Saxena’s stellar success with previousnewsletters serves as his springboard for this exclusiveinvestment publication, which started its portfolio on July 1,1996. While NASDAQ composite gainedonly 9% from July to December, the model portfolio published inthe weekly Hot Stocks Digest returned a sizzling 57.45%. Thistremendous performance has far outdistanced all other advisorypublications, mutual funds and professional money-managers. Inspite of the recent poor performance by small-cap stocks, Saxenahas amassed a fantastic 57% return for his understandably loyalfollowers. Dear FellowInvestor, If you think a 20% annual return onyour money is good, here’s how to set your sights on 40% ormore. This is yourpersonal invitation to join aselect group of investors who will double or triple their moneyin the next 2 years. My name is Jay Saxena and I make money formy readers. The model portfolio I feature in my weeklyHot Stocks Digest brought my readers a 57.45% gainin last six months of 1996. And right now, conditions are rightto achieve even greater gains in 1997. For a few minutes lets forget aboutthe Fed, the Dow and the so called experts you see on TV everyday. Instead, lets talk about how you can make hugereturns in the stock market by following my proven Alpha(a )-RSM stock selection system. When you look back in a few months,sitting on profits exceeding your wildest imagination,you’ll be amazed at your tremendous success. Even as mostinvestors are sitting on the sidelines waiting for the nextcrash, here’s your golden opportunity to join a select fewwho are able to soar to new heights of investment successregardless of prevailing market conditions. Think it can’t be done intoday’s market? Well let me tell you. Not only can it bedone, but it is being done by me and readers of my Hot Stocks Digest. My weekly service is specially designed fora few seasoned investors, like yourself, who want average annualreturns in excess of 40%with little effort and minimum hassle. The Hot Stocks Digest model portfolio was started on July 1, 1996. Since then it has generated a 57.45% gain for our readers. During the same time, the Nasdaq was up only 8.98%. It has outperformed the Nasdaq index by over 48 percentage points. Talk about blistering performance! With a proven, high-octane stockselection system, the Hot Stocks Digest couldn’t be any easier to follow. Youmay be one of those few investors who understands that explosivereturns in growth stocks are only made by those who are decisiveand swift. But, to be both decisive and swift requires a lot oftime and a tremendous amount of research. Hot Stocks Digest contains a weekly rankingand model portfolio of the most timely stocks in themarketplace today. It is easy to understand and easy to accessusing the internet or you can get it via fax or e-mail. My Alpha(a )-RSM System incorporates the C-A-N-S-L-I-Mapproach developed by William O’Neil. It is designed toferret out those stocks that have a high alpha as well as highrelative strength & momentum. Alpha is that measure of the returnthat is not explained by the general market. For example, if theS&P500 has an average monthly return of 1.5% and a stock hasan average monthly return of 8.5%, then the stock has an alpha of7%. This 7% is the excess return that the stock generates overthe general market. Once we have selected our list of400+ high alpha stocks, we run them through ourproprietary mathematical models that rank them based on theirrelative strength and momentum. We want to buy only those highalpha stocks that also have high relative strength and are goingup at the present time. We have no interest in stocks that aregoing sideways, or worse, are going down. The "200 Most Attractive Hot Stocks" are then presented in each issue of the HotStocks Digest. Their symbol, Friday’sclosing price, percent change over the past 21 & 50 days and21-day & 50-day moving average values are also shown. You can use this list of the 200 mostattractive hot stocks to pick and choose and build your ownpersonal portfolio. One strategy is to buy stocksthat appear close to the top of that list. Hold a stock as longas it in the list of 200. When a stock drops out of the list,sell it and then buy again from the top of the list. This is just one way of using thelist. You may prefer to use it differently and tailor it to suityour personal taste. Another way to use the list is to buy anystock that makes it to the top 25. To make room in yourportfolio, you may have to sell some stocks. We recommend yousell the lowest ranked stocks and buy the top ranked ones. Thisway you will be rotating out of weaker stocks into stronger ones. Or you may decide to mechanicallyfollow the modelportfolio presented in eachweekly issue of the Hot Stocks Digest. This requires no furtheranalysis or judgment on your part. As a new subscriber you havetwo options when you start building your portfolio. Theaggressive option is to go ahead and buy all stocks in the modelportfolio. This way you'll be fully invested instantly. Even though some of these stocks maybe up 100-200%, it doesn't mean that they cannot go up another100% or more from present levels. The conservative option is tobuy only a few top-ranked stocks each week and leave the rest ofyour portfolio in cash. This way, it'll take you a few weeks tobecome fully invested. You'll receive the HotStocks Digest every Sunday via fax or e-mail. When you start trading using ourrecommendations, you'll discover the Hot Stocks Digestgives you greater control over your profits And triple-digit gains are NOT rare!Time and time again, I've selected stocks that have realizedover-100% gains in just a few short months. With a portfolio ofhand-selected stocks, the Hot Stocks Digest has already far outdistanced the NASDAQ withstock selections such as: Amerco (AMOO) 23.42% Centennial Tech. - (CTN) 219.12% Chips & Technologies (CHPS) 23.68% Cymer Inc. (CYMI) 27.46% Eagle Hardware & Garden (EAGL) 65.03% Encad Inc. (ENCD) 44.80% Fairfield Communities (FFD) 30.11% Herbalife Intl - (HERB) 26.32% Inacom Inc.

H. of Bethesda, Maryland You don't have to be a mathematicalgenius to see the enormous advantage in growth stocks. That's whyI am so excited. For the next several years, these explosive investments will post the biggest gains! Butagain, you have to know which ones to buy. Not every growth stock is going to dowell. In fact, most of them aren't worth your trouble. I can'tstress this point too much. To achieve both high gains andsafety, you must invest only in the highest-quality small-capgrowth stocks. The problem is, you can't get timelyand reliable information on quality small-cap growth stocks. Andyet, without such information, you will not know which growthstocks to buy, nor when to sell them for the highest profit. You need the Hot StocksDigest... J If you want to turn your investment capital into a substantial fortune over the next decade... J If you want to be able to afford the kind of spacious home your family would love... the vacation home that would give you all so much pleasure... J If you want to know you can afford to let your children attend any college they want... J If you want the financial security to retire in a comfortable lifestyle, with the freedom to travel and enjoy the finer things... J If you want to put fun into your investing and see results, then you owe it to yourself to get the Hot Stocks Digest and start making it all happen! If you are like most successfulindividuals, you either spend most of your time heavily involvedin your work or enjoying the lifestyle you’ve created foryourself through years of accomplishments. Perhaps, at this point in your life,you do not have the time, the knowledge or the inclination tokeep up with a market that demands more and more attention. Youare the reason I created Hot Stocks Digest. Average annual returns exceeding 40%do not come easily. In fact, the time required for an individualto stay on top of the general market, alone, would be more thanwhat most individuals could manage. So, imagine trying to keep upwith 14,000 individual stocks. Now, you can have at your fingertips,the most spectacular stocks the market has to offer. Theseexciting growth stocks post the greatest gains you’ve everseen. And, to top it off, you won’t have to wait years tosee the rewards. Nor will you have to spend thousands of hoursdoing the research yourself. Like you, I have spent tens ofthousands of dollars to find the perfect investment disciplinethat would outperform all others. As I engrossed myself intheories and practices, I became more intent on finding a dynamicand effective approach to stock selection. Being an engineer by trade (I have aMasters Degree in Computer Science), I spent years analyzing andevaluating many methodologies. Utilizing the most effective aspectsof the systems I researched, such as William O’Neal’s C-A-N-S-L-I-M approach, I formulated and tested a highlysophisticated computerized screening system which I now call my Alpha(a)-RSM System. I must commend you on your stock selection process. — Dr. S.A. of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan The truth of the matter is, thissystem surpassed even my wildest imagination. Suddenly, Idiscovered small-cap growth stocks that literally doubled andtripled within a few months. Never had I seen money made soquickly. That’s when I decided to devote all of my time andeffort to building wealth through investments. Gains Generated By The Alpha(a )-RSM System 1993 59.03% 1994 109.38% 1995 143.73% In 1993, I started publishing stock model portfolios using this proprietary system, generating remarkable results. My model portfolios yielded 59% in 1993, 109% in 1994, and 143% in 1995. Consistently, my system has found companies which were just beginning to enter periods of explosive growth. But can you imagine trying to screenthrough 14,000 stocks to find the few that will yield thegreatest results? You would probably feel like many of the goldprospectors at the turn of the century who worked long and hardto no avail. Frustration and confusion onlypromote inaction. However, by simplifying your approach toinvesting, you’ll become proactive in claiming your deservedwealth. That is where the Hot Stocks Digest comes in… In July 1996, I started this newservice for the more experienced investor, such as yourself, sothat you, too, could benefit from the huge gains small-cap growthstocks have to offer. This new service delivers, aspromised, unparalleled profit potential with its timelyinformation delivered directly to your fax machine ore-mailbox every Sunday. Hot Stocks Digest is designedto be your vehicle to enormous wealth. With this easy to understand weeklynewsletter, you will be able to effectively manage your portfolioin as little as 10 minutes each week. There is no hype to readthrough, nor reams of useless information. Because this discipline isquantitative and mathematically based, you will no longer beconfused by worthless or inaccurate opinions or perceptions thatare difficult to interpret. To make this an evengreater value for you, we have limited the number of people whocan subscribe to only 2000.That’s not a marketing ploy or meaningless hype. With thisnewsletter, you can act upon advice without competing with tensof thousands of people. Unlike some of our competitors whowill take 30,000 or more subscribers at the drop of a hat, wefeel it is important to have some exclusivity to the availabilityof our information. We emphasize the quality of our serviceover the quantity of our subscribers in order to maintain anuntarnished reputation for excellent performance. Because the prices of small-capgrowth stocks can be adversely affected by several thousandsubscribers placing buy/sell orders at the same time, we mustplace strict limits on how many people we accept. You’veprobably experienced situations where a recommendation was madeand you could not execute your order at a fair price. My newsletter keeps the interests ofthe subscriber first. You must be able to make money with ouradvice or else you will not renew your subscription. If YOUdon’t make money, we don’t make money. So what exactly do you getwhen you get the exclusive membership to the Hot Stocks Club? Hot Stocks Digest brings to you, on a weekly basis, stocks thathave undergone a scrutinizing examination by our proprietary Alpha(a)-RSM System, filtering over 14,000 stocks and rankingthe top 200 in order of attractiveness based upon relativestrength. My Alpha(a )-RSM System is truly phenomenal. It values performanceover prognostication, so that you can base your investmentdecisions on solid information, not wild predictions. By now, youmust have already realized that the Hot Stocks Digest canbe the most effective weapon in your investment arsenal. When you start trading using ourrecommendations, you'll discover the Hot Stocks Digestgives you greater control over your profits. And triple-digitgains are NOT rare! Time and time again, I've selected stocksthat have realized over 100% gains in just a few short months. I have subscribed to a good number of financialnewsletters. I currently subscribe to several which I considertop notch and you are included in this group. I wish you well andtrust that you will continue your success. — D.L.D. of MountDora, Florida By joining today, you would not onlysave an incredible 50% off the regular cost, you wouldguarantee yourself a position among an exclusive group of 2000select investors who may participate. Hot Stocks Digest delivers unparalleled performance.It stands head and shoulders above any other investmentpublication. How many newsletter solicitations do you receive inthe mail each week? Too many would be my guess. And too many ofthem fail to deliver performance. That's where we are different.Perhaps it is because we have a time-tested discipline which wefollow without question. The ability to make clear concisedecisions to buy and sell is what separates persuasive rhetoricfrom proven performance. Many newsletters do not even tell youwhen to sell. We do! When your money is on the line, there is noreason to let your ego get in the way. If we pick a stock thatstarts heading south, we do not hold on to it hoping it will comeback. We sell it and move on in search ofthe next winner. The Revolutionary Alpha(a ) - RSM Stock Selection System I mentioned earlier that my methoduses a proprietary system I've developed for identifyinghigh-potential small-cap growth stocks that will yield explosivegains in a short time. Let me tell you more about this... Every week, my staff and I screenthousands of them, looking for the handful that have thepotential for spectacular stock price increases. I want to investonly in the top 1% of all growth stocks. To me, the other 99% aresimply not acceptable. I know from experience that only the top1% will beat the market by 100% or more. That’s where I wantto put my money, and I imagine you’d want to do the same. What are welooking for? Emergingcompanies poised for enormous growth. Or established ones thatare about to make major advances. We want companies whoseproducts are in such demand that they can't make them fastenough. Ones with entrepreneurial leadership that is takingadvantage of technological breakthroughs to create new,super-fast growing businesses. And we want to find them before they're discovered by the financial media andhordes of investors so we can buy them ahead of the pack and takefull advantage of the run-up in their stock prices. Please accept my compliments for your wonderful andpractical approach to stock selection. — P.E. of New York,NY I employ a combination of fundamentaland technical investment approaches and have a rigid riskmanagement system to keep my reward to risk ratio high. I determine my purchase candidates based on fundamental analysis and time my purchases using technical analysis, recommending the most promising small-cap growth stocks that show strong technical patterns and evidence of accumulation. Some of the fundamental and technicalcharacteristics I look for are accelerating earnings, positiveearnings surprises, accelerating revenues, high relativestrength, high relative industry strength, a low PE relative tothe projected earnings growth rate, innovative products in amarket that is rapidly expanding, rising order backlogs, andexpanding profit margins. I sell when a stock breaks downtechnically or violates my screening rules. Part of this stock selection processuses the C-A-N-S-L-I-M methodology developed by William O'Neil,which has proven highly successful. We set very strictrisk/reward guidelines and whittle the possibilities down to ahandful of companies with superior balance sheets and liquidity,and little or no debt. Then we take this short list andsubject it to a rigorous proprietary system based on cutting-edgecomputerized technical analysis. This incorporates both fundamental andtechnical factors like : � Valuation Indicators -- P/E Ratio, Relative P/E Ratio, Projected P/E Ratio, Price/Book Value Ratio, Price/Cash Flow Ratio, Price/Capital Spending Ratio, Price/Sales Ratio � Earnings Indicators -- Earnings Per Share, Earnings Growth Rate, Projected Earnings, Earnings Velocity, EPS Increase, EPS Consistency, Return on Assets, Return on Equity � Debt Risk Indicators -- Current Ratio, Debt/Equity Ratio, Interest Coverage, Debt Service/EPS � Balance Sheet Indicators -- Book Value Growth Rate, Capital Spending Growth Rate, Cash/Price Ratio, Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Turnover � Volume Indicators -- Volume/Share, 30-Day Average Volume, Vol/30-Day Average Volume Ratio, 5-Day/30-Day Average Volume Ratio, Short Interest � Performance Indicators -- Relative Strength, Price Growth Rates, Least Squares Deviation, EPS Rank, Price Rank, Group Rank, Accumulation Distribution � Background Indicators -- Number and Percentage of Institutional Holdings, Number of Outstanding Shares, Market Capitalization, Insider Trading and Exercise of Options � Technical Indicators -- Moving Averages, MACD, Momentum, Stochastics, Wilder's RSI, Daily Range, High/Low, Beta, Volatility, McClellan Oscillator and many more � Forecasting Indicators -- Next 5 Weeks, Next 4 Months, Next 1 Year and Next 3 Year % Probability of Increase and % Gain I realize that's a staggering numberof factors to take into account. It's only possible because ofthe advanced computer-based analysis systems I've developed. The bottom line is that the Alpha(a )-RSM System works. Itworks like crazy!

Although the Nasdaqcomposite has also gained substantially, most of this return hascome from large companies like Microsoft and Intel. So far in 1996, the smaller stock orientedRussell 2000 index has grown only 11.77%. The stocks recommendedin this newsletter closely resemble those in the Russell 2000.Since July 1, 1996, the Russell 2000 has grown only by 1.84%. But aren’tsmall stocks supposed to outperform their larger brethren? Over thelong-term the answer is an emphatic YES! In the shorter termhowever, markets are sometimes dominated by perceptions orchanges in investor sentiment. The word on the Street is that institutionalmoney managers have been bombarded with new cash flowing intomutual funds and they remain cautious as the bull marketcontinues. Looking for somewhere to put the new funds, they havesought shelter in the safer blue-chips. The subsequent increasein demand for these stocks has driven the large-caps higher andleft the small-caps behind. Despite their recent lackluster performance,the longer-term performance of small-cap is far superior to the large-caps.As things stand today, the small-cap stocks are now betterrelative values. The cyclical extremes of Wall Street sometimesdefy rationality, but over a period of time these disparitiesnormally fall back in line. Sooner or later, the correlation ofreturns between small-caps and large-caps will return to reasonable levels. For those investors who have the patience andthe stomach to weather the short-term volatile fluctuations of thissector, small-cap growth stocks continue to offer an opportunityto achieve superior long-term returns.

Safety gives you peace of mind, enablesyou to sleep at night, lets you enjoy investing, while you watchyour money grow and compound into the fortune you desire. But most importantly, simplicity and safetycombine to provide a high degree of comfort. Comfort is the mostimportant ingredient of any investment plan, because with yourserious money at stake, you won't tolerate anything difficult,risky, stressful, or discomforting! On the other hand, if you have a simple plan,and a safe plan, and you feel comfortable using it, then you'llstick with it over the long-term.

But only if you buy andif you sell at the right time. This is where we come in ... the Mutual Fund Bulletin specializes in stock market timing! We tell you what,as well as when, to buy and sell. Studies have shown that for a typical stock orequity fund, 60% of the price movement can be directly attributedto the movement of the overall market. Therefore, it is extremelyimportant to stay on the right side of the overall market trend. Itis important to know the current phase of the market, and when itis ready to change direction.

You are the best.Keep up the great work. – A. Murray Even though the market moves sideways at times,this motion is always temporary. Most of the time, the market isin the process of going up, or it is in the process of goingdown. The Mutual Fund Bulletin's plan follows the trend of the market,capturing the biggest part of any uptrend, and dodging thebiggest part of any downtrend. When we dodge the downtrends, we dodge bear markets. Any downtrend has the potential to turn into a seriousbear market. The reason we make more money than buy-and-holdinvestors is because we don't have to make up for bear marketlosses when the market starts advancing again. If you are a buy-and-hold investor, you'llcapture the advances but you won't necessarily profit from them,since you'll be making up for your bear market losses. Forexample, buy-and-hold investors who captured 1991's big advance merelymade up losses from 1990's big decline. Even more chilling, consider the bear market of1973-74. If you had invested $10,000 in a stock index fund onJanuary 2, 1973, your investment would have shrunk to $5,180 overthe next 21 months -- a 48.20% decline. After this loss, youwould have had to hold your investment more than seven and a halfyears just to make up your losses and break-even with yourinitial $10,000 investment. The important thing to understand is thatmarket advances are for getting your money to grow, not for makingup past losses. The key isknowing the trend of the market, so thatyou can dodge the bear markets and capture the advances thatfollow them. The Mutual Fund Bulletin will clearly showyou whether the intermediate-term trend of the market is up ordown and whether you should be long or in cash. If you had followed this system from 7/1/63 to10/31/96, a mutual fund that closely tracks the NASDAQ index, you wouldhave made a 25.14%annualized return. This performancebeats all others and has outperformed the popular buy-and-holdapproach to stock fund investing. One question we are often asked is, "How did your market timing modeldo during the crash of 1987?". You'dnotice that BITS not only side-stepped the crash of 1987, butalso the mini crash of 1989 and the market decline of 1990. Thenit signaled the powerful upmove of 1991. Consider the performance of BITS in recentyears. On 10/07/92, BITS identified a strong market uptrend andwe switched from the safety of money-market funds into stockfunds. While thousands of investors sat waiting on the sidelinesuntil the market climbed higher, we got into the market quickly andsaw our funds steadily generate profits. In contrast, manyinvestors were still entering the already overvalued market aslate as February 1994. Before the market corrected sharply in March 1994, our systemidentified a new downtrend and we switched back to the safety ofmoney market funds. In December 1994, many investors were too jitteryto invest in the stocks market, fearing another down move. However, BITS gave us a buy signal on December27, 1994 and we got invested in stock funds. Guess what? While ourportfolios are up over 40% in 1995, the other investors missedanother big advance. Buy-and-hold investors, of course, aremaking up for their 1994 losses. We, on the other hand, made 67.56% for our readers in 1995-96. The reason our system works better thanbuy-and-hold (and pray!) is that it mechanically identifies the trends.As a result, you know when to be in the market and when to beout. No other piece of information is more important. Our research shows that investing in equitiesduring market uptrends, then switching to money funds duringmarket downtrends, could safely produce 20-25% annualizedcompounded growth. Today we can say that anyone committing to ourplan for two years or more dramatically reduces stock market risk. Bear markets are inevitable, like death andtaxes. Sooner or later a major one will strike, cutting the portfoliovalues of buy-and-hold investors into half. But, by using the signals from BITS, youwill be able to get out in time - for maximumprofits! That's because BITSpresages all new bull and bear markets, allowing you to get intothe market at major bottoms, and exit the market right at the top beforethe downturn starts. And you never have to worry about surpriseshifts in the market robbing you of your profits, because BITS is specificallydesigned to give you a wide margin of advance notice whenever the marketis ready to turn. How SuccessfulHas It Been? Judge For Yourself... Historical BITS Data ANALYSIS SUMMARY Start Date: 07/01/63 Start OTC Value: 33.63 End Date: 10/31/96 End OTC Value: 1221.51 OTC Gain: +3532.20% Annualized OTC Gain +11.50% BITS Gain: +163830% Annualized BITS Gain: +25.14% Total Trades: 52 % Winning Trades: 80% Largest Gain: +94.1% Largest Gain: +94.1% Following the above signals and investing in amutual fund that closely tracks the NASDAQ index (for example the RydexOTC Fund) would have turneda one-time investment of $1000 into $1,639,304. The same $1000 invested using a buy & hold approachwould have yielded $36,322. Past performance, of course,is no guarantee of future results. The period 1963 to 1988 shows hypothetical resultsfrom computer backtesting of our market timing models. The timingsystem has been in real-time use since November 1988. BITS was developed in late 1988 and was testedon historical data from 1963 to 1988. The Nasdaq and theS&P500 index were used to generate the buy/sell signals andcompute the returns. Since 1989, BITS has been in use real-time andit has proven itself in both backtesting and actual trading. Onaverage it signals a trade every 7 months. The accuracy rating is80%, with every 4 out of 5 winning trades. The compoundedannualized return is 25.14% per year. There are a number of reasons why we areusing the Rydex family of funds for trading BITS signals. Rydex Nova is an S&P500 index fund with a beta of 1.5. Thismeans when BITS is correct in its long signal, you make 50% morethan the S&P500 index itself. Rydex OTC is the only indexfund that tracks the Nasdaq index. The combination of Rydex Novaand OTC when BITS is long, lets us participate in both the largeand the small-cap stocks. Rydex is only family that offers a fundthat is short the S&P500. This makes Rydex Ursaa rather unique fund. It goes up when the S&P500 goes downand vice-versa. This means when BITS is correct in its cash/shortsignal you make money as the S&P500 goes down. THE AMAZINGPOWER OF COMPOUNDING Long-term compounding is your single mostpowerful wealth building tool, and its free. But to make it work,you've got to keep your money growing. That's why it is soimportant to get out of the market during the downtrends. Over time, compounding converts smallamounts of money into enormous sums. For instance, if you invested$4,000 a year (the amount you and your spouse could put into twoIRAs) in an investment earning 20%, in ten years your money wouldgrow to $128,601. After 20 years, your investment would be worth$900,102. And get ready, because in 25 years, you'd have a whopping $2,269,509! With long-term compounding, you don't have todo anything fancy. You don't have to take unnecessary risks. The wholeidea is not to interfere with compounding. Just make steady gainsand let compounding work its magic! However, compounding takes time, and if youdon't have a simple and safe plan, you won't feel comfortableinvesting your serious money over the long term. What's more, ifyour plan does not put you safely on the sidelines during bear markets,you'll lose money and ruin the good work compounding has startedfor you. Let me now tell you how our investment planworks. Once you see how simple it is -- how it keeps your money growing-- you'll understand why Mutual Fund Bulletin subscribers areable to commit their money and stick with it over the long term. HERE'S HOWOUR INVESTMENT PLAN WORKS The BITS market timing system was created outof hard facts. It is a scientific system that has proven itsvalidity after decades of testing and investing. It does onething and one thing only, and it does this one thing very well: it identifies markettrends. The system has just two trading rules: one forbuying and one for selling. There are no gray areas. We use acomplex mathematical formula. We apply our formula to the majormarket averages and other stock market statistics like new highsand new lows. This reveals the trend of the market. An uptrend isa buy signal, and a downtrend is a sell signal. That's all thereis to it. We use mutual funds as our investment vehicles.I am sure I don't have to explain the merits of mutual funds.Today, nearly everybody knows that mutual funds are superior inevery way: management, performance, safety, costs, and tradingconvenience. We profit from the uptrends byinvesting in growth funds, but during the downtrends we protectour profits by switching to money market funds. As soon as the downtrend is over, and a new uptrend begins,we switch back to growth funds. Our trading is easily handledover the phone with just a few calls per year. Once you start reading the Mutual FundBulletin, you'll always know the trend of the market, and what actionto take for both profit and safety. Since 1963, our market timingsystem (BITS) has identified every major trend in the market. Duringthis time, we moved in and out of the market on average every 7months. We never labored over a buy decision. We neverlabored over a sell decision. We never lost any sleep. We always knewwhat to do. Deciding when to buy and sell is the most agonizingpart of investing. It can be emotionally wrenching. But our investment plan completelyeliminates emotional decision-making. It mechanically providesbuy and sell signals, and that makes it near fool-proof. I have never seen a simpler, safer, or morecomfortable way to keep your money growing and compounding. And once you see how easy it is to makemoney this way (by following the trends), you will no longer carewhy the market goes up or down. The marketalways goes up or down, and its a good thing it does, becausethat's how we keep making money. Time and again we hear from subscribers whoseonly regret is that they did not find us sooner. Newcomers, ofcourse, are always skeptical. The plan does seem too good to betrue. But as you can see from the trades on page 7-9, the planworks. In fact it works like crazy. Plain andsimple. No wonder it has an average yearly return of almost 25% overthe last 33 years. Now you know how our simple investment planworks. And, I think you can see how it can work for you. All youneed are 10 minutes a month and a desire to simplify and enrichyour life. HOW TO FOLLOWOUR INVESTMENT PLAN? As I said earlier, with our investment plan,you'll learn a new method of investing, an investment lifestyleyou'll be able to use to build all the wealth you want. And yet,it's so simple to use, it won't interfere with your family orwork. It takes just 10 minutes amonth to use this system. You'll invest inequity funds when the stock market shows an uptrend. And you willstay invested only as long as the uptrend continues. When theuptrend is broken and turns down, you'll call your mutual fundcompany and switch to the safety of their money market fund We will tell you which mutualfunds to use. You can choose betweentoday's best mutual funds and take advantage of the profits thatthe stock market offers. If you prefer, you can make your own mutualfund selections and use our market timing system (BITS) solely toidentify market trends (buy and sell signals). The informationyou need is in our monthly newsletter and on our 24-hour Telephone Hotline.It's as simple as that. Do you get the picture? This is a plan you can actually follow. One you'll feelcomfortable using everyday, for the rest of your life. Noguesswork. No emotional decision-making. No complex, time-consumingstrategies. No sales commissions. No conflicting reports in thefinancial press to fret and worry over. Just a comfortable planfor building wealth and increasing your spendable income! CLEAR CUT BUYAND SELL SIGNALS We monitor over 300 mutual funds, all withswitching privileges, which lets us move from the profitable equityfunds to the safety of money-market funds with one phone call. Wealways list the top performing funds along with their 1 month, 3month, 6 month and 12 month returns. But even more important than knowing whichfunds to use, you'll knowwhen to buy and when to sell. That way you canprofit from the uptrends and you can save your profits from thedowntrends, including bear markets. We screen hundreds of no and low load mutualfunds using our unique scoring system to zero in on the best ofthe best. Not only do we analyze their past performance, but alsoevaluate the likelihood of superior future performance by weighingall available fundamental and technical information. The top performing funds in any given periodalways outperform the market averages. Even when the market as a whole isgoing down, some funds make huge gains. But fund leadership isconstantly changing. You have to know which funds to get into,and when to get out. The Mutual Fund Bulletin gives you thisinformation in clear and specific terms. The bottom line is that you'll always know where to invest yourmoney because you'll always know whichmutual funds are on top. Many surveys tell you which mutual funddid best last year. What you need to know is which funds will do bestin the future — and this is what the Mutual Fund Bulletinwill do for you. The Mutual Fund Bulletin takes the suddenvolatility out of investing. It means you don't have to constantlywatch and worry about timing your investments. Successful fund investing means sticking withthe winners only when the trend is upwards; not buying andholding (and praying!). The drawback of a "buy & hold"approach is that in down markets your fund may lose as much as 50%of its value. At that point it would have to gain at least 100%just to break even. And that might take a long, long time. Onething is quite clear : you'll make more money by side-stepping market corrections. We rely on a rational, disciplined approach.When the market begins to advance, our indicators generate a buysignal, prompting a move into stock funds. They also flag thedownturns and generate a sell signal, so we're safely in money marketfunds. Steady, consistentgrowth is the hallmark of our safe and methodical approach. We are systematic about following trends thatpay off with significant gains in the long run. There's no guesswork.We don't try to predict the next move in the market at random.Instead we focus on detecting trends and reacting appropriately.The system of switching between top-ranked stock funds and moneymarket funds provides the flexibility needed to respond tochanging market conditions.

MAGNIFICENT MARKET TIMING Market timing has been the one, forever, secretof investment success. In all markets. In all times. All investmentshave their cycles, periods when prices rise and periods when theyfall. The idea is to buy before pricesrise and to sell before prices fall. Opportunities abound. But only if you buy andif you sell at the right time. This is where we come in ... the HotFunds Analystspecializes in stock market timing! Wetell you what, as well as when, to buy and sell. Studies have shown that for a typical stock orequity fund, 60% of the price movement can be directly attributedto the movement of the overall market. Therefore, it is extremelyimportant to stay on the right side of the overall market trend. Itis important to know the current phase of the market, and when itis ready to change direction. Vital Information's Best Intermediate-Term TimingSystem (BITS) provides a disciplined, objective andscientific approach to timing the market, freeof bias and emotion. It uses an arsenal of the finest stockmarket indicators available, organized into a complex set ofrules, to automatically signal stock market tops and bottoms. BITS is based on a mathematical model thatautomatically locates situations that have historically predictedstock market moves resulting in excellent buying and sellingopportunities. It has an excellent trackrecord of accurately signaling market turns.We never predict. Instead we follow the trend of the market. Weprefer to be prepared, so that when a market comes along, we cansimply sidestep it. Frequently, you read in the financial press theopinion that timing doesn't work. This myth is perpetuated bythose who have failed to develop a sound timing system. If youwere to study the long-term charts of stock market prices, you woulddiscover that the market moves up and down in trends, over aperiod of months, or even years. You are the best. I am a new subscriber andI’m excited. The calls you’ve made this year are nextto being clairvoyant. The market is down today, big time, andI’m not just out but in Ursa. What a thrill. You are the best.Keep up the great work. – A. Murray Even though the market moves sideways at times,this motion is always temporary. Most of the time, the market isin the process of going up, or it is in the process of goingdown. The Hot Funds Analyst's plan follows the trend of the market,capturing the biggest part of any uptrend, and dodging thebiggest part of any downtrend. When we dodge the downtrends, we dodge bear markets. Any downtrend has the potential to turn into a seriousbear market. The reason we make more money than buy-and-holdinvestors is because we don't have to make up for bear marketlosses when the market starts advancing again. If you are a buy-and-hold investor, you'llcapture the advances but you won't necessarily profit from them,since you'll be making up for your bear market losses. Forexample, buy-and-hold investors who captured 1991's big advance merelymade up losses from 1990's big decline. Even more chilling, consider the bear market of1973-74. If you had invested $10,000 in a stock index fund onJanuary 2, 1973, your investment would have shrunk to $5,180 overthe next 21 months -- a 48.20% decline. After this loss, youwould have had to hold your investment more than seven and a halfyears just to make up your losses and break-even with yourinitial $10,000 investment. The important thing to understand is thatmarket advances are for getting your money to grow, not for makingup past losses. The key isknowing the trend of the market, so thatyou can dodge the bear markets and capture the advances thatfollow them. The Hot Funds Analystwill clearly show you whether the intermediate-term trend of themarket is up or down and whether you should be long or in cash. If you had followed this system from 7/1/63 to10/31/96, a mutual fund that closely tracks the NASDAQ index, you wouldhave made a 25.14%annualized return. This performancebeats all others and has outperformed the popular buy-and-holdapproach to stock fund investing. One question we are often asked is, "How did your market timing modeldo during the crash of 1987?". You'dnotice that BITS not only side-stepped the crash of 1987, butalso the mini crash of 1989 and the market decline of 1990. Thenit signaled the powerful upmove of 1991. Consider the performance of BITS in recentyears. On 10/07/92, BITS identified a strong market uptrend andwe switched from the safety of money-market funds into stockfunds. While thousands of investors sat waiting on the sidelinesuntil the market climbed higher, we got into the market quickly andsaw our funds steadily generate profits. In contrast, manyinvestors were still entering the already overvalued market aslate as February 1994. Before the market corrected sharply in March 1994, our systemidentified a new downtrend and we switched back to the safety ofmoney market funds. In December 1994, many investors were too jitteryto invest in the stocks market, fearing another down move. However, BITS gave us a buy signal on December27, 1994 and we got invested in stock funds. Guess what? While ourportfolios are up over 40% in 1995, the other investors missedanother big advance. Buy-and-hold investors, of course, aremaking up for their 1994 losses. We, on the other hand, made 67.56% for our readers in 1995-96. The reason our system works better thanbuy-and-hold (and pray!) is that it mechanically identifies the trends.As a result, you know when to be in the market and when to beout. No other piece of information is more important. Our research shows that investing in equitiesduring market uptrends, then switching to money funds duringmarket downtrends, could safely produce 20-25% annualizedcompounded growth. Today we can say that anyone committing to ourplan for two years or more dramatically reduces stock market risk. Bear markets are inevitable, like death andtaxes. Sooner or later a major one will strike, cutting the portfoliovalues of buy-and-hold investors into half. But, by using the signals from BITS, youwill be able to get out in time - for maximumprofits! That's because BITSpresages all new bull and bear markets, allowing you to get intothe market at major bottoms, and exit the market right at the top beforethe downturn starts. And you never have to worry about surpriseshifts in the market robbing you of your profits, because BITS is specificallydesigned to give you a wide margin of advance notice whenever the marketis ready to turn. How SuccessfulHas It Been? Judge For Yourself... Historical BITS Data ANALYSIS SUMMARY Start Date: 07/01/63 Start OTC Value: 33.63 End Date: 10/31/96 End OTC Value: 1221.51 OTC Gain: +3532.20% Annualized OTC Gain +11.50% BITS Gain: +163830% Annualized BITS Gain: +25.14% Total Trades: 52 % Winning Trades: 80% Largest Gain: +94.1% Largest Gain: +94.1% Following the above signals and investing in amutual fund that closely tracks the NASDAQ index (for example the RydexOTC Fund) would have turneda one-time investment of $1000 into $1,639,304. The same $1000 invested using a buy & hold approachwould have yielded $36,322. Past performance, of course,is no guarantee of future results. The period 1963 to 1988 shows hypothetical resultsfrom computer backtesting of our market timing models. The timingsystem has been in real-time use since November 1988. BITS was developed in late 1988 and was testedon historical data from 1963 to 1988. The Nasdaq and theS&P500 index were used to generate the buy/sell signals andcompute the returns. Since 1989, BITS has been in use real-time andit has proven itself in both backtesting and actual trading. Onaverage it signals a trade every 7 months. The accuracy rating is80%, with every 4 out of 5 winning trades. The compoundedannualized return is 25.14% per year. There are a number of reasons why we areusing the Rydex family of funds for trading BITS signals. Rydex Nova is an S&P500 index fund with a beta of 1.5. Thismeans when BITS is correct in its long signal, you make 50% morethan the S&P500 index itself. Rydex OTC is the only indexfund that tracks the Nasdaq index. The combination of Rydex Novaand OTC when BITS is long, lets us participate in both the largeand the small-cap stocks. Rydex is only family that offers a fundthat is short the S&P500. This makes Rydex Ursaa rather unique fund. It goes up when the S&P500 goes downand vice-versa. This means when BITS is correct in its cash/shortsignal you make money as the S&P500 goes down. THE AMAZINGPOWER OF COMPOUNDING Long-term compounding is your single mostpowerful wealth building tool, and its free. But to make it work,you've got to keep your money growing. That's why it is soimportant to get out of the market during the downtrends. Over time, compounding converts smallamounts of money into enormous sums. For instance, if you invested$4,000 a year (the amount you and your spouse could put into twoIRAs) in an investment earning 20%, in ten years your money wouldgrow to $128,601. After 20 years, your investment would be worth$900,102. And get ready, because in 25 years, you'd have a whopping $2,269,509! With long-term compounding, you don't have todo anything fancy. You don't have to take unnecessary risks. The wholeidea is not to interfere with compounding. Just make steady gainsand let compounding work its magic! However, compounding takes time, and if youdon't have a simple and safe plan, you won't feel comfortableinvesting your serious money over the long term. What's more, ifyour plan does not put you safely on the sidelines during bear markets,you'll lose money and ruin the good work compounding has startedfor you. Let me now tell you how our investment planworks. Once you see how simple it is -- how it keeps your money growing-- you'll understand why Hot Funds Analystsubscribers are able to commit their money and stick with it over thelong term. HERE'S HOWOUR INVESTMENT PLAN WORKS The BITS market timing system was created outof hard facts. It is a scientific system that has proven itsvalidity after decades of testing and investing. It does onething and one thing only, and it does this one thing very well: it identifies markettrends. The system has just two trading rules: one forbuying and one for selling. There are no gray areas. We use acomplex mathematical formula. We apply our formula to the majormarket averages and other stock market statistics like new highsand new lows. This reveals the trend of the market. An uptrend isa buy signal, and a downtrend is a sell signal. That's all thereis to it. We use mutual funds as our investment vehicles.I am sure I don't have to explain the merits of mutual funds.Today, nearly everybody knows that mutual funds are superior inevery way: management, performance, safety, costs, and tradingconvenience. We profit from the uptrends byinvesting in growth funds, but during the downtrends we protectour profits by switching to money market funds. As soon as the downtrend is over, and a new uptrend begins,we switch back to growth funds. Our trading is easily handledover the phone with just a few calls per year. Once you start reading the HotFunds Analyst, you'll always know the trend of themarket, and what action to take for both profit and safety. Since1963, our market timing system (BITS) has identified every majortrend in the market. During this time, we moved in and out of themarket on average every 7 months. We never labored over a buy decision. We neverlabored over a sell decision. We never lost any sleep. We always knewwhat to do. Deciding when to buy and sell is the most agonizingpart of investing. It can be emotionally wrenching. But our investment plan completelyeliminates emotional decision-making. It mechanically providesbuy and sell signals, and that makes it near fool-proof. I have never seen a simpler, safer, or morecomfortable way to keep your money growing and compounding. And once you see how easy it is to makemoney this way (by following the trends), you will no longer carewhy the market goes up or down. The marketalways goes up or down, and its a good thing it does, becausethat's how we keep making money. Time and again we hear from subscribers whoseonly regret is that they did not find us sooner. Newcomers, ofcourse, are always skeptical. The plan does seem too good to betrue. But as you can see from the trades on page 7-9, the planworks. In fact it works like crazy. Plain andsimple. No wonder it has an average yearly return of almost 25% overthe last 33 years. Now you know how our simple investment planworks. And, I think you can see how it can work for you. All youneed are 10 minutes a month and a desire to simplify and enrichyour life. HOW TO FOLLOWOUR INVESTMENT PLAN? As I said earlier, with our investment plan,you'll learn a new method of investing, an investment lifestyleyou'll be able to use to build all the wealth you want. And yet,it's so simple to use, it won't interfere with your family orwork. It takes just 10 minutes amonth to use this system. You'll invest inequity funds when the stock market shows an uptrend. And you willstay invested only as long as the uptrend continues. When theuptrend is broken and turns down, you'll call your mutual fundcompany and switch to the safety of their money market fund We will tell you which mutualfunds to use. You can choose betweentoday's best mutual funds and take advantage of the profits thatthe stock market offers. If you prefer, you can make your own mutualfund selections and use our market timing system (BITS) solely toidentify market trends (buy and sell signals). The informationyou need is in our monthly newsletter and on our 24-hour Telephone Hotline.It's as simple as that. Do you get the picture? This is a plan you can actually follow. One you'll feelcomfortable using everyday, for the rest of your life. Noguesswork. No emotional decision-making. No complex, time-consumingstrategies. No sales commissions. No conflicting reports in thefinancial press to fret and worry over. Just a comfortable planfor building wealth and increasing your spendable income! CLEAR CUT BUYAND SELL SIGNALS We monitor over 300 mutual funds, all withswitching privileges, which lets us move from the profitable equityfunds to the safety of money-market funds with one phone call. Wealways list the top performing funds along with their 1 month, 3month, 6 month and 12 month returns. But even more important than knowing whichfunds to use, you'll knowwhen to buy and when to sell. That way you canprofit from the uptrends and you can save your profits from thedowntrends, including bear markets. We screen hundreds of no and low load mutualfunds using our unique scoring system to zero in on the best ofthe best. Not only do we analyze their past performance, but alsoevaluate the likelihood of superior future performance by weighingall available fundamental and technical information. The top performing funds in any given periodalways outperform the market averages. Even when the market as a whole isgoing down, some funds make huge gains. But fund leadership isconstantly changing. You have to know which funds to get into,and when to get out. The Hot Funds Analystgives you this information in clear and specific terms. The bottom line is that you'll always know where to invest yourmoney because you'll always know whichmutual funds are on top. Many surveys tell you which mutual funddid best last year. What you need to know is which funds will do bestin the future — and this is what the Hot FundsAnalyst will do for you. The Hot Funds Analysttakes the sudden volatility out of investing. It means you don'thave to constantly watch and worry about timing your investments. Successful fund investing means stickingwith the winners only when the trend is upwards; not buying andholding (and praying!). The drawback of a "buy & hold"approach is that in down markets your fund may lose as much as 50%of its value. At that point it would have to gain at least 100%just to break even. And that might take a long, long time. Onething is quite clear : you'll make more money by side-stepping market corrections. We rely on a rational, disciplined approach.When the market begins to advance, our indicators generate a buysignal, prompting a move into stock funds. They also flag thedownturns and generate a sell signal, so we're safely in money marketfunds. Steady, consistentgrowth is the hallmark of our safe and methodical approach. We are systematic about following trends thatpay off with significant gains in the long run. There's no guesswork.We don't try to predict the next move in the market at random.Instead we focus on detecting trends and reacting appropriately.The system of switching between top-ranked stock funds and moneymarket funds provides the flexibility needed to respond tochanging market conditions. The Hot Funds Analystwill enhance and safeguardyour portfolio with winning strategies and give you a low-risk, practicalplan for growing rich in premier mutual funds. By reading the Hot Funds Analyst,you'll dramatically boost your profits with an exclusive listingof the most highly prized mutual funds and invest with greaterconfidence & success. This kind of wealth building strategy can makeyou far more money than the average investor. And even a gooddeal more than the so called Wall Street "experts". Itis a mutual fund strategy that is designed to bring you truly tremendous profits,while uninformed investors meekly accept marginal returns or areeven losing money.

We aren't able to answer all of them because of the huge number we received, but we are able to post many of them here. Jack Nicklaus From Steve Hammer: I collect Ping and other putters. I would like to know what is your all time favorite putter? At this stage of my career, my favorite putter is the one that's working today. From Bob Lewis Why don't you play more often on the Senior Tour? The Senior Tour is terrific for most of the guys, but the courses are set up short in order to accomodate everyone. That, combined with soft greens, makes the courses play easy which I have never played well, because my strong suit was never my short game. My strengths have always been course management and the long game. Peter Jacobsen From Brad Niles: No question -- just wanted to wish you and the other members of the Ryder Cup team the best of luck. Bring it home! Thanks for the encouragement, Brad. I think we have a great team this year. From Sharon Moore Are there any plans to bring a PGA Tour event to Portland? The PGA offered us a tour event this year opposite the World Series of Golf, but we felt we just didn't have time to prepare properly. We would need two years to plan properly. It's something we continue to look at and evaluate, but we're having an awful lot of fun with The Challenge right now. Steve Elkington From: Michael Tollin: How do you hit a 7-iron 202 yards? Strong lofts, or are you really that strong? How far do pros hit an average 7-iron with off the shelf lofts? It depends on many factors, such as wind, slope, lie, elevation and probably most of all, adrenaline. All things being equal, most pros hit a 7-iron about 170-180. Ben Crenshaw From: Doug Johnson: What is the best way to practice at the range -- with one club per session, or with multiple clubs? I like to start with the short clubs and work my way through the bag to the driver. And then finish with a few more pitch shots. Fred Couples From: Jack and Mary Dare Tell us the truth, Freddie, how is your back? It feels good and isn't giving me any problems right now. My problem is that I'm a little rusty so I plan to play in 3 out of the next 4 tour events between now and the Ryder Cup. Ernie Els From: James Lowry Do you have a diagonal move forward initiating the down swing, or do you keep your spine centered and rotate your left hip around it? I don't use my legs quite as much as some of the players out here, and my forward move tends to be more of a turn than a slide. From: Will Przybylek How does it feel to be the best young player on the PGA Tour? I have faults in my swing like anyone else. I'm trying to get my game more under control. I feel like I'm maturing a little bit, and I've enjoyed being in contention the past few weeks. Phil Mickelson From: Bill Phillips Are you a natural lefty? Did anyone ever try to get you to play golf right-handed? Actually, I do everything right-handed. I started playing golf left-handed because I would watch my father practice in the back yard. I would stand facing him to get an image of his swing, and I would swing along with him. To do that, I was swinging left-janded. Payne Stewart From: Les Taylor What are the reasons that professional golfers can hit the ball consistently farther than I can? I hit the ball pretty well, but I can't get the distance I see the professionals hitting it. Is the balls you use, the clubs, or your swing? We all have access to the same equipment in terms of balls and clubs -- the main reason the players out here are so long is technique and timing. Distance comes from clubhead speed and clubhead speed comes from a delayed hit, versus hitting it from the top as so many amateur players do. Brian Henninger From: Patrick Keane I recently read John Feinstein's book on the PGA Tour, "A Good Walk Spoiled", and I felt that your feature was the most compelling and interesting. I wish you all the luck in the world on the tour.

Join us for a virtual tour along the route of Cycle Oregon 1995. Neil Mishalov Recaps This Years Ride Neil Mishalov, a participant in Cycle Oregon VIII, provides us with a recap of this years ride. Many feel this was the best Cycle Oregon ever. Welcome from Jonathan Nicholas Jonathan Nicholas, Oregonian columnist and President of Cycle Oregon, welcomes you and captures the essence of this years ride. 1995 Cycle Oregon Tourbook Elevation maps, mileage and description of each days ride (and menus).

Give Us Your Input We've had great input regarding what you would like to see included here. There's still time for additions so let us know what you would like to see here. WELCOME FROM JONATHAN NICHOLAS PRESIDENT OF CYCLE OREGON The man the world came to know as Chief Joseph, leader in the nineteenth century of the people called the Nez Perce by the wandering French trappers, was a remarkable individual. He led his nomadic people in a life lived in rhythmic harmony with a landscape as wild, as rugged and as breathtaking as any on our planet. When he first came into contact with what Indians called the "endless village" of whites, Joseph urged upon his people a simple admonition: "Be brave and always tell the truth." Truth be told, few of the first U.S. government representatives to enter the Wallowa Valley were big on either valor or veracity. Little of the Nez Perce presence remains in this area today. But their spirit, and their legacy, haunts this spellbinding swath of canyon and rimrock, of snow and desert, of prairie and streams that sing. I'm delighted you have decided to join us on a remarkable bicycle ride, a journey through the heart of the American West. The country you are about to encounter is vast with promise, redolent with myth and memory, teasing yet with its potential as the native home of hope. As Oregon moves beyond boom-and-bust cycles, it may yet find here in its Northeastern corner a sustainable economy, what Oregonian historian Terence O'Donnell calls "that balance so rare." Please treat this land, and the people who carve a living from its bounty, with respect as they welcome us to the place we call wonderful, the place they call home. CYCLE OREGON VIII RECAP Neil Mishalov THE FACTS First things first. Here are some statistics about the ride. 	Number of Riders:		2,200	Registration Fee: 		$435	Riders from Oregon:		1,514	Riders from California:		265	# States Represented:		38	Oldest Rider:			78 Years	Youngest Rider:			9 Years	Female Riders:			623	Male Riders:			1,577	Days on the road:		Seven	Distance Cycled:		440 Miles	Total Elevation Gain:		27,300 Feet Weather: Sunny, no rain and temperatures in the 90�s during the day and 40�s at night Area Cycled: Wallowa Mountains, Strawberry Mountains, Blue Mountains, Hells Canyon National Recreation Area and the high desert. Towns Where We Camped: Athena, Elgin, Joseph, Halfway, Sumpter, Prairie City, Monument and Fossil. TEST: See if you can find these towns on your Oregon road map! THE LOGISTICS OK, now that the statistics are out of the way, I can tell you a little something about the trip. 1995 was the eighth year that Cycle Oregon took place, and it was the third year that I participated in the event. The ride is fully subscribed within a week of the applications being sent out, and each year the ride traverses a different route. This year we cycled through rural northeastern Oregon. Most of the towns that we cycled through or camped at have a population of less that 500 people. The trip traversed through the former home terrain of Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce Indians, former gold mining areas, the Oregon emigrant trail, hay fields and hills, hills, and more hills! An amazing thing about Cycle Oregon is how smoothly everything works. The logistics are impressive when you consider that there are 2,200 cyclists on the road, a couple of hundred support people, and many support vehicles. In addition, the riders were provided with three meals a day. For example, here is the quantity of food supplied for lunch on the 4th day of the trip: 625 lbs. of turkey, (yes, vegetarians had non-meat meals) 266 loaves of bread, 300 lbs. of cheese, 1,632 cans of soft drinks, 34 cases of Gatoraide, 2,000 lbs. of salad, 147 lbs. of bean sprouts, 44 flats of grapes, etc., etc. Camp sites are provided every evening. If you have never seen 1,500 tents set up on a high school football field, believe me it is a sight to see! Every evening portable showers are also set up and they never run out of hot water. Of course there is also a myriad of porta-potties. The ride also has four ambulances riding on the course, four Oregon State Motorcycle Troopers tooling along on the road plus five sag wagons. In addition, three different traveling bicycle repair shops set up free repair facilities every day, and 20-30 masseuses provided massages for a fee. For those who were thirsty, Full Sail Brewery, out of Hood River, set up a beer garden every evening. The ride is great to participate in just to see how this moving wheeled community flawlessly works. THE DAILY JOURNAL DAY ONE: Well, the first day we cycled from Athena (Elevation 1,734 ), located just north of Pendleton, to Elgin (Elevation 2,692). The ride was only about 45 miles in length; we had to climb one big hill (Peak Elevation 5,160). Lunch was at Spout Springs Ski Area (Elevation 5,028). Elgin is a community with the Wallowa Mountains to the east and the Blue Mountains to the west. Elgin's site was once the location of the Central Indian Camp of the Nez Perce tribe, and a trading area since the 1880s. Total climb: 4,150ft. DAY TWO: On day two we entered the beautiful Wallowa Valley, and had lunch in Wallowa. We cycled 54 miles and climbed 3,280ft. Camp was at Joseph (Elevation 4,247), a thriving art community located on the edge of the Eagle Cap Wilderness. DAY THREE: This was a tough day. The distance was 78 miles, and the total climb was 5,290ft. We had lunch overlooking Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. Hells Canyon is the deepest river gorge in North America, and a beautiful sight to see. After a sweet 17 mile decent into the Pine Valley, we camped at Halfway (Elevation 2,684), the home of Inga Thompson, former Olympic cycling medalist. DAY FOUR: We cycled 84 miles and climbed 4,800ft. Lunch was just outside Baker City at the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center. This is a special place to visit. They have wonderful life size displays of the pioneers traversing the Oregon Trail in the 1850s. You can still see the wagon wheel ruts in the high desert. Ah yes, the high desert. We cycled about 50 miles of desert today. It was hot, it was sunny and it was hard. About 50 riders sagged into the evening camp at Sumpter (Elevation 4,463). Sumpter, population 150, was a booming gold mining community and as recently as 1957 their gold dredge was still operating. The dredge can still be viewed on the edge of town. DAY FIVE: This day was only 46 miles, and the climbing was 3,280ft. We had lunch in Unity (Elevation 5,124), where we were treated to some wonderful foot-stomping, hand-clapping, fiddling music. We descended into Prairie City (Elevation 3,553), and saw to the west the beautiful backdrop of the Strawberry Mountains. DAY SIX: On this day we had a 72-mile ride and climbed 3,800 ft. During the many mining booms that hit Eastern Oregon, thousands of Chinese laborers were employed. John Day the first community we traveled through, is the site of the Kam Wah Museum, which celebrates the herbal medicine practice of the Chinese mine workers. Lunch was served at Fox (Elevation 4,387). After a few more hot and steep climbs, we dropped 10 fast miles into Monument (Elevation 2,013). Monument is an agricultural town bustling with activity in September. Hay, mint, apples and pears all come to harvest during September. DAY SEVEN: Whew, the last day. On one hand you�re pleased that the ride is finishing, but there is sadness knowing that the special magical event is almost over. We cycled 60 miles today and climbed 2,690ft. We had 40 miles of gentle downhill, and then a 2,100ft climb in ten miles. Then we dropped down to Fossil (Elevation 2,656), and finished the ride! ODDS & ENDS Yes, there were a few accidents on the ride, such as dislocated shoulders, fractured collar bones and road rash. However, the problems were small considering the number of cyclists on the road. A question frequently asked is �do you feel overwhelmed by all the people on the ride.� The answer is yes and no. While you are cycling along you are usually never out of sight of another cyclist, however you never feel hemmed in by other riders. The cyclists start riding at about 6 a.m. ( yes, it is still dark ), and continue getting on the road up to about 10 a.m. Thus, there is a line of cyclists stretching 40 miles down the road! Camping is an interesting experience. The number of riders and a finite amount of camping space require the tents to be set up close to one another. So, if by chance, you happen to set up your tent next to a person whom snores, well, I surely hope you have ear plugs! Usually there are lines to use the showers and porta-potties. All lines move quickly, and you can always strike up an interesting conversation with the bikies next to you. Although I don�t have statistics, My eyes lead me to believe that the average age of the cyclists was between 40-50 years. Most cyclists rode road bikes, but there were many mountain bikes, tandems, recumbents and folding bikes. The cyclists rode unencumbered. The ride provided six tractor trailer trucks to cart the cyclist�s gear from one campsite to another. There it is, It was another great Cycle Oregon ride and maybe I�ll see you there next year!

Love, Ann Bob Heath To: Ken, Dave, Mike, Doug, Einar and Forest I wish I could be there with you guys this year instead of back here testing software. Maybe next year. I hope you are all having as much fun as I did last year in CO VII although I really don't see how that is possible. Watch those down-hills and I'll see you all again soon. Bob Chuck Rogers Message For Peter Knudson (AKA-The Legend) Peter, Just found out how to get in touch with you. Good Luck!! Bring us back a story!!!!!! Chuck Rogers and Billy Griffin John & Lora We are so proud of you both. But we miss you already. Have a great time and drink plenty of fluids. Love from John and Lora. Curt Simkins -- McMinnville, OR USA Cycle for Life My name is Curt Simkins and I will be working with the Oregon Chapter of the American Cancer Society in a fund raising effort to help fight cancer. This past April I lost my step-father to liver cancer and have had several other family members and friends that have had to face this terrible disease. In their spirit of accepting a challenge, I have decided to take part in Cycle Oregon this September, but with an added degree of difficulty. I will doubling back frequently, and plan to cover 125-150 miles per day in the mountains of northeastern Oregon for a total of 1000 miles for the week. My intended goal is to raise $10,000 and I would appreciate your support very much. Contributions are 100% tax deductable. You can either sign up on a pledge sheet for a certain amount per mile (1-5 cents/mile) or you can donate a set amount. Checks should be made out to the American Cancer Society and I will see that you get a receipt. You can also sign up with me during the ride. On behalf of the American Cancer Society I want to thank you very much. Dona & Sue -- Elgin, IL ATTN: Tom Rasmussen Good luck from all of you LATUS friends in Elgin, ILL. Hope to join you oneday. ........Dona and Sue Mark Collins -- Beaverton, OR USA I have always made it a habit to bring 1 golf club with me on Cycle Oregon to take advantage of my other hobby whenever the opportunity arises. This year it looks like there are golf possibilities on days 2, 4, and 6. I think one of my cycling partners is planning to join me. If you'd like to help make a foursome let me know. It would be great to have an entire entourage of club carrying cyclists (6-iron is my choice). Richard Busby -- Portland, OR USA Great idea to have this on the net! I'm from Oregon, so if there's any folks who need advice on weather, etc., e-mail me. See you on the road! John Burghardt -- Chico, CA USA There will be about a dozen of us there from Chico (CA) -- drop by Camp Chico and say hello. Dean Heath -- McMinnville, OR USA Hey, are there any other riders from either Corvallis or McMinnville, Oregon? Are there any other diabetics riding in Cycle Oregon? I'd like to hook up with either at Cycle Oregon or by e-mail before hand.

Our first stop is Spout Springs, a skiing wonderland in winter and mountain bike haven in summer. On the way UP to this scenic spot, take a moment a look around (it's much too easy to keep your focus down when you're traveling skyward) and especially back towards Athena. The transition from rolling wheat country to the Blue Mountains is truly spectacular. At the top, the reward is two-fold: a delicious lunch followed by a wonderful downhill cruise to Elgin. Elgin, named after the song, "Lost on the Lady Elgin" is a thriving community of 1,775 surrounded by nature at its finest. With the Wallowa Mountains to the east and the Blue Mountains to the west, the town site was once the location of the Central Indian Camp for the Nez Perce tribe, the former location of Fort Baker and a trading area since the 1880s. It's fortunate the days mileage is short, for the community is long on entertainment. You'll be treated to everything from a cowboy ballet and western dancing to a tuba band and three-act play.

Today we enter the magical Wallowa Valley. The beauty and wonder of this area is truly astounding; it doesn't take long to understand why those who visit are compelled to return. In Wallowa, lunch is served at the site of the annual Wallowa Band Nez Perce Pow Wow and Friendship Feast. Wallowa County provided the last stronghold of the Wallowa Band of Nez Perce Indians. Chief Joseph, noted for his commitment to his people and the land, left behind a legacy that endures to this day. Today, residents depend on the land for their livelihoods in farming, ranching, logging and milling. It's a small (pop. 800) close knit community where everyone greets everyone with a smile. On our way to Joseph, our overnight destination, we pass through the largest of the Wallowa Valley communities, Enterprise (population 1,940). All kinds of surprises can happen in Enterprise, so be ready! On the way out of town, watch the fields to the right for the big black Clysdale work horses bred and raised here. Nestled on the edge of the Eagle Cap Wilderness, we finally come to Joseph, a thriving art community bustling with charm. With much to see and do here, it may be difficult to take advantage of all the town has to offer. Whether it's a visit to one of the many galleries, shops or museums, you won't be disappointed. (Joseph merchants have kindly agreed to extend their hours just for us!) In terms of entertainment, if there's a theme to be had, think Cowboys! Just outside of town is beautiful Wallowa Lake. Consider taking the tram up to the summit of Mt. Howard (elevation 8,300 ft.) for some spectacular views. For those of you mountain bikers, consider exploring some true wilderness.

As Hells Canyon National Recreation Area celebrates it 20th anniversary this year, it seems fitting that Cycle Oregon help in the occasion. Sitting on the edge of the deepest river gorge in North America, eating a delicious lunch prepared by the Eastern Oregon Visitors Association, you'll be looking at thousands of years of Mother Nature's work. In the spring, the area is covered with wildflowers; in the fall, sumac and quaking aspen sets the area ablaze with vivid reds, bright golds and yellows. The Canyon itself is teeming with wildlife. Rocky Mountain elk, mule and white-tail deer, black bear, bighorn sheep, eagles and hawks are but a few of the residents. Our descent to Halfway will take us into Pine Valley where our perspective of the Eagle Cap Wilderness is just as dramatic as it was in Joseph. In Halfway, literally our halfway point on the ride, residents do things in big way. There's the big pit BBQ being prepared on our behalf; there's the exclusive Cycle Oregon raffle -- a four day, three night, all-inclusive white water raft trip for two on the Snake River being raffled to Cycle Oregon participants only; there's Inga Thompson, a Halfway resident and former Olympic cycling medalist, who will be giving a cycling clinic (if interested, please call the Cycle Oregon office by August 25); and there is much more.

You've got a rather long day in the saddle today. There are more hills to climb. It could get hot. Massage appointments will fill up fast. But remember, at least you've got rest stops, sag wagons, delicious meals, hot showers and a beer garden on hand at various points on the course. If you had been one of the early pioneers who came out on the Oregon Trail, it would have been a whole different story. So when you visit the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center, location of our lunch this day, remember to keep things in perspective. Inside the Center, living history demonstrations, life sized dioramas, numerous displays and exhibits pay tribute to the courage of the emigrants and the hardship of the Oregon Trail. (Note: when entering the Center, please check cleats and water bottles at the door.) Our lunch is being hosted by the Baker County Visitor and Convention Bureau. Continuing on, we ride through historic Baker City, one of few Western cities whose ornate turn-of-the-century architecture is still intact. Tucked against the dramatic backdrop of the Elkhorn Mountains, this "Queen City of the Mines," as it used to be called, was a booming mining community near the turn of the century. Sumpter, our overnight destination, was also a booming mining community and as recently as 1957 their gold dredge was still operating. Today, the dredge can still be viewed at the State Park located at the edge of town and the original narrow gauge steam locomotive from Sumpter still operates. During our stay, mining and logging demonstrations will take place. Check out the antique shops or witness the "pony express" in action. HALFWAY BREAKFAST, 6:00 - 8:30 A.M.

First, after two short-but-sweet climbs over Dixie and Tipton mountains, we will be greeted by some foot-stomping, hand-clapping, fiddlin' music. It comes to us courtesy of the good folk of Unity, our lunch hosts, who have traveled several miles to meet us with a good meal and a warm welcome. Unity, located in Oregon's Burnt River Valley, is one of four ranching communities in the area. Descending into Prairie City, we are greeted by another dramatic backdrop, this time from the Strawberry Mountains and the vast wilderness area they encompass. It's a beautiful setting for the evening activities which include everything from a natural history slide show, gold panning exhibition and cowboy poetry. Prairie City was once the western terminus of the Sumpter Valley Railroad. Check out the depot museum, open for your enjoyment. SUMPTER BREAKFAST, 6:00 - 8:30 A.M.

John Day, the first community we travel through on this day, is the site of the Kam Wah Museum which celebrates the herbal medicine practices of these mine workers. After John Day, we head for the community of Fox, a small farming hamlet where lunch will be served by the spirited folks from Long Creek, the next community on the route. Unfortunately, the mileage was too long for us to actually serve lunch in Long Creek. But that didn't stop them, for they came to us. While you're eating, be sure to look at the drawings on display produced by the elementary school children in the area. You'll have a chance to vote for your favorite few and watch awards being presented. Down the road, when passing through Long Creek, take note of their 1991 centennial sign on display. Long Creek has the dubious distinction of having experienced the worse tornado ever to hit Oregon. On June 3, 1891, 200 mph winds blasted the community, destroying most of the original homesteads. Let's just hope if we experience similar winds they'll be blowing at our backs! Monument, our overnight host community, is an agricultural town bustling with activity in September. Hay, mint, apples and pears all come to harvest. As bountiful as the crops are, they're no match for the generous welcome planned for our arrival. Whether you partake of the street dance or indulge in some of the homemade treats (and crafts) on hand, you're sure to end the day with a smile. PRAIRIE CITY BREAKFAST, 6:00 - 8:30 A.M.

Hey, sometimes I'd rather be run over by a greens mower. Working alongside professional golfers -- and writing about them regularly -- is no easy task. Friendships with players, for example, can be an impediment to objective journalism. There has to be a clear distinction between reporting the news (telling the truth, if you will) and being a friend. There has to be a line in the sand, over which an ethical writer will not step. It may sound unorthodox or even revolting, but I am not in the business of creating friendships. I have known Paul Azinger for more than 20 years. I knew him when he played on his high school golf team and would shoot 35 one day and 45 the next. Nine holes with him was an adventure to be continued, and there is no way I can adequately express the depth of my admiration for what he has accomplished. Because of our professions, however, we became adversaries as much as friends. Once I had a prolonged difference of opinion (I am tempted to call it a war of words) with Curtis Strange, who didn't agree with something I wrote. It was a very unpleasant experience. Even Peter Jacobsen, who gets along with everybody in cleats, has not exactly been my greatest admirer. "You're too critical," he pronounced one day. So why did Peter's event management company, which produces The Fred Meyer Challenge, ask me to write this article? I guess Peter Jacobsen Productions thought I would tell the truth, which in this case is simple: The Fred Meyer Challenge is the most entertaining golf tournament you will ever see -- anywhere, any time. Entertaining in the sense that it combines effervescent personalities and great golf shots better than any other tournament I know. Entertaining in the sense that a lot of money, $750,000, is on the line, and yet the players joke around as if it were a $2 Nassau. Be assured, however, that the competition is very serious. You can see it clearly in the emotion-filled faces of the players as they contend with The Oregon Golf Club's outrageously tough 18th, which may be the most difficult closing hole in America. My idea of a nightmare? I have to break 90, or the devil takes my soul. I get to the course and realize that all 18 holes are the same -- the uphill, creek-lined, bunker-protected 18th at The Oregon Golf Club. Peter must have finished his tax return the night before he designed this diabolical hole. Speaking of Peter, the free-wheeling personality of The Fred Meyer Challenge is a tribute to his distinctive character and to his popularity among players on the PGA Tour. Could anyone else assemble such a fabulous lineup of players and celebrities? Yes, but I can think of only three or four superstars who could pull it off. And the founder of the Flounders (that's the mock musical group Jake Trout and the Flounders) is right at the top of the list. How strong is the field for this year's event? Together these players have won almost three dozen major professional championships. This is golf at its best -- past, present and future, from the legendary Arnold Palmer, 65, to the soon-to-be legendary Ernie Els, 25. And how many golf fans have had the opportunity to see Jack and son Gary Nicklaus play together in a team event? Not many. In my mind, this alone is worth the price of admission. What happens when you put players of this magnitude in the friendly, no-pressure atmosphere of The Fred Meyer Challenge? It's like dynamite, all this golfing talent exploding in a let-'er-rip environment. Boom! The byproduct is an astounding collection of daring golf shots. If you're like me, you'll be amazed by what you see. The skill of these golfers is phenomenal. I love the sounds as well as the sights. I love standing by a tee, listening to the whack of the ball and watching the flight pattern as it soars toward the tree tops. But the bottom line, as Peter would wish, is the camaraderie and the fellowship. This is golf, the best of all games, played by a fraternity of some the most gifted golfers to lace on cleats and spike the face of the earth. The Fred Meyer Challenge is unique. But it's more than that -- it's something to be thankful for. A tournament like this doesn't just happen overnight. All the stars in the heavens must have been lined up in the just the right fashion when this event fell into place. I know of no other golf tournament quite like it. It's enough to make me cross that line in the sand. It's enough to make me think about new friendships. Oh boy, this tournament must be getting to me. Excuse me while I go write a few nasty words about somebody.

I got to know Peter through the gym. His personality and mine...we're both very talkative. We started talking and he was very funny. At that time I had long hair. I was still playing bass in a rock band, so we had that common interest, although I did notice he talked an awful lot about golf. I didn't know his last name, and I had no idea what he did. I just knew he was a nice guy, was funny, and liked rock 'n roll. He showed me a tape of the Flounders, and I still didn't have any idea what he did for a living. "At the gym everybody talked to Peter about golf and I can remember thinking, 'Boy, he's obviously into this thing.' I've never played golf; never done it, ever. I said to Peter, 'Look, you are obviously into golf. Why don't we go out one day, go out to the muni here and hit some balls? I've never played and it would be fun.' He graciously agreed to do that. He said, 'I'll hit some balls with you, but I'm going to be gone for three weeks. When I get back in town...' "As fate would have it, that weekend I was watching TV, flipping through the channels and came upon the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. They kept talking about Peter Jacobsen. I didn't really pay attention because I didn't really know his last name. Peter had a cap on. He had just won and at this point they zoomed in for a close up. I thought, 'Oh my God, that's the guy from the gym! He's a pro golfer and he just won!' And then, of course, it all fell into place. "When Peter came back home, he was ready to hit some balls. I said, 'No way, I'm not gonna do that.' To this day, if we're at The Oregon Golf Club, he'll try to give me instruction. I would prefer that my first experience with a golf ball not be in front of that guy."

The second shot, ideally, will be hit over a large fairway bunker which we call the "hell bunker," after the trap at St. Andrews. The best approach to the green is from the left side of the fairway. I'll probably use a driver, 3-wood and 9-iron. # 2 - Par 4 - 369 Yards The player must be aggressive on this par 4 to carry it to the top of the hill, which then opens up a view to the green. If you lay up to avoid a fairway bunker on the left side, you will have a semi-blind downhill second shot. We put bunkers and long grass over near the tee boxes of Hole 3 to discourage players from trying a shortcut to the right. I'll use a driver and a wedge. # 3 - Par 4 - 437 Yards This par 4 reminds me of a hole in Scotland, with tall grass growing along the side. We have bordered the left side with many fairway bunkers to keep the player from short-cutting the hole down that side. There are no hazards in front of the green, so if there's a wind from the east, you can bounce your ball up. I'll hit a driver down the right side of the fairway, and then a 4- or 5-iron to the large green. # 4 - Par 3 - 162 Yards A downhill par 3 hole, dominated by Mt. Hood in the background. The player's tee shot goes right at the mountain. A massive oak tree guards the right side of the green, and a natural spring lake guards the left. I'll play anywhere from a 3- to 5-iron, depending on the pin position. This will be a very difficult hole to birdie. # 5 - Par 5 - 591 Yards A par 5 that's reachable in two shots. The drive needs to reach a plateau, and the second shot needs to carry a bunker in front of the green in order to reach it in two. If not, you've got to lay the ball up left, or play long to the right, to give you a short pitch to the green, which is guarded by another huge oak tree. I'll use a driver and a 3-wood to try to reach it in two. # 6 - Par 4 - 435 Yards A spectacular hole. The player must have a very good downhill drive, between two groves of trees, to set up his second shot. This par 4 is tough to reach in two, so there's a lot of area for chipping. I'll use a driver and a 3-iron, and I'll bring my short game with me. # 7 - Par 4 - 411 Yards A fun, interesting par 4. We tee off straight down the hill, and the second shot will be to a very narrow green. You can bounce the ball on the green from the left side, but if you miss it to the right, you'll be in the water. I'll probably play a 3-wood to the right center of the fairway, and a 6-iron to the green. # 8 - Par 3 - 204 Yards This hole is one of the toughest holes on the course. The green is protected on the right by a creek, and on the left by some tough bunkers. There is a flat, fair green; just a tough tee shot. This is a 4- or 5-iron shot for me. # 9 - Par 4 - 342 Yards I really enjoyed building this par 4 hole. We built the tees on the dike that was already there. The further back on the dike you hit, the more water you have to carry. We'll be hitting from the back and our drives will have to carry about 235 yards over the water and two fairway bunkers. The second shot is very short, to a green that looks a lot like the 3rd green at Augusta National. I'll hit a long, hard driver and an 8- or a 9-iron. # 10 - Par 4 - 361 Yards This is one of my favorite holes - the sharp dogleg right makes it a driveable par 4. The player can either lay up with a 2-iron down the left side, or use a wood and go for the green. It's a big, fair green and I purposely left a lot of open area around the green for chipping, because I want to entice the player to go for it. I definitely will be trying to hit a driver onto this green every time I play the hole. # 11 - Par 4 - 400 Yards This hole is cut right out of the trees, and looks like something out of Tokatee or Spyglass Hill. This is not a difficult par 4, but make sure you hit the green with your second shot -- it's well guarded by bunkers. I'll use a driver and probably a 7- or 8-iron. # 12 - Par 3 - 155 Yards This, along with number 18, amy be the signature hole of the course. A stunning par 3, with the tees and green cut into opposite sides of hills on either side of a canyon. I'll be hitting a 7- or 8-iron to a narrow green. # 13 - Par 4 - 443 Yards A tough par 4 hole. If you don't reach the green, you pay a penalty -- there's a creek that runs in front of the green. This creek will always be maintained with just a trickle of water so that you can play the ball out of the creek if you put it in there. I'll probably use a driver and a 2- or 3-iron. # 14 - Par 4 - 431 Yards This par 4 hole is power golf. It's an uphill tee shot to a very wide-open fairway. You must have a strong drive and an equally strong second shot to the largest green on the course, about 10,000 square feet. I'll hit a driver and then a 3-wood. I don't think you'll see very many birdies on this hole. # 15 - Par 5 - 517 Yards On this dogleg-right par 5, you've got to smack your drive far enough to be able to get around the corner to the right. If not, you'll have to lay up. The same creek that runs in front of 13 cuts in front of the 15th green. If I hit a good drive, I'll attack the flag with a 1- or 2-iron. If I hit a poor drive, I'll lay up with a 5- or 6-iron and go in with a wedge. # 16 - Par 4 - 440 Yards I want the player to be at the top of his game as he finishes his round. This tough, uphill par 4 requires a solid, straight drive down the right side to avoid fairway bunkers on the left. You must be in perfect position to have a good angle at this well-bunkered green. For me, this hole is a driver and a 4-iron. # 17 - Par 3 - 182 Yards A beautiful, tricky par 3. It almost has the illusion of a dogleg-left par 3 because the green wraps behind some of the tall trees that are down the hill to the left. When the pin is back and left, this will be a very difficult hole to play. I'll use a 3- or 4-iron. # 18 - Par 4 - 449 Yards A tough final hole. From the back tees on this par 4, we will have extremely difficult drives. There is only about 30 yards of safe landing area from back there. If the player is fortunate enough to hit a good drive, he'll have a tough long-iron shot uphill to a semi-blind green. This is a great spectator hole. The tournament will likely be won and lost on number 18.

TheAndean Mountains The most beautiful roses in the world are being harvestedtoday, like everyday, on the farms of Florinsa Farms in Ecuador.Nestled in the Andean mountains outside of Quito, the farms ofFlorinsa Farms provide ideal conditions for the production ofexceptional roses. The water is nature's purest, from the snow melt and thetemperature is stable year-round. The days are long here and thespecial brilliance of sunlight at the equator is consistentthroughout the year. Beginning with these great natural blessing, Florinsa Farmshas also developed the post-harvesting technology that definesstate-of-the-art in the industry. From our breeding laboratoriesin the Netherlands to the most modern computerized irrigation andfertilization systems on our farms, we've found the perfect blendof nature and science. It's a marriage that produces roses withunusually big heads, strong straight stems, healthy leaves, andan intensity of color you simply have to see to believe.

Because production depends on economicsand consumer demand, environmentally friendlier productionmethods are becoming increasingly important. Yet not manycompanies are aware of the potential their harvest residue has asa first step to meet these demands. For Florinsa Farms inEcuador, composting provides the means to effectively managenutritional and environmental demands as well as productioncosts. Harvest Residue Benefits A common belief is that merely piling up organic matterwill eventually produce compost. Unfortunately, this concept is abroad and often incorrect generalization of a very complexmicro-biological science. Composting is an exact science with itsown rules and limitations. For it to be a successful source ofnutrients, growers must first understand the mechanisms at work.Floricultural companies produce tremendous amounts of biomass anda substantial amount, the harvest residue, remains on-farm.Growers burn, destroy or produce compost with this residue.Composting is good practice, as the residue contains valuablenutrients. As good money has been paid for these nutrients, it iscommon sense to re-apply them to the soil. However, the nutrient content is not the only considerationwhen producing compost. As crops grow, they consume organicmatter as humus from the soil. Humus content determines thefertility of a soil. Applying chemical fertilizers as the onlyform of nutrition does not add any humus-forming organic matterto the soil. Instead the soil is gradually depleted of humus andthus of its fertility. Reapplying the harvest residue as compostsaves money and replenishes valuable exported humus needed tomaintain production and quality standards. Soil Breakdown Nutrients and water are taken up through the roots inthe soil. Soil must have buffer capacity to allow storage ofnutrients: humus. This substance is made exclusively by theactivity of microorganisms transforming organic substances, crudenutrients applied to the soil, into stabilized and readilydigestible food. The presence or absence of microorganisms in thesoil is very important and determines its health status.Decreased microbial activity implies increased susceptibility todiseases and pest attacks. The management of microorganismsshould not be considered a hands-off responsibility. The image isthat they grow automatically. However, microorganisms are livingcreatures and change rapidly with changes in their livingconditions. Their presence or absence cannot be determined by simplechemical analysis. Chromatography enables the soil status to bevisualized. It produces "soil pictures" that providedata such as soil condition, structure, microbiological statusand fertility concerning a soil or compost. Chromatography canprovide a picture library of the gradual improvement ordegeneration of a soil and notably its microbiological status. Decomposers When harvest residue is piled into a heap, it is invadedby bacteria that specialize in breaking down organic compounds.Mesophilic decomposers are the first to invade. They quicklyconcentrate their efforts to heat up the pile. They increasetemperature with the energy they use to break down residue. Next, thermophilic microorganisms begin working. At the highertemperatures, mesophilic bacteria are eliminated by their ownactivity and become food for thermophilic organisms. Their hungersoon causes the temperature in the pile to peak, signaling theend of the breakdown cycle. As thermophilic microorganismsdeplete their food supply, overall activity in the heapdiminishes. While the temperature drops, several organisms arewaiting to initiate the next stage in the process: stabilization. When growers recognize the smell of good soil, they usuallyare not aware that it is actually actinomycete organisms they aresmelling. Actinomycetes are crucial to humus formation in compostas well as in the soil. These bacteria release nitrogen andcarbon equally, and they possess the ability to produceantibiotics. This is where chromatography comes in handy again,as it will "show" stabilized nutrients on die clayhumus complex as well as readily available nutrients. Thestabilized nutrients are especially important in composting. Veryfew systems stabilize nutrients sufficiently in order to preventleaching. Equally few systems provide the carefully balancedmicrobiological life that increases the health and fertility ofthe soil significantly. Composting at Florinsa Farms Several composting methods are practiced worldwide.Florinsa Farms, after several years of experimenting andconducting trials with composting and vermiculture, have nowopted for aerobic composting. They found that it is possible toproduce healthier crops with microbially active compost, reducingchemical fertilizer input and production costs significantly.Moreover, to enhance quality, they grow additional ingredientson-farm by a process that provides tons of superfluous,nutrient-rich, green material. The farms also have other benefitsfrom this system: purifying the water in the storage basins andreducing evaporation. At Florinsa Farms, management discovered that compost doesn'tjust happen, it requires skill. What is often considered to be acompost heap is in many instances the remains of a anaerobiccomposting process, where more valuable elements are lost thanare stored. Anaerobic composting is an ineffective and long-termprocess. Here mainly anaerobic bacteria are at work, and despitethe fact that compost is produced, much of the nutrient potentialis used up by the anaerobic bacteria and fungi and such compostmay produce dangerous toxins such as cadaverin! Aerobic microbial compostinq Although not many growers are aware of the aerobiccomposting process, it is a truly effective composting processthat utilizes 50 to 85 carefully selected bacteria and fungistrains and is capable of recycling harvest residue in six to tenweeks! The final result is with excellent water holding capacity,good CEC qualities and readily available stabilized nutrients. What is more, the compost has many microorganisms that willcontinue their work once applied to the soil. It provides a readymenu for plants as well as for physical decomposers such asmites, millipedes, centipedes, springtails and earthworms. But why provide food for earthworms as we can make a readyproduct such as worm compost? The answer is simple. Invermiculture, microorganisms must first decompose the harvestresidue into digestible chunks before it can pass through theworms' digestive tracts. As this takes place in rather flat beds,considerable time and space is needed to process significant quantities. With aerobic composting much less timeand space is needed to recycle all material. Also, in FlorinsaFarms' soil management system, they also want food forearthworms. Vermicompost, as a ready product, does not providethis, but aerobic compost provides a ready food to nurture theneeds of earthworms. Consider that earthworms make more nutrients(phosphorous and potassium) available, neutralize soil pHd"ugh the action of their calciferous gland, improve @e andinfiltration rates, improve soil structure, stimulate microbialactivity and although it is as yet unclear why, reduces parasiticnematode counts. All of this is free, provided you feed andmanage them. Management The more types of microorganisms in the soil, thebetter. Beneficial microorganisms need to be introduced to thesoil and fed organics to help them multiply. You must bring theirpopulation to the appropriate level. This is where compost playsa major role. You have to manage soil organisms: Nurture them, accommodatethem, and make sure they have sufficient air- everything theyneed to thrive. The result is healthy soil with strongantagonistic abilities to combat diseases and nematodes. Bydefinition this means less chemical crop protection, stabilizednutrients that will not leach and sensible economics anddecreased environmental pressure.

On-demand text retrieval options include: Keyword text searching Article and issue retrieval Headline scanning Text Search Keyword Text Searching To retrieve information from NewsNet that covers a topic of interest, perform a keyword text search. Start by clicking on the Text Search icon from the Main Commands and Featured Services screen. Click here if you wish to display the Text Search screen Create your search strategy by completing the [Text Search] screen that is displayed, using the following steps: Define Search Type -- Boolean or concept Construct Keyword Phrase Select Search Fields -- NewsNet allows you to decide where in the article your keywords will appear...all text, headlines only, headlines and lead paragraph only Choose Database Codes -- Identify which titles to search for your topic Select a Date or Date Range -- Select the section of the NewsNet database you would like searched according to date or date range. Conduct the Search -- Click the OK button and Baton will initiate a sign on (if you aren't already connected) and begin processing your search. Output Display -- The way your search results are displayed will depend upon which Search Type you selected. For a concept search, a bar graph will be displayed which illustrates the relevancy ranking of the retrieved articles. With a Boolean search, relevancy ranking becomes less meaningful since all articles will contain your keywords, so the graph is replaced by a simple notification of the number of articles retrieved. Retrieve Articles Retrieve Full Issues Article and Issue Retrieval Each story and article contained in the NewsNet database is assigned an accession number, which appears with the headlines that result from a Text Search, NewsFlash hits as well as a headline Scan. These numbers enable you to quickly retrieve articles of interest by simply inputting the accession number in the proper box displayed after clicking on the Retrieve Articles icon from Baton's main command screen. To retrieve the full issue of any publication on NewsNet, click on the Retrieve Full Issues icon of the Main Commands and Featured Services screen. The Retrieve Full Issues screen requires that you simply type in the title code and date of the issue requested. Click the OK button and NewsNet will retrieve and display the full issue. Scan Headlines Scan Wires Scanning Headlines and Wires Just like perusing the table of contents of a book or magazine, NewsNet allows you to scan issue headlines. Click on the Scan Headlines icon from the Main Commands and Featured Services screen. Type in the title code(s) of the publication(s) whose headlines you wish to scan and the date of the issue you wish to scan. For assistance selecting the title code(s), click the List Sources button to display the Database Codes Selection screen and double click on your selected titles. Database codes for the Scan Headlines option can consist of any combination of one or more title, industry, source, or category codes. The Scan Wires feature lets you browse through information from individual newswires by displaying a sequentially numbered list of headlines from the one or more wire services that you specify. If you find an article of interest, click on the headline to receive the full text. Continue to the next stop on the Tour --or-- Return to the Tour of NewsNet home page to choose your ownpath.

It's easy. Just ask Rita McDowall and she'll tell how easy it is to peer into the future of the energy and utility field with NewsNet. Rita is primarily responsible for researching competitive intelligence and pricing for the marketing department at Central Illinois Public Service Company (CIPS). CIPS, a public utility, conducts all core research on an in-house level and recently began intense competitive tracking with NewsFlash. Rita likes NewsFlash for easy retrieval of the information she needs to project possible mergers or uncover services the competition may offer in the near future. "The utility area is very competitive. NewsNet helps us pinpoint the changes occurring with the competition. NewsNet helps you know your competitors, as well as you know yourself, " Rita says. "With NewsNet, I don't waste time waiting for what I need. I could go into NewsNet and find a company profile or an analysis of the latest development in the field. It's so easy, and the news is so timely," Rita says. Another benefit is the large number of newsletters online covering the energy and utility fields and the ability to pull stories off the newswires. "We like to see what the newswires release online related to our field. Sometimes a story about a utility a thousand miles away will be a real benefit to us," she explains. Rita feels the analysis is simplified when the right information is at your fingertips and no time is wasted. "When all the needed information is in front of you, it's much easier to complete the analysis. We want to be able to make accurate projections as soon as possible- before something happens. It's how we remain competitive in the field," she adds.

But she isn't. "I wish I'd have been using it much sooner," says Barbara, a researcher for the international public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton based in Washington, D.C. Hill & Knowlton has found the service to be invaluable in a number of ways. The firm serves a diverse client base consisting of a variety of industries including healthcare, pharmaceutical, aerospace and telecommunications. In the public relations arena, fast-breaking news takes center stage. Who's doing what and when is what Hill & Knowlton's clients need to know. And serving clients needs is what Hill & Knowlton is all about. "NewsNet has become an indispensable tool to monitor breaking news for our clients," says Barbara. "If a client is experiencing a crisis, I can monitor the wires and custom tailor our search to retrieve just the information they need." Barbara feels the benefits of NewsNet are countless, but the best advantage is getting vital information- fast. "I would say NewsNet's greatest attribute is the timeliness of information combined with the vast number of publications available. I capture the news before the competitors," Barbara says. "We're getting the news quicker and from a greater number of sources than we could in any other way," she adds. It's these advantages that give Hill & Knowlton the edge they can pass on to their clients. "With the diversity of our clients, NewsFlash makes it easy to track projects for a number of clients at the same time," she says. "I really like the way I can custom tailor searches to get the precisely the information I need from the best sources." "I'll sign on a couple times on an ordinary day- and when there's breaking news I'll sign on every half-hour for the most up-to-date news." "NewsFlash consistently performs to my expectations. It's difficult to pick one instance of an excellent search- they're all excellent," she adds.

As with many NewsNet users, NewsFlash is one of Dan's favorite features. "I like NewsFlash the most because it allows me to input specific keywords and it enables me to monitor all of the NewsNet files in a way that I am guaranteed not to miss anything," he said. "Information in our business can come out just about anywhere." Dan finds the Investext files to be a valuable source of company information. "The Investext company reports conducted by analysts and brokerage firms allow me to obtain very specific information about particular companies," he said. "Reports include company strategies and current markets, and some include their five-year strategic plans," he continued. "I like the in-depth analysis that you can retrieve from an Investext report; you are not just limiting yourself to financial records."

On other services, you are not able to browse and choose nearly as easily." He signs on to NewsNet every day to check his NewsFlash hits and to conduct targeted searches relative to the latest advancements in telecommunications around the globe. The convenient grouping of services covering the telecommunications industry is a principal reason Ed uses NewsNet so frequently, as well as the broad telecommunications coverage offered by NewsNet. "Special searches are much easier to conduct with NewsNet's industry grouping," stated Ed. "And we always know what's being published in the area." In addition to NewsFlash and the quick full-text retrieval methods, Ed likes NewsNet because of its extensive worldwide coverage. "My favorite attribute would be the worldwide coverage available on NewsNet. If I need to know what the latest developments are in Saudi Arabia, I know that the information is going to be found in a number of newsletters and wires that are on the system.

Fred Shanks, a reference librarian for its headquarters in New York and one of its primary NewsNet users, signs on to the system each business day to check his NewsFlash profiles. NewsFlash is one of his favorite NewsNet features. He likes being able to continually monitor news stories in the media and track particular issues of interest. Corporate information, tax and bankruptcy news, and general litigation are some of the main points of interest for Fred and his coworkers. The timeliness of information retrieved from NewsNet, especially those articles clipped in NewsFlash, is one of NewsNet's most attractive features according to Fred. "We can pull stories that have come out in the last couple of hours or so, and that's a real advantage," he said. Accessing the wire services through SCAN and SEARCH are also popular activities with the NewsNet users at Shearman & Sterling. Getting current, relevant information on NewsNet is elementary.

He currently signs on three or four times each day to retrieve NewsFlash hits and to conduct ad hoc searches. He uses NewsFlash to track policy and international information on missile threat, defense and production. The ease of sifting through hits generated by NewsFlash is one of his favorite NewsNet features. "You don't have to worry about searching," he says. "NewsFlash does the work for you." When Jim does conduct searches, he generally searches wires such as Federal News Service and Kyodo News Service and daily defense services for stories of interest to ballistic missile defense. He finds the breadth of coverage and the wealth of information to be one of the most important reasons for using NewsNet. "I can retrieve large amounts of information from various services and bring them together to produce a nice presentation that is very effective for our needs."

NewsNet and NewsFlash have over 800 sources that include real-time, worldwide newswires, and many daily newsletters and papers. There is no limit to the number of NewsFlash topics you can monitor and the menu-driven software allows more options for customizing your profile than any other system. For instance, you can specify activation and expiration dates, ask the system to search only certain segments (full text or headlines), or sort your results. You can track against a single source, any combination of sources, or everything added to the system. When your profile is active, NewsFlash notifies you at sign-on with the name of the folder and the number of new articles. You can scan a list of new headlines and decide to view results in full, KWIC, or preview formats (the first 18-24 lines). Once you've looked at the articles, you can either delete or save them..."

Elston NewsNet President For NewsNet, as for most information companies and most users of business information services, 1996 will forever be remembered as the year the Internet and the World Wide Web became an important force in our lives- and not just a curiosity. It was the year that the Web was on the tip of everyone's tongue and in the cortex of our brains. What seemed like a vibrant, interactive marketing and advertising medium just a year ago suddenly became stable and robust enough to begin developing useful applications for serious information users. Almost overnight, it seems, business researchers and business services began to proliferate on the Web. We introduced the NewsNet Website, www.newsnet.com, in April, with a host of marketing and demonstration features, including a NewsFlash demo. Just a few months later, we began providing limited access to NewsFlash on the Web for selected "early adopters" who provided valuable feedback and helped us refine the service. By the end of the summer, we had created a friendly, convenient interface to NewsNet that adds many new features to the traditional NewsNet service. At Online World in Washington, D.C., we demonstrated NewsNet on the Web publicly for the first time-and to much enthusiasm from subscribers and prospects alike. I hope you'll come and visit our site and sign up for a free demo soon if you haven't already done so. Data Sources Continue to Grow It was a very successful year for adding more timely news titles. About 150 new sources will be added to the database by the end of 1996. In no previous year have we added as many resourceful publications. Our International category experienced tremendous growth this year. Among the most impressive additions are titles from Lafferty Publications of Dublin, Ireland, and the London-based Pearson Publications, Ltd. And most recently, an agreement with Financial Times' Asia Intelligence Wire has expanded the NewsNet database with approximately 80 new International titles, including the leading daily English-language newspapers of Asia and the Far East. (See New Online Titles.) The NewsNet database now consists of about 25% International titles. These publications cover a wide range of subject areas too. For example, a large number of international publications can be found in our Telecommunications, Finance and Accounting, and Electronics and Computers categories. Other categories where we have greatly increased coverage are the Health and Hospitals and Publishing and Broadcasting areas. By the end of 1996, you have approximately 1,000 data sources available to you via NewsNet. New Pricing Plans We like to keep you, our customer, happy. And one great way to make you happy is to save you money. We reduced the price of TRW Business Profiles retrieved from our system by 15% and we cut out the $1.50 per minute information retrieval fee for TRW. These increased savings on an already valuable service were well received by our users. NewsNet users find important business information useful for competitive intelligence, or to research a new client, and save money at the same time. Outlook for 1997 The online information industry has become very competitive, offering knowledge workers a myriad of new options and sources. This competition means we'll be working twice as hard developing an even better product for you and expanding our database. You can expect continuous, ongoing enhancements to our Website and Web products. And, as in the past, we look forward to seeing you at tradeshows and at NewsNet onsite consultations and training sessions. We always value the opportunity to discuss the NewsNet service and your information needs, and our new Users Group gives you an opportunity to meet face-to-face. All of us at NewsNet wish you a prosperous 1997. Continue to the next article of the NewsNet ActionLetter.

And most of us can't recall what we did before fax machines were common-place in the office. That's why NewsNet's on-demand delivery option is so popular to our users. NewsNet users find the option so attractive because, in just a matter of minutes, almost any information retrieved via NewsNet can be sent to any fax machine or to anyone with a standard Internet address. And there is no limit to the amount of information sent via fax or Internet e-mail. Dozens of articles, pages in length, can be sent successfully with either medium. The process is simple and is completed in just a few simple steps. Retrieved information can be sent in any form- headlines, full-text, KWIC, or previews can all be sent via on-demand delivery. In Baton, simply click on Utilities and select fax or e-mail and enter the information in the menu box. The following is the process for on-demand delivery in Native Mode. Easy E-mail Process To send information via e-mail simply type -EMS at the end of any text retrieval command. (This can also be abbreviated to -E.) You will then be prompted for the recipient's name, e-mail address, and a brief message for the recipient. After this is entered, you will have the chance to review the information you entered and, if anything is incorrect, you can re-enter the information. You can also send a list of headlines with the on-demand delivery option. After listing the headlines retrieved from a text search, simply type HEAD -EMS. You will then be prompted for the recipient's name, e-mail address, and a brief message for the recipient. Please note that the text you transmit will not be displayed on your screen with on-demand delivery. Fax Fast and Simply Just as easy is the on-demand delivery option via fax. Simply type -FAX after any text retrieval command. Now, you will be prompted for the recipient's name, fax number, and a brief message to accompany the faxed information. As with the e-mail on-demand option, the fax command can be appended to HEAD, KWIC, or PREVIEW. The process will be exactly the same as if you were sending a full-text article. Great Value Not only will you be able to send important information in a timely and predictable manner, with NewsNet, you will also be sending this important information in a cost-effective manner. An on-demand delivery message only costs 50 cents plus one cent for each line of text. Full-text and full-issue rates along with KWIC and PREVIEW rates will also be incurred when used in conjunction with the -EMS command. If you'd like to approximate the cost of an e-mail or fax before sending, simply use the line count feature in the headline display to determine the total number of lines in a specific article. Add this amount to the 50 cent fee and the cost for the retrieved option you selected (PREVIEW, KWIC, or full-text). Easy Conversion for X.400 In the event you want to send NewsNet-retrieved information with this option, but the recipient has a non-Internet e-mail address, the address must be converted into a X.400 format address. The X.400 is an addressing standard which allows communication between NewsNet's messaging system and other messaging systems. It's very simple to convert an address. Simply type HELP X.400 at any NewsNet prompt, and you will receive directions to guide you through the conversion. If you're using Baton, simply click on Utilities and select e-mail from the menu. Enter the recipient's name and then place your cursor in the ENTER X.400 ADDRESS box. Simply hit the F1 key on your keyboard and your monitor will display a listing of how to convert a non-Internet e-mail address. Continue to the next article of the NewsNet ActionLetter.

Jean provided the following answers. Q. When I access a D&B report, I am asked to enter an endorsement. What should I enter? A. The endorsement field is a convenience for the user. It is a way to identify the report for future reference. Simply enter your name, department, or the person who is requesting the report. Q. What do the suffixes next to the D-U-N-S Number mean? A. When the list of company names matching your search criteria is displayed, one of the following suffixes may be appended to a D-U-N-S Number. The suffixes identify the type of report you retrieved. B -- Branch location T -- The company name you see is a trade style. The report will print under the company's legal name. D -- A D-U-N-S Number has been assigned to this company but Dun & Bradstreet has not conducted a full investigation on it. Therefore, the report is not available. Z, I -- The report for this company contains information that is too old and is therefore unavailable. Q. If a Business Information Report is not available, does that mean the Payment Analysis Report is not available also? A. No. The information on these reports comes from a third party source. It is possible to have payment information and/or family tree information about a company and not have a current Business Information Report. Q. If a foreign company has locations in the United States, will I be able to retrieve those U.S. locations? A. Yes. Because of Dun & Bradstreet's unique D-U-N-S Numbering system, each corporate family member has its own D-U-N-S Number. This means each member has its own unique report. If they are located in the U.S., they are in the U.S. database and therefore available. Q. If I order the combination of both the Business Information Report and the Payment Analysis Report (BP), will they come out separately or together? A. Two separate reports will come out in response to one command. That is, when you select number 3, BP, you will access both reports; the BIR followed by the PAR.

Nynex officials are used toupsurges in usage during bad weather and thought they hadplenty of capacity this time, but there were more phones,faxes, pagers and computer modems switched on than theycould handle. Many customers experienced delays in gettingdial tones.     NATIONWIDE, there were 45 million home-based workers in1994, up from 6 million in 1984, according to the NationalAssociation of Home-Based Businesses. That included bothself-employed people and employees who work from home. Thenumber continues to grow.* * *     GOLDILOCKS, who preferred her porridge not too hot andnot too cold, has lent her name to the current economy. Mostanalysts think the Federal Reserve has engineered it "justright," and they expect it to continue through 1996.     THAT WOULD make the new year the sixth straight year ofeconomic expansion since the last recession. If inflationremains under control, it could also be the fifth straightyear with consumer price increases under 3 percent. (Thehigh-inflation 1970s look more like an aberration everyday.)     UNEMPLOYMENT should also remain low, according to theconsensus, but that won't stop Americans from worrying.Corporate downsizing has given them a permanent sense ofinsecurity. Also, real income growth has been stagnant fortwo decades, leaving many middle-class families hard-pressedto make ends meet.     THE ECONOMIC YEAR may start slow as automakers andretailers struggle to move unsold inventories, but thecavalry is already on the way in the form of lower short-term interest rates from the Fed. Rates were cut twice lastyear as the economy faltered, and analysts say continuedtame inflation will allow further cuts in 1996.     IN SUM, there are so few clouds on the horizon thatmost economists expect stable, if boring, economic growthright through 1997. David Berson, chief economist at theFederal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), says"modest economic growth and benign inflation" are the mostlikely outlook for the next two years.Back to Headline List CopyrightAMERICAN MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996SPLIT MAILING EARNS VICTORIA'S SECRETA LAWSUIT FOR GENDER DISCRIMINATION     Denise Katzman was outraged by the obviousdiscrimination: She and a male coworker had each receivedseemingly identical lingerie catalogs from Victoria'sSecret, only his offered a $25 discount on orders of $75 ormore, while hers offered only a $10 discount.     On Jan. 2, she filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S.District Court in New York City. She sought $15reimbursements or credits from the Columbus, Ohio, companyfor anyone who received the smaller discount.     The suit alleged discrimination based both on genderand income, because the company presumably had done enoughmarket segment research to know that Katzman made less thanher coworker. The suit further alleged a historic pattern ofdiscrimination, on the grounds that the company had done thesame thing previously.     Wrong! In a brief statement released the next day,Victoria's Secret called the suit "baseless." Industryinsiders said Katzman was apparently the victim of nothingmore sinister than a "split mailing," whereby marketers testthe pulling power of various come-ons by including differentones in two or more segments of a given mail drop.Deja Vu     In 1991, American Express became embroiled in anothercontroversy involving a split mailing. The Joan Cook mail-order house, which sells housewares, wanted to mail out someof its catalogs, but not all, with the message thatcustomers could charge orders using the AmEx card.     The president of Joan Cook got the idea to try a splitmailing at a time when many retailers, restaurants and othermerchants were objecting to - and publicly revolting against- the high fees they had to pay to AmEx on each transaction,and the long time it was taking AmEx to reimburse them forcharges. Schwartz wanted to see whether "The Card" waspaying its freight, so to speak.     AmEx was trying to stamp out the revolt, and threatenedto stop doing business with Joan Cook if the company wentthrough with the split mailing. The catalog companyrelented, but AmEx was later forced to cut its fees for manymerchants after Land's End, L.L. Bean and Laura Ashleystores joined the revolt (AM, Feb. 27, 1992, p. 44).Back to Headline List CopyrightAMERICAN MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996THE MILLION-DOLLAR MARCH:L.A. BLACKS SWITCH BANKS     Hundreds of Los Angeles-area African-Americansresponded to a self-help campaign Jan. 6 and switched theirbank deposits to four black-owned institutions. In one case,Founders Bank of Los Angeles saw its deposits increase by$600,000.     The event was called "Change Bank Day." It was part ofa larger campaign called Recycling Black Dollars that calledon blacks to patronize black-owned businesses.     Campaign organizers estimate that blacks have about $9billion deposited in various Los Angeles-area banks.     "If we were able to get just 25 percent of our moneyinto black banks, we can see a hotel on Crenshaw, a hotel atthe Convention Center, new manufacturing plants in South-Central, which in turn would provide more jobs for youngblacks," says Muhammad Nassardeen, head of Recycling.     Founders Bank President Carlton Jenkins is ready to dohis part to further such dreams. He has promised to investhis depositors' money in the black community, while alsogiving his customers excellent service. Five-year-oldFounders has $100 million in assets.     "It's just phenomenal!" said Jenkins of the $600,000windfall the bank received Jan. 6. Sounding somewhat likemovie banker Jimmy Stewart, he added, "What they're sayingis, 'We've finally arrived with you, Carlton!'"     The other institutions participating in Change Bank Daydid not immediately release information on the amounts oftheir new deposits.Don't Call It Separatism     Nassardeen insists that the campaign is about self-help, not racial separatism. "We're into survival," hedeclares. "Nobody ever called it racism when other peoplewere doing it."     The concept of financial solidarity within the blackcommunity has been around for years, but it was recentlyrevitalized by the Million Man March on Washington, D.C.     "It was time to let people know that we are not thepoor people that many people have depicted us to be,"Nassardeen says.Back to Headline List CopyrightAMERICAN MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996BANKERS DISCOUNT CREDIT CRUNCH,EXPECT SURGE IN HOME BANKING     As the new year approached, the Consumer BankersAssociation (CBA) polled its board of directors for theiroutlook on a number of vital issues. They were emphatic ontwo issues of interest to marketers: 1) They do not believethe recent increase in consumer debt levels will lead to asignificant pullback in spending; 2) They are certain thathome banking is about to become very hot.     "There will most likely not be a major financial shockin 1996 as a result of the consumer loan situation of 1995,"says William MacDonald III, president and CEO of NationalCity Bank in Cleveland and chairman of the CBA.     MacDonald concedes that many banks "extended" theircredit standards in 1995 to make more money on interestpayments. They were particularly aggressive about issuingnew credit cards.     But although the ratio of consumer installment debt toincome has risen as a result, "the good news is that creditcard debt is but one segment of consumer debt," he says. "Tofairly assess consumer debt you must also include loans fromhome equity and personal and revolving credit lines." Viewedfrom this "macro" perspective, he argues, "the debt levelnumbers are not as alarming."     And given a relatively high level of consumerconfidence, "experts are not looking for consumerretrenchment in the near future," he continues, but adds, "Iexpect to see some tightening of consumer credit standardsand an increase to more historically normal loss anddelinquency ratios."A Naysayer in Dixie     MacDonald's sanguine outlook is not shared by JohnKirby, who heads the Consumer Lending Group at SouthTrustBank of Alabama, headquartered in Birmingham. (His boss,Chairman and CEO Julian Banton, sits on the CBA board.)     "In my opinion, 1996 will be a year when we see higherdelinquency and loan losses as the consumer becomesoverextended," Kirby says. "Consumer purchases will softenbecause of this trend as the year proceeds."     Kirby says too many banks have lowered their creditstandards to maintain earnings in the face of growingcompetition. They have engaged in a race to the bottom onrates for credit cards and auto loans. That forces prudentlenders into a Hobson's choice: accept more marginalapplicants, or leave their business to someone else.     In either case, the marginal applicant gets the loan,and Kirby fears many of them will be unable to keep up thepayments in 1996.Home Banking     "It is no longer a question of whether clients want andare willing to use home banking; the question is how many,how soon and how much will they pay for it?" says RichardHartnack, vice chairman of Union Bank in Los Angeles.     "A number of factors are converging to make 1996 theyear of electronic banking," says Linnet Deily, who ischairman, president and CEO of First Interstate Bank ofTexas, based in Houston.     She explains: "Consumers are increasingly comfortablewith online technology; time is an ever-more preciouscommodity; and millions of Americans are alreadyenthusiastic users of personal financial management softwarepackages such as Quicken and Microsoft Money.     "Judging by the level of enrollment in the first weeksafter First Interstate Bank began offering online servicesand our usage trends on check cards, electronic banking willbe a significant part of how we do business in the future."FTC Warning     At the CBA's recent annual conference, an official fromthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned bankers to becareful with the Pandora's Box represented by onlinebanking.     "Technology provides unprecedented opportunity togather information on consumers," said David Medine, theFTC's associate director for credit practices, but bankersmust control the temptation to sell such information tomarketers. "The challenge will be to educate consumers abouthow information is gathered and used, and then provide themwith a vehicle for exercising choice."

WOULD HEALTHYFOOD PRODUCTS TASTE AS SWEET?     America's love affair with healthier foods has mademany government truth-in-labeling standards obsolete. Whyinsist that "peanut butter" contain 90 percent peanuts whena less-concentrated version can taste as good and be farhealthier?     That is essentially the question asked by the U.S.Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) in twin Dec. 29 notices in the FederalRegister. The notices invite public comment on proposedchanges to a wide range of naming and labeling rules.     The regulators say many old-fashioned rules are denyingfood processors the opportunity to offer healthier and moreconvenient products. But some processors and consumeradvocates worry that looser rules will allow watered-down oreven adulterated versions of common foods.On the Table     Without apparent ironic intent, FDA food labelingofficial Betty Campbell says "everything is on the table" inthe current review. She insists that food labels will stillhave to list ingredients and nutritional values, regardlessof any other changes that may be enacted.     That does not satisfy Larry Davenport, president of theAtlanta-based International Jelly and Preserve Association.     "Without federal standards," he warns, "it opens thefield to a free-fire zone where people can do whatever theywant, which is to, say, make a sweet-tasting paste of somesort, with coloring and sugar, call it a jelly or jam orpreserve."     Currently, strawberry jelly has to be almost one-halfstrawberries to wear that name. Beef stew must be one-quarter beef by weight. The rules date to 1938, when theywere intended to keep processors from watering down theirproducts or stretching them with fillers. Perversely, therules often encourage high fat, sugar and salt content.     Even our everyday language has left the old standardsbehind. People who say, "Pass the butter" or "Pass thecream" these days do not necessarily expect to receive thereal thing. Yet, technically speaking, butter must be 80percent butterfat, and cream must be cream, not half andhalf.     Dairy farmers have actually lost business because theycould not lighten up their products without relabeling them,says Fergus Clydesdale, head of the Food Science Departmentat the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.     To be sure, health considerations have already led tochanges in some rules involving water, fillers and labeling.The FDA has ruled that the product once called "ice milk"may now be sold as "low-fat ice cream." But the agencycomplains that each such change requires a cumbersome andexpensive special review under current rules.The Specific Proposals     The USDA wants to allow reduced-fat versions of hotdogs, ground meats and other meat products to go by thetraditional names, so long as their labels clearly statethat water or fillers have been added.     Both the USDA and the FDA are proposing to allow theuse of such common terms as beef stew, peanut butter, etc.on healthier versions, provided that the percentage of beef,peanuts or other key ingredient is revealed on the label.     Michael Taylor, who supervises meat inspections for theUSDA, says, "Presumably, there's some point at which there'sso little beef it's misleading inherently to call it beefstew, but what's magic about 25 percent?"

That's what consumers said, essentially, in focusgroups made up of regular Unocal customers and drivers whopatronize other stations. They were far less interested inalleged performance differences between brands - thetraditional pitch - than in convenient squeegees with soapywater, paper towels, and clean, well-supplied restrooms.     Accordingly, the TWBA Chiat/Day advertising agency cameup with a campaign of TV and radio spots with the theme, "WeGet It." It started running in Southern California on thefirst, and is slated to run in Northern California soon. Itemphasizes the "little things" people want.     "We learned that gasoline is not a primary factor inchoosing a service station," says Cindy Hearn, Unocal'smarketing director. "We get it: people want more than goodgasoline; they want the little things that make theirexperience at the station as efficient, quick and pleasantas possible."Focus Group Art     During the focus groups, participants were asked toshare their feelings about service stations - not justorally, but through a sort of arts-and-crafts exercise. Theymade collages of words and pictures relating to service, andthey drew cartoonlike "thought bubbles" filled with theirfeelings about the fill-up experience.     Hearn says the "We Get It" campaign is less a promotionthan a new way of doing business, designed to maximizecustomer convenience and minimize hassle. As part of thisnew push, all local dealers have been asked to sign pledgescommitting themselves to the new philosophy. Point-of-salematerials reinforce the message.

Offer them free onlinehours, electronic "coupons" good for purchases at thevirtual mall, and, if all else fails, use the oldest of allcome-ons, cash.     That's how the Greenfield Online Research Center doesit. The new venture, a subsidiary of a Westport, Conn.-basedmarket research firm, is one of only a handful specializingin online consumer and business-to-business marketing.     The heart of the operation is an in-house hardware andsoftware system linked to the World Wide Web, the MicrosoftNetwork and Prodigy. Private research studies are conductedamong an exclusive base of respondents who have registeredwith Greenfield and receive compensation. Public studies areopen to participation by anyone who visits the three sites.     Greenfield's quantitative research includes opinionpolls; attitude and usage studies; customer satisfaction andtracking research; market segmentation, concept and producttesting; plus advertising and Web site testing.

The company expects many of its clients will bemarketers with World Wide Web sites. Spokes-man HughBraithwaite says online research studies "will help clientsto optimize their corporate and brand imagery and overallsite effectiveness, measured against specific marketingobjectives."     Andrew Greenfield, president of the parent GreenfieldConsulting Group, says online research is not only logicalfor online marketers, but an almost mandatory means ofintelligence-gathering.     "With speed to market emerging as a key corporatestrategy for success, we believe online research will becomean increasingly valuable means of achieving projectefficiency and cost control," he explains.     Although online research is an infantile offshoot oftraditional research methods, the Greenfield group says ithas proven to be statistically comparable to them. In arecent test, survey results collected via Prodigy proved tobe virtually identical to results obtained by telephone.     In other respects, the company says, online researchhas clear advantages. It can reach people who have littleinclination to participate in traditional phone and mailsurveys, and in-depth interviews can be conducted acrosswide geographic regions without the time and expense oftravel.

The WFS saysthese are not forecasts or predictions, which imply a highdegree of probability, but "futuribles," or realisticconceptualizations of possible future developments. Some aremerely linear projections of developments that are alreadywell under way, but others are more visionary:     y A microchip implanted somewhere on our bodies mightserve as a combination credit card, passport, driver'slicense, personal diary - you name it. Implants might evenhelp us think.     y Local languages will disappear at an acceleratingpace as global communications induce people to adopt commonones. English, which already dominates global computer net-works and communications, among other fields, may become thedominant language worldwide.Cyberghettos     y Neighborhoods may become more, not less, homogeneous,because people who "telecommute" to their jobs will be ableto live wherever they feel most comfortable. Generally, thatmeans among people of their own demographic groups.     y Digital assistants, using artificial intelligence,will surf through thousands of online catalogs and consumerinformation banks to identify the products and services wewant. They will then solicit bids from competing suppliers.Although highly efficient target marketing will eliminatethe proverbial "wasted" half of all advertising costs, muchof the savings will be spent on getting around the digitalassistants, which will be programmed to filter out "junk"messages.     y "Smart cards" and crime fears will finally make papercurrency obsolete. Federal Express has not accepted cash atmost of its air freight locations for 10 years now, and manyretailers are following suit. This may put a severe crimp inthe so-called "underground economy," because it will becomeincreasingly difficult to exchange funds without creating arecord of the transaction.     y Government officials and dissidents, as well asbusinesses and consumer advocates, will increasingly usecyberspace to spread disinformation as well as facts.Anonymous individuals will share the online forum withgovernment information bureaus and Madison Avenue. Small-time snake-oil salesmen, cranks, radicals and slandererswill have a potential audience of millions.Dollars for Data     y Much of the information on the Internet will remainfree or nearly free, but a growing amount will be availableonly for a fee. Information providers who can't or won'tfinance dissemination through advertising or otherunderwriting will have to charge for it (see box, below).     y The new media may make people increasingly insular,egocentric and selfish. First, it will allow them to avoidmany in-person contacts. Meanwhile, content providers andmarketers will compete for their attention by courting themas all-important members of a special elite. The result maybe widespread narcissistic self-satisfaction.     Finally, the society notes that not even its best mindscan foresee everything in the future:     y Many of the biggest payoffs from informa-tion/communications technology will come as surprises.

Most of the employees at the government's chief number-crunching agencies - the Bureau of Labor Statistics and theCommerce Department's various statistical branches - werefurloughed in mid-December because Congress and PresidentClinton could not agree on a continuing resolution. Theirleave was extended into the week of Jan. 8 by a blizzardthat paralyzed the East Coast.     Without those statisticians, the economic and businesscommunities had no data on such things as consumer spending,unemployment, new housing starts, inflation, the GrossDomestic Product and international trade.     That caused immediate nervousness on Wall Street, wheremarkets often rally or tumble based on the latest economicnumber. Traders were left to their own devices, and theybegan to make decisions based on the latest word aboutbudget talks between the White House and Capitol Hill.     But many businesses also use government statistics.According to Labor Secretary Robert Reich, "The privatesector really does rely on this information [for] everythingfrom what to order, when to order, how optimistic to beabout inventories and sales. Without these reports, it isnot just the financial community that's handicapped, it'salso the entire business community."     Many trend watchers fell back on "the understudies," asCommerce Undersecretary Everett Ehrlich called privatelycompiled numbers on manufacturing and sales of previouslyowned homes, autos and chain-store goods.     "But they're just not as reliable," says Morgan StanleyChief Economist Stephen Roach. "It's pretty hazardous todraw solid conclusions from these types of numbers."     In the end, though, Roach says even lost data will havelittle effect, so long as the flow resumes soon. "If we losta month or two along the way, it won't be a disaster. But ifit lasts a long time, it will [create] problems...,"especially if the Fed makes a misstep with regard tointerest rates.Back to Headline List WT03-B27-185IA059-000320-B032-4http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ad28.html 205.156.212.5 19970114194951 text/html 185880HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 19:47:30 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:08 GMTContent-length: 185692Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ad28.html Sample Issue Copyright FORECAST via NewsNet JANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES The Changing Face Of The American Worker (2623 words) A Penny Saved Is Two Pennies Earned (1077 words) TECHNICAL SUPPORT: READERS' QUESTIONS ANSWERED (1720 words) The Northwest Trades Wood Chips For Microchips (1738 words) I'm Okay, Eurokay?

The mix is a far cry from 1960 when, according tothe Bureau of Labor Statistics, 90% of the permanent job pool consisted ofskilled and semi-skilled white men.  Today, there may not be a job foreverybody, but many more kinds of people are available to work.In the next 10 years, not only will the labor market retain its kaleidoscopicquality, the ranks of older workers, minorities and women will expand a gooddeal further.  BLS projects that in 2005, 62% of all workers will be women andminorities, compared with 58% in 1992.  One out of every three people over theage of 55 will be in the work force; 39% of the labor pool will be 45 orolder, up from a current level of 31%.As a result, experts foresee rising numbers of part-time skilled employeesworking later in life than did the previous generation.  As workplacediversity becomes even more obvious, issues concerning the glass ceiling forwomen and minorities and adjusting management to different work styles willhave to be addressed with more effective diversity programs.  Moreover,training, compensation and benefits programs will have to change to take intoaccount the needs of this multicultural labor force.Retraining existing workers to fill projected needs will become one way toretain valued employees in an age when neither employee nor employer canexpect lifelong loyalty.  Compensation programs based on productivity andincluding investment options are likely to become even more common than theyare today.  Benefits that make life easier for two-income families and singleparents will give companies an edge in the competition for the best jobcandidates.Of course, today's employers already have begun making some adjustments forwomen and minorities, but few have thought about what it will mean toaccommodate large numbers of aging members of the Baby Boom generation.  Theywill soon find themselves doing so.  As Philip Rones, a Bureau of LaborStatistics expert on aging workers, puts it, "Throughout their working lives,the Baby Boomers have dominated the work force demographics.  This is notgoing to change as this group ages."One reason many older Baby Boomers will still be working in 2005 and beyond:they won't have the enticements to end their careers as early as many of theirparents.  Several recent initiatives, if passed, would further reduce thefeasibility of early retirement.  A proposal before Congress would raise theminimum eligibility age for Social Security payments.  Smaller companycontributions to pension plans will discourage early retirement.  In short,not only will aging Baby Boomers comprise a large percentage of peopleavailable to work in 2005-many will have to stay on the job longer.Age Plus Skills Equals JobsThe predicted abundance of older workers should prove very good news to manycompanies.  By the time 2005 rolls around, middle-aged and elderly employeeswill possess two of the characteristics most prized by bosses:  they'll beexperienced and they'll be cheap.  Many companies will be eager to keep themin the work force.This will be a significant change from today's labor atmosphere.  After all,company after company has spent the past decade kicking aging workers offpayrolls to cut costs.  Not only do older workers, by dint of seniority, tendto have the highest salaries, they also may have more health problems, afactor that drives up company medical plan costs.However, Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit ResearchInstitute, says several changes in compensation and related areas-alreadyunderway at some companies-should level the playing field for older workerssoon.  By 2005 this set of workers will be no more or less desirable thanyounger employees, because soon there will be little cost difference inemploying various age groups, he says."What I find really interesting is that there are things taking place forreasons that have nothing to do with older workers," Salisbury observes.  "Yetthese changes will make it more desirable to employ this group in the future.We seem to be entering a new era of age neutrality in the workplace."These initiatives include the movement toward pegging salaries to anindividual's performance or that of his work division.  "Many companies fearthat older workers slow down somewhat and don't produce as much," he says."However, when salary is tied to performance, those who don't work as harddon't cost as much.  In addition, you create an incentive for people tocontinue producing top-quality work, year after year, no matter what theirage.""The movement toward defined contribution pension plans also makes it mucheasier to employ older people," Salisbury adds.  "In the past, most companiesoffered straight pensions, which meant that they had to pay more into plans asworkers got older, no matter what.  Now, the employee has to pick up some ofthe costs himself.  And, what the company pays is tied to how much the workerearns, not his age."A third trend-offering salary packages that mix cash, stocks and bonds-oftenappeals to older workers because they need to pile up investments, Salisburysays.  Although these weren't designed with older workers in mind, suchbenefits work in their favor.There's another factor likely to increase the desirability of older workersover the next 10 years.  The Baby Boom boasted more college graduates than anyother generation in American history, according to Education Departmentstatistics.  "The future belongs very much to workers with strong skill sets,"says Alan Reynolds, a scholar at the Indianapolis-based Hudson Institute."The demand for them already is outstripping the supply.  Today there are over100 million people in the labor force, and only about 20% of them have collegedegrees."BLS predictions about employment growth by industry between now and 2005follow a pattern of more jobs in services and fewer in manufacturing, themodel that has dominated the U.S.  economy since the 1970s.  Although someservice jobs require little education, nearly all high-paying ones call for atleast a college degree.  And few require the physical strength and dexterityusually associated with younger workers.Barbara Adolf, a benefits expert in the Fort Lee, New Jersey, office ofconsulting firm Kwasha Lipton, predicts that aging workers will be wellpositioned in 2005-providing they are well-educated.  "In the next century,there'll be more competition for skilled workers-particularly in high-tech andservice jobs," she says.  "Companies already are much leaner.  They're sayingin effect.  'There's no room for fat anywhere.  Each job has to count andcontribute to the company's goals.' All this creates a tremendous pressure onorganizations and individuals to perform.  Suddenly, human resourcesdepartments have become very important to companies.""The good news for workers, though, is that if they have the right skill sets,they will be sought after," she says.  "Many very talented people actually nowfind themselves in stronger positions than they were when companies werefatter.  In the next century, this should mean that highly skilled olderworkers will find themselves both more in demand and with fewer young peopleas competition."Of course, in between the lines, Adolf implies that 2005 will be a very harshtime for aging employees-as well as the younger ones-who lack the requisitebackground.Steve Bookbinder, a vice president in the Boston office of managementconsultant Towers Perrin, says the skilled older workers of 2005 should havelittle trouble attracting jobs-on the company's terms.  "Corporate Americawould love to be able to hire many experienced workers," he says.  "They'llprobably try to hire them part-time, so they don't have to pay their medicalbenefits or fund their pensions."Martin Sicker agrees with Bookbinder's latter conclusion.  The economist headsthe older workers program for the Washington, D.C.-based American Associationof Retired Persons.  He says workers over age 55 often are forced out offull-time employment and into a string of part-time jobs.  A recent BLS studyalso documents a very strong increase in older men being forced intoretirement, then taking low-paying, part-time jobs with few benefits.During the last 10 years, the trend of pushing aging workers out of permanentjobs and into consultancies and other part-time arrangements has createdtremendous tensions between old and young workers, to say nothing ofmanagement and labor.However, there are some good reasons to think this hostility will subside.  AsEBRI's Dallas Salisbury points out, there is a strong trends towardage-neutral wage and benefits policies, a phenomenon that should lessen someof the stigma against aging workers.  In addition, with the largest block ofthe population, the Baby Boomers, approaching late middle years, older workerswill become socially and politically more powerful.Dealing with DiversityAging workers are not the only cohort that will be represented in greaternumbers in the work force in 2005.  The ranks of women and the minorities willalso be larger.Many experts believe women are the growing demographic segment best adapted tothe economy of 2005, with its preponderance of service jobs.  "Traditionally,women have been well-represented in service industries," says Ken Goldstein, alabor economist with Manhattan's Conference Board.  "They have tended togravitate toward these jobs, and society generally has accepted them in thesepositions.  In fact, one of the reasons larger numbers of women have beenentering the work force in recent years is the increase in services work.  Ifour economy was still concentrated in heavy industry, there probably would notbe as many women workers."The fate of minorities in the 2005 job pool will be strongly linked toeducational achievement and skills training.  "Historically, there have beenrelatively large proportions of dropouts among minorities," says the HudsonInstitute's Alan Reynolds.  "To survive in the economy of the future, it'svery important that more minorities become college graduates.  Actually, thisalready has started happening for blacks.  Education Department statisticsshow that more blacks are entering college than ever before."While it's likely that a good share of African-Americans, Hispanics and Asianswill possess the education needed to snare jobs in 2005, many companies willhave to alter their workplace culture in order to create an atmosphere inwhich all types of workers can be productive.Michael Wheeler, a Conference Board associate who recently completed a studyof corporate diversity initiatives, says that while progressive managementscurrently tend to be aware of the need for an inclusive atmosphere, theyfalter in their attempts to generate one.  "There's a gap between awarenessand understanding what to do.  And our study included only companies thatvolunteered to establish diversity initiatives.  Right now, there's a lot oftalk, but not a lot of models."A recent study by the Center for the New American Work force at Queens Collegein New York City concluded that diversity strategies often fail because theyare not linked to positive business initiatives.  Instead, many companiesstart such programs just to avoid lawsuits and unfavorable publicity.However, Wheeler believes that diversity initiatives will increase, both innumber and importance, between now and 2005 because there are compellingbusiness reasons to create an inclusive culture.  "The first reason iscreativity," he says.  "When you have people coming together from a variety ofbackgrounds to discuss business issues, you get more responses and moreoptions for solving problems.""Our study showed that cross-cultural problem-solving groups often take longerto get started than homogenous groups, because it takes more time for peoplewho differ to understand each other," he says.  "But the work was definitelymore creative and far-sighted than when people from like backgrounds gottogether."  The second business advantage of a diverse team:  it reflects themarketplace.  "More and more, the U.S.  is made up of all sorts of people fromall sorts of backgrounds," Wheeler says.  "And this is the prime customer basethat many companies want to sell to.  There's a lot to be said for having awork force that looks like your customer base."He adds, "In the past U.S.  companies operating in foreign markets often madethe mistake of bringing all their staff from home.  Often they wound up makingstupid mistakes that wouldn't have occurred if they'd had talked more to thelocals.  Companies are in danger of being in the same predicament at home-ifthey don't try to include many types of people in their decision-makingprocesses.""And that's the whole point about 2005," Wheeler says.  "Companies will findways to work with all these different kinds of employees-better ways than theyhave now-so that they can appeal to many kinds of customers"Redefining BenefitsCompanies still need good employees, even though they are unwilling to financelifelong employment and defined-benefit pension plans.  This often translatesinto a situation in which employers go out of their way to provide benefitsthat don't cost the corporation much, but nonetheless simplify and improvelife for the workers.For instance, Kwasha Lipton's Adolph says her own company has begun offeringsuch innovative benefits as on-site car washes and laundry pick-ups, as wellas payroll programs that make automatic de- ductions for consumer purchaseslike car payments.  Such offerings are shrewd corporate moves, she points out,because they win the workers' gratitude and generally cost very little.  Ofcourse, providing these services on-site also reduces workers' outsidechores-and keeps them at their desks longer.Telecommunications company GTE Corp.  in Stamford, Connecticut, has developeda number of programs tailored to women, who comprise about 60% of itsemployees.  They include a back-up on-site daycare center, open on work dayswhen school is out, and a referral service for care providers for olderrelatives."Many members of the Baby Boom generation will have critical childcare andeldercare needs, often at the same time," Adolf says.  "More employers willneed to offer supports-beyond the traditional compensation and benefits-sothese workers, particularly the women, can do their jobs."Another of the far-sighted new benefit offerings is continuing education.These programs soothe the workers' fears of job loss by enabling them toexpand their skills and retain their desirability in the marketplace, Adolfsays.  At the same time, the programs do not involve a promise of continuedwork from the employer.Northern States Power, a Minneapolis utility, has developed an innovativeprogram that addresses both workers' fear of unemployability and management'sdread of an underprepared work force.  The company's offerings includeteaching computer skills to meter readers, a job category Northern Statesplans to replace with machinery.  The utility also is a leader in providinghigh-potential members of minority groups and with professional mentors.Adolf adds that in some shrewdly managed companies, the death of the conceptof a job-for-life has freed both management and workers to negotiate eachjob's hours, structures and benefits on a creative and individual basis."For instance, the whole issue of flexibility is very important today," shesays.  "Both sides are demanding more flexibility.  Many workers withresponsibilities at home want to be able to take time off to care forrelatives.  At the same time, new technologies allow some workers to workoutside their offices.  For their part, companies have financial reasons forwanting people either to work part time or out of the office."In the future, she says, this new freedom, will work to the advantage of bothmanagement and labor-if they learn the art of making trade-offs.Leslie Wines is senior writer of Forecast.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996A Penny Saved Is Two Pennies EarnedFact:  in 1995, there were about 34 million Americans age 65 or over.Fact:  by 2010, there will be about 40 million Americans age 65 or over.By 2020, there will be about 53 million Americans age 65 or over.By 2030, there will be about 70 million Americans age 65 or over.This is called both a problem and an opportunity.The problem is that under any reasonable understanding of the Social Securitysystem, the great bulk of these people will not be able to retire with thesame level of benefits that retirees have now.  This will lead to a stupendousstruggle over benefits and who will be cut the most in coming years anddecades.The downside hints at the upside:  If Americans cannot reasonably expectthemselves to be cared for adequately by the Social Security system, they willhave to pay into their own private savings and investment schemes to supportthemselves in their golden years.The scope of the effort required is enormous.  If you look at it on anindividual basis and then on a collective basis, you get an idea of the moneythat will be needed.Take a baby boom couple who have reached age 45.  They have around 20 moreyears to work, or so we will imagine.  Their combined earnings are $100,000 ayear (just to make it easy).  They spend almost all of that on living, plustaxes, saving only a few thousand a year.  At age 65, if inflation stays inthe bottle at 3.5% per year, they will need to make almost exactly $200,000 ayear to equal the buying power of today's $100,000.  By age 75, they will need$281,000, and by age 85, which they can be expected to reach, they will needabout $400,000 per annum.To make it really simple, let's imagine that the lucky couple, whom we willcall Mike and Ginger Bayer, will need to live on $280,000 per year for theentire 20 years between retirement and shuffling off this mortal coil.It's reasonable to expect that Social Security will pay for some of this.Unless there is some major upheaval, a couple paying in all their workinglives and getting every possible Social Security benefit is likely to receive$60,000 a year by 2015, or about twice what they would have received at thetop end of the current benefits scale.  (Bear in mind that all of thesenumbers are approximate.)That means the Bayers must bring in about $220,000 per year from other sourcesby 2015.  To do so, they should have a capital sum-that is, savings-largeenough to provide that yield.Assuming mild inflation of 3.5% per annum, the Bayers might expect to earninterest of 6.5% on their investments in 2015.  This means they need to amassa capital sum of roughly $3,384,615 by 2015.  This sum will allow them tospend at their 1995 level and also to save, adding to their capital, so thatthey will have higher interest earnings in the future when they need them.This would also allow them to leave a decent sum to their children, to providefor any hazards that lie in the future.Now here comes the part that will make the couple's hair stand on end andshould make Merrill Lynch start salivating.Suppose the Bayers have the decent, but by no means lavish, sum of $200,000already saved as of mid-1995.  Imagine further that they can earn 9% pretax-7%after tax-on their investments.  This is not a staggeringly good rate ofreturn, but it is a fine historic rate.  To get to $3,386,000 by 2015, theBayers will have to save $4,947 per month.  Of a likely after-tax monthlyincome of perhaps $6,000, the Bayers will have to save about five-sixths.Impossible?  Well, maybe so.  So let's give the Bayers a break.  Let's saythey will be able to earn 10% per year, all in annuities, and that the yearthey retire taxation is abolished.  This is unlikely, but let's be really,really generous in our assumptions.  The Bayers will still have to save about$2,528 per month, or about 42% of their after-tax income.Of course, to the extent that the Bayers can spend less and cut their standardof living after they retire, they will need to spend less.  But just how easyis it to spend less when faced with the demons of boredom, opportunity fortravel because of the end of work and the possibility of declining health?The Bayers would also have to save much less if they lived on their savings asan annuity, using up part of principal and interest each month.  But just howmuch do they want to risk outliving their capital?  And how badly do they wantto leave money to their children in this highly uncertain world?  For comfortof mind, substantial savings are called for.Obviously, if the Bayers could start out with $200,000 at age 35 and have 30years instead of 20 to save up for their retirement, their payments to savingseach month could be far smaller.  The advantage comes from the gains made bycompounding the excess of the rate of return on their investments above theinflation rate for a long period.There are several key numbers-oriented points here.  If middle aged peoplehave any sense at all, they are terrified about their retirement.  If theireyes are open, they will be looking to save as much as they possibly can.Their advantage will be immensely increased to the extent that they canincrease the yield on their savings.  (If you save $20,000 per year for 20years at 10%, you come out with $1,145,000.  If you can earn 13%, you have$1,619,000.  If you can earn 15%, you have about $2,050,000.)Now, multiply the Bayers by tens of millions of middle-class people preparingfor their golden years.This surely must be the marketing opportunity of all American history.  It'shonest and straightforward, and the numbers tell the story.  It's a scarystory, but it's almost criminal not to hear it.Benjamin J.

Rarely are the answers to theseproblems in manuals.  That's why we have launched this new column.Email us at kimbaker@aol.com or mleuchter@aol.com, or write to Forecast Q&A,Faulkner & Gray, Inc., 11 Penn Plaza, New York, NY 10001.In this issue, we tackle a continually vexing subject:  How to successfullyoutput those gorgeous maps and charts built with mapping, modeling,spreadsheet and statistics software.  All too often, what you see on yourscreen is a thing of beauty compared to what you print out.  Fortunately,there are solutions to this problem.Dear Forecast,We use mapping techniques extensively for site location.  I spend several dayseach month building maps that look good on my computer monitor, but when I tryto print them on the color printer, they look fuzzy and my labels [text] printlike characters made of blocks.  I'm working on an IBM PC and the printer is aHewlett-Packard.Jan S.  Spokane, WAJan, it would help if we knew exactly what kind of printer you were using asHP builds many different units, but the underlying issues are the same for allprinters.  In addition to the obvious differences between printer technologies(dot matrix, ink jet, laserprinter, thermal wax and dye sublimation), thereare three kinds of printer "languages" in use.  What we're talking about isthe lingo employed to convert computer output into printed pages.1.  The most basic printing engine simply prints a series of characters asthey are output by the computer.  Such a beast cannot print graphics, since itis strictly character-based, with the shape of each character kept in theprinter's modest memory.  This is (fortunately), a dying breed due to itsinability to handle graphics and multiple type sizes and fonts.  Since you canprint the maps, albeit fuzzily, you don't have this dinosaur.  2.  The secondkind of printer-probably what you are using-prints each page as a series ofdots.  Type characters are composed of dots that shape each letter.  Thisprinter can print graphics, but its type reproduction abilities are limited.This technology is used in non-PostScript printers, but font outlinetechnologies such as TrueType are improving type output from these printers.3.  Last, and arguably best, is the PostScript printer.  Type is sent to theprinter as vector-based descriptions of each letter, called outlines.  Theprinter prints the outline of the character with very smooth precision andthen fills in the letters.  Some images are composed of PostScript code, too.Programs such as Adobe Illustrator create PostScript files.The advantage of this technology is that the edges of lines used to createletters and shapes are much smoother and can be enlarged or reduced with noloss of quality.  PostScript printers cost more than other models because theyrequire additional printer-based computer power.  There's also a fee paid bythe printer's manufacturer to license PostScript from Adobe Systems, itsdesigner.  This adds a few hundred dollars to the cost of these units.Problem #1:  Your problem with the label type coming out in blocks is fairlycommon with non-PostScript printers.  You can solve that problem quickly byadjusting to your printer's limitations.  Just make sure to use only the fontsand font sizes included with your printer's software.But if you need a greater selection of fonts than your printer has available,install TrueType on your computer and then use only TrueType fonts.  TrueTypecomes with Windows and Macintosh operating systems, and there are thousands ofTrueType fonts on the online services.  Look in the desktop publishingsoftware areas.Problem #2:  As for your maps looking fuzzy, if you are using a color ink-jetmodel HP printer, you may be using the wrong paper.  Regular paper suitablefor copiers and laserprinters absolutely won't work for quality color printingwith ink jets.  In fact, dust from conventional copier bond can clog yourprinter's heads, requiring frequent cleaning or replacement.Buy ink-jet paper made by companies such as Epson and HP and see if your mapsdon't suddenly appear clean and vibrant with color.  This paper is availableat most computer stores and large office supply houses.  For top-qualityprinting, try HP's Premium Glossy Paper.  It's expensive, but your maps andcolor charts and graphics will look better than ever.Dear Forecast,We are assembling an investment report for our shareholders.  We tried using alaserprinter output but our printer said it was not good enough for "repro"(what's that?).  Would a better laserprinter fix the problem as ours isgetting old?Shelley L.  Beaverton, ORDear Forecast,I would like to put my charts on 35mm slides, but it's very expensive at thephoto house I use.  Is there a better way?Brian H.  Truro, MAThe solution to both of these problems is similar, so we'll handle themtogether:Brian, we assume that you are creating colored charts on a PC (or Mac) andthen taking the printed output to a professional photo service.  There, theyessentially have to re-create your art and that is expensive.A better way to handle this is with a device called a film recorder.  Itconnects to your computer and reproduces your slides on conventional 35mmfilm.  Film recorders are expensive, starting in the $1,500 range for a fairlyunsophisticated unit, so you may not be able to afford one.  But there's abetter solution.  Read on.Shelley, essential to quality reproduction-that's what "repro" means-isresolution.  For decent reproduction of type, you'll need a laserprinter withat least 600 by 600 dots per inch (600 dpi).  For photos, 1,200 dpi isrequired.  But here, too, there's a better way.Use a service bureau.  This is a well-equipped shop that owns a printer ofsorts called an imagesetter.  This expensive device takes computer output (PCor Mac) and renders it to photographic paper or film.  While your laserprinterstruggles with 300 or 600 dpi, imagesetters typically output at 2,500 dpi andup.That's the kind of resolution, Shelley, that will satisfy your print shop.Service bureaus are found in the phone book under desktop publishing,photographic film processing and typesetting.  Many offer free pick-up anddelivery, although we would definitely shop price.  Prices per page run from$5 to $15 depending on output size, paper or film, output quality andquantity.Brian, you may need to do a little more shopping.  While every service bureauowns an imagesetter (it is their raison d'etre), not all possess a filmrecorder.  Call around or pick up a copy of desktop publishing magazinePublish!  and look at the ads in the back.  Shops around the country offerfilm recorder services complete with acceptance via modem and overnightdelivery of the finished slides.Cost:  about $5 to $15 per slide depending on the shop.  Again, shop price andlook for a shop that outputs at 4,000 lines per inch (lpi), not 1,500 or2,500, since that's not good enough for high-quality 35mm slides.Dear Forecast,How can I videotape the maps I make?  I use MapInfo on a Macintosh IIvx.Hideko K.  Chicago, ILWe'll tackle this topic the best we can here, as it's really more suitable fora book.  First, don't use a camcorder to shoot the screen.  The results willbe horrendous.Instead, what you want to do is to capture the computer's internal videosignal and send that to the videotape.  The easiest way to accomplish thisminor miracle is to use an add-on video board, which can be purchased for bothMacintoshes and PCs.These boards aren't cheap, unfortunately, with price tags over $1,000 forquality models.  (Owners of Macintosh AV-models have this ability built in.)Some computer configurations and add-on boards are only capable of 20 framesper second (fps), but this makes for a jumpy video.  The videotapes you areused to seeing are recorded at 30 fps.With a fast computer, the right board, software, enough memory and a gianthard disk, full-screen 30 fps is now possible on personal computers.  Butwe're afraid, Hideko, that you're going to have to swap that IIvx for a fastermachine-at least a Quadra 6100AV or a Pentium 100 or better.To capture video, you simply run your mapping session and send it to the tapethrough the board's output jacks.  The owner's manual will explain the correctprocedure.  Look for a board packaged with useful video management and editingsoftware such as Video Spigot/Adobe Premiere where possible.  Your originaltape will need editing unless you're capable of a perfect session with no longpauses.  And, this is assuming that the finished tapes don't demand the kindof quality seen on TV.For professional quality, you probably should seek professional help.  Theequipment required is quite expensive, and final polish will require anediting console and an experienced operator.  Pros can also add nuances suchas captions, titling, music and effects-all for a price, of course.You can also dump your "movie" to QuickTime on Macs, but this is an additionalstep if your real need is videotape.You can, however, use QuickTime and a QuickTime editing package to edit yourmovie before shipping it to tape.Last, if you do use slow computer, shoot screen shots of each change to themap.  Then build a file of these shots, dumping each one over and over.  (At20 fps, a 4-second shot requires you to dump the same screen to tape 80times.)  The finished file can then be dumped to video and your machine'sspeed won't be such a significant problem.  This will, however, take time andpatience on your end in order to get the timing and pseudo-animation right.You can also use a product such as Macromedia Director to help you build yourmovie.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996The Northwest Trades Wood Chips For MicrochipsThe first half of the 1990s produced a substantial economic restructuring inthe Pacific Northwest states of Oregon and Washington, one that will fuel theregion's growth for the rest of this decade.The federal forests, long a major source of timber for wood productmanufacturing in these states, were virtually shut down to provide improvedhabitats for endangered species.  That forced thousands of logging and millworkers to find new jobs.  Boeing Corp., the largest manufacturer inWashington, downsized significantly in response to commercial airplane orderdeferments and cancellations, as well as to the weaker defense and spaceproducts market.Despite these adverse developments, however, these states have continued toenjoy healthy rates of growth.  The reasons:  the expansion of thehigh-technology industry and the migration in of people and firms.  By the endof 1995, the negative forces had moderated.Better, new high-tech projects now underway should keep the PacificNorthwest's economy climbing at a pace above the national average for the nextseveral years, and the region's increasing economic diversity will cushion itagainst any mild cyclical downturn.Oregon No Longer TrailsOregon today might be described as the poster child of industrialtransformation, celebrating a series of announcements of new or expandedhigh-technology facilities.The list of companies boosting their production in Oregon includes SanJose-based microchip manufacturer LSI Logic Corp., Fujitsu Ltd.  (Japan'slargest computer maker), Korean conglomerate Hyundai Ltd., silicon makerSiltec Corp.  and Tokyo-based Komatsu Electronic Metals.  In addition, majorconstruction projects by Intel Corp., Integrated Device Technology, Inc.  andWacker-Siltronic Corp.  are already under way.  These expansions and newplants will serve as reservoirs of strength for the state during theirconstruction and opening phases.  Total potential investment in thesefacilities exceeds $10 billion.The worldwide microelectronics boom, the availability of water and low-costhydroelectric and combustion gas power, a skilled and educated work force andtax breaks under Oregon's Strategic Investments Program all played roles inthis high-tech surge.  Designed to attract major corporations, the SIP-inwhich each county has the option of participating-caps property taxassessments at $100 million for up to 15 years.  Intel, LSI and IDT all tookadvantage of this program.The strong economy boosted income tax revenues (the state has no sales tax),and the state's gambling operations have been very successful, fattening statecoffers.  Thus, the major fiscal stress that some observers expected as aresult of state property tax cuts has been largely absent.Much, but not all, of the new corporate investment is in the Portlandmetropolitan area.  Employment gains in the past two years were widespread;all the metropolitan areas (Portland, Salem, Eugene-Springfield and Medford)added jobs either at or above the state average.Still, Oregon is seeing non-metropolitan growth that has made the first halfof the 1990s look like a replay of the 1970s, when rural areas generallymatched or even outpaced metro areas in population growth.  (For an example ofone fast-growing nonmetropolitan area, see the sidebar above.)Oregon labor markets tightened throughout last year, raising increasingconcerns among employers about the labor supply and putting pressure on wages,particularly in construction.  Net in-migration continued its strong pace.  In1995, the state's population grew an estimated 50,000; of that, 35,000 peoplemoved to Oregon from somewhere else, many from California.  Housing priceincreases began to raise questions about affordability, particularly in thePortland metropolitan area, where the median price of a home rose 12.5% injust the first three quarters of 1995, reaching $131,500, according to theNational Association of Realtors.Going into 1996, conditions in Oregon are ripe for increased pressure on wagerates and higher labor force participation rates.  Employment is anticipatedto grow at about 2.5% to 3%, with a personal income increase near 6%, thisyear.  This forecast is a bit lower than 1995's growth, which, when theyear-end figures are in, should reach about 4% for employment and 7% forpersonal income.Oregon's high-tech sector will continue to expand, given the backlog ofprojects either announced or already under way.  Construction will remainstrong, with major industrial projects, a light rail expansion and continuedpopulation growth.  The only dim note comes from the forest products sector,which is continuing to decline due in part to harvest constraints, althoughthere have been some gains in secondary processing.The rapid growth in recent years has focused concern in the state on issuessuch as growth management, whereas less than 10 years ago encouraging growthwas the mantra.  The state's land use planning process is being tested in someareas by the extended period of expansion.  Concerns about rapid growthcontributed to one county's decision not to extend the SIP incentives to alarge company last year, losing it to Arizona.  The growth problems are notlikely to dissipate soon.Washington at the CrossroadsWashington State offers more of a mixed message.The pace of growth in Washington has been slower than in Oregon throughout the1990s.  The biggest reason:  the contraction at Boeing, which now has about70,000 employees in the state, down from nearly 107,000 in 1990.  Layoffs atboth Boeing and the Hanford Reservation, a former nuclear materials productionfacility, had a constraining effect on the state economy, which in otherrespects was doing very well.  Statewide total nonagricultural employmentincreased by 2.5% in 1994, and as of September 1995, year-over-year job growthhad slowed slightly to 2.1%.Many observers had expected the economic braking effect of Boeing's work forcereduction to end early in 1995, but the company decided to reduce its workforce by another 12,000 during the year.  In 1996, Boeing will be anessentially neutral force, with no additional work force reductions expected,but no major hiring.  The November announcement of a multi-billion dollar saleof aircraft to Singapore signals an improving outlook for Boeing, but this isnot likely to translate into job gains for some time.On the other side of the state, the major contractors on the HanfordReservation also announced plans to reduce their work force by 4,800 during1995 due to a slowed pace for the radioactive waste cleanup program.  Furtherjob reductions at Hanford are certainly possible in 1996.Despite these temporary and permanent reductions in payrolls, the statecontinued to grow in terms of total employment and personal income.  Theacceptance of early retirement offers by many Boeing and Hanford workerscontributed to the dampened effect of the work force reductions, but the realstory was strength elsewhere in the economy.High technology was the primary growth force in Washington in 1995.  Softwareemployment expanded rapidly, led by Microsoft but accompanied by expansions ofseveral hundred other firms and a flood of small startups.  Biotech continuedto expand slowly, and medical electronics firms have also been doing well.Late in 1995, thanks mainly to some key changes in Washington's tax code, thesemiconductor industry rediscovered the state.  In September, Intel announcedthat it had chosen Dupont, a small town located between Tacoma and Olympia, asthe site for a manufacturing/research and development facility that willemploy 6,000 people within several years.  Two other semiconductormanufacturing companies announced expansions of existing plants:  Matsushitain Puyallup and SEH America in Vancouver.  In addition, BHP Steel, anAustralian company, chose a site near Kalama for a steel rolling mill thatwill employ 230 workers.These announcements were major coups for the state's economic developmentleaders, who attributed the moves to a new sales tax credit available tomanufacturing companies that invest in plants and equipment.  Although thestate has no income tax, it has a high sales tax that-until the credit tookeffect last year-applied to manufacturing equipment, inhibiting corporateinvestment.Other indicators also showed growth.  Airport traffic was up 12% at Sea/Tac inthe first half of 1995 compared to the first half of 1994, and several newinternational routes were added.  Despite harvest constraints, the lumber andwood products industry added 700 workers, and log exports were up 15% in thefirst half of 1995.  Headhunters reported tightening labor markets,particularly in the Puget Sound area.In the early fall, the state's revenue forecasters reported higher thananticipated collections, indicating a more vigorous pace in the state economy.With problems in some sectors and considerable strength elsewhere, the statemoved ahead at about the rate of the national expansion.Still, worries remain about the sustainability of current employment levels inthe wood products industry, with the federal forests essentially closed andother stumpage sources unable to increase harvests.  Ultimately, a modestresumption of production from Forest Service lands and perhaps imports fromRussia and Pacific Rim sources may help boost supply.  Secondary wood productproducers saw some drops in exports and total production in 1994 due toweakness in both the U.S.  and foreign economies, but expect to show astronger performance by the end of 1995 and into 1996.Structural change continues in the retail sector, with national storesadvancing into regional markets.

Public opinion polls in Germany,without whose participation monetary unification would be DOA, run two-to-oneagainst giving up the Deutsche Mark.  Great Britain has already opted out ofjoining.  And France has been crippled by strikes protesting the governmentspending cuts necessary for the country to qualify for entry."There's a fear, especially in wealthy countries, of redistributing wealth,"Klaus Friedrich, chief economist for Germany's Dresdner Bank, explained to agroup of financial journalists in December.  "People think Portugal and Greeceare coming in and will destabilize the currency.  They're not, because they'revery unlikely to meet the criteria for convergence in time.  People just don'tknow enough about it."The lack of popular support for the Euro doesn't discourage continentalpolicymakers, bureaucrats and bankers.  So far, the EU has kept very close toits timetable.  And public opinion is malleable, especially since citizenswon't have to give up their francs and marks for another six years.  Notwasting any time, the EU has already launched a Europewide public relationscampaign to promote the Euro.The real obstacle to the common currency may be the economic criteria forjoining.  By the end of 1997, each member nation must have an inflation rateof about 3%, interest rates below about 10.5%, and a stable currency.  Many,if not most, countries will have little difficulty reaching those goals.  Butit will be harder to clear the remaining hurdles:  a government budget defecitof less than 3% of the nation's gross domestic product and total public debtof less than 60% of GDP.The point is to assure stability.  "That will be taken care of by being a cluball of whose members are equally rich," Friedrich says.  In a recent report,he gives the best odds to a union of eight European countries-Germany, France,the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Austria and Ireland-althoughothers may join later.What if the EU fails to sway public opinion in favor of adopting the Euro?Many observers believe that would spell the end of the "European agenda," thefull financial integration of most of Western Europe.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Index of Tardy Economic IndicatorsPity the Conference Board.  No sooner had the nonprofit business-researchorganization won approval to take over production of the U.S.  CommerceDepartment's Business Cycle Indicators program, which includes the widelyfollowed Index of Leading Economic Indicators, than the federal governmentshut down-not once, but twice.  Although the Conference Board now calculatesand disseminates the leading, coincident and lagging indicators indices, theraw economic data that comprise them still come from the feds."It's ironic," says Michael Boldin, the Conference Board senior economist incharge of the program.  "They properly decided to privatize in order toconcentrate on what they do well, and now they're not even able to work onthat."At the end of December, just a day before the leading economic indicatorsindex for November was to be released, the Conference Board still hadn't seenthe data for four of its 11 components.  The report on new factory orders anddurable goods shipments was stuck in limbo and likely to delay production ofthe index even longer.  Those figures hold considerable weight in the index,on which many analysts rely to gauge of where the economy is heading in thenext three to six months.Boldin points out that, in addition to the new orders data, economists aremost worried about whether the Commerce Department will be able to gather andrelease labor force figures.  They are also impatiently awaiting disclosure ofthe full methodology and details of the new chain-weighted method forcalculating gross domestic product, so they can revise their econometricmodels.  "I don't think anyone knows how to live in a world without thesethings," he says.For now, the Conference Board will continue to use the same calculations asthe government.  But it has assembled an advisory board to recommendrevisions.  "We will also be soliciting ideas and suggestions," Boldin says."I would like to make the index as simple and transparent in its calculationsas possible, so that economists can make better use of it."Starting in February, the organization will also assume responsibility forpublishing Commerce's Survey of Current Business, likely to be renamed theBusiness Cycle Indicator Report.  It will include all of the data included inthe indices, plus explanations of any new additions or other issues in whichreaders may be interested.That is, if it can get the government-supplied data it needs to fill the firstissue.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Growing GranniesEvery nine-year-old knows that grandparents are supposed to spoil kids rotten.But no one ever put a number on it until now.According to a recent study by Packaged Facts, a New York City-based researchfirm, annual spending by grandparents will rise to $25.6 billion by the year2000, up from an estimated $19.9 billion in 1995.  The company used reportsfrom other market research companies, including Roper Starch Worldwide, inpreparing its 100-page, $1,850 report, titled "Marketing to Grandparents."It projects the number of grandparents will swell to 62.8 million in 2000 from57.1 million today, rising at a rate of 95,000 a month.  About 67% of allAmericans age 45 and older have grandchildren.The report states that most "mature" Americans feel 10 to 15 years youngerthan their actual age, but that many marketers persist in portraying them as10 to 15 years older.  "In the past, grandparents have been stereotyped asfrail and feeble, but because of lifestyle trends, grandparents are perceivingthemselves as younger and having a more active lifestyle," says David Lummis,project manager for the marketing report.  "I think the portrayals we see inadvertising are getting younger.  And the range of products and services aimedat grandparents is widening."One of the fastest-growing areas is travel, with such companies as Club Med,Hilton and Westin Hotels pitching packages to active grandparents who take thekids along.  He expects that over the next several years, travel will commanda greater share of grandparents' spending at the expense of such traditionalcategories as toys and food.Noting that three of the four major television networks (counting Fox) stilldevote themselves to courting younger viewers, Mr.  Lummis thinks that asadvertisers and programmers recognize the growth and spending power of theolder population, the inequality will begin to dissipate.  "Money talks, andonce advertisers realize they can make money talking to an older audience,they'll pursue them," he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Hispanic ZIP Code UpdateHispanic market research firm Geoscape International, of Boca Raton, Florida,just released Base Hispanic U.S.A., a new database tool for penetrating theburgeoning Spanish-speaking consumer market.  Available in diskette, CD-ROMand printed formats, it updates the 1990 census block-area data, providing acurrent look at the country's commercial and residential Hispanicneighborhoods by ZIP code.It provides country of origin, age, sex, income and educational attainmentinformation.  Besides 1995 demographics, it forecasts population for the year2000."The 1990 census data is now six years old," says Geoscape president CesarMelgoza.  "Six years is a long time in the Hispanic community.  As a group,Hispanics move more often than the rest of the population and have a greatdeal of mobility within cities.  This is because many Hispanics are immigrantsand are unlikely to own their own homes.  They tend to rent, and renters movemore often than owners."The database contains direct marketing tools-including current nationwidelists of 7.7 million consumers and 4.5 million households-for businesses thatwish to tap the U.S.  Hispanic market through the mail.  It also providesnames and addresses of grocery stores, shopping centers and other businessesthat cater to this segment.Geoscape also breaks the market into media regions for radio, television orprint advertising.  According to Melgoza, 70% of Hispanics listen toSpanish-language radio, and television broadcasting in Spanish, includingcable programming, is growing fast.Geoscape is aiming the product at both U.S.  and Latin American companies."Because of the devaluation of the peso, Mexican companies in particular areconcentrating on exporting goods now," Melgoza says.  "The cheapest thing forthem to do is to find Mexican immigrants in the U.S.  because these consumersalready are familiar with Mexican goods."Pointing out that the the Hispanic market is made up of myriad subsegments ofpeople from divergent backgrounds and countries, Melgoza adds, "Thetraditional way of looking at these markets at a gross level is problematic.Marketers today must take into consideration the trading area for theirproduct or service and then look at candidate areas where the conditionexists.  Under that scenario, there will be many additional 'micro markets.'"A version for Atlas GIS for Windows encompassing the full U.S.  Hispanicmarket is available for $9,995.  Pieces of the database may be purchased forsmaller sums.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996King of the Conceptual RoadWhen is a truck not a truck?  When it's still a concept.Once you see it, it's hard to forget Volvo's new Environmental Concept Truck,a pale blue one-of-a-kind vehicle with a bubble-shaped, traffic-stoppingdesign.  Its round-cornered contours are so striking that the ECT, as Volvoexecutives like to call it, could have been built solely for visual effect.However, the vehicle's primary purpose is to stimulate research on how tobuild safe, low-environmental-impact delivery trucks for city streets.  Thetruck is the end-product of an 18-month research project at Volvo's Goteburg,Sweden, headquarters.  It was created not for sale, but as a laboratoryexperiment in no-emission technology."ECT is not a commercial venture," says Karl-Erling Trogen, president of VolvoTruck Corp.  Instead, he says, the vehicle "demonstrates solutions that cancreate a new foundation for the development of tomorrow's trucks andtransportation infrastructure."At this stage, though, the ECT has significant unsolved structural problemsand is not yet ready for the world's highways.  For instance, its ethanolfueled and two-ton electric battery-powered engine may be ecologicallycorrect, but the battery runs down every 15 to 25 miles.  Volvo engineers arehunting for ways to enable the batteries to function for longer stretches.Volvo unveiled the ECT in Goteburg in September to members of the truckingpress.  In November the vehicle arrived in the U.S.  and was displayed tojournalists, fleet owners and lawmakers in three cities.  "We wanted buyers oftrucks and legislators to start looking at how trucks could be designeddifferently in the future to meet new emissions laws," explains Phil Ramba, asenior public relations specialist at Volvo-GM Heavy Truck Corp.  inGreensboro, North Carolina.In the U.S.  there is a movement toward tougher auto emissions regulations.The ECT was designed in part to capitalize on the trend, which Volvo'sforecasters expect to spread throughout the world.  In California a new lawmandates that after 1998 at least 2% of vehicles sold in the state mustfeature zero-emission technology.  On the East Coast, the Ozone TransportRegion, which consists of 13 states from Virginia to Maine, recentlypetitioned the federal Environmental Protection Agency for stricter emissionstandards for cars and trucks weighing up to 8,500 pounds.Volvo designed the ECT to emit little pollution when running on ethanol and tomeet urban zero-emission standards when running on the battery alone.  Whilethe market for delivery trucks that require a battery charge every 15 miles ispretty slim, Volvo executives expect to incorporate pieces of the ECT intofuture designs.Carol Birkland, a senior technology editor at the trucking magazine FleetEquipment, inspected the ECT at the Goteburg debut.  She gives high marks toits safety and visibility features, which include huge, round front windowsand a very low height of nine feet.  "The wrap-around windshields give thedriver incredible visibility," she says.In place of rear mirrors, the truck has remote video cameras installed in theback.  The driver monitors the view from the cameras on a screen.  The lowheight and round edges of the vehicle promote safety by minimizing collisiondamage.The ECT's most impressive feature is probably its unique steering system.  Thetruck's front and rear wheels can turn in opposing directions, giving itunusually good maneuverability-but only at speeds under 20 miles per hour,when the feature is most useful.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996New Databases to Map on ExcelAiming at small businesses, Claritas Inc.  has released seven inexpensivedatabases for use with Microsoft Excel's new DataMap feature.

The aim of the project is to installartificial intelligence into everyday inanimate objects, such as door knobs,furniture, glasses and shoes."A computer in a shoe?," he asked the crowd."Actually, it's not such a crazy idea," he continued.  "As I understand it,you power the computer with every step you take, and when you shake hands withsomeone who's also wearing a shoe computer, you establish a low-voltageelectrical connection and instantly exchange information through thehandshake-sort of a 'personal area network.'""What happens is you download to your shoe the person's title, what he does,where he works, phone and fax numbers-maybe a digital photo or a video clip.""If you think that's nutty, think about it tonight before you hit the sack.Try to remember the names and faces and affiliations of all the people youmeet today.  Empty your pockets of all the business cards you've collected.Then look at your shoes.  Not such a wacky thought, after all.""So," he concluded, "in terms of raw technology, our industry's future isextraordinary.  There's no letup in sight."Will Big Blue be the first out with a prototype?

A premature leak of the agency's numbers might allowa smart speculator to corner the market on, say, sugar beets.  Multinationalagribusiness corporations, commodity trading firms, farmers' cooperatives andacademics all engage continuously in their own analyses of crop and livestockmarkets.But none can match the resources of the vaunted USDA, which employs 1,000full-time and 2,000 part-time staffers to visit farms and inspect ripeningcrops each month to gauge the health of the agricultural economy.  In theweeks before the November report was issued, the agency interviewed some19,000 farmers and conducted tests of 2,000 corn fields and another 1,500cotton fields.The tests are only a part of the process.  The USDA has a vast array ofsatellite photographs-so detailed that they can distinguish one farm from thenext-to help judge the volume of planted acreage.  Increasingly sophisticatedcomputer models crunch the numbers, as well as weather predictions from theNational Weather Service, to yield an impressively wrought report that tracksin excruciating detail everything from the Texas grapefruit and Florida orangecrops to peanuts grown in Georgia and rice in Louisiana.  The department alsohas information officers in every overseas embassy collecting estimates offoreign production, critical data in forecasting import and export patternsand price movements.Given that sales of crops and livestock in the United States amounted to $188billion in 1993 (the latest complete figures available), with farm assetsnearing $900 billion, the stakes are high.  According to the American FarmBureau, 3.5 million people work on farms in the U.S., about 2% of the adultpopulation.  The trade group estimates that through its ripple effect on suchbusinesses as supermarkets, restaurants, equipment manufacturers and financialservices firms, agriculture affects roughly 20% of the nation's generaleconomy.Still, the USDA's forecasting capabilities are necessarily limited.Predicting crop production is a maddening exercise, given to constant shiftsand revisions as weather patterns evolve, insects eat away at otherwisehealthy fields and orders for exports suddenly evaporate when a bumper harvestmaterializes on some foreign shore.  An economist tracking employment, factoryutilization and consumer confidence can forecast a coming recession with someassurance.  But farm forecasting is a tenuous process, subject toserendipitous change with every passing storm cloud."It's a very difficult business," concedes Frederick Vogel, director of theestimates division of NASS.  "Agriculture is seasonal; you only grow it once,with no second chances to start over.  It's not like a factory assembly linewhere you can slow down production for a time and then make it up later onwith overtime.  The weather can cause huge swings in production-from a bigcrop to a major failure-in a very short period of time."Adds Gary Benjamin, a vice president and economic advisor who specializes inagriculture with the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago, "Computers have given usbetter modeling and analytical capabilities.  But it seems that many of thebig surprises in the farm sector, particularly weather and export demand, arehard to anticipate.  I'm not sure we're forecasting agriculture any bettertoday than we did years ago, although I'd like to think we are."Counting CornThe 1995 season was one of the toughest for forecasters to gauge in years.Heavy spring rains across the cornbelt forced many farmers to plant theircrops very late, well into June.  Then came one of the hottest summers onrecord, an infestation of the corn borer pest along a wide swath of theMidwest and an unprecedented early frost in late September.  In June the USDAwas cautiously predicting that the U.S.  would harvest 7.8 billion bushels ofcorn and 2.24 billion bushels of soybeans, but by November the estimates hadfallen to 7.37 billion bushels of corn and 2.18 billion bushels of soybeans.The corn estimate was 27% below the record harvest of 10.1 billion bushels in1994.  (Last year's actual harvest figures will be released early this year.)The inhospitable growing conditions and unexpected import orders from Chinaset off a storm in futures trading.  By November corn was priced above $3.30 abushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, up 20% since mid-August, and it neared$3.60 just before Christmas.  Overall, prices were the highest since thedrought year of 1988.The experts breathlessly track these shifts day-by-day, with speculatorsmaking their fortunes by anticipating correctly the next announcement, eitherfrom the USDA, the government of China or the National Weather Service.Farmers who don't want to wait for the once-a-month USDA estimates subscribeto an array of newsletters that put their own spin on interim conditions.Then, too, they're talking to university extension services, grain elevatormanagers and neighbors down at the feed store or the local cafe.For them, the forecasts are crucial:  the farmer who sells his corn crop earlyin the harvest at, say, $3 a bushel could be missing out on a price of $3.50or $3.75 if he gambles and stores it until the market improves.  Thousands ofdollars in income is at stake.  Multiply that by thousands of farmers and thestakes rise exponentially.Crop forecasting is an art as well as a science.  Dan Basse, market researchdirector of the Chicago-based forecasting firm AgResource Corp., also owns a600-acre farm in Wisconsin.  "Forecasting requires a lot of judgment.  Youalmost have to have grown up in the fields and know all the things that canaffect crops-from insects to the Russians buying on international markets-tobe able to make good decisions," Basse says."The average farmer's psyche is difficult to understand.  What price does hewant for his sow?  Will he sell it this year for slaughter or keep it forbreeding next year?  These are not easy questions to resolve."The government tries to orchestrate crop production and inventories with itsset-aside and other subsidy programs, but most observers believe that suchgovernment supports will be curtailed in the face of the budgetary cutbackmood in Congress.  In the aftermath of huge harvests last year, the USDAoffered to pay farmers this year to set aside 10% of their croplands in thecorn belt.  But in the wake of the poor harvest this year, the U.S.  will havethe thinnest so-called carryover stocks of corn and soybeans in more than twodecades."The set-aside is not an effective tool anymore.  Government policies areoften wrong," argues William L.  Roberts, an independent economist whopublishes the newsletter Agri-Business Perspective from Sioux Falls, SouthDakota.  "With more free trade of grains today and the opening of EasternEuropean economies, the U.S.  can no longer dominate pricing the way it did inthe 1960s and 1970s."When the USDA surveys corn crops, it targets uniformly sized plots and thenmeasures stalks per row, ears per stalk and then kernels per ear.  Privateforecasters even go a step further and measure the depth of each kernel.Still more precision is possible on many farms now.  The latest combinesactually process wheat and soybeans as the crops are being harvested and weighthem at the same time, Then they calculate the yield per acre by employingGlobal Positioning System techniques to bounce signals off satellites anddetermine exact land mass.Computers, of course, have further enhanced the process of estimation.  RobertWisner, a grain marketing economist at Iowa State University, recalls, "When Icame here 28 years ago it would take a half day to generate a relativelysimple chart.  Today I whip the same chart out in four minutes."Wisner keeps a database of crop conditions and production stretching back fordecades, he adds, and can search out historical analogs to match nearly anyrecent set of circumstances.  Late planting with summer heat and early frost?A search by the computer will find that conditions were similar in, say, 1974,and will recall crop yields that year."Another big thing that's changed is the way information is disseminatedtoday," says William Uhrig, an agricultural economist at Purdue University."It used to be that you'd wait to get the USDA's forecasts the next day out ofthe local newspaper.  Today farmers sitting in their offices at home pull thenumbers off the computer within minutes of their release."Long-Range Weather ReportsComputers and satellites are also making weather forecasting more precise.Paul Handler, president of Atlas Forecasts Inc.  in Urbana, Illinois, studiessunspots and wind currents, among other factors, in predicting weather out sixmonths and more.  His weekly newsletter correctly predicted in July theSeptember frost that hit much of the northern corn belt."Agriculture production in many places in the world is correlated to otherplaces in the world," Handler claims.  "When India has a good monsoon season,for instance, the U.S.  usually has a dry crop year."An elite corps of agriculture economists, toiling for organizations such asthe International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, D.C., hardlyconcern themselves with the day-to-day vagaries of weather and crop prices.They take a long view-the institute recently issued a forecast of agricultureto the year 2020 worldwide-and worry over the implications of such cosmicissues as global warming.Such forecasting may be even more difficult than predicting next month'srainfall in Iowa.  In the 1960s, for instance, many self-styled futuristspointed at rising populations and predicted the world would run short of foodby the 1990s.  The subsequent Green Revolution that boosted crop yields helpedavert that disaster; the more populous world is being fed better today thanever before.Long-range forecasting contains more enigmas than ever before.  As in anyfield, not just agriculture, the more variables come into play, the lessreliable the prediction.  Add to that unforeseen advances in technology andthe future becomes even harder to call.Genetically engineered strains of corn and soybeans in research laboratoriespromise to make crops invulnerable to insects and heat someday.  Farmers nowyielding 130 bushels of corn an acre may get 300 bushels or more in the age ofbiotechnology."Advances in genetic development might allow us to leapfrog beyond anythingwe've seen before," says Terry Francl, a senior economist with the AmericanFarm Bureau in Park Ridge, Illinois.  "But there's no way to be sure.  Youcan't predict where something like biotechnology will take you."H.

Spanning the Columbia River, the Tri-Cities-with a 1994population of 169,900-are the hub of economic activity in the southeasternpart of the state.Tri-Cities is the transportation and processing center for rich agriculturallands in both Oregon and Washington.  The Columbia River bisects the area,providing a wealth of recreational activities and supporting a shippingindustry.  Wheat and other agricultural commodities are transported downriverto the Pacific Ocean and industrial goods come upriver to markets in theinland region of Washington and nearby states.This area is home to the Hanford Reservation, a nuclear material productionfacility from World War II through the 1980s.  It now houses major researchfacilities, radioactive and hazardous waste cleanup programs and Washington'sone operating nuclear power reactor.The Hanford hazardous waste cleanup program is a 30-year, $50 billion to $70billion operation funded by the U.S.  Department of Energy and carried out bylocal contractors.  The sheer size of the program provides significantopportunities for waste technology companies.  A substantial environmentaltechnology industry has grown up in this area as a consequence.  Nearly 15,000people are employed on the Hanford Reservation by government agencies andcontractors.  Led by the three major contractors on the reservation -Westinghouse Hanford, Battelle Northwest and ICF Kaiser Hanford-many otherfirms have located nearby to supply specialized technologies, to commercializetechnologies developed on the reservation, as well as to market thesetechnologies and services to other nuclear industry sites around the world.The Tri-Cities are at the heart of a vast agricultural area that produceswheat, apples, wine and juice grapes, corn and other commodities.  Some ofthese commodities are barged down the Columbia River for offshore shipment,making the ports in these cities important points for loading barges.  Otheragricultural products, such as frozen vegetables and wine, are processedbefore shipment to markets.  Food processors located in the area include LambWeston, Simplot and Seneca Foods.  Wineries located nearby are St.  Michelleand Columbia Crest.In 1994, the trade and services sectors comprised 62% of total nonagriculturalemployment in the Tri-Cities.  The counties had a labor force of 96,700 as ofmid-1995 and an unemployment rate of 6.4%.  By the end of 1995, employment atthe Hanford Reservation had been reduced by 4,400 to about 14,660.  Many ofthe reductions came in the form of early retirement.  To the extent that theseretirees stay in the area, the economic impact of the reduction will bemitigated.  Current expectations are that the bulk of the layoffs arecomplete, but future budget years may bring additional challenges for thecleanup program, its work force and contractors.To cope with these challenges, the Tri-Cities Industrial Council, along withcity and port economic development organizations, have created a marketinggroup based on agribusiness, technology transfer and commercialization, andwestern Washington businesses looking to expand or relocate.  Because of theinvestment in office space, telecommunications infrastructure andtransportation systems to support the Hanford cleanup, the area has manyamenities to offer companies.  The agribusiness and technology efforts havebeen quite successful, with new food processing plants and several newtechnology firms announcing expansions during 1995.The cleanup program and the growing agribusiness complex created a veryhealthy real estate market in the Tri-Cities in the early 1990s.  Residentialbuilding permits soared and substantial retail development occurred with chainstores, such as Target, Eagle and Costco establishing outlets in Tri-Citiesmalls.  But with job losses in 1995 came weakness in the real estate market.The guardedly optimistic outlook for the Tri-Cities is contingent on relativestability at Hanford.  If federal budgets force further major layoffs,economic diversification efforts will face a difficult challenge, and thelocal area will face higher unemployment and reduced construction.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Rural Renewal:  Umatilla County, OregonLocated about 150 miles east of Portland, Umatilla County has much of itsnorthern border along the Columbia River and its southern border in the BlueMountains.  Transportation linkages are one of the county's major advantages.Two major interstate highways intersect there, and it is on the Union PacificRailroad's main line between the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest.The county population held essentially stable between 1980 and 1990,increasing only 0.7% over the decade.  But between the 1990 census and July 1,1994, the population increased by 8%, slightly below the state-wide gain of8.4%.  More than half the population growth was due to net in-migration overthe period as the economic fortunes of the county improved.  By 1994, countypopulation reached 64,000, with the largest communities being Pendleton(population 15,715), Hermiston (10,330), Milton-Freewater (5,865) and Umatilla(3,115).Umatilla County has what for Oregon is a unique mix of employers that includesan army depot, a state prison, a major food processing/agricultural complexand forest products firms.  The county ranked third in the state in sales fromfarms and ranches in 1994 at $212.2 million, primarily from grain, potatoes,peas, beans and cattle.  Food processing makes up the largest piece of thecounty's manufacturing sector, accounting for 2,920 of 4,940 manufacturingjobs in the county in 1994.  The forest products industry has outperformed thestate's, with employment reaching 980 in 1994.Three government installations are part of the county's employment base.Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution is a medium-security facility that had375 Corrections Department employees and housed 1,534 inmates in mid-1995.Blue Mountain Community College-offering basic skills programs, specializedtraining for employers, including an industrial maintenance program for thefood processing industry, and college courses for transfer-is located inPendleton, with facilities in Milton-Freewater and Hermiston.  And the20,000-acre Umatilla Army Depot, constructed in 1941, is a munitions storagefacility that straddles Umatilla and Morrow counties.During 1996, plans call for the construction of an incinerator that will beused to destroy munitions stored at the army depot.  It is expected to takethree-and-a-half years to build the incinerator, one-and-a-half years to testit, and another three and-a-half years to destroy the munitions.  The facilityis scheduled to close in 2003.The Pendleton Round Up, one of the nation's premier rodeos, draws thousands tothe county each September.  The area also offers the amenities of the ColumbiaRiver and the Blue Mountains.  In 1995, the Wildhorse Gaming Resort opened.This permanent 40,000-square-foot casino, located seven miles east ofPendleton on the Umatilla Indian Reservation, opened in March and employed 265people by mid-summer.  A 100-room motel opened in December.Employment in Umatilla County has increased each year since 1987.  Annualaverage wage and salary employment increased 17% to 23,130 in 1994 from 19,770in 1987.  The broad-based gains in the period came from expansion inmanufacturing, trade, services, government and construction.Such growth is likely to continue.  Wal-Mart has announced plans to build adistribution center in Hermiston in 1997, capitalizing on the county's easyaccess to highways for distribution.  One combustion gas turbine generatingplant is under construction and two others are being considered.Umatilla County mirrors the pattern of many nonmetropolitan countiesnationwide, with flat (or declining) activity during the 1980s changing tostronger population and employment growth during the 1990s.  And the impetusbehind that growth is hardly unique to Umatilla.  Food processing has expandedwith export opportunities and increased demands for convenience.  The prisonrepresents stable employment in a growth industry and the Indian gamingfacility is another growth activity that is changing parts of rural America.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Growing and Declining IndustriesBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) predictions of employment growth by industryfollow a pattern of more jobs in services and fewer in manufacturing, themodel that has dominated the U.S.  economy since the 1970s.  The bureauforecasts that the number of U.S.  jobs will rise from 121.1 million today to147.5 million in 2005.  (Given that it also predicts a maximum of 156 millionavailable workers, this could mean that there won't be employment for as manyas 8.5 million unsuccessful seekers, or an unemployment rate of about 6%.)  Afull 25.1 million of the 26.4 million new positions that will be createdbetween now and 2005 will be nonfarm salaried jobs, the agency says.The service-producing sector-which is wide enough to include such diverselines of work as engineer, lawyer, real estate agent, shoe clerk, teacher,software writer, mechanic, fast food seller, clerical aide and maitre d'-willaccount for 24 million of the new jobs.  Within this broadly-defined category,7.1 million of the new jobs will be added in health services or businessservices, 4.4 million in retail trade, 3.4 million in government, and 1.4million in finance, insurance and real estate.BLS says the service-producing sector's share of nonfarm jobs rose from 70.4%in 1979 to 78.6% in 1992.  In 2005, the bureau predicts, services will accountfor an overwhelming 82% of all U.S.  unemployment outside farming.Turning to the goods-producing sector, the agency projects that almost all thejob gains-1.2 million new positions-will be in construction.  Manufacturingoverall should shed more than half a million wage and salary jobs, fallingfrom the 1992 level of 18 million to the projected 2005 total of 17.5 million.In specific job categories, BLS sees increases in 2005 of 138% for home healthaides, 19% for janitors, 46% for restaurant cooks, 112% for computer engineersand scientists, 48% for psychologists, 57% for legal secretaries, 54% forpreschool teachers and 70% for correction officers.On the downside, the bureau foresees reductions in 2005 of 21% for farmers;29% for sewing machine operators; 32% for household servants; 11% ofelectrical and electronic parts workers and 51% for directory assistanceoperators.The bureau's projections for 2005 also indicate a continuation of the currenttrend toward leaner corporations with fewer middle management positions.  BLSpredicts the number of executive, administrative and managerial workers willincrease 3.1 million to a 26% share of all jobs.  Although a healthy increase,this is much slower than the 50% growth experienced by executives between 1979and 1992.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996The Work Force in 2005The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that in 2005, one in every threepeople over the age of 55 will be in the job pool.  The labor segment thatwill expand most rapidly in the coming decade is workers aged 45 to 64.  Thisage bracket, which currently comprises 31% of the labor force, will make up39% 10 years from now.  The percentage of workers aged 45 to 54 will increaseto 24% from today's level of 19%, while the segment aged 55 and older willrise to 15% from 12%.The bureau also predicts that by 2005, 62% of the work force will be made upof women and racial minorities.  The agency anticipates a total labor force in2005 of 147 million to 156 million people, consisting 52.3% of men and 47.7%of women.  The current breakdown is 54.5%, men, and 45.5%, women.  The gapbetween men's and women's shares of the job market has been narrowing sincethe 1950s, and the 2005 projection represents the most equal distribution ofthe work force by sex in history.In specific projections, BLS forecasts the proportion of whites in the jobpool will shrink from the current 78% to 73% in 2005.  About two-thirds of newentrants to the labor market over the next decade-or 33.4 million people-willbe whites, while about 22.4 million whites will exit the job force, leaving109.7 million whites in the job force.  While they will retain a clearmajority, their rate of expansion will be well beneath those of other races.As the percentage of white workers falls, Hispanics and Asians will enjoy veryhigh percentage increases of labor force entrants.  Hispanics, who today makeup 8% of the pool, will see their representation climb to 11% in 2005.Currently, there are 10.1 million Hispanics in the labor pool.  During thenext 10 years, 7.8 million more will enter and only 1.4 million will exit.These changes will boost the total of Hispanic workers in 2005 to 16.5million.Asians, who now comprise the smallest group, with just 4.3 million workers,will experience the largest gains of any racial group over the course of thenext 10 years.  Their ranks will increase by 81%, as 3.9 million join thelabor market.  Only about 746,000 Asian-American workers are expected to dieor retire during this time, so about 7.5 million will be eligible to work in2005.  This will leave them with a 5% share of the total market.On the other hand, African-Americans will not experience a significantshrinkage or increase during this period.  Currently, they are the secondlargest work force segment, with 13.6 million workers, or a 10.8% share.  BLSpredicts the addition of 6 million new black workers and the exit of 3.1million.  These changes will raise the percentage of blacks in 2005 marginallyto 11%, giving them the same share as Hispanics.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996BOOKS ETC.:  Marketing Goes Beyond Fun And GamesThe Ultimate Guide to Sport Event Management & MarketingStedman Graham, Joe Jeff Goldblatt and Lisa DelpyIrwin Professional PublishingBurr Ridge, Illinois, $30.00Sports Marketing:  It's Not Just a Game AnymorePhil SchaafPrometheus BooksAmherst, New York, $25.95These two new books by marketing experts shriek out an undeniable truth:there's money, money and more money to be made in sports marketing, and eachyear the proceeds get heftier.Both books back up that central thesis with a plethora of anecdotesdistributed throughout the manuscripts.  In 1992, the Fox Network paid theunprecedented sum of $1.58 billion to the National Football League for anexclusive four-year broadcast arrangement.  The cost of a 30-second Superbowlcommercial rose from $850,000 in 1993, to $900,000 in 1994, to $1 million in1995.  In return for wearing its shoes at the Summer Olympics, the Germansportswear giant Adidas gave free samples to athletes in 1972, but bestowed upto $10,000 per participant for the same favor in 1976.  The list goes on andon and on.But while both works begin with the same set of inarguable facts, they proceedin different directions.The Ultimate Guide to Sport Event Management and Marketing is essentially ahow-to manual for people interested in entering the field, a textbook thatspells out how to rake in some of the lovely lucre.  It is pitched tomarketing professionals, as well as to college business professors who canincorporate it into courses.In fact, although one of its co-authors, Stedman Graham, is a professionalsports marketer, the other two co-authors, Joe Jeff Goldblatt and Lisa Delpy,teach sports and event marketing at George Washington University.  Some of thematerial has been pulled from their course work.Sports Marketing:  It's Not Just a Game Anymore, by Phil Schaaf, is lively andfull of interesting details, but it has a less consistent focus.  Schaaf doesa thorough job of documenting such modern phenomena as battles between citiesto sponsor ball teams and the debate central to the 1994 baseball strike overwhether players' salaries should be pegged to owners' profits.At times, Schaaf turns into a social critic and ruminates on whether allowingfinances to dominate the sports world is destructive to our society.  Yet atother points, he writes as if his primary concern is advising Fortune 500companies on how to get the most out of their sports advertising budgets,weighing such issues as whether celebrity endorsements or stadium advertisingbillboards offer the better deal.Sports Marketing 101The book by Graham, Goldblatt and Delpy is less intent on being all things toall readers.At the beginning of one chapter it quotes the legendary sportswriter RedSmith's succinct observation about the eternal primacy of athletics in humanlife:  "The Coliseum is the oldest building in Rome."  The Ultimate Guideoperates on the assumption that sports have always held a strong fascinationfor people and that each society will find its own way to capitalize on thatfact.Because it can be used as a college text, the Ultimate Guide is laid outsystematically and is full of pragmatic advice.  Each chapter covers an issueof concern to budding sports marketers, such as strategies for managing eventlogistics, techniques for reviewing contracts with sponsors and suppliers, andadvice for working with celebrity athletes.  The chapters all bear utilitariantitles like "Emerging Opportunities" and "Critical Planning to Master theGame," and they end with a series of questions designed to provoke furtherthought about the topics.The Ultimate Guide is full of helpful tips geared primarily to young adultsembarking on their career paths.  For instance, it recommends volunteering atmarathons to get a toehold in sports marketing, a break-in technique unlikelyto appeal to older aspirants or marketing professionals switching fields.It attempts to assure us that this strategy can pay ultimate dividends bypointing out that no less important a figure than Barnett Lipton-best knownfor arranging a display of 88 grand pianos during the half-time show at the1988 Superbowl-started his professional life as a humble volunteer.All this may sound a bit too didactic-to say nothing of juvenile-for readersalready established in the marketing field.  Fortunately, the book is writtenin a breezy and pleasant style, an attribute that should broaden its appealsomewhat.  Nonetheless, it is tailored to the needs of beginners, whoinevitably will make up the largest portion of its readership.A Fan's NotesOn the other hand, Schaaf, the director of San Francisco consulting firmPacific Sports Marketing, has written a book with something for everybody:marketers, athletes, labor negotiators, business analysts, fans and evenculture critics.  He does best, however, when he sticks to analyzing theintersection of sports events and product positioning.Consider the creative marketing campaigns for the PowerBar, which in Schaaf'sestimation amounts to a modern Mom-and-Pop success story.  Thecarbohydrate-rich snack, capable of providing vast surges of energy to fuelathletic feats, was concocted by former marathon running star Brian Maxwelland his wife Jennifer in their own kitchen.  Initially, the Maxwells promotedthe PowerBar by handing out samples at local sporting events.Over time this simple, cheap, no-tech method grew into sponsorshiparrangements with more than 4,000 sporting events, ranging from the big bucksNCAA college basketball playoffs to small-town charity auto racing events.The company, PowerFoods of Berkeley, California, even went on to devise itsown sporting events, such as the PowerBar Women's Challenge, an annualbicycling race in Idaho.The PowerBar case illustrates that cleverness and persistence can overcome theobstacle of under-capitalization.  This is the sort of moral that appeals toSchaaf, who never quite seems to make his peace with the money-drenched worldof modern sports.However, when Schaaf cares to, he can do a fine job of analyzing why sportingevents and big business are such a compelling match.For instance, he cites the sponsorship of the Arizona Fall Baseball League bySafeway Stores in 1994, and the role that basketball superstar Michael Jordanplayed in that alliance.  By selling game tickets in its supermarkets, Safewaywas able to lure new customers into its stores and increase sales in its coregrocery business.  At the same time, Schaaf tells us, the company increasedits visibility greatly by associating its name with Jordan's much-publicizedcrossover into baseball.Schaaf explains over and over again that the real value of sponsorships tocompanies is that associations with athletes and teams bring them closer tothe customers they covet.  It's no more complicated than that.  Being asuccessful sports marketer is just a question of finding ways to turn athleticaudiences into consumers of goods.  The challenges lie in creating newpromotional formats and in matching particular products to specific events.The author also excels at dissecting other oddities of the sports world, suchas the franchise system of team management and ownership.  In a chapter aboutlicensing sports merchandise, he quotes from an October 31, 1994 SportsIllustrated article:Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones has been complaining about NFL rules thatlimit each franchise to a 1/28th share of league licensing deals.  As Jonespointed out to the Washington Post last week, merchandise bearing the Cowboylogo generated 28 percent of all NFL Properties revenue in 1993.  Still, don'thold your breath waiting for the league's other twenty-seven owners to offerJones-or anyone else-a bigger slice of the pie.  Cleveland Browns owner ArtModell put it this way:  'We are twenty-eight fat-cat Republicans that sitaround the league meetings and vote Socialist.'Athletics are SecondarySchaaf goes on to note that this sort of memorabilia fuels a $4 billion-a-yearindustry that in most major sports is under the tight control of teamfranchise owners.  The owners' right to enter sponsorship arrangements withcorporations enhances the value of team ownership well beyond ticket sales andbroadcasting rights, and has spawned a considerableindustry-within-an-industry.  The author contends that sometimes the actualsports contests become secondary to the needs of these adjunct businesses andfranchise owners' profits.Obviously, that's one of the aspects of the contemporary sports business thattrouble Schaaf.  In the last two chapters of his book he clarifies hisconcerns.  For one thing, he worries that amidst all the hype, deal making andprofit taking, we have fallen into an approach to sports that is ritualized tothe point of boredom.  Schaaf seems to think that big business is in danger ofsqueezing the life out of sports.He quotes Chris Friden, a young and slightly irreverent sports journalist whobroadcasts on public access channels in the Bay Area, on the frustrations heencountered in trying to interview basketball's Dream Team II in Oakland in1994:Shaq [O'Neal] and Derrick Coleman were great, but the system around theplayers was uptight.  The system, not the players, is the barrier.  The systemcreates and illustrates the image.  There can be no deviation, no frivolity.It seems so ridiculous that they have a narrow definition of professional fromthe media's standpoint.  ...  It seems that the uncreative system we have isalmost unprofessional, because it does not develop the interview.  I mean, howmany times can you ask, 'How do you feel about the win?,' and fool the sportsfans out there like there's any emotion.In his final chapter, Schaaf gets to the point.  "The main issue in sports isgreed," he writes.  "Specifically, if greed will damage both the image ofcompetition, and the competition itself.  Major League Baseball generatesalmost $2 billion annually.  The owners and players cannot agree how to divideit."How is it that a man who makes his own (presumably rather pleasant) livelihoodas a sports marketer can be annoyed with the industry's mega-profits?In the last paragraph of the book, Schaaf notes critically that,when CBS purchased the television broadcast rights from Major League Baseballfor $1.06 billion, the owners did not take the extra revenue (profit) and turnit over to the consumers (fans) in the form of reduced ticket prices,concessions, etc.  They spent it on labor, the players.  More free agentsignings, higher salaries, and higher financial risks, which increases thecosts of event production and presentation.  Fans have to accept management'sdecisions.  Fans cannot ask for binding arbitration, or a new cost settlementon professional sports spectating.At last we learn who Schaaf really is.  At heart, he's not a businessman or asocial critic.  He's a fan, one who has written an entertaining book thatmanages to explain in detail how the sports business functions, all the whilesignaling his strong distaste at the industry's excesses.Leslie Wines is Forecast's senior writer.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996CONSUMERZ 'N THE 'HOODIF ONE ACCEPTS THE ADAGE THAT YOU are what you eat, then the United States isfull of ambulatory burritos, chicken salads and hamburgers, while Japanesefactories hum thanks to industrious slices of raw tuna.That's merely a fanciful illustration of the futility of trying to judgepeople by a single trait.  Not that we don't often tryto categorize individuals, using labels to describe ethnic background,economic status and political affiliations.  But since humans are the mostcomplex critters on earth, neither skin color nor the shoes upon a man's feettruly say much about character or behavior-unless you're sizing up a guywearing Birkenstocks.However, according to the developers of "lifestyle segmentation" systems,people do reveal nearly everything about themselves in a singular way.  Forwhile you may not be what you eat, you are indeed where you live.  And even ifresidence is not quite an ultimate destiny, geodemographics-with a littlepsychographic data added for spice-still speaks volumes about consumers in thehere and now.Since they first appeared in the 1970s, these systems have promised marketersa means to find and categorize clusters of consumers.In turn, this helps businesses to predict the wants, needs and spendingbehavior of each discreet group, and find out exactly where concentrations ofindividuals live.  Based heavily on U.S.  Census Bureau information, theclusters are usually comprised of people residing in neighborhoods, includingrural, urban, suburban and an ever-growing panoply of permutations.Indeed, where segmentation was once limited to a couple of dozen clustergroupings, some of the industry's firms have created nearly 100 distinctgroups and subgroups.  Several companies give clusters straightforward names,such as "Urban Professional Couples" and "Social Security Dependents."  Stillothers have turned geodemographics into a delightful-or borderline smarmy,depending on your taste-realm by using catchy terminology.  The "YoungLiterati," for instance, is a market that's obviously as different from "NormaRae-ville" as the "Family Scramble" is from "Executive Suites."All this makes sense, in that the cost of rent or mortgage payments in anygiven 'hood is a reasonably good indicator of income and spending power.Tenements and 3,500-square-foot homes are seldom found side-by-side.  Andsince the consumers in each cluster ostensibly have similar demographiccharacteristics, on the premise that people with like socioeconomicbackgrounds tend to congregate in proximity to each other, the consumers ineach neighborhood or segment should also have similar purchasing patterns.That is, if the Jones family at 22 Maple just bought a 1996 Ford Explorer, theodds are fairly high that just two doors down at 18 Maple, the keeping-upSmiths are lusting for a new Grand Cherokee.  Or so goes the basic thrust oflifestyle clusters."Of course, there's no such thing as a totally homogenous neighborhood,"concedes Michael Pugliese, the director of Consulting Services for StrategicMapping, Inc., a Santa Clara, California-based firm that's been in thelifestyle segmentation business since 1983.  "If you look at the smallestclusters that can be produced, a mere five to 15 households in a specificarea, you're going to find consumers who don't begin to fit the profile towhich the cluster has been assigned."A "Baby Boomers with Children" suburban household might well be flanked by"Thriving Immigrants" and an "Older Settled Married Couple."  Midlifeprofessionals in their peak earning years may well live among retirees whobought their homes 30 years ago.  Aside from Stepford, few neighborhoods arefull of clones."What any and all of the segmentation systems now on the market will do,including ours, is help increase your chances of reaching the customers you'reafter," explains Mike Mancini, the vice president of Marketing andCommunications of Claritas, an Arlington, Virginia-based segmentation firmthat with its PRIZM system has been an industry leader since 1971.  "Clustershave an above-average incidence of the people they describe.  Using themsimply increases the law of averages."That margin, adds Mancini, can produce a big payoff.  "For example, if yourcompany is planning to sell an upscale product nationally through direct mail,increasing your efficiency just a couple of points can be worth millions ofdollars.  Costs are reduced if you avoid sending mail to consumers unlikely tobuy what you're selling.  Sales go up if you reach the correct target."The Bon Marche chain of 41 department stores, for instance, has usedsegmenting to cut down its direct mail costs, and in the process has learnedmore about its customers.  Nearly a dozen times each year, the stores in thechain promote an event through direct mail, sending out some 750,000 pieces.Through the PRIZM system, Bon Marche found that most of the customers duringthose sales came from three clusters.With a cluster-coded map, the chain found a core group of 250,000 shoppers whopatronized the sales and lived close enough to the stores to respond to amailing within one day.  By mailing only to its best targets, the Bon Marchesent out only 500,000 pieces per promotion, saving mailing and distributioncosts of $1.5 million annually.  It also learned that 90% of its business camefrom 60% of the chain's customers, which allows it to focus its future mediaand mailers even more tightly.Going beyond the obvious direct-mail application, the use of clustersinfluences business decisions as varied as where to locate a particular retailstore in a given town, where in the nation a company will find the largestconcentrations of customers for a product, where to make the most effectiveadvertising media purchases, and how to calibrate the creative pitch behindthe product.  Hence some of the more colorful descriptive words for eachcluster."If you know where your potential customers are and have a picture of whatthey look like," says Pugliese, "segmentation can be of use for both strategicand tactical marketing."But while lifestyle segmentation has gained increasing recognition as apowerful marketing tool, it generates revenues of only about $100 million peryear for the industry's major players.  (Besides Claritas and StrategicMapping, the list of major players includes Equifax National Decision Systems,based in San Diego, and CACI Marketing Systems in Arlington, Virginia.  Othercompanies focus more narrowly on specific industries.)As these firms create ever-smaller clusters-where a couple dozen were a oncecommon breakdown, some companies now divide the U.S.  population into nearly100 distinct types-these systems gain some strengths, yet take on certainweaknesses.Using more segments allows businesses to target their markets more precisely.But the smaller the number of households in a sample, the less reliable theresults.  And working with scores of categories can get unmanageable, leadingsome companies to cluster their clusters into broader groups.Putting People in Their PlaceSegmentation has come a long way in this country since Jock Bickert, now chiefexecutive of Denver-based Looking Glass, Inc., developed his "LifestyleSelector" system and founded National Demographics & Lifestyle more than twodecades ago.  "As long as humans have been interested in explaining puzzlingevents, they have turned to typologies for answers," Bickert observes.Biologists use typologies in analyzing organisms, as do mental healthprofessionals to better understand and treat the human psyche.  And whilemarketers have long searched for typologies to understand "the oftenbewildering array of consumer behavior," Bickert adds, "the quest to decodeconsumers and predict their behavior continues."In the U.S., the quest commenced after the 1970 census.  But according to LynnWombold, CACI's technical director, the ACORN clustering system-it stands forA Classification of Residential Neighborhoods-her firm produces was first puttogether in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.  Prior to the 1970 U.S.  Census,she points out, the Census Bureau's computer tapes could be best described asuser-hostile.  "Twenty years ago, segmenting neighborhoods was impossible,"she says.  "While a variety of clustering techniques were available, the datawere not."Interest in small-area statistics prompted the bureau to eventually developways break its data into "block groups," which average about 350 to 400households.  Then came the "block-level" data, which encompass about 30households.  "But with each jump to a tighter focus, the bureau suppressessome of the data out of privacy concerns," says Pugliese.  "Block-level datacan't tell you as much about the people in them as you can get with blockgroups."In the early 1980s, when the United States Postal Service introduced 9-digitZIP codes-or the ZIP+4 system-marketers believed they'd found a way to targetclusters as small as five to 15 households.  Equifax's MicroVision system, forexample, reflects the postal system's more than 23 million ZIP+4 areas.Yet since ZIP+4 is essentially just a mail delivery system, segmented databases cannot rely only on Census Bureau information to get a reasonablyaccurate read on households in this particular kind of division.  SaysWombold:  "We must also use computerized files with information about consumerpreferences and spending, credit histories, and details from purchases,affiliations, product warranty cards and other data."Even then, there are questions about whether ZIP+4 clusters are simply toosmall to have any great meaning.  "One of the weaknesses with ZIP+4 is thatthere's just too much instability, when one or two households out of 15 canskew the cluster profile," says Pugliese, who before joining Strategic Mappingworked for one of its rivals."Say you also have credit data, and it shows one household buying a new car,and another spending almost nothing.  Well, the people in the second householdmay be saving for a European vacation.  And when they do take the trip andspend the cash, it again throws things off.  I think you need 30 or morehouseholds-at least the block group-to get reliable calculations, or to seesome statistical consistency in a neighborhood."Mining the DataOf the major lifestyle segmentation firms, all but newcomer Looking Glass havebuilt their fundamental systems on Census Bureau information.  (The Denverfirm's Cohorts II system is constructed on data from nearly 40 million productwarranty card questionnaires, from stereo systems to lawnmowers to homeappliances.)What's different about each system is its other sources of consumer data.  Allhave links to syndicated consumer panels.  But some have specialty ties todatabases from various industries.For example, Equifax's MicroVision has strong links to financial servicescompanies, packaged goods and the telecommunications industry, among others.The Claritas PRIZM and Strategic Mapping ClusterPLUS 2000 systems have hadsuccess in the advertising game.  All five, however, produce useful clustersand data, says James Mendelsohn, the manager of marketing research andinformation for Perdue Farms, Inc., which uses two rival systems.  "But thesegmentation company that any marketer might want to pick really comes down toits experience in your industry and how it fits with your particularenterprise."Like the kind of poultry various people prefer to eat, choosing a particularsystem is almost more a matter of preference than of identifying any intrinsicsuperiority.  In other words, they all taste like chicken.  But just asdrumsticks have a slightly different flavor than boneless breasts, each of thebig systems has its hallmarks.With more than 3,000 clients, Claritas is well known for its PRIZM system, andfor the novel names it assigns to 62 separate clusters, ranging from "BlueBlood Estates" owned by super-rich families, to the "Hard Scrabble" clustersof older families in poor, isolated areas.  Starting with 1990 censusblock-level data, PRIZM also develops statistics for finer, ZIP+4 analysis.According to Mancini, Claritas figures that several dozen demographicvariables in six broad categories explain much about the different types ofneighborhoods.  These include social rank, encompassing income, employment andeducation; household composition, given the age, sex, and family type of theresidents; mobility, which is the time of residence; ethnicity, from race toancestry and language; urbanization, or in turn, whether it's a town, suburbor rural area; and, finally, housing, which is the physical unit and itsvalue.To pull all this together, Claritas taps more than 500 million consumerbehavior records, including car registrations, credit histories, shoppingpatterns and psychographic studies.  It also updates its system annually, frommore than 1,600 sources of federal, state and local demographic data."Things in neighborhoods change, but not as fast as you might think," saysMancini.  "The same factors usually dictate who moves into a neighborhood.  Weroutinely look at things such as building permits.  But even gentrification ofa neighborhood happens over a period of five to 10 years."Like other segmentation companies, Claritas has found more and more targetgroups developing.  In the past 10 years, it has adjusted for the surge inimmigration from Latin America and Asia, creating a cluster called "LatinoAmerica," which includes largely foreign-born Latinos in young, blue-collarurban families.  In another cluster are concentrations of older and moreaffluent Asian and Latino immigrants, called the "American Dreams" segment.Also similar to its competitors, Claritas clusters its clusters.  "You want toprovide data without it confusing marketers who don't need to know everythingabout seven different clusters," Mancini explains.  For instance, one ofPRIZM'S natural groupings, the so-called "Affluentials," includes "YoungIntellectuals, New Empty Nests, Boomers & Babies, Suburban Sprawl andBlue-Chip Blues," the latter meaning upscale blue-collar families.The system can also be retooled to identify specific targets for an individualbusiness.  When Home Pro, an 800-store national home improvement chain, founditself facing stiff competition from the likes of Home Depot and othersuperstores, the company figured it had to remodel its image and find newcustomers.Known for its "no-frills-good-value" products, Home Pro identified five targetclusters within the PRIZM roster.  Calling it "This Old House-ers," the customsuper-cluster included the "Starter Families, Boomers & Babies, Upward Boundand Suburban Sprawl," the kind of folks who spend considerable time and moneyon home improvements.  Locating these budding Tim Taylors, Mancini says,enabled Home Pro to target its advertising and creative approach.Equally as venerable as PRIZM is Equifax's MicroVision segmentation system,which got its 1971 start as National Decision Systems.  It has nine majorgroups that include 50 clusters, with labels such as "Upper Crust,""Comfortable Times," "Metro Singles" and "Trying Rural Times."  It also has 95other subsegments that go down the ZIP+4 level."Like the other systems, we start with census data," says David Tedrow,product manager for MicroVision.  "At the block level, you can figure outwhich household is making $1 million annually, the ethnicity breakdown of theneighborhood, and the number of homes with two incomes or children.  But wealso get a tremendous amount of aggregate data from our parent company."Equifax, of course, is a huge repository of credit information.  (Because ofprivacy and legal concerns, says Tedrow, Equifax does not provide itssubsidiary with house-by-house data; ZIP+4 is as detailed as it can go.)  Thecompany also has alliances with at least 10 market research companies,including Footwear Market Insights, SRI International, the Electric PowerResearch Institute and Simmons Market Research Bureau.  "The data that goesinto our model," says Tedrow, "is always fresh."And MicroVision segments can all be wrapped in with a client's own data base."By appending the MicroVision code to their data, we can help clients in avariety of ways," Tedrow explains.  "Say a company wants to find a locationfor a new outlet or branch, which is important retailers and banks.  Bylooking at the clusters and knowing the customers you're after, it can helpyou pick the right intersection for a store."Still other customers can analyze large clusters while planning productintroductions or a major expansion.  Areas around Washington, D.C., to mentionone locale, include numerous clusters of affluent consumers.  But even forcustomers who want to identify all of those clusters, segmentation reportsaren't necessarily expensive."A small entrepreneur with a file of customers can get a cluster analysis fromus for about $90 per 1,000 names," says Tedrow.  "Of, if you want to look atLos Angeles and how many households might be your potential target, the costis about $100 per market area.  If you're opening a restaurant and want anidea of what kind of people in the area like ultra-premium hamburgers or amid-priced sandwich, those clusters can be found for about $500 per product.A small business can get a lot of information for $2,500."On the flip side, he adds, corporations that intend to advertise in largenewspapers or on television might spend as much as $50,000 to $100,000 onmarket segmentation.  "Telephone companies, utilities and insurance companieshave millions of customer records.  Their marketing campaigns are simply goingto be larger and more costly."While Equifax has seen the same changes as Claritas, it also has observeddifferent users of segmentation products.  "While it used to be that retailerssuch as Mervyn's and Nordstrom looked at who was buying what, we now seesuppliers, such as Levi's, also buying cluster analysis.  The suppliers arefinding the information useful when working with the retailers; it helps themhelp the stores market a different range of products."CACI Marketing Systems has produced U.S.  population segmentation clusterssince 1977.  It also sells forecasts of economic trends up to five years aheadin neighborhoods, and 20-year forecasts for counties and states.  Its ACORNsystem breaks up the U.S.  population into 40 different segments, with namesthat are a bit more clear than cute.  "Top One Percent" is self-evident, asare "Rural Resort Dwellers," "Military Proximity" and "Prairie Farmers."Proceed with CautionCACI's Lynn Wombold is not a fan of the ZIP+4 breakdowns.  "I simply don'tlike them," she explains.  "The census block level group is the smallest areaof good data."  She also maintains that summary statistics from creditbureaus-from bank cards to home mortgages, credit lines and auto loans-must beused carefully.  "Income is often a derived variable, and the source of ageand other demographic data is unknown."In combining census and non-census data that comes from multiple sources, "theanalyst must ensure the data are compatible with each other and are measuredin ways that do not result in undue bias."  ACORN thus makes heavy use ofconsumer surveys to verify and validate what's found in its segments.  As muchor more than any other segmentation company, CACI presents itself as a firmpopulated by rigorous statisticians and analysts.  "What distinguishes us inthe market," says Wombold, "is how much imagination goes into our products,and the continuous measurements we make to be sure that the data arereliable."As for changes, Wombold echoes Mike Mancini's point that "changes don't happenovernight.  Corn fields don't instantly turn into housing developments.  Butin the last ten years," she adds, "we identified one market that is nothingbut retirement communities.  And in the future, you might see a cluster of'Downsized Middle Managers.'"Strategic Mapping bills its ClusterPLUS 2000 segmentation system as a"micro-marketing" tool.  In addition to its 60 lifestyle segments-which go bystraightforward descriptions-SMI adds the concept of "urbanicity" to itscluster segmentation.  "Urbanicity is a neighborhood geographic measurecreated by SMI to indicate a geography's proximity to an urban center, as wellas population type, housing density, type and structure characteristics," saysSMI's Michael Pugliese."The degree of urbanicity affects consumer behavior," he continues.  "Forexample, someone making $40,000 per year in a small town can have the samespending power as someone living in a major metropolitan center and earning$100,000 per year.  Meanwhile, the goods and services that each of thempurchase can be vastly different.  So segmentation that simply lumpsdemographics together without accounting for urbanicity can miss the mark."Like its competitors, SMI also uses information from consumer data bases andresearch companies, including National Family Opinion, Nielsen Media Researchand the Arbitron Company, among others.  Pugliese also explains that, "We alsohave a close relationship with Dunn & Bradstreet, which has a file ofinformation on 86 million households."When it comes to looking at clusters, most clients find six to 12 that areimportant to their business.  "At the very least, most businesses will bemarketing to at least three clusters, and usually more," says Pugliese."But what I'm seeing that's new in our marketplace is the use of segmentationfor tactical purposes almost as much as for strategic concerns.  That is, apackaged good marketer will break down its targets on a store-by-store basis.The other innovation is using segmentation for business intelligence, toanalyze what the competition is doing.  If I'm going head-to-head with anotherfirm, I want to know where our clusters overlap, and where I might be able tograb business through the use of what we call 'Atomic Clusters' andmicro-marketing."What's in a Name?Unlike other lifestyle segmentation firms, Looking Glass doesn't rely on thecensus for its segmentation.  Its Cohorts II clusters are based on 65different personal activities and interests, in addition to detailed householddemographic data.  Looking Glass considers its clusters among the mostaccurate, since the information comes from consumers themselves.  The CohortsII groupings are built on 35 million product warranty cards.  "And we includea fresh 25 million each year," says Jo Moniak, chief marketing officer forLooking Glass.Out of that data comes 27 clusters.  But what's also different about CohortsII is that each of the clusters is described with a name that suggest apersonality, not just economic status."Victoria" is not just a cluster, but a woman with a median age of 44 andmedian income of $97,650.  She's a busy executive overwhelmed by emails and ademanding travel schedule.  "Cindy & Dmitry" have a median age of 38 and anincome of $44,922.  They've got one kid, Dmitry drinks beer, and the coupleworks on home improvement projects together.  The cluster known as "Elmer" isdescribed as having "sedentary men with fixed incomes and few interests beyondtheir grandchildren and gardens."So why the names?  "When we ran a distribution list of the names on thewarranty cards, we found that men named Elmer, Adolf, Otto and Chester wereindeed sedentary men," explains Moniak.  "'Bret & Tracy' turned up as olderGeneration Xers on the rise.  'Russ' is a well-off young executive."So if residence isn't destiny, then perhaps your first name guides youreconomic fate.No matter which system a company uses, the point is the same:  to know thecustomer better.  In an era when consumers are growing ever more picky,marketers must choose their targets carefully.James Mendelsohn of the Salisbury, Maryland-based Perdue Farms, firmlybelieves that, if you'll pardon the language, clusters can sell cluckers.  "Wedon't just sell chicken, but a variety of poultry products," he says.  "Anddifferent groups of consumers have clear taste preferences, be it for wholechickens, boneless breasts or even Cornish hens.  In the pure vanilla sense,we look at clusters and their known preferences:  the Hispanic andAfrican-American populations like the dark meat in chicken, which adds flavorto many recipes.  Other groups-say where they don't do much complex homecooking-prefer boneless breasts to whole chickens."But in a more applied sense, adds Mendelsohn, Perdue looks closely at theclusters near the grocery stores that Perdue supplies.  "We sell selections ofproducts to stores, including Perdue brand and private label poultry," heexplains.  "Those assortments are different from store to store.  But when weanalyze clusters, we might see opportunities to change the assortment thatstore managers might not notice.  Cornish hens are not a high penetrationitem, but in certain upscale areas they will sell to that segment ofconsumers.  But in areas where consumers are cost-conscious, whole birds undera private label might do better.  So this enables us to help the stores.  Thething is, there's not a lot of room for mistakes in the poultry business; iteither sells or smells."For all the work done in lifestyle segmentation, no cluster has yet been foundwith a preference for bad chicken.  But even if consumers aren't what theyeat, where they live still says much about what they're inclined to think, doand purchase.Jay Stuller is Forecast's national correspondent.

Every newsstand this fall trumpeted the fact that the leading edge ofthe Baby Boom is turning 50.That means that over the next 20 years we can expect to see increasing mediacoverage of the lives of older Americans, more products and services gearedtoward their needs and perhaps more three-dimensional portrayals of them inboth advertising and popular culture.As Leslie Wines points out in this issue's cover story, it also means thatbusiness must learn to cope with the realities of an aging work force.  We'relikely to see greater opportunity for skilled part-time jobs, increasedretraining for older employees and even an end to corporate staffing policiesthat encourage early retirement and favor younger workers in hiring.The graying of the labor pool isn't merely an outgrowth of the Baby Boom'sshear numbers, by the way.  Less generous pension pay outs, low savings ratesand the insecure future of the Social Security system will keep many BabyBoomers in the job market longer than their parents.  Lengthening life spansand the nation's shift to a service economy-affording more work to people withphysical limitations than strenuous manufacturing jobs do-also play a role.As the Boomers age, they will be more likely to experience mobility problems,hearing loss and sight impairment.  Yet many companies have only just begun tomake special efforts to reach and accommodate potential customers who havethese disabilities, writes Bob Cole in "Discovering the Disabled."  Given theBaby Boom's consumer activism and clout with marketers, the corporate worldshould catch on fast.Of course, predicting the future is easy.  Getting it right is another matter.This issue of Forecast inaugurates a reformulated column by Steve Schnaars onthe back page.  Called Future Imperfect, it explores historical visions of thefuture, some laughable now in hindsight, others startlingly prescient.We've also added a new column called Technical Support.

With a goal of full industrialization by theyear 2020, the government of this sourtheast Asian country is betting onbigger families to build a large consumer market and provide workers for aplanned heavy manufacturing sector in the coming century.Malaysia today has 19 million people.  Its population is predominantly Muslimand young; about 37% are under the age of 15.  The government, concerned abouta shortage of workers (particularly skilled ones), wants to boost thepopulation to 70 million by 2095.  In the meantime, officials encourageskilled foreign workers to take jobs there and provide inducements toMalaysians to pursue higher education.The Malaysian citizenry also is increasingly urban and Westernized, accordingto a recent issue of the newsletter Market:  Asia Pacific, published inIthaca, New York.  Supermarkets and convenience stores have made their debuts,and Western foods are popular.  The newsletter points out that Malaysiarepresents an untapped market for supermarket products that are acceptableunder halal, the Muslim standards of dietary hygiene.Whether full industrialization can be accomplished in the next 25 yearsremains to be seen.  However, there have been a number of positive economicsigns in recent years.  For instance, Malaysia's Ministry of Finance forecaststhe nation's gross national product per capita to rise to $4,335 this yearfrom $3,948 last year and $3,519 in 1994, a 12.3% increase.According to Global Trade Information Services, based in Columbia, SouthCarolina, Malaysia was the 17th largest importer of goods from the U.S.  inthe first nine months of 1995, when it bought $6.4 billion of our products, upfrom $5.1 billion and $4.3 billion in the same periods in 1994 and 1993.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996MODERN AGE HOME IMPROVEMENTHindsight may be 20/20, but foresight is far less reliable.  Some views of thefuture come through as if with telescopic vision, while others-sometimes fromthe same person-display a surprising degree of myopia.  That's because, nomatter how insightful, forecasts can't help but be shaped by the times thatproduce them.Take the Roaring Twenties, an era enchanted with all things industrial.  InAugust 1926, the prestigious magazine Nation's Business published an articleby Gerald Wendt, director of the Division of Industrial Research atPennsylvania State College, titled "The Synthetic House of Tomorrow."  Heobserved that while many industries had moved into the "iron age," housing wasstill stuck in the "stone age."Steel, which two decades earlier had begun to transform skylines by supportingskyscrapers, was rarely used in houses.  Brick, stone and wood were still moretypical.  That would change in the near future, Wendt said, forecasting theuse of steel framing and walls in residential construction.  "It is easy topredict that the next decade will see a similar complete revolution in ourhome-building," he wrote.  "Our present stone and wood construction, madeprehistoric almost overnight, will pass out swiftly as the carriage did."Flat steel roofs would allow for rooftop sun rooms.  "Modern medical researchhas demonstrated overwhelmingly the healthful action of sunlight," Wendtnoted, "and especially the extreme violet rays which our present glass windowsshut out."The inside of homes would also change radically.  Wallpaper, floors, woodworkand furniture would be made of plastics and resinoids, reducing fire hazardsand resisting stains.  Walls, draperies and just about every other interiorfeature would be easily washable with a wet sponge.  Rayon, a hot new fabric,would be found throughout the modern home.Lighting would be chemical, rather than electrical.  Walls would be paintedwith phosphorescent paints, gathering light during daylight hours and glowingbrightly during the night.  Color could be added.  Even the streets would becoated with luminescent materials, lighting the roadbed itself and thuseliminating street lamps.Overall, Wendt foresaw a fireproof, stainproof synthetic house of the futurewith a concrete foundation (he was right there), steel walls (wrong, unlessaluminum siding counts), rooftop solaria (almost anathema, given today's skincancer fears), synthetic stone floor bases (maybe, depending oninterpretation), rubber, leather or cellulose floor surfaces (not really),curtains made of rayon (not unheard of, but other fabrics are more common),and furniture of molded resinoids (wood and fabric are still more popular thanplastic).But while Wendt got many of the architectural and furnishing elements wrong,he did well when it came to electrical appliances.  He predicted that electricrefrigerators would make ice boxes obsolete and that each room in a housewould have an air conditioner.  He scored another hit by predicting that asingle thermostat would control both heating and cooling.  As the price ofpower declined, he said, housework would become easier as the motorized vacuumcleaner proliferated.Wendt did best of all, however, when it came to communications.Radios-novelty items at the time-would become commonplace.  He foresaw "thetransmissions of moving pictures on the air" and confidently predicted:  "Thenwe shall have movies in every home."  More prescient yet was his predictionthat live events would be beamed directly into homes.  Today we call ittelevision.Wendt went even further by predicting that by the end of the decade (that is,by 1930), "the next war will be seen and heard around the world at the momentit is taking place."  It took much longer than he expected, but anyone whowatched the Persian Gulf war will affirm the accuracy of that forecast.Wendt's final prediction was a real long shot.  He believed that "the house ofthe future will have a movie room, or better still, a news-room, where by theturn of a dial, we shall be able to tune in and look in on Los Angeles, Miami,London, the North Pole or the ringside.  It will be the center of the house,like the old Roman Atrium.  It will be a triumph of science."In 1926, that was only a dream.  Ultimately, of course, it became a reality.Steven P.  Schnaars is a professor of marketing and chairman of the marketingdepartment at Baruch College, City University of New York.His book Megamistakes (Free Press, 1989) evaluates the accuracy oftechnological forecasts.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Mapping Review:  Is Mapping Going Mainstream?Product:  DataMap:  An add-on module included with Excel 7.0 and MicrosoftOffice for Windows 95.Rating:  (Out of four stars)Features:  *Ease of Use:  ***Value:  (DataMap is essentially free.)Technical Support:  1/2Documentation:  1/2Data Included with Product:  **Overall:  H 1/2Windows Version:  Free with Microsoft Office for Windows 95 and Excel 7.0.Requires Windows 95 or Windows NT.

It's reasonably easyto learn and use, but that's in part because it doesn't do much.  However,there are relatively inexpensive add-on packages available that substantiallyexpand the product's functionality.Cons:  Limited functionality, although sitting on top of Excel, many featuresgermane to stand-alone software can be performed or emulated.  Nearlynonexistent documentation.  No tutorial.  Questionable Microsoft commitment toDataMap success, as quoted in this review.  No one seems to know if or when aMacintosh version for Excel will become available.WHEN WE BEGAN RESEARCHING OUR BOOK Market Mapping in 1991, it was difficult toconceive of mapping technology evolving into a mainstream analysis tool.  Theproducts of the early 1990s were a either high-power, high-cost, hard-to-usetools designed for engineers and scientists or what we call "presentationmapping software."  These lesser products were capable of producing colorfulmaps but unable to import outside data or analyze problems.Commitment to the more powerful PC-based products of the era was a majorcorporate investment.  It meant a big bill for the initial purchase andmaintenance, and hopping a plane for factory training.  Once trained, usersthen hunkered down at a PC, manual in hand, and attempted to exploit theirnewly acquired expertise.  The interfaces were as daunting as a CAD program.Astronomical data prices also made the software that much harder to justify.Today, mapping is easier, less expensive, and more accessible.  Even Excel 7.0includes a simple mapping engine-DataMap-designed for Microsoft by industryleader, MapInfo.  Selecting correctly formatted data cells within Excel andclicking the "globe button" builds a simple map using basic globalcartography.It's breathtaking (well, almost) to realize that mapping technology has madethe transition from a niche technology for highly skilled analysts tosomething that anyone can run with Windows 95, Excel 7.0 and a well-endowedpersonal computer.  But it's disappointing to see what an anemic offeringDataMap really is.  It's really little more than a charting alternative to thepie charts, bar displays and grids included with previous releases of Excel.What Can You Use It For?Looking at it from the perspective of a mapping product, DataMap is a handyadd-on for some users because it's free.  With simple geocoding, existingExcel spreadsheets can be used to build maps without leaving the MicrosoftOffice environment.  The attribute and cartographic data that comes with itcan be used to explore the United States (at the state level) and foreigncountries to identify new markets for expansion.  Most users, however, willneed to study markets in more detail than it allows, so add-on packages arerequired for deeper analysis.The interface is simple enough, and there's a choice of several styles of datarepresentation, including dot density, graduated symbols, shading and piecharts.  Beyond these capabilities, few options exist; although, in fairness,the power of Excel stands behind DataMap, and some functions that might behandled in a stand-alone mapping product can be accomplished within the mightyExcel.There is some data provided with the product.  We'll save you a call totechnical support or search through Online Help and tell you to open the fileMAPSTATS.XLS to get at the included attribute data.  If your hard drive is C:,you can find it in:  C:\PROGRAM FILES\COMMON FILES\ MICROSOFT SHARED\DATAMAP\DATA\MAPSTATS.XLS.With DataMap, you receive basic demographic data for the countries of theworld.  For the United States, you also get population data by age, race andethnic group, zip centroids and a few other goodies.  Zip centroids appear inthe features dialog.  Initially we were excited that we could use such data inthis "free" product, but we found the function grayed out.  (After goingthrough a number of steps, we finally gained access to the centroids.)  Statedata and county boundaries are included, but no city-level data could belocated.Something for Nothing?DataMap is free.  So, is it true that you get what you pay for?  Well, maybe.For the cost (and problems) of upgrading to Windows 95 and purchasing orupgrading Microsoft Office, you get a bare-bones mapping package of limitedcapabilities.  Another potential problem is that Microsoft has provided almostno documentation with DataMap.  It's fortunate that the product doesn't domuch, because you'll have to figure it out for yourself.A more serious problem is Microsoft's commitment to mapping technology withinExcel.  As you can see from the following snippet of conversation with anExcel support technician, we ran head-on into this problem:Bakers:  "This product doesn't seem to do very much."Excel support technician:  "This really is a demo version of Info Map's [sic]software."Bakers:  "Can we upgrade to a full version of MapInfo?"Technician:  "No, not that I know of.  I suggest you call the Info Map [sic]people."As it turned out, the technician had very little information on the DataMapmodule, and must have lacked even basic training on this product.  Calls totwo other techs revealed a pattern:  there was little knowledge of DataMap,and both techs verified that the only supplemental documentation consisted ofan "app note" available from Microsoft (which neither could locate to send tous).  One acknowledged that the department wasn't up to speed on DataMap, "butthey hoped to be soon."  We hope this isn't a demonstration of Microsoft'sactual commitment to DataMap and mapping technology in general.Should You Upgrade to Use DataMap?The writing is on the wall:  most users, especially in corporate environments,will at some time make the transition to Windows 95 or a subsequent version ofit.  While it may not be this month, or in some operations, any time soon, itwill happen eventually.  For users of existing PCs, Windows 95 requiresexpensive RAM upgrades, plus the purchase of a Windows 95 license and anupgrade to the newest version of Microsoft Office.  This upgrade will not comecheap, not because Windows 95 or the Office upgrade are expensive, but becausethe RAM upgrade may cost anywhere from a couple of hundred dollars to as muchas $1,000, depending on how much memory is currently installed and whetherthese chips can be reused or must be replaced.  (Users of older PCs may need awhole new workstation for Windows 95, because the upgrade cost is impracticalor the machine too slow.)Most novice mappers would be better off with a program such as Scan/US ($495with an extensive collection of data), with its tight links to Excel, or theeasy-to-use EasyStreet with its new $495 price tag.The underlying question is:  should you spend the time and money to upgrade totake advantage of Excel's DataMap if you wouldn't have done it anyway to takeadvantage of Windows 95?  For now, we would have to say "no."But the news about DataMap isn't all bad.  Read on about third-party add-onsfor the product that make it almost cool.Company:  Microsoft, Inc.Address::  One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052Phone:  (206) 882-8080Fax:  (206) 936-7329Internet:  http://www.microsoft.comADD-ON BUILDING BLOCKS FOR DATAMAPDataMap may well fail to impress with its limited features, nearly nonexistentdocumentation and finite cartographic and attribute data.  But two add-onproducts for DataMap are worth your consideration.  Among a flurry ofannouncements, two software add-ons-both on CD-ROM-augment the restrictedpower of DataMap and convert it from a product barely suitable for basicdemographic studies to one of at least some power and influence.While neither product adds operational features to the DataMap software, bothcontribute a mix of attribute and cartographic data that is the basis of aneffective mapping package.  Both are priced under $100, so they're affordableadditions for most Excel users and in line cost-wise with the rest of themapping market.  (If you had to spend $400 to reach the power of a $150stand-alone product, then these additions wouldn't make sense.)Still, serious market mappers will want a full mapping package, as no numberof add-ons to DataMap will address the limited functionality of the underlyingengine.  But for novice mappers looking for something, well, almost fornothing, these packages transform something of limited capability into aworking, albeit unconvincing, mapping environment.Product:  Maps, Data, and Mapplets:  Add-on modules for DataMapFeatures:  ***Ease of Use:  ***Value:  ***Documentation:  *Technical Support:  ****Data Included with Product:  ***Overall:  ***Windows Version:  $99 for the complete set on CD-ROM.

(See the requirements for DataMap above.)Pros:  For $99, you can transform the bare bones DataMap into a useful mappingenvironment and get five useful mapping applications.  Includes two tutorialsfor DataMap, and more.Cons:  No paper-based manual.DEVELOPED BY MAPINFO, THE SAME PEOple who built DataMap for Microsoft Excel,the complete Maps, Data and Mapplets collection fills in some of the potholeson the way to successful mapping inside Excel.  First, and possibly foremost,is the incorporation of two tutorials-Mastering DataMap and Great Map!-thathelp bring users up to speed on the basic use of DataMap.  (We wonder whysomething like this wasn't included with the Microsoft release.)In addition, three small Excel/DataMap-based applications add demographicanalysis, territory management and what MapInfo calls "market performance"abilities to DataMap.  Additional data sets include the "must have" U.S.county and five-digit zip code boundaries along with additional demographicdata also by county on businesses, consumers and industry.  Demographic andattribute data include income, home values, job classifications, health careanalysis for locating and operating care facilities, retail trends and a lotmore.The most interesting Mapplet is "Marketing Savvy," in which users can "pin"their marketing activities to a map within Excel and study the results to seewhich plans work and which require retooling of some sort.  This is a toolthat makes regional analysis of sales and market penetration a snap.  Is thebillboard campaign working in the tri-state area?  How does it compare withtelemarketing efforts in the surrounding region?For $99 plus the cost of the Windows 95 upgrades described in the review ofDataMap, this is a useful and appropriately priced package.

Clumsy install procedure for thecartographic data courtesy of Excel.SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THAN MAPINFO'S entry, Maps, Data & Mapplets, Maps and Datafrom MaconUSA consists of a collection of maps and well, data.  But while thissounds mundane, the product adds substantial power to the otherwise anemicDataMap.  As with MapInfo's add-on Mapplets, no new functionality is appendedto the Excel mapping engine, but the presence of better cartography and aricher data set allows real mapping within Excel.We tested the product by loading zip codes for California-a two-step process.First, outside of Excel, the cartography must be selected and a multi-stepinstall procedure followed.  Then, inside Excel, the data must be selected andthe map built by clicking on Excel's new globe icon.  If more than one map canbe used with the data selected, you are given a choice of maps inside a dialogbox.Once loaded, and after a brief wait, we had a map of California zip codes, butlittle else.  Calling the company, because we couldn't find it documentedanywhere, we asked how to load a second set of data so that we could mappopulation density by zip code.  The support engineer said he would check andcall us back in five minutes.Lo and behold, the phone rang about seven minutes later.  The procedure issimple:  load the first set of data and then the second set within the samespreadsheet.  Then, in the now larger spreadsheet document, select the data touse and wait for your map to appear!The "mini-manual" contains three example applications that will get you atleast partially up to speed.  The product ran without problems.Excel users will have no difficulty relating to the Maps and Data paradigm,although due to the design of DataMap for Excel, it's a little different inoperation than standalone mapping products.

It is:  http://www.cts.com/ends/We regret the error.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996DISCOVERING THE DISABLEDA FEW YEARS BACK, MERRILL LYNCH & Co.'s senior management received a proposalfrom one of the technical analysts on its market analysis team.  The idea hadnothing to do with business cycles or market timing.  Instead, the analyst,Christopher D.  Sullivan, pointed out that people who are deaf or hard ofhearing could have money to invest.  But many won't invest if they can'tcommunicate directly with their financial advisers; and investment firms don'ttypically market their services to this 10 million-plus sector of thepopulation.  Indeed, at the time, not one major Wall Street firm offeredspecial services to investors with hearing impairments.So Merrill introduced a Deaf/Hard of Hearing Investor Services program, withMr.  Sullivan at the helm.  That was back in 1989.Today, the company conducts investment seminars using sign language for peoplewith hearing disabilities, has five financial consultants-Merrill's term forbrokers-who are deaf andhas trained 1,200 other consultants on the use of telephone relay services,which enable them to converse with people who can't hear voices over a phone.The results?  "All told, more than 700 of our consultants have clients with aserious hearing loss.  More important, we have more than half a milliondollars in assets under management for this population group," says Mr.Sullivan, who has been deaf since the age of two.In addition, Merrill Lynch is planning a pilot program that will use Brailleand large print to communicate with people who are visually impaired.Merrill Lynch is one of a plethora of corporations to discover that cateringto the more than 40 million Americans with some disability means more thanjust doing good-it's smart business.For one thing, the size of the population considered disabled is huge, nomatter what system of measure you use.  According to projections based on aU.S.  Census Bureau household survey taken in 1991 and 1992, nearly 49 millionpeople have some kind of disability, defined very broadly to encompasseveryone from the 1.5 million people who use wheelchairs to the more than 17million people who have trouble climbing stairs without resting.  That amountsto almost one out of every five people in the United States.  "When you throwin relatives and caregivers, you're at or above 30% of the population,"asserts Cyndi Jones, publisher of Mainstream, a San Diego-based publicationthat describes itself as the "magazine of the able disabled."Of course, the numbers presented by advocates for the disabled tend to look atthe market in the broadest possible terms.  Using the Census Bureau'sdefinitions, a little fewer than half of the people with disabilities -24million-have severe impairments.According to the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, thepopulation includes an estimated 22 million people with hearing impairments, 2million of whom are deaf, 1.2 million with partial or complete paralysis, 9.2million with such developmental disabilities as cerebral palsy and mentalretardation, 120,000 who are totally blind and another 60,000 who are legallyblind.The U.S.  Census Bureau calculates that this sleeping giant of a consumermarket-even though many, if not most, of its members are underemployed orunemployed-had total annual discretionary income of $188 billion at the end of1992.Loss of vision, hearing and mobility skills commonly comes with age.  So,because of increasing life spans and the aging of the Baby Boom generation,this market will undoubtedly grow over the coming decades.Yet, while the desire and ability to spot and penetrate new markets, alongwith a sense of social responsibility, has sparked some of the businessinterest in people with disabilities, many experts in the field insist thatthe prime mover now is the Americans with Disabilities Act.The 1990 federal law attempts to bring the disabled into the economicmainstream by barring discrimination against people with physical or mentalhandicaps in either employment or the delivery of services.  Like otherminority groups that have benefited from government prodding, many people withdisabilities view the legislation as a positive step in their efforts to gainjobs and to receive the products and services that non-disabled consumers takefor granted.The law's work is far from done.  Five years after President Bush signed theADA into law, declaring, "Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally cometumbling down," the National Council on the Disabled rhetorically asked in areport to the President and Congress, "In 1995, can people with disabilitiesfinally have the same expectations as other people in their community-to live,work, travel, communicate to, and generally feel comfortable in theircommunities?"The answer is:  Not yet.Changing from the InsideStill, positive assessments of the ADA are moving many companies fromunawareness and inactivity to concern and action.The most obvious changes have come in the form of renovating business premisesto accommodate people who are blind or in wheelchairs; some of thoseadaptations began long before the ADA was signed.  All the marketing andadvertising in the world won't help if potential customers don't have accessto a company's products and services.For example, NationsBank Corp., KeyCorp and countless other depositoryinstitutions have installed automated teller machines with Braille keys andlower-set ATMs and teller windows for people in wheelchairs.  Many banks alsoteach sign language to branch personnel, install teletypwriter (TTY) machinesin branches, print checks and account statements in Braille and hire outsideconsultants to assess how user-friendly their facilities are for people withdisabilities.The travel industry, too, has begun to make changes.  In the early 1990s, forexample, Embassy Suites Hotels, Inc., focused on accessability.  Tinybathrooms, an absence of railings and narrow doorways all combined to makeaccommodations less than accommodating to guests in wheelchairs.  Managementalso worried about the responsiveness of hotel staff.So the company sought outside assistance from Opening Doors, a Woodford,Virginia-based consulting firm that helps employees become comfortablewith-and thus better at-dealing with customers and co-workers who havehearing, vision or mobility impairments.As a result of the changes it made, Embassy Suites has seen an average annualincrease of 23,000 room bookings for people with mobility impairments and $13million in gross revenues from guests who are disabled.Other efforts long predate the legislation or go far beyond the requirementsof the law.  Among the corporations getting good marks from advocacy groupsfor reaching out to and accommodating people who are disabled are MerrillLynch, AT&T Corp., General Motors Corp., McDonald's Corp., Prudential Co.  ofAmerica, Marriott Co., Toys 'R' Us, Inc.  and NationsBank.  Their activities,many of which date back a number of years, are generating follow-the-leaderresponses elsewhere in the business world.For example, besides taking an acive role in the passage of the ADA,McDonald's introduced Braille menus back in 1979.  It was one of the firstcompanies to use people who are disabled in advertisements and has sinceproduced a television commercial in sign language.  "It was the right thing todo," says spokeswoman Malesia Webb-Dunn.  "It also makes good marketing senseto have all of our customers enjoy their meals at McDonald's."Similarly, in response to questions from parents, relatives and friends ofchildren with disabilities, more than a year ago Toys 'R' Us created a productbrochure titled "Toy Guide for Differently Abled Kids."  Available from thecompany upon request, the current version describes 117 toys appropriate forchildren with a wide range of disabilities, promising to help them developauditory, language, visual, tactile, gross and fine motor, social, creativeand cognitive skills, as well as the often elusive self-esteem."This isn't a marketing vehicle; it's a response to customers who soughtadvice in purchasing toys for children with different abilities," says JeanneMcIntosh, product manager.  While the company does not track toy salesgenerated by the booklet, she adds that letters and comments by consumers whohave used it warrant its continued publication.Detroit's Big Three auto makers have also gotten into the act.  General Motorsprovides customers with up to $1,000 in reimbursement for mobility adaptationcosts and vehicle "alerting devices" for drivers with hearing losses.  Some24,000 GM customers have received reimbursements since the program startedthree years ago.  The company also provides information on area mobilityinstallers and wheelchair-compatible GM vehicles."We've always been a leader in crash protection.  This is a crash avoidanceprogram for a very important market segment," says Dean Rotondo, a spokesmanfor the company's North American operations.But even among the recognized leaders, efforts to reach out to people withdisabilities is still fairly limited.  The "differently abled" toy cataloguecan't be found at every Toys 'R' Us store, for example.  And GM is only justexploring the development of a flashing light alarm to alert hearing-impaireddrivers who are deaf if they've left the key in the ignition or if anothervehicle is honking at them.(For one consumer's frustrations with the travel industry, see the sidebar onpage 38.)This Year's ModelsSpurred by pioneers such as McDonald's, AT&T, Nordstrom, Marshall's and LeviStrauss & Co., scores of businesses are targeting ads at people withdisabilities and using them as models.  "We still have a way to go, but we'reseeing more handicapped individuals in advertisements than ever before," saysElaine Brodey, executive administrator in charge of affirmative action for theScreen Actors Guild.Advertisers are also taking steps consumers without disabilities may nevernotice.  For fees of approximately $300, the Vienna, Virginia-based NationalCaptioning Institute, Inc., that creates closed captions for televisionprograms and commercials, enabling viewers who can't hear to read the text assubtitles with the help of an electronic device attached to the TV or acomputer chip built into the set.  The not-for-profit NCI, the largest ofseveral such firms, has captioned more than 20,000 spots for more than 400advertisers since it first developed closed captioning in 1980, with usagegrowing swiftly in the past few years.  The reason:  the huge growth in theaudience using closed-caption reading devices, since Congress mandated theirplacement in all TVs with 13-inch or larger screens built after 1993.In addition, NCI's market research indicates that 66% of closed captionviewers are more likely to buy products advertised with captions.Advocacy and service groups encourage the advertising trend through adcompetitions.  For instance, the National Easter Seal Society gives out annualawards called EDIs, for "equality, dignity and independence," to mediacampaigns that further the understanding of disability issues.  Thesix-year-old program gave out more than 40 EDIs this year in categoriescovering journalism, advertising and television programming.ITT Hartford Life Insurance Companies-one of the 1995 winners, with six awardsin such categories as print advertising, broadcast journalism and televisionprogramming-aims its broadly based marketing campaign not directly at peoplewith disabilities but at corporations that buy disability insurance for theiremployees.Using sports as a unifying theme, the company created a three-pronged approachthat focuses on disabled athletes.  It encompasses advertising in trade andgeneral-interest business magazines, producing such TV programs as "TakingCharge:  Empowering People with Disabilities" on public television and "ITTHartford's Break Away," the first show devoted to athletic events for peoplewith disabilities, on the all-sports cable channel ESPN.The company also sponsors national athletic events for people withdisabilities, such as a recent ski weekend in Aspen that drew 400participants, and a wilderness adventure in Maine for its insurance claimants."Our big selling point," says spokesman Jack Hayward, "is in getting ourclients' employees back to work."As an insurance company, ITT Hartford had long been involved with this market.But as at Merrill Lynch, where Mr.  Sullivan's own experience informed thecompany's response, the impetus behind ITT Hartford's focus on empowermentcame from an employee who is an athlete with a disability himself.  That's avery typical route to change within corporations:  often the personspearheading efforts to expand products and services to the disabled market isa manager who has a disability or has a relative with one.If the Carrot Doesn't WorkMany of the business efforts on behalf of people with disabilities, however,clearly come in response to the ADA.Despite angry rhetoric from some businesses about the "prohibitive cost" ofcompliance, more than half of the accommodations for people with disabilitieshave cost between $1 and $500, according to the Job Accommodation Network ofthe President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities.  Another17% of them cost nothing.But defending a lawsuit brought under the act can be much more expensive."There still is a lot of discrimination out there," observes Scott Wolfington,associate publisher of Ability, a magazine dealing with disability issues,published in Irvine, California.  "This has to spur lawsuits."Indeed, it already has.  "We've seen an increase in the number of ADA-relatedlawsuits over the past year," says Andrea de Gorgey of the New York law firm,Hughes Hubbard & Reed.  "This trend should continue, especially since the'undue hardship' defense is being viewed with increasing skepticism."Adds Cyndi Jones of Mainstream, "The business community better wake up.  Ithad a grace period from 1990 to 1995 and many people who are disabled are atthe end of their patience.  They feel businesses that ignore their needs aresaying people with disabilities have no usefulness.  This angers activists whoview lawsuits as their only recourse."Not everyone agrees that suits play a big role in compliance, however.  In aJune 7, 1995 speech to the Association for Persons in Supported Employment,former PCEPD Chairman Justin Dart called fears of more litigation a "myth inthe media.""As of January 1, 1995," Mr.  Dart noted, "there had been roughly 600 privateand public lawsuits-affecting about one-hundredth of 1% of the entitiescovered by the law."Says John Lancaster, executive director of the PCEPD, "I really don't see achange one way or another in the number of lawsuits.  People with disabilitiesare becoming increasingly proactive, but their energies are more likely toconcentrate on lobbying, not suing, businesses."Lawsuits more often focus on employment than on accommodation.  And becausethe definition of disability keeps broadening, fights over who should becovered by the ADA break out not just between courtroom adversaries but amongdifferent factions within the disabled community, as well.Still, most observers agree, the threat of litigation remains and activistsare more than willing to raise that specter at the same time that they promotebetter routes to encouraging compliance with the ADA.Chief among the better routes is education.  "I really think 90% of theproblem is awareness and attitude," says Joel Ziev, executive director of theNew York Society for the Deaf.  "For example, the hotel industry genuinelywanted to help, but many managers simply didn't know how."  Today, he adds,the industry is definitely more disabled-friendly than it was five years ago.Lancaster cites two examples of how dialogue, rather than litigation, made forpositive before-and-after scenarios.  "A dentist in my hometown of Potsdam,New York, was moving his office from a wheelchair accessible building to arenovated private home, the entrances to which were by steps.  He was unawareof ADA requirements, but once I explained how inexpensive it would be toconstruct a ramp, he happily agreed to do so."The second situation was somewhat more confrontational.  "A new restaurant wasopening in Potsdam and the owner didn't want to spend money to make itaccessible to people with mobility impairments.  I told him I'd never dinethere and that the loss of business from me and people who shared my viewswould, in two years time, exceed the cost of the necessary repairs."The repairs began shortly thereafter.The Road AheadProgress notwithstanding, some advocates for people with disabilities say thatfragmentation within their communities is delaying the total elimination ofbarriers."There are too many examples of people with disabilities not banding together.We're almost at the point where amputees above the knee don't deal withamputees below the knee, while similar differences crop up within othergroups," says Angela Miele Melledy, publisher of Able, a monthly newspaper forthe disabled, published in Old Bethpage, New York.In addition, some people with disabilities don't want to be singled out.Mel and Enid Zuckerman, co-owners of Canyon Ranch, one of the world'stop-rated health spas, wanted to build a resort for people with disabilitiesthis year but couldn't find an enthusiastic customer base."The interest wasn't there," Mel Zuckerman says.  "Most groups don't want tobe isolated; they'd prefer to mix with others if they went to a health andfitness resort.  All we could do is design more rooms for people with mobilityproblems, and make sure we have TTYs, captioned televisions and light alarmsfor guests with hearing problems.""One solution," says Jim Weisman, general counsel for Eastern ParalyzedVeterans, "is to band together.  Too many organizations focus only on onedisability."He notes that the American Association of People with Disabilities was formedthis year "and is striving to be the AARP of the disabled community.  If itsucceeds, it could become a very effective spokesorganization."In the meantime, it and other groups work both separately and collectively topromote understanding and further accommodation.The ingredients are certainly in place for both.  They include a healthy angeron the part of people with disabilities and their families, a watchfulgovernment, fear of lawsuts, awareness that people with disabilities are alsoconsumers with disposable income, noticeable room for improvement and sheermomentum.Five years ago, companies that went out of their way to market to people withdisabilities stood out, winning new business and plaudits.  Five years fromnow-and perhaps even sooner-companies that don't court this growing populationwill be the ones that stand out.Robert S.  Cole is a public relations professional who has a hearing-impaireddaughter.  He has worked for a number of organizations serving the deaf,including the Deafness Research Council, where he was director of development.Portrait of Disabled AmericaBased a survey of 30,000 households bewteen in late 1991 and early 1992, theU.S.  Census Bureau estimates that 48.9 million people, more than 19% of thepopulation, have a disability, defined as having difficulty performing atleast one daily living activity or socially defined role or task.

He interviewed his daughter abouther frustrations as a frequent business traveler.Debra Cole-who recently served as head of the recruitment office for theuniversity from which she graduated in 1992-had a delightful three yearstraveling around North America heralding the strengths of her alma mater.Well, almost delightful.Unlike most travelers, she had the hardest time getting a hotel room in whichshe could make phone calls.  Or enjoy television.  Or know that she would bealerted if a fire broke out.  Despite assurances from reservation clerks thatshe would have these basic comforts, she often entered a hotel lobby withstomach pains, afraid those assurances would be worthless.Ms.  Cole is deaf.  In order to use a phone, she needs a teletypewriter (TTY)machine, also known as a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD).  Tohave words accompany the images she sees on TV, she needs a closed-captioningdevice that flashes dialogue across the bottom of the screen.  And to bealerted to an emergency, she needs flashing lights, not a beeping alarm.According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, hotels and motels must havethese devices readily available.  But Ms.  Cole has found that many do not.Or they do have them, but hotel personnel are:  a) unaware of the fact, b)don't know where the devices are, c) don't know how to install them, or d)don't want to be bothered."Deaf people have a better chance of getting the services they need atexpensive hotels," Ms.  Cole notes, "but Gallaudet University," her alma materand the nation's only liberal arts college for people who are deaf, "has alimited budget."Of budget and moderate motels and hotels-those charging between $30 and $75night-Ms.  Cole rates Holiday Inn the best and Super Six the worst she hasencountered in terms of providing the necessary equipment."But even when hotels have a TDD, closed-captioning device and flashing alarm,it is still a battle," she says.  "I've often had to write an angry note todesk clerks asking that they let me look in the office so I could find theequipment for them.

Alexa Cate of TDM Marketing Associates Ltdexplains how they managed to please -- but notconfuse -- everyone.Back in 1994 when NORWEB Communications came into theworld it had all the right ingredients for success.Its parent company had a strong brand name which thetarget audience already associated with quality andgood service; it had a state of the arttelecommunications network using the very latestdigital technology and it was in the process ofrecruiting a top team from the telecommunicationsindustry to handle its sales and marketing. Some may say that this would be apushover for the PRagency... NORWEB Communications is a public telecommunicationsnetwork operator in the north west of England, whichwas granted a Public Telecommunications Operator's(PTO) licence in April 1994 and launched services a year later following a period of network expansionand staff recruitment. NORWEB's network stretchesfrom Macclesfield in the south to Carlisle in thenorth and from the Lancashire and Cumbria coastacross to the Pennines. The company targets thebusiness sector, offering a range of voice and datatelecommunications services such as ISDN, facilitiesmanagement, card services, leased circuits and LAN toLAN interconnect as well as plain old telephony.Apart fro m facilities management and the value addedservices which are available nationwide, most ofNORWEB Communications' services are targeted only atnorth west based companies. The company thereforeprefers not to encourage demand from outside thenorth west as it is only in a position to offerservice on its own network in the NORWEB area.  TDM was officially appointed in March 1994 to handlePR and provide marketing consultancy as required. Ourkey objectives were to establish NORWEBCommunications as a major network operator on thenorth west of England, to increase awareness ofNORWEB amongst the north west business community, tolaunch NORWEB's portfolio of products and servicesand to position NORWEB as the preferredtelecommunications supplier for north westbusinesses. Our brief was, and still is, to complement othermarketing activities such as direct mail andadvertising in local and regional business press. Wealso work closely with NORWEB plc's corporate affairsdepartment as they need to be kept fully briefed onour activities. Although our main area of activitywas to be PR with local, regional and trade/technicalpress and event management we have found ourselvesgetting involved with all manner of projects fromroadside workers' luminous jackets through toclothing for a clay pigeon shooter! Whatever the project however, we soon learned theNORWEB rule of "No purchase order number, no pay" andthat on average it takes three weeks for a purchaseorder to be processed! On the PR front, the local and regional press werealready familiar with NORWEB plc -- their localelectricity company. They were however less familiarwith the technicalities of telecommunications and thechallenge for TDM was how to interest them in the new services on offer from NORWEB Communicationswithout turning them off with telecommunicationsjargon. The importance of this was amply demonstratedat the official launch of NORWEB Communications whichwe organised in June 1994. There was a press briefingin the morning attended by a mix of technical andregional business press. Some of the NORWEB spokespeople had a tendency to usejargon, (especially when under the hot glare of mediaflashguns) and in no time the regional pressjournalists were asking questions like "So whatexactly is a 2Mb link?"In the first few months after the official launch wedidn't need to worry too much about bamboozlingjournalists with techno jargon -- the challenge was alittle different. NORWEB Communications had not yetlaunched their core telephony services and we had togenerate press coverage with stories about the manynew staff appointments and not so many existingcustomers for whom NORWEB already provided specialisttelecommunications services. After the tenth newappointment announcement the regional business presswas probably wondering where it would all end. Once the services were launched we had a lot more toshout about and the press began to call more upon ourspokespeople for comment and interviews. We decidedit was time for some media training so we hired awell known freelance telecommunications journalist togive them a going over and she certainly proved valuefor money. They came out of it a bit battered aroundthe edges but ready to face anything the press couldthrow at them. The next milestone was arranged around the officiallaunch of NORWEB Communications' new services. It wasdecided to hold a three day Communications Expo atG-MEX Manchester for north west businesses. Whilstthe event was an overwhelming success (over 500businesses attended) we vowed never again to trustNORWEB when they said they had "cleaned" theirdatabase of invited guests -- just how did that manfrom Cable NorthWest get in the door? Our most recent launch has been the Nexus Centre --also at G-MEX -- this is a showcase of NORWEBCommunications' services which businesses can visitto see the services in action and talk to theexperts. We had a few experts on hand at the launchto give talks on various new telecommunicationstechnologies, once again supposedly in layman's termsbut I did hear the odd "155Mbit/s" and "packetswitching" being bandied about. Next time I thinkwe'll lay on an interpreter to translate for thosepeople who can't resist using jargon no matter howmuch you ask them not to. So what does the future hold? As you're probablyaware NORWEB has recently been taken over by NorthWest Water and many of the recent press enquirieshave been about the takeover. For once ourspokespeople had no excuse for talking intelecommunications riddles - all they were allowed tosay was "No comment!"Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH-TECH MARKETING via NewsNetJANUARY 1996-PUSHING THE BOAT OUTHIGH-TECH MARKETING-PUSHING THE BOAT OUTCOPYRIGHT 1995-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTDVNU BUSINESS PUBLICATIONS has launched a 26-issuepartwork home computer guide called Easy PC andlaunched a major GBP1.6m nationwide advertisingcampaign.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH-TECH MARKETING via NewsNetJANUARY 1996-ON THE PITCHHIGH-TECH MARKETING-ON THE PITCHCOPYRIGHT 1995-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTDOn The Pitch is compiled from a number of sources.Confirmation of activity should be sought before anyprofessional time is spent pursuing such activities.Argyll Public Relations has been appointed by BTRIEVETECHNOLOGIES INC to handle UK public relations andinfromation office services.CHEMFREE CORP has appointed Baron, McDonald & Wellsto handle its US PR and marketing for promoting itsnon-hazardous parts cleaning system.

HTM has examined theChristmas cards which came into M2 Communicationsalong with comments from many other journalists andPR folk in the field to present the (subjective) best-- and worst -- of the bunch.A lot of companies copped out and used charity cardswith the usually-well printed company name in thecentre trick -- so these are mainly excluded from thejudging but DPA/Flying Pig deserves a mention as theydesigned a card for the Bramley Area Bosnia Appealwith another local firm for subsequent resale: a neatmove.A special mention mist go to Fox Parrack Fox who usedChristmas to announce a new office move -- 1 3/4miles as the sleigh fiies -- and to prove thisrecipients could move Santa and watch his progressthroughout London. Johnson King also derserves creditfor the simple card of a man reading a newspaperwhile it is snowing with the caption  Snow coverageagain' -- well done!The COULD IT BACKFIRE? award goes to MERCURY ONE-2-ONE, a PCN operator, for its card headed "SilentNight..."The DIFFERENT INNIT award is split to Unipalm Pipexfor its Christmas baubles in the form of thecompany's logo, a logo for a major product and aworld map -- presumably showing its Internetaspirations; The MOST COMPANY MENTIONS ON A CHRISTMAS CARD awardgoes to Digital Music Express who had the largecorporate X, DMX emlaxoned in the middle, DMX'severywhere looking like snow and in case you missedit  The Ultimate Music expreience' strapline sittingunder yet another company logo. DMX also squeezed ina mention on the inside and back covers too! Sentinel Business Services Group tried to get intothe action by a rather ostentatious, tacky cardlisting all of the firm's services beneath two logos;Mathieu Thomas/Herald Communication's card hadletters spelling the different companies falling fromthe sky, jumbled up as snow and Quarterdeck Corp madedo with a snow seen and its very large Quarterdeck Qlogo taking up all of the space on the 8x10" card.The TACKY CARD award went to Bite Communications withits Reservoir Dogs-type card with various persons inblack and white wearing a superimposed red santa hatand dark glasses headed: "Are you going to bark allday, little doggie..." before the inside captionreads "...or are you going to Bite (with the firm'slogo). This was closely followed by Apple Computerfor its multi-part gee-whizz-sicko American familyChristmas image card showing an all American familylooking at a multimedia Mac; Adobe with its psuedo-trendy multimedia type of card which mentioned theright words but failed to capture the spirit and toNorthern Telecom who made its card a multipagecorporate brochure and sales tool.The TASTEFUL CARD award goes to Sharp Corp of Japanwith a traditional Japanese Christmas card where theexecutives had also clearly taken the time to legiblysign their name. Germany's Bundesministerium fur Postund Telekommunikation always wins for its tastefulcards and German Christmas stamps.The TO SAVE A FEW CENTS award goes to Odetics Inc whosent out a pre-printed postcard saying that it hadused a virtual Christmas card on the Internet's WWW(http://hppyhldz.odetics.com) -- meaning there was noChristmas cheer for those who are not wired. Thebattle was close with Alexander Communications (USA)incorporating its New Year's greetings with an inviteto a press briefing and Hughes Communications Europewith its UNICEF card and photocopied insert paperwhich was not, well inserted at all but leftseparately in the envelope.  Quite a few companiesopted for the postcard Christmas card including FodorWyllie with Santa on one side of the postcard infront of a computer with the strap  findall:clients\big budgets."The WE MEAN IT award goes to Nokia Mobile Phones(motto: connecting people) for its simple picure ofthe world with festive people around thecircumference err, holding hands.

Apparently a financial journalistrecieved a parcel she apparently left at a restaurantwhile talking to Midland execs and a PR officer.Unfortunately she had never seen the packagecontaining a few of her articles, a biography on her,a handwritten appraisal of her bank account, salary,credit card details and monthly spending patterns.The Barman has heard tales of PR people getting thetechnies to check computers returned from loan forinteresting documents and of one e-mail provider whoapparently monitors the incoming and outgoing trafficon loan accounts -- technically they cannot read thecontents but they can see how the mail flow is takingplace -- but this appears to be the mostcomprehensive information sortie.

The survey saidthat Nethead's service was available just over 15% ofthe time during its continuous test process.NEXUS BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS in the UK havesomething to learn about e-mail.

But not all companies will benefit from a maturation of theInternet. Analysts expect that Internet service providers will see amajor shakeout beginning this year as larger telephone companies enterthe market of bringing businesses and consumers onto the Web.Web Measurement      Advertisers will demand better information this year about whois seeing their Web pages while Web publications, such as  TimeWarner's Pathfinder [TWX] or Hearst's HomeArts site, will betterquantify Web usage, knowing full well that the moneymaking potentialof a Web site depends on solid information about the people who useit.      "Measurement is an increasingly hotter issue," said Ed Hott,vice president of marketing at Interse Corp., which designs softwareto measure Web site activity. "There's a lot of information available,it just has to get logged and interpreted in a proper way."      Information that is readily available includes "pageimpressions" -the number of times a single Web page is downloaded by auser -- and the time a user spends on a page before clicking toanother Web page. This information can tell marketers which Web pagesdraw the most interest or produce a direct sale. They can then adjustthe content of their sites to maintain the interest of a core group of users.      Audited reports of Web site usage also will begin to appear asthe Audit Bureau of Circulations, the non-profit organization whichaudits print subscribership and newsstand sales, ends its testingprogram of Web tracking software this month and begins to offeraudited reports of Web site usage.Advertising Prices Fragment      This year also will see more companies define their marketingobjectives for the Web and how they use it to advertise or acquirebusiness leads.      "I see a couple of different pricing models," said MattThornhill, president of Martin Interactive in Richmond, Va.He said Web sites that draw in thousands of people, such as the Webdirectories Yahoo! and Lycos, may be able to begin selling advertisingon a cost per thousand basis, similar to the measurement criteria intelevision.      The other pricing model will resemble direct marketing's costper lead basis, which is generally targeted and more expensive,especially for business-to-business advertising.      "Direct marketers may pay between $150 and $300 for a lead, butif a business can convert a $20,000 sale out of it, it's worth it," henoted.Slowing Web Growth      Thousands of companies launched sites on the World Wide Web lastyear because they wanted to experiment with the new medium and notfall behind competitors. But that growth is slowing, says a study byThe Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston which specializesin information technology.      The firm found that the average weekly growth in commercial Websites slowed from a yearly high of 4.4 percent during the thirdquarter of last year to 2.8 percent during the last quarter. Thisslowdown may be attributed to a cooling of the hype surroundinginteractive media or possibly the end to the surge of technicallysophisticated telecom and technology companies which jumped on the Webearly.Year of the Shakeout      The rush to the Web by thousands of businesses spawned a wave ofstartup Internet service providers, many of which are not expected tohave enough capital or cash flow to survive an industry consolidation.      Telecom firms that begin offering Internet access, such as AT&Tor major cable-TV companies, probably will end up the winners in thecompetitive struggle. The Yankee Group predicts that the number ofInternet service providers will fall from 1,400 now to 600 by the endof the year, which it is labeling the Year of the Shakeout in theInternet industry. That number will fall to less than 300 by the endof next year.      "We expect to see scale-backs in everything from Internetdevelopment plans to the number of Internet network providers," saidGregory Wester, director of research at the firm.      Evidence of an industry consolidation is being seen as companiessuch as PSI buys out smaller Internet service providers such asPipeline and Panix, both once based in New York.      An industry shakeout should have little impact on mostbusinesses which market through traditional sales methods or advertisein established media such as print publications or television. Ifanything, it will make marketers and consumers more cautious abouttheir choice of access providers.      A shakeout also is a strong indicator of how the Web will beused for commercial purposes, according to the study. Westeridentified four distinct phases which characterize companies' Internetdevelopment plans: experimentation, development, justification andincorporation and fulfillment.      Most companies are now in the experimentation and developmentphase in which they have an Internet presence, but they do notscrutinize its marketing effectiveness. The justification phase iswhere companies can back up the investment in interactive media withevidence of growing revenue streams. The final phase, fulfillment,occurs when interactive marketing generates a consistent revenuestream and return on investment. None of the companies surveyed havereached the fulfillment phase.      A total of 18 percent of companies with an Internet presencehave done no analysis of the effectiveness of their interactivemarketing program, said Steve Franco, program manager at The YankeeGroup.      "Only 12 percent [of companies surveyed] have justified theirinvestment plans under the scrutiny typically required within anorganization," he said of the justification and incorporation phase.      This sentiment is echoed by Thornhill at the Martin Agency.      "My overall opinion is that '96 will be a watershed year for theWeb as major marketers will put their toe in the water to test itout," he said. "Marketers have money in the budget for '96 to try awhole lot of stuff. But when October '96 rolls around and they budgetfor '97, the big questions about its [the Web's] effectiveness will beasked. The Web really has to prove itself this year to survive nextyear."       As companies move toward the justification phase, they will bepressed to demand quantifiable results in reaching a desired targetaudience, acquiring new customers and building lasting relationshipswith existing customers.      The firm said most near-term Internet successes will be seen inthree areas of activity:*Leveraging traditional core competencies: An example of this type ofsuccess would be a cable programmer, such as CNN or ESPN, using theInternet to distribute news already gathered by its editorial staffand distributed through cable systems.      *Efficiencies of scale: Floral delivery companies which generatea large volume of low-priced transactions through a Web site may bemore successful marketing on the Internet than sellers of suchbig-ticket items as cars.      *Cost reductions: A bank which allows customers to conductInternet transactions may save on the costs of expanding a branchnetwork.

But interactive marketing will not add value to a company'ssales efforts unless the company maximizes this interactive capabilityby building one-to-one relationships with customers and making anonline sale.      Clearly, assuring customers that credit card numbers or otherpayment information are secure will be a major factor in online sales.The major purchase card companies, Visa International and MasterCardInternational , are working on developing security protocols forInternet transactions.      The protocols are a necessary part of how computers communicateconfidential payment information without the risk of being stolen byan interloper.      Although each company began developing its own protocols lastyear, some executives expect to see the two firms combine theirefforts this year.      "At the request of Visa, we have met with them a couple of timesabout coming back together," said Dorea Smith, director of globalcommunications at MasterCard.      Another MasterCard insider said that Visa and its securitydevelopment partner Microsoft Corp. have come back to the table andwill make an announcement soon of their intentions to work withMasterCard on an open set of standards.      MasterCard has spent the last few months listening tosuggestions from security consultants about its protocols and expectsto begin testing them during the first quarter of this year andrelease them for Internet use in April.      Executives at Visa were unavailable for comment.      "In 1996, you will see security solutions moving from the realmof specification debates and political jockeying about protocols tobeing actually rolled out," said Stratton Sclavos, president ofVeriSign.      The widespread deployment of security solutions will acceleratethe acceptance of electronic commerce and make doing business onlinemore commonplace, said John Patrick, vice president of Internetapplications for IBM. "In 1996, we will see the beginning of a newlevel of trust and understanding about authentification andencryption. This will bring the next major round of growth, fuelingmajor growth in electronic commerce," he said.      Software firms are expected to incorporate electronic paymentmodules into both client and server software packages by midyear.Initially, most will focus on credit card payment methods, with cashand check systems catching up late this year or early in 1997, sayanalysts. This development could allow other security solutions toemerge, although companies with existing products will continue to beregarded as market leaders, they say.Dorea Smith, MasterCard, 914/249-1421  Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE MARKETING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996ARTHUR ANDERSEN LAUNCHES WEB SITE      Someone finally did it: Published a history of accounting on aWeb site.

The demonstrates that 70 percent of online adults -- the nearly16 million U.S. adults that have access to the Internet or subscribeto an online service -- have a Visa card, while 50 percent have aMasterCard, 30 percent use Discover and almost 18 percent have an AT&TUniversal Card.     "We would expect to see a higher number of credit cards amongInternet users, because the demographics of Internet users are skewedtoward upper-income and college-educated adults," said JamesDesrosier, head of global advertising at MasterCard.Internet shopping is relatively undeveloped now for a variety ofreasons, including no "critical mass" of online users and prevailingconcerns about Internet security. But Internet security is expected toimprove as payment card companies develop improved encryption methodsfor cardholder data.     As security does improve, it is reassuring to know that onlineadults have the purchase cards to allow them to engage in Internettransactions in the near term.     "It's best to capitalize on an existing base of a certainbehavioral segment," Desrosier said.     Because that base now largely consists of value-minded,college-educated males, MasterCard is using a three-pronged approachto getting the most out of its Web marketing strategy.     Desrosier said his company's Web site is designed to attractcollege students, sports enthusiasts and value-minded shoppers.     A large proportion of the 15 million college students in theUnited States have free access to the Internet, which means the Web isuseful in targeting an attractive market segment.     Because Internet users are mostly male and men tend to be sportsenthusiasts, MasterCard has sports tie-ins on its Web site to reachthis group and sign them up for credit cards.     Desrosier said the company is also trying to attract value-mindedshoppers by offering contests and giveaways.     "Value shoppers are looking for freebies, value-added offers andgive-backs," he said.     He declined to comment on how many new cardholders the company'sWeb site has solicited compared with other types of solicitations.Overall, direct-mail was less successful at attracting new cardholderslast year, according to BAI Mail Monitor, which tracks direct-mailsolicitations. It reported that more than 2.6 billion card offers weremailed last year, up from 2.4 billion in 1994, but response rateshovered around 1.4% last year, down from 1.6% in 1994.     Desrosier said he would expect to see higher response rates fromWeb users who visit the MasterCard Web site, simply because the usermay be actively seeking out a credit card application. But the key toeffective Web advertising is directing the foot traffic of Web users.     "You have to provide the right kind of content for the kind ofpeople who are surfing the 'Net," Desrosier said. "Right now, thatconsists of value-driven shoppers, males and college students."

Although market research firm Inteco Corp. predicted that thenumber of installed multimedia kiosks would grow 69 percent this yearto a total of 211,000 units, Greg Swistak remains cautiouslyoptimistic.     Swistak is president of Factura Inc., a kiosk maker based inRochester, N.Y. that was bought by touch-screen manufacturerMicroTouch Systems Inc. in February.     "Some of Inteco's numbers were based on a couple of largerollouts which were put on hold," Swistak said.     He said he expects his company's unit sales to grow 50 percent toa total of 15,000 kiosks this year. The company has installed 30percent of the 100,000 kiosks now in operation in the United States.     The biggest installers of interactive kiosks have been greetingcard companies, such as American Greetings. American Greeting hasbetween 10,000 and 12,000 kiosks which print customized greetingcards. It was installing 800 kiosks a month during a peak installationtime last year, but that program was put on hold.     Hallmark also installed 1,500 kiosks in its chain stores andgrocery stores, but is now in the process of redeploying some unitswhich did not perform as well as expected.     "If a kiosk takes up space in a food store, it has to beproductive," said Mindi Ellis, a spokesperson for Hallmark.     But interactive kiosks are not limited to printing greetingcards. Swistak said all types of retailers are taking interest ininteractive kiosks to offer product information to customers.     "The real benefit is to have much more detailed productinformation than a human being can offer," Swistak said.     He said stores which don't have the time or resources to teachhigh-school and college-student employees about a wide range ofproducts may benefit from installing a kiosk, but Swistak concedes itis difficult to measure the return on investment for the devices.     Kiosks may be expensive depending on their capabilities. The costof a kiosk enclosure costs a mininum $750, and a touch-screen monitorcosts between $700 and $1,000. A personal computer which sits insidethe kiosk may cost about $1,500 and a printing device could addanother $500 to $1,000. Depending on the choice of hardware anindividual kiosk may cost between $4,000 and $20,000. And then there'sthe cost of designing the software to interact with a kiosk user.     "The cost of designing the software depends on a company'scomputer expertise," Swistak said.     One of his customers, JCPenney Co., is in the process ofinstalling 1,500 kiosks for its bridal registry program. The companyhas a large internal systems department that designed the entiresystem.     Another customer, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, has a group oftransportable kiosks which are temporarily installed at the office anew health-maintenance organization customer. The kiosk allows acompany's employees to view information about various health insuranceplans, select a plan and even select a preferred doctor.     Swistak foresees kiosks with greater Web access which would allowa user to search for more extensive product information.     "A company like General Motors could have kiosks in itsdealerships which allow people to browse its home page and get moreproduct information," Swistak said. "There are a lot of marketingapplications out there."Greg Swistak, Factura Inc., 716/264-9600Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE MARKETING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996lLOOKING BACK ON A YEAR OF INTERACTIVITY     Go back to the beginning of 1995 and look at the businessliterature. Without fail, nearly every publication has devotedenormous amounts of space to interactivity, the Internet, and theelectronic marketing revolution.     The emphasis on interactive marketing and interactive potentialhas dominated the technology literature, the financial literature, themarketing literature, the futurist literature, and the salesliterature. Without a doubt, 1995 was the year of the acceptance ofthe topic of interactivity.     It may come to pass, as we enter 1996 and the years beyondleading up to the new millennium, that more businesses will form as aresult of interactive technology than have formed across all ofhistory to date.     During 1995, the entrepreneurial visionaries of the worldactually came to believe that everybody can be a publisher. Up untilnow, publishing was reserved for only certain members of society'selitist layer.  With the advent of the Internet, the elitist layer wasredefined and ambitious individuals discovered that the world will payhandsomely for both information and entertainment.     The world is dividing into those who provide and those who usecontent.  Put another way--a more entrepreneurial way--the world iscleaving into those who will buy information and entertainment andthose who will sell information and entertainment.  That is a profoundshift.     Witness, if you will, the hardly surprising indications ofmankind's propensity to drift to the lowest common denominator.  TheInternet is itself cleaving into the useful and the profane.  Thebroadcast world is subdividing into The Learning Channel and RickiLake.  The great Bell curve, however, is firmly centered over"Unbelievably Vulgar and Coarse."     Cyberspace seems to be a more environmentally (with emphasis onthe "mentally") friendly place for business than it is for children. Perhaps it is business that will serve as the "hemisphere of good" incyberspace while entertainment is relegated to the "hemisphere ofevil."  Perhaps it is information and business applications ofinformation that will redeem interactivity and its elemental shapingof our future.  Perhaps it is information distilling to wisdom thatwill create grace in cyberspace.     And so, as we continue into the first full years of thecyberspace age, it is well we should look back at where we have beenand attempt to influence where we are going.  A great number ofcorporations are spending massive sums of money to dominate variouscorners of cyberspace. A huge number of individuals are counting oninteractivity as being their personal Holy Grail. An even larger massof humanity is dying from ignorance and poverty. We are entering theformative and truly shaping years of interactivity. We have choices tomake as to content. Those choices can be driven be goodness or bygreed.       When the interactive world contains merchants of pornography andviolence, I despair for the future. When the interactive worldcontains cheats and thieves, I despair for the future. When theinteractive world contains darkness and hate, I absolutely despair forthe future. It is up to each member of the interactive world to choosea hemisphere of content. It is up to each member to choose a directionfor he future. With some small amount of luck, we may actually makethis thing called interactivity work for good instead of just anotherspecious "profit." But, frankly, I doubt it.          Donald R. Libey is a marketing futurist, consultant, speaker andauthor.

Specifically, the company has inked a deal with USA Networks inwhich Simon and Schuster will advertise its new Star Trek Omnedpediaand Star Trek Technical Manual CD ROM games on The Dominion, the Sci-Fi Channel site on the World Wide Web (http://www.scifi.com), inaddition to the Sci-Fi Channel television network in the UnitedStates.     In exchange for Simon and Schuster advertising with the USANetwork, the network has created a seven-page section which willdemonstrate the CD-ROMs to Dominion users, as well as the opportunityto order the CD-ROMs via fax.      "Essentially, [Simon and Schuster Interactive] is the first tobuy a site," within USA's online area, said USA Network's DanMartinsen.  "What it does for us is to bring us some revenue."     In the past, there was a great deal of debate about how well thistype of agreement would pan out, he added.  "But it actually doesbecome a revenue source."  He declined to provide projections on whatUSA Network expects to earn.     "The key is ...to do it in a way not to turn off [consumers],"said Martinsen.  "It's a challenge to create advertising...but make itof interest to [cybersurfers]."     For Simon and Schuster, the obvious benefits amount to tappingUSA Network's online traffic as well as cable viewers. The Dominionsite, launched in March 1995, is the home for science fiction on theWeb.  The growing Sci-Fi Channel is available in more than 26 millionhomes nationwide.     "The unified message we have directed through the Sci-Fi Channeland its Dominion online site provides the one-two punch we look forwithout Star trek advertising," said Walter Walker, vice president ofmarketing for Simon and Schuster Interactive.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE MARKETING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996ONLINE PROMOTIONS GAINING FOOTHOLD     The launching of interactive Web sites to promote entertainmentproducts is multiplying at a phenomenal rate.     One of the latest trends is for entertainment giants to useinteractive Web sites that offer behind-the-scenes video clips,interactive games and contests to promote new products.     The sites range from simple reviews of the film and stillpictures to actual sound and video clips, interactive board games andtrivia questions.      For example, Magnet Interactive Communications, a leadinginteractive media development agency for Sony Pictures Entertainment,has created a web site that offers six downloadable games that offerusers the chance to win a trip to Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla.

Throw Out Those 3-Ring Binders. Crisis managementhas finally entered the computer age.  Burson-Marsteller (B-M)introduced the industry's first computer-based crisis managementsystem, called C:\risis.  B-M is certainly one of the world leaders inthis field, having worked on crises from Tylenol and Bhopal to Perrierand Pan Am at Lockerbie.No Time, Information. Losing control of a crisis is almost always aresult of either not enough time or not enough information, RayO'Rourke, director of B-M's U.S. practice, told IPR.  So C:\risis wasdeveloped to save time and provide accurate real-time information inmanaging a crisis for tracking and evaluating a rapidly evolvingsituation, formulating strategy, and responding quickly.   No Plug & Play.  The system provides resources, such as onlinemonitoring, database and Net search tools; communications drivers,such as e-mail, fax polling, and satellite paging; and an electronicmanual of procedures, policies, contact lists, and backgroundmaterials. Of course, all this information must be customized to aorganization based on its business and the kind of vulnerabilities itfaces.    Beam It Up, Scotty.  O'Rourke said C:\risis will be especially helpfulon site at an emergency, where facilities are often lacking. Thesoftware fits in a laptop, and info can be received or sent out viamodem and cell phone, if needed.  It even has a built-in hand-heldpage scanner, to send out local media stories that won't be foundonline.//Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996TO COMMUNICATE BELL ATLANTIC/NYNEX MERGER, WEB PAGES ARE SENT TOREPORTERS VIA E-MAIL      WASHINGTON  To communicate its information and spin on itsrecent merger agreement with Nynex, Bell Atlantic has embraced a newInternet technology that allows it to deliver its media relations Website to a self-selected group of reporters and other influencers usinge-mail.  Thus, instead of waiting for reporters to log onto the Weband remember to surf over to its site, Bell Atlantic goes directly tothem.      This capability is enabled by e-mail programs that allow for thesending and receiving of e-mail messages with embedded HTML, LiveObjects and images  i.e., the ability to send or receive Web pagesvia e-mail.      Bell Atlantic public relations/public affairs has been anInternet innovator since launching the Web's first major corporatepublic affairs site back in December 1993 during another proposedmerger, this time with Tele-Communications, Inc.  The media relationssite, ba.com  went up well before the general BellAtlantic site , and today remains one of thebest on the Web (see IPR story, Aug. 10, 1995).       Bell Atlantic has always used a listserv, which is a mailinglist of e-mail addresses to which it can send messages almostsimultaneously.  People interested in receiving Bell Atlanticinformation subscribe to the list.1,000 On Listserv      The listserv is a good communications strategy in itself. Due tointerest in the merger, Bell Atlantic's listserv has grown to about1,000 people, and can be found on a special Media  Resource Centersite on ba.com for merger information .      The ability to deliver Web pages to this listserv provides addedbenefits, according to Ken Deutsch, director of Washington-based IssueDynamics, Web site manager and consultant for Bell Atlantic.           "The problem with the World Wide Web is you have to have peoplecoming back to your site but as people go out and browse the Web, theyfind other sources and do not come back to yours," he said.  "Sendingindividuals HTML documents by a listserv delivers the Web to their e-mail. Since most Internet users check their e-mail on a daily basis,you'll always be able to get to them."      Photos, charts or tables can be e-mailed to users, but theability to sent hyperlinks to the Web is the most powerful benefit. When a specific announcement is e-mailed to reporters, they can simplyclick on a link to send an e-mail query to the relevant Bell Atlanticor Nynex contact.      For example, one recent announcement, on responses to themerger, was based on comments by Ed Young, a Bell Atlantic vicepresident.  The document referenced the merger and linked to the MediaResource Center. It then highlighted Ed Young's name, and a hyperlinkcould be clicked on to pull up his bio, photo and past speeches.  Atthe bottom of the page was a link back to the main ba.com site.      "In Bell Atlantic you can get any corporate profile, you can getany speech, you can do a keyword search of the whole site." Deutschsaid.  "You can do a search and find out everything that Ray Smith(Bell Atlantic's CEO) said about mergers before this announcement."Growing User Base       Most e-mail programs do not support the sending and receiving ofWeb pages, although it's almost certain they'll add the feature toremain competitive, so the user base should grow.      Today, it's available in the e-mail programs in the NetscapeNavigator browser, version 2.0 and higher, and in the MicrosoftNetwork.        Eudora, the most widely used e-mail program, does not have thefeature, but its latest 2.2 version supports what it calls "ActiveURLs."  Users can be sent an e-mail with an embedded URL (e.g., "tolearn more, see http://ba.com/nynex"), and by clicking on the URL,their Web browser is automatically opened and the specific Web page isdownloaded.       It's not quite the same as directly receiving a Web page, butit's close.  From a sender's point of view, users can still bedirectly linked to the Web.  Major Web publishers, such a c|net, usethe feature in newsletters e-mailed to subscribers.          Deutsch said that about a third of the new people joiningba.com's listserv for merger updates opt to receive Web pages ratherthan plain text messages.//Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996EVOLVING INTO AN INTERACTIVE MARKETING TOOL, SCREEN SAVERS PROTECTBRANDS, NOT MONITORS      LOS ANGELES - It used to be that a screen saver just kept youfrom burning a picture in your monitor. But in the last year it hasevolved into a powerful and popular branding and one-to-one marketingtool of choice.      Improved computer monitor technology has eliminated the need forscreen savers, yet millions are sold, downloaded, and given away aspromotional items.        That's because on today's screen savers, increasing quality,sound, interactivity and variety has become  de rigueur.      "It's priced right up there with a coffee cup and baseball capand pen, traditional items that companies give to their customers orprospects, said Jeff Oster, president of Interloc Design Group,specialists in customized screen savers (see Online Interview). "Itputs something right in front of  customers to keep the name in frontof them."      Interloc has developed custom promotional screen savers forcompanies such as Sprint, Nintendo, CompuServe and Yonex golf clubs.      "The strongest recognition of the power of  this whole thing isstarting to come through now as people see what PointCast is doing,"said Oster.       The PointCast Network (PCN) online news service works like ahybrid screen saver/browser that automatically or manually downloadsan astonishing breadth of current news headlines, weather, sports andU.S. stock chart and ticker information, and can be customized toreceive only the information the user desires, such as the number ofcompanies the user wants to monitor. (See IPR, April 8).       The service is free, paid for with a section of its screen thatprovides animated commercials: Click on any of the commercials, andyou jump directly to the advertiser's Web page.        When the PC is inactive, the PCN screen saver kicks in and rollsvarious news headlines and leads that the user can click directly tofrom the saver.  Some have described the PCN screen saver applicationas a taste of the killer app for the business Internet PC. Incentives Make A Difference      Fun and original screen savers are well and good but matterslittle if the user doesn't install it and keep it active for someperiod of time. Thus it becomes necessary to create an intrinsic valueto the user. That comes most readily in the form of incentives, as ininformation, entertainment, or most likely, money and prizes.        Interloc is developing a screen saver for a store grand opening.Diskettes will be mailed out in enticing packaging that tells peopleto bring the disk to the store to find out if they've won a prize. Even non-winners who install the program can benefit from storecoupons and rebates that can be printed from the screen saver at thehome or office.       "They're using it to draw people to the opening, and thenthey're using it as another delivery vehicle for coupons later," notedOster.      To keep users from ignoring or uninstalling the saver, time-released information may come in handy. Programmers can release anyspecified information over time, so that a contest or vital piece ofinformation may not appear on the screen for a while after the screensaver is installed, say one week or 90 days later.      PC Dynamics Inc., another screen saver developer, lays apractical set of rules at its Web site  onwhat not to do when you go about designing a screen saver, such as,"Computer users don't want screen savers that are blatantadvertisements," and "Don't even think of showing a bouncing oranimated logo." PC Dynamics, incidentally, created the Energizer BunnyScreen Saver.      Bouncing cookies however, may whet one's appetite. The winsomeNabisco screen saver , is housed in the company's kids site, butis equally amusing for adults who grew up on Oreos and Fig Newtons.      The animal motif has worked for successful screen saversstarring the Budweiser frogs and Coca-Cola's skiingpolar bears Interactive Marketing, Inc., also of Capistrano Beach, Calif.,designed a screen saver for King World Productions, distributors ofWheel Of Fortune, Jeopardy and Oprah, that was designed to read theinternal clock of the user's computer so that message changed everyday and reminded users of various promotions and other pertinentactivities during certain sweeps periods. "We incentivized users by telling them the screen saver wasseated and that one day a clue was going to pop up and if they knewthe answer they could win a trip to Hawaii," said Andrew Batkin,president of Interactive Marketing.//Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996'A CACOPHONY OF VOICES, A MASS OF CLUTTER', ANOTHER DISCUSSION ONINTERACTIVE MARKETING NEW YORK The year 1995 ended paradoxically for theinteractive marketing industry, said Alfred Sikes, president of HearstNew Media & Technology. "Despite a great year for the Internet, thecognoscenti ended the year soberly. Never have so many invested somuch in the future." Is there a business in interactive? This is "the recurringquestion that gnaws at us," he said. His answer: he's "certain there is." Sikes keynoted IM'96: The 7th Conference & Expo on InteractiveMarketing, organized by Capistrano Beach, Calif.-based InteractiveMarketing Communications April 16 to 18, which both looked to thefuture of the industry while trying to help attendees grapple with themore immediate issues of the day. Sikes said three forces will work together to makes today's Web"look like black and white TV," he explained: 1) competitionresulting from the new telecom law, 2) the seemingly infinite capacityto improve the performance of digital systems, and 3) market demand. Golden Era Another keynoter, Martin Yudkovitz, president of NBC InteractiveMedia, was also optimistic. "I'm firmly convinced we live in the most invigorating era tolive in in information and entertainment the golden era of TV," hesaid. And no "rank amateur" upstart is going to beat NBC in seizingthis new era, the way Ted Turner did with cable TV. "We're not going to let that happen in interactive media,"Yudkovitz proclaimed. Indeed. NBC's been playing for keeps since clinching a strategicalliance with Microsoft more than a year ago. MSNBC Cable, a 24-hour news and information service, and MSNBCInteractive, an interactive online news service, will both launch thissummer. NBC already has launched Web sites for the last Superbowl, ingolf, the Olympics, and coverage of Bosnia, to name a few. It'sdeveloped other initiatives, as well. One is the NBC Desktop Video, which provides full-motion videofor the financial community on its desk tops. It's an "expensive, butterrific product," Yudkovitz said, and "Wall Street can afford it." NBC has also embraced Intercast technology, which links theInternet and television on desktop computers so that information ormultimedia delivered via HTML pages can be delivered simultaneouslywith normal TV broadcast programming. It's a way of deliveringinteractive TV without the expense of set top boxes, Yudkovitz said,and NBC will use it with the Olympics. Full motion video was his message. He said the Web's been "sorely disappointing in itsentertainment power." Good product is "absolutely necessary," he said, but "being goodisn't good enough" for the Web, where there's "a cacophony of voices,a mass of clutter." "Design your content for where the medium is going, not whereit's been," he urged. "It is a full-motion video medium, a transactionmedium."Thirst For Bandwidth Not everyone at IMC'96 was desperate to turn the Web into TV,into a marketing model based on TV advertising. Steve Goldberg, manager of advertising development and strategyfor Microsoft Network, said he was "fascinated by marketers thirst formore bandwidth," since they still haven't figured out how to do thesimplest things, such as design and place an ad banner. "Focus on how to improve that as an art form," he challenged."We have a long way to go." Martin Sloane, president and CEO of Supermarket ShoppingNetwork, strongly suggested that brand marketers in general, andpackaged goods marketers in particular, should abandon resident Websites altogether. "Let corporations do this for IR (investor relations) andcorporate purposes," he said. "Resident Web sites are becoming less attractive" because theyare "too much trouble," he said. "Packaged goods marketers "don't wantto be the publisher of an interactive magazine"; rather, they want "avehicle they can turn on and just as quickly turn off." Sloane outlined alternatives. He said the advertising route is targeted, flexible, measurable,accountable in sales, and can offer full interactive facilities suchas surveys, promotions, contests and feedback. The umbrella Web site alternative, sometimes called the "virtualmall," offers lower costs and "relief from the burden of creatingfrequently changing and engaging content," he said. All participantsjointly promote the site, and achieve the necessary mass of consumerpromotions to offer the gratification and rewards needed to keepconsumers coming back, he added. Brands Will Blossom Lynn Upshaw, Ketchum Advertising's EVP for brand marketing, wasmore enthusiastic about brands and Web sites. "Brands will blossom on the Web," he said, and all thesuccessful brands he mentioned had resident Web sites. He said the Web will be "Brand Central" and that brands "will beone of the drivers, part of the super structure" of the Web. Brands are using the Web to "outflank competition," he said, insome cases attracting a younger and richer demographic. Ragu, forexample, had an older demographic than its competitors before itbecame one of the first consumer products on the Web, he explained. The session on "Site Promotions: Both On & Off The Net,"provided three panelists all charged with promoting entertainmentproducts on the Web. They stressed the power of deal making. Stuart Halperin, EVP of marketing for Hollywood Online explaineda nifty deal he worked out with National Theater Owners Association(NATO). NATO theaters run 30-second trailers promoting HollywoodOnline prior to their feature movies. In exchange, Hollywood Onlineprovides movie listings on its sites (on all the online services andthe Web) something that's in its interest to do anyway!Linking Thinking "Cut deals, find ways to form partnerships," said RobertaJacobs, SVP sales and marketing for Viacom New Media, which marketsvideo and CD games. She said online guerrilla marketing campaigns are "moreimpactful than TV ad campaigns," and at far less cost: "hundreds ofthousands rather than millions of dollars." She said sales with promotions linked to the Net can be graphed. To promote the Beavis & Butthead In Virtual Stupidity game onthe Net, a promotion was done with MTV Spring Break Weekend and linkswere made to MTV's homepage as well as to TV and print advertising. "Use linking thinking," Jacobs enthused. To get into this mindset, she said to identify companies thatalso reach your target market, and to "think of things to build intoyour site that others would like to link to." She said Viacom New Media gets approached a lot for cross-promotional links. "There are no established promotional models on the Web," shesaid. "Linking thinking" was also emphasized in a session on"Hyperlink Marketing." When asked, "how do you find hyperlink opportunities," DanielStone, SVP for Turner Broadcasting Sales, Inc., said: "They're allover the play, you just need the perspective to see them." He offered that many sites are looking for content providers andthat a strategic alliance with the right company "can bring anadditional 50,000 people to your site." He also said: "We see this as a branding medium; we see thevalue of the branding impression as important as an ad promotion," Back at the session on site promotion, Annie Van Bebber, a VP atAttitude Network, which publishes the Happy Puppy software game Website, also emphasized the value of cyber marketing over traditionalchannels. "Focus first on marketing online then roll out into othermedia," she said. It's So Easy She advised companies to hire one good person internally foronline marketing, but didn't think the position required muchexperience. "Students are a great resource," she said. "They don't have tohave any marketing experience just be able to type a word in asearch engine" because "it's so easy to get around the Internet."Maybe monkeys can be trained to do it. The subject of newsgroups wasn't raised until the end of thesession, when Van Bebber said they're "a great source" because "wordcan spread like wildfire." She suggested to "find one in your niche." An attendee said he'd heard there was danger in usingnewsgroups, and asked, "What is proper?" "Use proper Netiquette," Van Bebber replied. "What is that?" the attendee asked. "Well you should know," Van Bebber bristled. Apparently, she didn't.// For contact information on companies or people mentioned, e-mail.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996ONLINE INTERVIEW: JEFF OSTERMarketing With Screen Savers Jeff Oster is president of Interloc Design Group (IDC), based inCapistrano Beach, Calif. IDC is a leading developer of custom screensavers, having developed promotional, communications-directed screensavers for a range of companies. IDC also develops commercial screensavers sold at retail, such as the official 1996 Atlanta SummerOlympic Games screen saver.IPR: What is the killer app in marketing for screen savers today?Oster: Today the screen saver can be updated from the Internet. Youdistribute the screen saver and then information can be downloadedinto it on a regular basis. So it continually becomes a new device.The information can be from a company that's trying to get informationto the consumer level, or it can be delivered over an Intranet. It'salmost like an electronic sign. Messages can scroll across the screenwhen the computer is inactive, and those messages can be informationthe user wants. IPR: How are they used internally?Oster: We've done internal screen savers for MCI and Sprint and othercorporations that want time-released messages in front of employees.These might be advertising schedules or corporate information, missionstatements and goals. This is just a new way of putting it in front ofthem on their computer screens. Really, the applications areunlimited. IPR: Are companies starting to send customized information to theiraudiences?Oster: In fact we're meeting with an agency for one of the automobilemanufacturers and that's exactly what they want to do. They want tohave a module similar to PointCast where the user can say, "Okay,here's the news I want. Here are the things I'm interested in andhere's the schedule I'd like to receive it in." (Note: PointCast is adesktop screen saver that provides users with updated, customized newsand information from news sources via the Internet. See IPR, April 8,or http://www.pointcast.com).IPR: Can a screen saver draw traffic to a Web site?Oster: Yes, it could. In fact that's something one agency we'reworking with wants to do. We can build a screen saver on disk that'sgiven away to a consumer, like a phone card. It's got free Internetaccess time on the disk, it's got a browser, and the screen saver. Allthe user needs is a modem. Now they've got 20 minutes of free time onthe Internet, and the program launches them right to the Web site of the company that gave it to them. This is similar to a phone card with30 free minutes of long distance calling on it and you hear a littlecommercial before you make your call. That's just one way to do it.IPR: With all the screen savers out there how do you make your's standout? Oster: Since we've developed this as a marketing tool one of the firstquestions people ask is, "Why is someone going to load this on thesystem? And then once they get it there, why are they going to keep itthere?" And you know, if you load something and it doesn't work orit's a bit frustrating or you just see the same thing over and over,you think "Okay, give me something new." So we've spent a lot of timeresearching that and found that incentives are very effective. We'vedone instant cash prizes for radio stations, golf clubs, tickets to aPGA event, and American Express gift certificates. Some clients willuse a grand prize. Radio station KOST 103.5 had five disks withinstant cash winners of $1,000. The screen saver disk had a serialnumber etched into the shutter so that somebody couldn't duplicate it. Others have spread those prizes over a wider number of disks. Onedistributor of computer products had about 4,000 disks and 100 of themhad $25 American Express gift certificates that were time-released, sopeople would be inclined to keep it loaded on their system over thenext ninety days. ViewSonic's screen savers announced an incentivetrip for resellers, with pictures of the Caribbean. But now we're getting into more people wanting to releaseinformation as the incentive. And that's really what PointCast is: ifthe information that ends up on your screen is something you want tosee, then that's a value. An incentive to someone in a corporateenvironment may not be an incentive to a university student. We'vefound that if information is valuable to the market we're going after,it's almost a stronger incentive than cash. If you thought you couldget information that would put you a step ahead of your competition,that would probably be pretty valuable to you as a business person. The other thing that we've found in doing this is that, whetherit's a CD or a diskette, this kind of direct mail gets a significantlyhigher response rate than a printed piece. You'll load it in yoursystem and spend about 20 minutes fiddling with it as opposed to thedirect mail piece that you might look over briefly and throw away.IPR: What do you say when a client asks what this is going to cost?What's the analogy?Oster: Good point because really the analogy is we view this as asoftware program that can be given away and has a retail value ofmaybe $15.00. We price these to our clients based on quantity anywherefrom $1.00 to $7.00 apiece, which includes the disk, labeling,software duplication royalty or licensing fees. The creation of themaster can range anywhere from $1,000 to $15,000, average $3,000 to$5,000. That generally includes putting in some kind of motion. Mostof the cost is building in the interactivity, if you want to hit a keyand have something else happen. We've rebuilt some where the user canactually put in their own information, like reminders or quotes. Itgenerally takes four to six weeks from the time we get a story board.IPR: When is a screen saver not an effective marketing vehicle?Oster: I talked to the Los Angeles Dodgers more than a year ago aboutdoing a screen saver night, and they said, "When we give somebody abaseball cap we know it fits everybody's head." So you've got to lookat the audience first. IPR: How do you work with communications agencies on these projects? Oster: Agencies obviously are creative people so it's something thatwe look to them for. They generally come to us with the story board. Sometimes they come to us with the content as well. If you go back ayear, nobody knew what the Internet was. We used to go call on allthese agencies and had to describe to them what a screen saver was.Today a lot more people know what it is.IPR: Are there any media relations applications for screen savers?Oster: The Nintendo screen saver was done for Golin/Harris, which isNintendo's public relations firm. It became part of an electronicpress kit so that reporters could load the disk and see 3D screensfrom Donkey Kong.IPR: It seems screen savers have come a long way.Oster: We're developing a trademark on the word "Kinetic Screens"because our engine is really more than a screen saver. It's adevelopment tool where we do 3D animation, video, sound, and allmultimedia components. But once we've worked with all those things wecan make a kiosk out of it, a Web site, a CD-ROM. The screen saver isreally a part of that. It just happens to have this unfortunate namethat everybody knows.//Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996NEW WEB AD NETWORK LETS MARKETERS, OTHERS, TARGET AUDIENCES TO ANUNPRECEDENTED DEGREE NEW YORK DoubleClick, the first Web advertising network (seeIPR, Feb. 19) has just ended its beta test phase and is now live. DoubleClick is intended to help advertisers reach the peoplethey want in a highly efficient, and therefore cost-effective manner. And for Web sites seeking advertisers, an ad network like DoubleClickmay remove the need to have an ad sales department or rep firm. But because targeting an audience through DoubleClick can be soprecise, the network may prove a useful tool for purposes beyondgeneral advertising, such as public relations, public affairs, or anyapplication where a specific group of people is to be reached with aspecific message, and quickly. DoubleClick offers this example on its Web site: "you cantarget females who work for aerospace component manufacturers in theLos Angeles area with at least $100 million in operating revenue whouse PCs with Windows 95 and like sports."Most Advanced Medium "We've taken it from one of the most primitive mediums to themost advanced medium," said Kevin O'Connor, DoubleClick CEO andpresident. "We do more right now with this medium than any othermedium can possibly do." The network enables targeting by Web page/site category (e.g.,arts and literature, entertainment, health and medicine), by one ormore geographic locations (e.g., by countries, states, area codes orzip codes), by operating system, browser type, by Internet domain,organization type (using SIC code), by organize size or revenue, bypersonal interests, and time (i.e., days or hours to display an adbanner). Advertisers can also control the types of banners, bannerdistribution, as well as banner frequency and ad banner series. "We have some advertisers using six different parameters, so wehave to hone it into a very specific group," O'Connor said. "I'm waiting for a restaurant to take out ads between 4:30 and5:30 Thursday, Friday and Saturday to get you to go to therestaurant," he added. "It's inevitable." The DoubleClick service is based on a massive database ofinformation on Internet users/organizations, combined withsophisticated proprietary application software. It lets advertisers control reach and frequency in real time, and provides measurableresults so advertisers can improve their campaigns.Non-Advertising Applications That's great news for advertisers, but also imagine thepossibilities for political campaigning, grassroots lobbying, issuesmanagement, and other applications such as financial communications especially as other ad networks sprout on the Web, some dedicated tovertical industries areas such as health care, for example. "We're not going to be the only network," O'Connor said. However, DoubleClick is the first and appears to be off to agood start. According to O'Connor, since the beta phase began in February,DoubleClick has delivered ads to more than two million Web users. Ithas grown from five to 25 participating Web sites, with more than 200sites asking to participate. And advertisers are pleased with theresults. "(DoubleClick's) targeting capabilities allowed us to bolsterour night-time traffic and better hit our demographic by doing latenight blitzes to the '.edu' domains," said Stephan Paternot ofWebGenesis, a site targeting the college market.//Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996INTERACTIVE NEWS & IDEAS NEW YORK c|net Look Out, Tech Marketers Get Ready.

From a business and job marketpoint of view, the answer is certainly "yes."  Most PR execs alsowould view the new federal laws on corporate financial disclosure, andto a lesser extent on lobbying as pluses.     From the point of view of excitement, the year was clearly awinner.  Last year's No. 1 story--the emergence of cyber PR--continuesto grab attention.     The other big stories of the year were: the press-monitoringfiasco at the Department of Energy, the Counselors Academy's droppingof APR as a membership requirement, a continuing high priority for PRmeasurement, leadership changes at IABC and IPRA, the Unabomber'sletter about Thomas Mosser's murder, and the death of PR legend EdwardBernays.Cyber PR Stays Center Stage     The standing-room-only crowd packed into Nicholas Negroponte'skeynote speech at the Public Relations Society of America conferencein October was striking evidence of the primacy of interactive PR. The cyber celeb's characterization of the World Wide Web as a "PRengine" should convince all but the most hardened technophobes thatthe Internet must be embraced.     And many have.  PR executives often have been heavily involved inthe launch of home pages by thousands of corporations and scores of PRfirms.  Home pages also were unveiled last year by the major PRprofessional bodies (Public Relations Society of America,International Association of Business Communicators and the NationalInvestor Relations Institute.)     Cyber services for media relations also logged on last year. PRNewswire and MediaMap Medannounced a linkup, that, in addition toautomating transmission of news releases via wire, mail and fax,provides automated e-mailing of releases to media.  Media directorycompanies added editor's e-mail addresses to their directories, and ahandful of companies began offering Internet clipping services.Strong Market for Jobs, Accounts     "Happy days are here again" could well be the refrain for the PRindustry last year.  The corporate and agency job market was thestrongest it has been since the boom of the mid- and late 1980s (July10, p. 1; June 26, p. 1).  In some markets--especially high-tech--lastyear's demand for experienced professionals appears to haveoutstripped the supply.     In another indicator of the robust job market, a number of PRexecutive recruiters reported that 1995 will go down as their bestyear ever.       The strong economy and corporations' increasing tendency tooutsource PR projects have combined to give most firms--including somewho had posted a string of soft years--a healthy flow of income.  Solopractitioners, whose numbers continue to increase sharply, also appearto have benefitted handsomely from these trends--and by a growingtrend of firms themselves to hire them on a project basis or asindependent contractors.Press Monitoring Overloads Circuits     A fairly routine PR measurement tool--content analysis of mediacoverage--unexpectedly became the most visible PR story of the year,hitting the front-pages of major newspapers such as The Wall StreetJournal and the Washington Post and nearly forcing the resignation ofa cabinet secretary (Nov. 20, p. 1; Dec. 11, p. 1).     Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary found her modestexpenditure of about $40,000 for Carma International's analysis ofDOE's press coverage become a lightning ride for criticism by thepress and Republican Congressmen.     Subsequent stories and a panel of journalists at the NationalPress Club ultimately acknowledged that content analysis generally isbenign--rather than underhanded.  Nonetheless, a media attorney on thepress club panel said that federal law prohibits media monitoring byfederal agencies--a subject that never was brought up in initialreporting of the story or in criticism by lawmakers.Lobby Disclosure Law Passed     As expected, President Clinton on Dec. 19 signed into law ameasure requiring registration of lobbyists and lobbying activities. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 was supported by both the AmericanLeague of Lobbyists and the American Society of AssociationExecutives, both of whose members will be required to comply with thelaw (Dec. 11, p. 1).  The measure also will require full-timecorporate lobbyists to register.     While many corporate, trade association and independent lobbyistshave been registering all along, the new law closes loopholes thatallowed many lobbyists to legally bypass registration if they chose.     Coincident with the new lobbying disclosure law, both the Houseof Representatives and Senate passed strict rules banning most gifts. In the case of House members, almost all gifts are banned.  Senatorspassed rules allowing gifts of up to $50.IR Execs Get Their Wishes     1995 was a great year for investor relations, with majorvictories on federal regulation and with the Financial AccountingStandards Board.     Late last month (Dec. 22), both houses of Congress voted tooverride President Clinton's veto of a bill limiting frivolouslitigation (see story this issue, p. 8).  The new law will limit theability of shareholder plaintiffs to sue publicly traded companieswhen they believe that companies' disclosure of earnings or marketprojections turned out to be inaccurate.  Moreover, even in cases whensuits may go forward, the law limits the amount of payments toplaintiffs, as well as attorney's fees.     IR professionals also counted as a gain a January decision by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board to drop a proposed change thatwould have required publicly trade corporations to determine anddisclose a present value for stock options granted to seniorexecutives (Jan. 23, p. 8).Measurement: Still A Top Priority        Proving the value of PR to management--both on a project leveland on a fundamental level--continues to be a high priority for PRprofessionals.     A fall survey of PR NEWS readers conducted by the newsletter andSchenkein/Sherman Public Relations revealed that proving PR's valuewas the top concern of corporate and agency PR people (Oct. 23, p. 1).     Nearly two-thirds of the 200 responding readers also said thatthe best way for the profession to gain more credibility with topmanagement would be "national studies" that show PR's effectiveness atchanging behaviors.     At a rare meeting of the leaders of the largest PR firms lastmonth (Dec. 11, p. 8), these agency chieftains voiced support for astudy of this type. Counselors Drop APR Requirement     After fighting an uphill battle to increase membership--particularly among executives at the largest PR firms--members of theCounselors Academy of the Public Relations Society of America votedlast fall to drop PRSA accreditation as a requirement for membershipin the group (Nov. 6, p. 2).     In the 1980s, the Academy became the first and only group tomandate the APR (Accredited in Public Relations) designation as arequirement for membership in the section, whose membership iscomprised solely of PR agency executives and individual practitionerPR consultants.     While the APR certification is not required for membership inPRSA, it remains a requirement for chapter and national officerpositions.Leadership Changes at IABC, IPRA     1995 marked changes at two of the world's largest PRorganizations, the International Association of Business Communicators(IABC) and the International Public Relations Association (IPRA) (June12, p. 1).  IABC's board selected long-time headquarters stafferElizabeth Allan as its new president, after the sudden resignation ofDavid Paulus after only eight months on the job (June 19, p. 1). Allan became IABC's fifth president, and the second woman to lead theapproximately 12,500-member organization.     In contrast to the IABC's nearly instantaneous move to replacePaulus, IPRA has not decided who will take over the reins of the1,000-member organization following the mid-year decision to acceptIPRA President Dennis Clagett's resignation.  Among the options beingexplored are the hiring of a part-time executive director, sharing ofan executive or administrative support with another PR organization,using an association management company, or moving its headquartersfrom Geneva, Switzerland, to a less-expensive city.     Clagett's last day on the job was Dec. 22. Bomber Targeted PR in Mosser Murder     The shocking December 1994 mail-bombing murder of former topBurson-Marsteller executive Thomas Mosser was in the news again lastyear when a letter from the notorious Unabomber revealed the reasonsfor the PR executive's targeting (May 1, p. 8): "We blew up ThomasMosser last December because he was a Burston-Marsteller [sic]executive.  Among other misdeeds, Burston-Marsteller helped Exxonclean up its public image after the Exxon Valdez incident."  Theterrorist also said the firm's identity as one of the major PR firms,whose work often involves "manipulating public attitudes," made it atarget.Edward Bernays, PR Pioneer, Dies     Edward Bernays, the last and possibly most celebrated of PR'searly pioneers, passed away last March at age 103 (March 20, p. 3).     A high-level New York PR counselor for about 40 years, he alsowas the author of a seminal work on PR practice, "Crystallizing PublicOpinion."  The booked marked one of the first uses of the term, "PRcounsel."     "He made very real, very substantial contributions to thebusiness," first and foremost the understanding of psychology, saidChester Burger, himself one of the legendary counselors in the field. Burger said Bernays also was a pioneer in the use of opinion researchat a time when many were "flying by the seat of their pants."     Bernays also is remembered as the most visible proponent oflicensing of PR professionals; he sponsored an effort in his homestate of Massachusetts in the early 1990s which failed to gain muchsupport in the state legislature.     He is remembered for many successful marketing PR programs, suchas a 1920s Proctor & Gamble Co.  effort that encouraged children touse soap by sponsoring a soap-carving contest.  He in later yearsadmitted regret for his successful work for tobacco companies, inwhich he conceived programs promoting the smoking of cigarettes bywomen, by labeling cigarettes "torches of freedom."Back to Headline List CopyrightPR NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HOLLYWOOD TAPS WEB TO HYPE ITS FILMSStudios follow movies' themes to create fun promotional sites     Hollywood studios are quickly adding the flashy World Wide Web totheir promotional machinery for new movie launches.        Entertainment companies now are using interactive Web sites thatoffer behind-the-scenes video clips, interactive games and contests topromote films.     The sites range from simple reviews of the film and stillpictures to actual sound and video clips, interactive board games andtrivia questions.        For example, in conjunction with box office success "Jumanji," ahome page developed by Magnet Interactive Communications has created aWeb site for the Sony Pictures Entertainment release.  It offers sixdownloadable games allowing users the chance to win a trip to BuschGardens in Tampa, Fla.      "For us it is another way to advertise our product.  It is usedin addition to billboards, television and print ads," said JenniferKennedy, assistant account executive for KillerAp Communications,which worked with Sony on the project.     Sony is not the only entertainment company jumping onto theInternet.  Castle Rock Entertainment is offering an interactive Website for its recent release, "The American President."  Users can votein an online poll, take a tour of the White House, participate in avirtual press conference, fill in a crossword puzzle or take aConstitution quiz.Games Carry on Jumanji Theme     With a roll of a die, visitors to the Web site for "Jumanji" canmove across a virtual board game through three phases of challengingriddles, travel cards or fun and perilous games to qualify for Jumanjiprizes.      "Users will encounter the same sense of adventure the movieoffers," said Basel Dalloul, chairman and CEO of Magnet InteractiveGroup, which helped develop the page.  "This site invites movie goersto enjoy the Jumanji experience in an exciting original format plus achance to win great prizes," he said.     Six games on the site allow visitors a chance to win the Jumanjiprize.  The games include:     -- Bullseye!, in which the player plays a spunky monkey let loosein a kitchen where the object of the game is to target everything insight;     -- Spashot, in which the player becomes a jungle photographerwith only 12 exposures to take pictures of animals who rapidly appearand disappear into the jungle;     -- WebCrawl, a spiderweb maze where the gamer is a fly trying toescape the web without being eaten by the dreaded tarantula,     -- Gator Raid.

A recent survey found that PR agencies are much more likely to beon the Internet than corporate PR departments.  The survey, which wascompleted last month by Chicago PR agency DGPR, polled 115 PR agencyand corporate department chiefs.       Ninety-two percent of agency respondents said they could accessthe Internet, compared to 70 percent of corporate respondents.     However, in-house PR departments are more likely to design theircompanies' Web sites than are outside consultants; 40 percent ofcorporate respondents said they design Web sites compared to 25percent for agencies.     The survey suggests that, per-person, it costs agencies more toget online.  Agency heads pay 60 percent more per workstation to gainInternet access; in-house PR departments pay $1,207 compared to $2,020for agencies.       DGPR president Deborah Gordon says agencies may be gettingonline faster than corporations because agency owners can makestrategic investments in computers without time-consuming budgetapprovals.  But because they are not part of a large corporation,agency heads are paying a premium for equipment.

Klein said New Jersey authorities auditing her firm areattempting to collect a 6 percent sales tax and penalties going backthree years for both in-state and out-of-state clients.     The state's top auditing official last summer changed hisinterpretation of existing law, and concluded that language requiringtaxation of "advertising services" also covers public relationsservices, according to Joseph Dietz, president of ad/PR firm J. M.Kesslinger & Associates (Union).  Dietz heads a coalition of ad and PRfirms that have been working with New Jersey tax authorities to try todevelop clearer guidelines of what is taxable for both state auditorsand agencies.  The coalition also hopes to mount an effort to havetaxes on ad and PR services stricken from the law.     Current law puts New Jersey agencies at a disadvantage whencompeting with agencies from neighboring Pennsylvania and New York,which do not tax ad and PR services, Dietz said.

To counter the move by the larger bottlers, a group of smallspring water companies formed a new association, the National SpringWater Association, after the International Bottled Water Associationrefused to back them on labeling that would identify water as eitherspring water or well water.     Armed with information from scientists from the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey, thespring water association hoped to make the case to the public and tofederal authorities in charge of water labeling, that spring water wasinherently more pure than well water.  The NSWA also had access toconsumer research data, which indicated that, if given the choice,consumers preferred spring water over all other types of water,including well water.Announcement of Own Label     With federal authorities in the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationmoving slowly on a labeling decision, the NSWA decided to go aheadwith its own labeling program in conjunction with its PR firm,Fitzgerald Productions Inc. (Margate, Fla.).     A "gold seal" label was created that would identify to consumersthose waters whose producers had gone through an NSWA-designedcertification.  The unveiling of the program was used as a news hookto build visibility for NSWA's position among consumers and keygovernment officials.     A news release announcing the program was sent by mail and wireto about 1,000 print and broadcast media in early November, 1994. This was timed to raise public awareness in the weeks leading up to anexpected December decision by the Food and Drug Administrationregarding bottled water labeling.     Packets sent to many news media also included names of third-party experts that NSWA had cultivated, whom the media could call foroutside opinions on the merits of the labeling issue.     Follow-up calls by Fitzgerald resulted in a number of telephoneand in-person interviews with Jim Heaton, the head of NSWA.     The press release and media contact resulted in widespread mediacoverage.  Among the most significant:     -- a report by WTVJ-TV (Miami), which was sent around the nationon NBC's network feed;     -- appearances by NSWA representatives on two television talkshows, "The Susan Wornick Consumer Show" (Boston), and the "Issues andAnswers" program on Montgomery Cable TV in Washington, D.C.'s Marylandsuburbs (where most of the FDA offices are located).     Many smaller or consumer-interest magazines carried the story,and included information asking readers to contact governmentofficials and press for accurate spring water labeling.Lobbying the FDA     NSWA executives and member companies testified before the Foodand Drug Administration, providing information about the differencesbetween spring water and well water.  NSWA obtained permission fromscientists at the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S.Geological Survey for their views on spring and well water to beincluded in NSWA testimony.     Ultimately, the FDA came out with a ruling that, on the surface,supported NSWA's position.  However, according to Elaine Fitzgerald,the ruling contains loopholes that appear to allow non-spring watercompanies to continue to label their water as spring water.  As aresult, the NSWA is continuing with its media and labeling campaign.

Both the House of Representatives and Senate voted to overridePresident Clinton's veto of the Securities Litigation Bill, whichbecame law with the Dec. 22 Senate vote, following the House's Dec. 20override vote.     "I think it's a very important, positive development," saidRobert Leahy, vice president/corporate relations for Bowater Inc., whohad worked actively on National Association of Manufacturers'committees to support passage.  "The good news on this is the 'safeharbor' provision, which will allow executives to speak morefreely...in putting forward assessments of where you see thingsmoving."     It should put a damper on shareholder litigation, said DavidOlson, vice president of investor and public relations at HealthSystems International Inc..  "The rise of shareholder litigationreally did put an unwarranted muzzle on many companies' ability totalk about their conditions and their prospects," he said.     Olson gave much of the credit for the passage of the law to theNational Investor Relations Institute, which had lobbied and mountedgrassroots efforts for most of the year (PR NEWS, July 17).Provisions of the Measure     The new law's provisions will:-- make it harder to be sued if forecasts do not come to pass, byincluding a "safe harbor" that allows spokespersons to communicateforward-looking information--with the caveats that these are notguarantees, and could be affected by other factors;-- make it harder for plaintiffs to file cases, by requiring them toshow evidence that suggests that corporate insiders knew they werecommitting fraud;-- limit attorneys' fees, (which at times swallowed a major portion ofsettlements), and allow punishment if judges determine that they havefiled "frivolous" lawsuits.     The National Investor Relations Institute has mailed to members afive-page summary of the new law's implications.

Companies get better annual reports when their roster ofcorporate officers includes a PR executive, according to a recentstudy conducted for PR NEWS by annual report maven Sid Cato.     In an analysis of 1994 and 1995 annual reports, Cato, whopublishes a newsletter on annual reports and conducts a yearlyconference, found that just over 10 percent of the hundreds of annualshe reviewed listed a PR executive as an officer of the company.  Butthese annuals were markedly better, according to his analyses, whichare based on standard indicators related to depth of financialdisclosure, clarity, level of detail in the chairman's letter, etc.     Specifically, Cato found that:     -- about 14 percent of annuals by companies with PR officersreflected positively on companies (in terms of his indicators)compared to only 3 percent for other companies;     -- most of the reports by companies with PR officers included twofeatures that Cato regards as critical: a percentage-change columnwith the up-front financial highlights (57 percent had it), and anobvious theme on the annual's cover (all had it).     -- all reports by companies with PR officers met Cato'srequirements for "attractiveness," while only 3 percent of reportsoverall met his standard.     For other companies, only about one-quarter had the financialpercentage-change column, and just over one-half (55 percent) hadcover themes. (Cato, 616/344-2286.)
