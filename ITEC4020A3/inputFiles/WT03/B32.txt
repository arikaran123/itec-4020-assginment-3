During December,NASA mounted one of its most ambitious effort since the Moon landings,the Hubble Telescope repair mission. As anyone who has been on Earth forthe past few months probably knows, this mission required six EVAs(extra-vehicular activity) of more than six hours each. In two personteams, astronauts removed, replaced and repaired many components of theHubble telescope. What interests us about this mission is that it was thefirst time that VR was used as a significant part of mission training,both for flight crew and ground-based team members.We first reported on the Hubble Mission Trainer in our November/December1992 issue. At that time Bowin Loftin and his team working in theSoftware Technology Branch at the Johnson Space Center (Houston, Texas)had just finished their first prototype of the system. We found itexciting and innovative. During the last months of 1993 the system wasput into operation. NASA used the system as an auxiliary training toolfor 121 Flight Controllers, real people with line responsibility, whorelied on the system for real training, for a real mission.We spoke with several people involved with this training project, and theconsensus among them is that this was a highly successful trainingtechnique. Said Page Lucas, a Flight Controller, and the liaison betweenthe Controllers and the Software Section, "I thought this was a veryefficient way to train flight controllers. It exceeded my expectations."She explained that this was because the VR system helped them visualizeand understand procedures and equipment much better than the standardbooks, models and diagrams.As Lucas explained, the system was used for 200 hours of training. Eachteam member spent about 30-40 minutes in the system on two separateoccasions. People used the system in groups of three, with one person inthe HMD and the other two watching monitors. There was continuos verbalinteraction among the team members.The training was designed to provide basic understanding of each EVA,therefore the simulations were simplified in scope and reduced in time.The astronauts needed six hours to complete the COSTAR installation, butin the simulation, the task was done in one hour. Most tasks were dividedinto two parts, which were worked through on separate occasions.Simplification involved eliminating details like bolt removal, and movinginto position to do various jobs. What was left was the essence of eachtask, such as order of operations, the locations of and familiarizationwith components, and the cooperation needed on EVA teams. In Lucas'words, the training ensured that "flight controllers were all speakingthe same language on the Hubble mission". Using the VR system, she toldus, controllers were able to more quickly visualize and understandprocedures.According to Steve Potter, Payload Training Supervisor, "we really likedthe system. It really tied [the operations and procedures] all together."He explained that this type of training has been done using traditional2D drawings, procedure descriptions, and scale models. While thosetechniques work well, VR adds another modality that is especially usefulfor those with different learning styles. He would like to see moredetailed graphics and interactions, but felt that the system met hisexpectations very well. His group is now looking at other areas oftraining that may benefit from this interface, including pilot andcommander training, and further payload operations training.Lead Timeline Officer, Alan Bartos, was enthusiastic about the system,his first VR experience. He has responsibility for scheduling operationsduring a mission. The VR system gave him a new outlook on therequirements of various tasks. "Seeing it in action gave us a newappreciation for what had to happen and how it happens. I thought it wasreally excellent." This deeper understanding helps him know which tasksfit together well, so the crew's time is used more efficiently.A similar system was used by the flight crew to evaluate RemoteManipulator System, (RMU, the robot arm) planning, and to refine thechoreography of moving the large and delicate arm and its cargo. The RMUwas used both to move the Hubble itself, as well as a mobile workplatform for the astronauts. The VR simulator used by the astronautsmodeled the arm controls, located in the aft cabin of the space shuttle,and also permitted the Mission Specialist to "grab and move" the arm tocheck positioning.Tim Saito, Senior Software Engineer, pointed out that the VR system isonly supplementary at this time. The system is constrained by computingresources and the quality of HMDs. However, the entire team, both thedevelopers and users of the system, feel that this first trainingexercise was a great success. The Software Technology Branch is alreadystarting their next training system, which will be used for the scheduledHubble maintenance mission in 1995.While there are obvious shortcomings in this system, we feel that it isof historical significance. We believe that this exercise was the firstto use VR on this scale, over 100 participants, and for this length oftime, over 200 hours of training. It is important that this was realtraining, not a evaluation of a demo system. Probably most important,everyone involved feels that the VR simulation added value to thetraining regimen. We salute NASA and everyone who developed the HubbleMission Trainer for a job well done.Contact: NASA, Johnson Space Center, R.

The newest entry into the HMD arenais the VFX1, a joint development of Advanced Gravis and ForteTechnologies. The new unit, which was shown for the first time at theWinter Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas, is a full color, mediumresolution design with PC interface. The VFX1 incorporates two EpsonAMLCDs to provide stereo 428 x 244 resolution with a 46.4: x 35.2: fieldof view. Included is Forte's 3DOF, proprietary, hybrid tracking system,called Virtual Orientation System (VOS), providing pitch, roll and yawdata. Input may be either PAL or NTSC video, with stereo sound optional.VFX1 is compatible with Advanced Gravis' UltraSound 3D sound card, andother sound cards. It also includes a VESA features adapter whichinterfaces its controller card to standard VGA display systems. Theweight of the actual unit is not yet determined, but is expected to beless than 2 pounds. Ergonomic features include adjustable interpupilarydistance (IPD), and the "Smart Visor", an optics mounting system thatlets the user pivot the optical unit out of the line of sight. Focusadjustments are independent for each eye. The unit also adjusts for headsize.The VFX1 is scheduled for release in the 3rd quarter of 1994 at a retailprice of under us$1,000. We have also been told that the HMD may be madeavailable without the VOS tracking system, and the VOS will be soldseparately at an as yet undetermined price, starting this coming Fall.

The announcement which may have the mostimpact on  world builders is that Division has debuted their new 100 VPXgraphics system. Based on the University of North Carolina's PixelPlanes architecture, this single board implementation includes 8,192processors that provide two channels of video output providing either astereoscopic display, or high throughput monoscopic video. Two to theEISA form-factor boards can be used in together to increase throughputfurther or to provide four video channels. The 100 VPX is rated byDivision at 300,000 texture mapped, Z-buffered, specularly lit polygonsor spheres per second. The graphics system is available as a stand-alonefor inclusion in OEM systems for #12,000 or in an integrated system, theProVISION 100 VPX, for #50,000.Working with Volvo UK, Division has developed a crash simulator thatVolvo is using as a selling tool at auto shows. Running on a ProVISIONsystem, the simulation models the interior of a Volvo 850, its exterior,the countryside and another vehicle. The animation of the experiencematches a current Volvo advertisement, in which the Volvo is struck fromthe side at 25 miles per hour. Designed to illustrate the strength ofthe side impact protection system, the model will also be used fortraining and ergonomic evaluation.Finally, two entertainment companies have announced liaisons withDivision. UK-based Global Entertainments has formed a new subsidiary,Virtual Reality Games, Ltd., that will develop a new series ofinteractive entertainment systems using Division equipment andconsulting expertise. The American company, Alternate Worlds Technologyalso recently announced that they will be building systems based onDivision hardware and software.

The sale is part of aChapter 11 reorganization that VPL filed in US Bankruptcy courton November 12.VPL initially filed for Chapter 11 protection last March whenit needed protection from numerous creditors and a foreclosuresuit brought by Thomson. Thomson was foreclosing on loans thatwere collateralized with VPL's patent portfolio.The VPL patent portfolio includes two optical flex sensorpatents, the glove control patent, "3D Swivel" licenses, and, atleast, ten additional patent applications covering a range ofkey technologies. Many of the applications were filed in both USand Europe. These intellectual properties would give Thomson astrategic holding in the VR industry since they could bringconsiderable resources to bear in any patent protection suit.As part of the proposed $150,000 purchase, Thomson willforgive approximately $2 million in loans to VPL. However, theplan allows Thomson to retain claim to a $150,000 DIP loan(Debtor-in-possession) made last September. VPL used the DIPloan to cover the cost of maintaining the patent portfolio.Thomson will acquire VPL's assets free and clear without liensand encumbrances.Unsecured creditors do not fair well under VPL's plan.Unsecured claims, totaling approximately $1.5 Million, will bepaid $0.05 on the dollar. Among the unsecured creditors is TomZimmerman who is owed $212,000 for royalties on VPL's importantglove control patent. Zimmerman invented the DataGlove and islisted as an inventor on several VPL patents.After the sale of assets to Thomson, VPL will change its nameand the company will be liquidated under Chapter 7. NeitherVPL's president, Jean-Jacque Grimmaud, or Comptroller, AlanDefrenne, are planning to join Thomson or any new company formedby Thomson with the acquired assets.The court is scheduled to approve the reorganization onFebruary 16. A previous approval date was rescheduled because ofobjections from one of VPL's unsecured creditors.Back to Headline List CopyrightCYBEREDGE JOURNAL via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY 1994Recent VR Books: Readers' RoundupThe end of 1993 brought a flurry of new VR books.

It is a collection of loosely connected chaptersthat were mostly written by professors, and indeed, the book "is based ona Institution of Electrical Engineers vacation school held at theUniversity of Reading (UK)". The style is didactic, and veryAnglo-centric. We found the approach somewhat round-about, for example,in the section titled "A definition of virtual reality" the authorprovides a full page of discourse, but leaves the reader lacking aconcise definition. As close as one gets is the opening sentence,"Virtual Reality can be described as the science of integrating man withinformation".

Nearly 400 peopleattended conference session or tutorials, more than thatattended the first ever VR Video festival, produced by Louis M.Brill. There were two evening Keynote speeches, one by RobertStone, head of the Advanced Robotics Research Lab in Salford,England, and the other by CEJ Publisher and Editor, Ben Delaney.There were 34 exhibitors, and there were a couple of thousandpeople who came to see them. Finally, the event concluded with afull-day Venture Capitol Forum, during which fourteen buddingentrepreneurs made presentations about their companies, andtheir growth opportunities.Another interesting note was the composition of the crowd.Unlike most West Coast shows, the cyberpunk contingent was mostnoticeable by its absence. The people at this show were businessprofessionals, conservative in dress and manner. They were thereto see if there is money in VR. As their focus was finance andbusiness, so will be the focus of this report.>>The business of VRThe first business-oriented session brought together twoveterans of the VR production house business and one of the fewmarket researchers in the field. Chet Dagit, Director ofBusiness Affairs for WorlDesign (Seattle, Wash, USA) discussedtheir experience in getting a world building company off theground. From Dagit's presentation, we see that it may not beeasy. In his discussion of Financing and Fund Raising, herecited a litany of every problem known to small businesses:lack of capital, difficulty in attracting top people, beingunsure of the product, and the paradoxical problem of nopractical experience and no way to get it. "It sounds clichid",he said, "but know your customer." In fact, much of Dagit'spresentation was clichid, which doesn't mean it was unimportant,but that the problems of starting a business are universal.Dagit emphasized, though perhaps unintentionally, how importantit is for those getting into the VR business to understand notjust VR, but also business.A more successful experience was related by Ian Capon, formthe London VR studio, Virtual S. Capon and partner PeterWilliams co-founded Virtual S in April of 1991 with the missionof providing commercial VR for what ever purposes their clientsfound appropriate. With a client list that includes Canon OfficeProducts, Volvo, British Telecom, Compaq and others, Virtual Smay be the most prolific VR production facility in the world.Capon described their purpose-built worlds, and explained thatthe objectives of the clients were primarily one of two:building trade show volume or product introduction tours. Whilethese worlds are largely custom designed, Virtual S makes use ofa common production strategy; they re-use modules, slightlycustomizing them for individuality. This saves a substantialamount of time, and enables them to provide high quality at arelatively low price.Capon offered a few insights that may be valuable for othersentering the world of VR production for hire. "The fullpotential of VR will only be realized through greatproductions", he said, emphasizing that "virtual reality isn't acomputing technology, it's more like the telephone of thefuture", ubiquitous and easy to use. He also stressed the needto make effective use of the technology that works, especiallysound. He described the professional, multi-track soundproduction facility in the Virtual S studio as providing animportant finishing touch to the visual aspects of worlds. "Weenphasize audio", which he pointed out is, "one of the mostimportant, and undersold parts of virtual reality". Capon cameoff very professionally, as a man with a commercial sensibilityand a bottom-line orientation, and was refreshing in his candor.A report on market considerations in VR entertainment wasprovided by Carrie Heeter, from Michigan State University (EastLansing, MI, USA). For nearly two years Heeter has been doingresearch on the demographics and motivations of players of VRgames, specifically BattleTech players in both Chicago andWalnut Creek, California. Her conclusions, based on hard data,present an interesting picture of BattleTech aficionados, andoffer guidance for others entering the VR LBE arena.Heeter found that 93% of BattleTech players are male, butthat women may be attracted if the games become lessmilitaristic. 62% of players played more than four times, whilean impressive 42% have played more than 10 games. Repeatbusiness is essential to financial success, and the factors thatkeep 'em coming were no surprise: "It's fun", It'sexhilarating", It's challenging", "The staff is friendly".Interestingly, the sixth most popular reason is "It's fun toblow up people", which belies some of the more noble rationaleoffered for these games. The players are not fools, however,with 86% having at least some college attendance. Heeterbelieves that virtual travel may be a strong draw for women, andnotes that there is a strong correlation between VR game fansand science fiction readers. Heeter's research will be publishedlater this spring in its entirety.>>Voices of experienceFrom William Bottoms, Senior Vice President at the investmentfirm of Patricoff and Company, came a fascinating look at the VRindustry from the investor's point of view. Patricoff was anearly investor in VPL Research, having put in us$50,000 in 1986,and is part of the group which recently brought the VirtualityGroup (formerly W Industries) public. His presentation was aprimer in funding, tempered by as much experience as anyinvestor has had in the VR business, which is, he said quotingJaron Lanier, a bit "like surfing in an avalanche of boulders".Bottoms sees a tremendous potential for VR, which he expectsto be the preferred interface for simulation, communication,artificial intelligence and multimedia applications. The successof the VR industry will be driven by its ability to reduce cost,improve interfaces, and implement efficient programming methods,he cautioned. Bottoms identified six areas of immediateopportunity for entrepreneurs and investors in VR:     *  Sensors     *  Telemetry     *  Display technology     *  Graphics engines     *  Software development tools     *  Programming/ApplicationsPatricia E. Glovsky, of the Polygon Capital Group, startedoff by polling the audience. The show of hands indicated that20% were already running a VR company, 10% were looking forfunding and 5% were investors. She discussed the objectives oflarge funders: a 1000% or greater return in 5-7 years, andstressed the importance of a business plan that demonstratesthat income potential. One way to provide that return is apublic offering, the strategy taken by Virtuality Group,Division, and Virtual Universe in the past year. While this maybe quite profitable, it imposes significant up front expense andongoing regulatory burdens on the company, and needs to beconsidered carefully. Glovesky's talk meshed well withPatricoff's to provide a good foundation for budding VRcapitalists.We were impressed with this show. Once again, the Mecklerorganization and conference chair, Sandra Helsel did a good jobof providing solid organization and valuable information. Theshow floor was bustling, and many of the vendors with whom wehave spoken told us they did good business. The two eveningsessions were not well attended, and probably need either morepromotion, a scheduling change, or to be dropped, but that was aminor flaw in what was otherwise a worthwhile show.Contact: Mecklermedia, 11 Ferry Lane West, Westport, CT 06880USA, 203 226-6967, FAX 203-454-5840.Back to Headline List CopyrightCYBEREDGE JOURNAL via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY 1994Criterion's RenderWarePC Renders at Startling SpeedWhat's faster than a speeding bullet, but less powerful thanyour average workstation? It's a PC running the new RenderWaresoftware from Criterion Software, a spin-off of Canon's UKResearch Centre. RenderWare is an interactive, 3D graphicsprogramming API for Microsoft Windows and other environments.That means that you won't find it on the shelves of your localsoftware emporium. RenderWare is intended for developers, andprovides them with a set of routines that dramaticallyaccelerates 3D graphics on PCs with no special hardware. It isbased on new algorithms, first reported here in our May/June1992 Industry Outlook section, on which there have been 20patent applications filed worldwide.Criterion showed RenderWare at recent press conferences inNew York City and San Francisco. They demonstrated itscapabilities on a Toshiba 486/DX50 laptop computer with 12megabytes of RAM. The system will run in 4 MB, in our office wehave run it easily in 8MB, in our standard Windowsconfiguration. (A Gateway 2000 486/DX33 EISA, 256-color, 1068 x780 ISA video, Windows for Workgroups 3.1, Norton Desktop 2.2,and various other Windows programs.) David Lau-Kee, leaddeveloper of RenderWare, and President of the new company toldus that on the demo system, we were seeing texture mapped,animated, lighted images being updated at a rate of 40,000polygons/second. The subjectively rated frame rate was about 15-20 fps. On our office system, we observed a frame rate of about10-15 fps, but this still exceeds the performance of any similarpackage we have seen. The demos presented by Criterion includedreflective and other surfaces texture mapped on various objects.This texture mapping, according to co-developer and VP of R&D,Adam Billyard, "doesn't cost you anything as far as performanceis concerned". The demo also permitted one to use "drop anddrag" techniques to pick up new textures and objects, and dropthem into a RenderWare window.Criterion rates the software at 40K poly/sec on a 486/DX50using a 4K polygon model transformed, clipped, painted andsoftware double-buffered in a 400 x 400 pixel viewport.Performance scales with CPU power. The software is writtenentirely in C, with no operating system dependency, making iteasily portable. The geometry for RenderWare scenes is stored ina proprietary ASCII format, with converters for other fileformats included. The use of ASCII makes the building of self-modifying worlds fairly simple. At this time, only 8 bit coloris supported, but 16 bit color and true color support are in theworks, as is sound support. The library of 32 bit code is about300K in size.Features*       Available now on Windows 3.1, Macintosh, Sun (X11).

You would have heard someentertaining, informative, innovative presentations and some dull,derivative, boring ones. You would have seen around 15,000 slides andnearly as many overhead cells. It would soon become obvious that thelength of the list of initials after a speaker's name is not indicativeof the quality of thought or presentation.You would have seen 839 exhibits at these 21 shows. They ranged from atablecloth on which was placed some equipment and brochures, up tomulti-hundred-thousand dollar show stands. They were attended by close tothree thousand enthusiastic salespeople. Some of them were staffed byattractive young ladies who were apparently not chosen for their VRexpertise. You would have quickly realized that the price of the exhibithas no bearing on the quality of the products.During the 65 days of these symposia, you would have eaten 41.6 awfulpre-made sandwiches, drunk 382.6 cups of luke-warm coffee, waited 33.8hours in line for lunch and dinner, spoke to about a zillion people andhauled off 418 kilograms of paper, much of which you discarded in yourhotel room. You wore out 2.1 pairs of shoes.>It comes down to dollarsConferences cost a lot to attend, and can provide major paybacks. Theycan also be major time and money wasters. Last year, 56,123 peopleattended the conferences we list here. Each spent an average of threedays in attendance, plus travel time, let's say 1-1/2 days for travel foreach person. That makes 252,535.5 days spent at VR conferences last year(691.9 years!) Assuming that each person's time is worth $200 a day (avery conservative estimate), that time was worth $50,510,698! Plus, eachperson paid an average of $510 for each conference, a total of$28,609,367 in all. Add to that the cost of plane fares, hotel andrestaurant charges and other incidentals, and you have a hefty sum.>Getting your money's worthThat's why we provide these Conference Rankings each year. Like the restof the VR industry, the conference business has grown. Unlike the rest ofthe VR industry, the conference business is very profitable. And alsounlike much of the VR industry, conferences effect nearly everyone in thebusiness. Either you attend a conference, or the people you're trying tocontact are attending. Regardless of your level of involvement, it'simportant that you spend your time and money wisely.A few notes on how to use the rankings. Most important is how well theconference program fits your information needs. There are essentiallyfour types of conferences included here: Scientific VR meetings, VR tradeshows, Special-interest VR gatherings, and Non-VR shows that include asignificant VR component.Remarkable as it may seem, not every 1993 VR conference is included inour rankings. We know of at least four others for which we were unable toobtain information by press time. This year we will redouble our effortsto get this information for every important meeting.RAIS, our overall top ranked conference,Informatique, or the IEEE meeting were your best bets last year, andprobably will be next year, too. They provide a preponderance of researchpapers, most juried, and provide complete sets of proceedings. There arefewer exhibits at these meetings, usually less social activity, and lot'sof data.For people with a general interest in VR, and for executives andmarketing types, the VR trade shows are the most useful. These aregenerally bigger shows, with major exhibit areas, and more socialactivities, ideal for networking. Many new products are introduced atthese shows, and usually attendees get to try them out.The special interest shows are hard to summarize, since by definition,they are narrowly focused and esoteric. Two of these stand out asproviding exceptional programs: the Virtual Reality and Persons withDisabilities Conference, and the International Conference on Cyberspace.The former is explained by its title. The Conference on Cyberspace is aunique meeting, bringing together presentations on the social impact ofnew technologies, the importance of gender in cyberspace, providingaccess to new technologies to disadvantaged people, and much more. It'swild and woolly, and very exciting.The non-VR-specific shows include the biggest listed here: SIGGRAPH andTechnology 2003. SIGGRAPH is the computer graphics show the whole worldwaits for. With hundreds of exhibits, scores of presentations, thousandsof attendees, and dozens of parties, SIGGRAPH is all things to allpeople. VR has taken root here, and though it is a small part of thebigger picture, SIGGRAPH is an important VR show. The othernon-VR-specific shows have various foci, and provide VR as an important,but secondary, part of the program.Our rankings this year, the third year we've provided them, are producedin essentially the same manner as previous years. Each conference israted on a 0 (awful/none) to 10 (excellent/all) scale in eightcategories. These raw scores are weighted to reflect the importance ofthe categories, for example, Percent VR is weighted 2.5 times moreheavily than Entertainment/Parties. The weighted scores are thennormalized on a 0 to 10 scale that is used for the actual ranking. Asnoted earlier, the content of each conference is more important than theabsolute rank, as you decide how well it meets your needs.Finally, we must note that two of these conferences were co- sponsored byCyberEdge Journal. They are the Virtual Reality and Persons withDisabilities conference, and the New York Virtual Reality Expo. We havemade every effort to rate these conferences objectively, but feel thatyou need to know of our affiliation with them.>>The Top Ranked Conferences<Overall Rankings[Overall rankings and details are available from the publisher.

Paray and James P. Jenkins, (C) 1994NOTE: The opinions set forth in this article are solely those of theauthors and do not represent official NASA policy on any issue discussed.Mention the words "products liability" to a virtual reality productmanufacturer and you might get a blank stare in return. Many virtualreality product manufacturers are simply not in tune with the broad brushdevastation this theory of law can inflict on a growing company'soverhead. Some creative lawyers and inventive expert witnesses havegenerated a cottage industry by using pseudo-science to influencejuries,. With proper due diligence, virtual reality product manufacturerscan avoid having to waste time defending lawsuits and waste money inincreased insurance premiums.The law of products liability is generally easy to understand butdifficult to apply. Under the law of most states, one who manufactures,distributes, or sells a product in a defective condition unreasonablydangerous to the user is subject to liability for physical harm caused bythe product if 1) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such aproduct and 2) it is expected to and does reach the user withoutsubstantial change in the condition in which it is sold.  Lawsuits can bepursued against the seller of the product even if the seller hasexercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the productand the user or consumer of the product has not bought the product fromor entered into any contractual relation with the seller.  Simply put,the manufacturer, distributor or seller is strictly liable to theconsumer for all injuries sustained from use of the defective productafter the product has entered the stream of commerce.Under the law of most states, the existence of a "defect" or unreasonablydangerous condition is a prerequisite to recovery. A product may be in adefective condition, or unreasonably dangerous to the user, by virtue ofa manufacturing defect, a design defect, or inadequate warnings ordirections. Whether a product has a "manufacturing defect" can bedetermined by comparing it with other units from the same assembly line.A product with a design defect is not reasonably fit, suitable or safefor its intended purpose.Some states provide that a manufacturer or seller is not liable for anyinjuries to a user if at "the time the product left the control of themanufacturer, there was not a practical and technically feasiblealternative design that would have prevented the harm withoutsubstantially impairing the reasonably anticipated or intended functionof the product." Because this "state-of-the-art" defense is based on thestate of the scientific knowledge, it tends to expand faster than itsassimilation by industry.Lastly, a product may be unsafe if it fails to adequately warnforeseeable users as to dangers inherent in the use of the product. Soundbusiness practice requires virtual reality product manufacturers to fullyexplore current technology and potential liability issues before productsare marketed for public use.Virtual reality product manufacturers should be concerned with theperceived possible physical effects of HMDs and electromagnetic trackingdevices placed near the body.  Most of the tracking devices on the marketemploy an electromagnetic sensor technology. These tracking devicesgenerally operate at over 100 Hz, and they are placed near users for onlyshort periods of time. Whether the short term exposure to fieldsgenerated by electromagnetic tracking devices can cause harm to users hasbeen given little mention in the virtual reality literature.Although ionizing radiation such as x-rays or gamma rays are able toknock-out electrons from atoms and cause damage to DNA and tissue,non-ionizing radiation such as ELF-EMFs do not displace electrons as theypass through tissue. Evidence is inconclusive that human exposure toELF-EMF electric and magnetic fields can increase the risk of cancer andleukemia. (See "Extremely Low Frequency Electric and Magnetic Fields andRisk of Human Cancer, 11 Bio-Electromagnetics 91, 92 (1990)). Indeed, agood deal of research indicates that there is no danger due to extendedELF-EMF exposure. For example, a study conducted by Southwest ResearchInstitute that was reported in the September 1993 Industrial Health &Hazards Update indicates that exposure to 60 Hz electric and magneticfields on non-human primates did not cause significant problems.Notwithstanding this research, the fact remains that the choice of whichexposure parameters constitute a proper safety zone is difficult tomeasure.Paul Brodeur, in a series of New Yorker magazine articles and two books,the latest one titled The Great Power-Line Cover-Up: How the Utilitiesand the Government are Trying to Hide the Cancer Hazard Posed byElectromagnetic Fields, has created a cottage industry by speculating asto the dangers of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields(ELF-EMFs). These fields are in the 30-300 Hertz (Hz) range.  Althoughcommentators in the August 5, 1992 issue of the Journal of AmericanMedical Association state that any conclusion of human health risk due toELF-EMF exposure is premature, the fact remains that there are vocalgroups seeking to exploit any ambiguities in the medical literature. Onesuch group is a nation-wide group of lawyers who collectively callthemselves the Electromagnetic Radiation Case Evaluation Team (EMRCET).EMRCET seeks out ELF- EMF cases in order to create legal precedents forsubsequent cases. In other words, they generate business by using thepopular media to sensationalize phantom dangers and exploit fears.Several courts have recently rebuked such tactics. For example,Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission Administrative Law Judge HubertSmolen ruled in September of 1993 that evidence of dangers associatedwith ELF-EMFs "taken as a whole remains inclusive".Even without the medical evidence, there are ELF-EMF products liabilitylawsuits being filed and there is money being spent defending thesesuits. According to an article in the November 2, 1993 Wall StreetJournal, more than a hundred lawsuits and regulatory disputes involvingEMF complaints have been filed nationwide. Because present virtualreality technology relies heavily on electromagnetic tracking devices,safety concerns and preventive litigation techniques should be analyzedwhile the industry is in its infancy.Although there is no reason to believe the electromagnetic trackingdevices are anything but safe, there is still no available talisman toward off groups such as EMRCET and the circulation-driven media.Accordingly, there are three business strategies virtual reality productmanufacturers can employ to better the likelihood that a jury willdetermine a product is safe.First, virtual reality products manufacturers should obtain a basicunderstanding of the proper use of warnings. A product may be unsafe ifit fails to adequately warn foreseeable users as to dangers inherent inthe use of the product. This duty to warn is a continuing one. Itrequires a manufacturer to provide warnings of dangers that themanufacturer discovered or reasonably should have discovered after theproduct left its control. Courts use an objective standard to determinethe adequacy of a product warning. An adequate warning is "one that areasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances would haveprovided with respect to the danger, and that communicates adequateinformation on the dangers and safe use of the product, taking intoaccount the characteristics of, and the ordinary knowledge common to, thepersons by whom the product is intended to be used. . . ."Simply put, a product warning must illuminate the mind of the reasonableuser by explaining risks not reasonably appreciated when a product is inuse. A manufacturer's liability for failure to warn is always contingentupon proof that the missing warning was indeed the proximate cause of aplaintiff's injuries. And, the issue of proximate causation turns onwhether proper warnings by the manufacturer would have prevented theharm. For example, in order to warn against the possibility of physicalinjury due to movements made while navigating in cyberspace, it would beprudent to offer a potential user an instruction leaflet or present avideo demonstration warning the user not to make sudden wide-rangingmotions while navigating in a virtual reality system. There is arebuttable presumption that a plaintiff would have followed such awarning if it had been given.Determining whether warnings and instructions are adequate is not an easytask. For example, because a clear understanding of all potential hazardsand consequences of injury must be had before any warnings orinstructions can be created, it is difficult to determine safetystandards until a suitable institution or governmental agency imposessome safety parameters.  After such information is obtained, severalimportant questions must be asked. Does the warning or instructiondescribe how to avoid the hazard? Would the warning or instruction make adifference?, i.e., would anyone bother to heed the warning or follow theinstructions? It may even be advisable to liken a virtual reality systemsexperience with an amusement park ride and to list those persons whoshould not "ride" in cyberspace.Second, virtual reality product manufacturers should openly discusssafety issues and pool health and safety information now that theindustry is still in its infancy. Shared safety research would benefitall segments of the industry. Indeed, the common goal of building acustomer base for virtual reality products would be furthered ifmanufacturers pooled their resources.Third, the formation of a Virtual Reality Technology Business Consortiumwould be a cost-effective means of dealing with these virtual realityproduct safety issues. Associations such as the Product LiabilityPrevention and Defense Group in Falls Church, Virginia already helpsmanufacturers of machinery improve their defense against litigation.Commensurate with their ability to pay and their percentage of activityin developing virtual reality products, qualifying start-up companiescould even join this consortium.Virtual reality product manufacturers are urged to address these issuesin a straightforward, practical manner before waves of lawsuits are givena chance to materialize. Although it certainly does not make any sense tobegin preparing for a specific lawsuit before it is filed, virtualreality product manufacturers are urged to consider implementing theabove measures in order to prevent the first suit from going to trial.Similarly, it is also a good idea for manufacturers to meet with the losscontrols representative of their insurance carrier to discuss methods forevaluating possible risks of loss before any claims are made. Simply put,although entrepreneurs are by definition "risk takers," there is noreason to gamble on the ingenuity of groups such as EMRCET.>The Authors:Paul E.

Given the fact that their products are placed so close to the body,manufacturers of HMDs and electromagnetic tracking devices should beparticularly mindful of products liability issues.

A sample ofwhat is said and what it actually means:Advanced design: Most of our own people don't have a clue on how itworks either; All new: Parts not interchangeable with existing models;Automatic: You can not repair it yourself; and Breakthrough: We finallyfigured out how to sell it. And talking of breakthroughs, there is thislittle incident about the shades of reality at press meets. Recently, ata gathering of press people recently, for the launch of a leadingcompany's telecom product, all the invitees were flummoxed. The reasonwas that when the time came for the unveiling of the actual product,there was so much light and smoke and sound that at the end of the wholeshow a very strange, though expected, thing happened. Unable to witnessthe product, or the video, or the presenters themselves, the augustassembly took recourse to the only enticement left. And that was theprofuse champagne on call.

Oneof the most technology-friendly banks in India, Canara Bank's depositsare in the region of Rs 26,000 crore, with a net profit of Rs 250 crore.A techno-savvy banker, Shetty recently appointed as Director of theInstitute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS), an autonomous body withthe Governor of RBI as its Chairman. This body--which conductsrecruitment test for the banking sector and attests almost 40 lakhpeople every year--the world's largest testing organization. Shettyspoke to Latha Kuttappan and Sindhu Raj of DATAQUEST on a variety oftopics related to IT and banking. Excerpts:In your new capacity, you are going to push for computerization inIndian banks using the same as you did in Canara Bank?I can do it in my individual capacity. However, it will be theprerogative of the banks to draw up their plans. I certainly believethat it is the level of technology that decides who is going to be theleader tomorrow. So, it is in the interest of the banks to take ITseriously.How did computerization in Canara Bank come about?The bank already had introduced computerization and traditional AdvancedLedger Posting Machines (ALPMs) which used outdated PCs and obsoletetechnology. But now, we are only going in for state-of-the-arttechnology. When our largest branch (Delhi, Parliament street) wasautomated, the software was developed by the Canara Bank team andInfosys. What we developed there was for 132 activities. Banks abroadhave limited operations. So the software developed by foreign companiestake a long time to customize and runs into problems. As a result youloose the lead time in overtaking competitors.When will Canara Bank go online with live transactions?Bangalore and Delhi are already operational. We are waiting for PChidambaram, Finance Minister, who has agreed to inaugurate the firstnetworked public sector bank. We have introduced CashPoints (ATMs) as apart of our customer service scheme. Out of 80 branches in Bangalore, if10 can be put up as ATMs, it will be good. Since major frauds have takenplace, it is better to go on a pilot basis and develop a good auditsystem first.Many banks are complaining about lack of funds for computerization. Isthis true?I don't see why banks should complain about lack of funds. It is aquestion of investments and returns. One can't wait for returns first.For those banks that are running at a loss, the World Bank has comeforward to finance for technical upgradation programs.Where do Indian banks stand in compared to foreign banks?Indian Banks will definitely catch up. In terms of marketing,competency, expertise, and a variety of other functional abilities, weare second to none. What we lack is motivation and training. Our frontdesk has poor customer service. We are developing a new scheme where weintend putting well-trained and well-informed probationary officers atthe front desk. In addition to this, if an attitudinal change sets in,other banks will not be able to match us. Our advantage lies in physicalpresence. We are in almost all districts with 2,200 branches spreadacross the country. Our deposit base is more stable and dependable thanforeign banks. The key area in the future, I believe, is treasurymanagement. The niche areas for the twenty-first century will beinvestment, training, forex, and project appraisals.DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996VIGNETTE SPOTLIGHT: NEELAM DHAWAN, VP (DISTRIBUTION), TISLfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996In an industry where changing jobs has become more the rule than theexception, Neelam Dhawan stands out as an exemplanary exception. Thelady has moved after spending 14 long years in HCL HP, where she was GM(Marketing), to TISL as VP (Distribution). This is the first job changeshe has made after joining HCL straight from college in 1982. Thissudden move came after she was tipped to take over as the head of HCLGlobal Alliances, the newly formed HCL Group entity.Born and brought up in Delhi, Dhawan did her schooling from Convent ofJesus and Mary, and then went on to secure her degree in economics fromSt Stephens College. Armed with a Management degree from DelhiUniversity's Faculty of Management Studies, she failed to find favourwith Hindustan Lever and Asian Paints as they refused to take women inmarketing. Not willing to settle for the post of a "glorified clerk," asher brother called the job offer she received from ANZ Grindlays, shejoined HCL.After training, she was made incharge of the northern region sales whereshe remained till 1985. Next, she took over as the Assistant ProductManager and became a part of the team which was directly involved in thelaunch of Busybee systems. In 1995, she became the GM (Marketing).Despite enormous work pressure, Dhawan prefers a slow pace of life. Sheloves travelling, and dreams of going on a world tour, "an undefinedholiday" as she puts it, once she retires. She also plans to resume herwork in Mother Teresa's orphanage where she used to go and help duringher college days. But at the moment, with two young daughters and thedemands of her new job, she still has a lot more to accomplish beforeshe can even think of retirement.DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996VIGNETTE SPOTLIGHT: S RAMADORAIfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996"Never let problems overcome you.

In the software developmentfield, something that is the exact anti-thesis of this principle is atwork. Dubbed the theory of increasing returns, this essentially statesthat the more you sell, the easier it gets.This theory has been much acclaimed by many people who sadly fail torealize that this is not exactly praiseworthy because it rests on twocrutches--virtual monopolies and forced standards--and a crutch, nomatter how powerful, is unsightly. About the only good effect it has isthat it acts as an aphrodisiac for established players who control theindustry.If you care to examine matters in detail, you will realize that it isnot technology but the virtual monopoly of players like Microsoft thatforms the bedrock of the industry. This virtual monopoly is achieved byforcing standards on the user and the developer industry, and ensuringthat over a period of time they are generally tied down to thatstandard.I do not grudge the apparent advantage that companies like Microsoft,Netscape, and Sun have due to their clout in the OS/applications,browser market, and Internet development market respectively. What I'mworried about is the fact that this sort of a virtual monopoly cripplestechnological advances. Thanks to the success of Win95, the penetrationof Mac has been curbed and most users will never realize its powers.Another problem is that this also ties people to standards. Thedominance of Win95 essentially means that users and developers will findthat it is impossible to migrate to some other platform like the Mac. Inaddition to this, developers are forced to develop for a particularplatform because it is more prominent. Some may claim that a variant ofDarwin's survival of the fittest theory is at work, but the point I'mtrying to make is that the fittest product is perhaps not the best forthe user.The monopoly and standards issue hurts everybody, even its veryproponents. For example, Win95 would have been a much stable product hadit been engineered from the ground up, like Windows NT. But sadly,Microsoft was tied to its own outdated DOS and Win 3.1 standards, andbecause of this, in spite of its best efforts, Win95 falls short of themark.The Increasing returns theory rests on two crutches, Virtualmonopoly and forced standardsRoyalEDGETell me now, do you still find the theory of increasing returnslaudable? Shouldn't something like the software industry, which drivesall our lives to a large extent today, and is expected to form thefoundation of living in the near future, be based on better principles?Should we worship a principle that ties us down to the shoddiness of thepast, curbs innovation, and forces users and developers alike?No. Because the increasing returns theory is the shame of our realm. Therelationship between this theory and the software industry is similar tothe relationship between a junkie and his heroin--he may praise it forthe high and the happiness it provides, but it is a crutch,nevertheless.Dr RoyalE has a PhD from SHINE--The Sherlock Holmes Institute for NobleEminence.Warm Regards, RoyalE, for RoyalE Inc.The view expressed in this article are those of the author and do notnecessarily reflect the view of the publication.DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996PASSING THROUGH: DR ROBERT C CAMPfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996He is the pioneer in the field of benchmarking.

The markets which closed at 3406 on 21 August rose by just 102points to reach 3508 at the end of business hours on 6 September. The USattack on Iraq and fears of higher oil prices in India also affected thesentiments. Due to Telecom Scam involving the former CommunicationMinister Sukh Ram, the political scenario was also disquieting whileCMIE reported that industrial production grew by only 5 percent in thefirst quarter of 1996-97 as compared to a healthy growth of 23 percentin the corresponding quarter last year. The World Bank's fears of slowergrowth in India due to infrastructural bottlenecks, and somerecommendations by FIIs in key counters like SBI also dampened thisresponse. Whether the current upward move will withstand some of thenegative news filtering into the markets remains to be seen in thecoming weeks. Chances of this, however, remain dim in the currentcontext in any case, the market is likely to come down in the nearfuture.IT stocks were reasonably stable and some stocks like HCL HP and Zenithgained ground. Mastek reported a poor year with a relatively slow salesgrowth of 33 percent to reach 28.79 crore. Profitability was a casualtyled by lower margins on operations and higher interest costs.

The event was attended by over2000 people: developers, resellers, OEMs, consultants, academicians, andthe press from all over the world who had converged at the campus toexchange notes on the trends in the Unix world in particular, and the ITindustry in general. The best of minds met here and discussed the futureof the computing industry.A host of luminaries delivered the keynote speeches at the Quarry'sessions in the morning. They included Alok Mohan, President and CEO,SCO; Doug Michels, Executive VP, Chief Technology Officer, and Founder,SCO; Dick Watts, VP and GM HP, and the irrepressible Scott McNealy,President and CEO, Sun Microsystems. McNealy's presence was intriguingto many, since Sun Microsystems is SCO's arch rival in the Unix market.But then the event was for the Unix industry as a whole. Nevertheless,Scott chose to give his own reasons. A Top 10:10. They wanted somebody to do a Top 10 list.9.  Takeover rumors are always good for the stock price. (The conference    was rife with rumors that Sun has been courting SCO, which analysts    dismissed.)8.  Because Bill Gates (of Microsoft) wouldn't let Lew Platt (of    Hewlett-Packard) speak.7.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend.6.  SCO stands for Sun Collaboration Opportunity.5.  Santa Cruz can always use more Sun.4.  Because Bill Gates wouldn't speak free.3.  No other CEO would speak without AV support or demos.2.  The road to Santa Cruz leads through Scott's Valley.1.  It's Java stupid.A Network Computer (NC) debate titled Will The Network Computer Breakthe Windows Monopoly?' was held. One of the most influential computerjournalists in America, David Coursey, hosted the event and theparticipants were Hermasn Hauser, Founder of Acorn Computer and Chairmanof NChannel, Philippe Kahn, Co-founder and Chairman of StarfishSoftware, Zvi Alon, President and CEO of NetManage Inc., and PhilipJohnson, Director of Server Operating Environments at IDC. Kahn andHauser argued in favor of the network computer. After a heated debate,the wind blew in favour of network computing and the impact of Interneton the computing model.In addition to the debate, a special NC pavilion was set up fordevelopers to display their information appliances'. More than a dozenNC makers, including Sun Microsystems, HDS, Wyse Technology, and Dibadisplayed their NCs for the first time in public.Parallel conference sessions were held in three streams: Engineering,systems administration, and business. These sessions included everythingfrom developing Windows-friendly client server applications to sellingbetter Internet solutions talks on the internals of Gemini (SCO'snext-generation Unix systems project).Free UnixIn a move that empowers students, educators, and Unix system enthusiastswith free access to the world's most popular business computingenvironment, SCO announced plans to provide a free license to use itspopular Unix systems, including SCO OpenServer and SCO UnixWare toanyone in the world who wants to use them for educational purposes andunderstanding of Unix systems. The bold move has far-reachingimplications for the future of Unix platform and marks the public debutof SCO's stewardship of the Unix system.Mohan said, "This is only the second time in Unix's 25-year history thatthe owner of the technology has made this offer. The last time thishappened, a $ 60-billion industry was born."The Unix system was in its infancy when AT&T Bell Labs gave it free tocolleges and universities to help R&D projects. Soon, thousands ofstudents learnt to program on Unix systems. After graduation, they tooktheir knowledge into the corporate world, building a $ 60-billionindustry. The legacy of AT&T's gift to universities includes theInternet, WWW, multiprocessing, and much more. "SCO believes it is timeto return the favor," said Mohan, "and deliver the result of more than20 years of technical innovation back to educators and studentsworldwide."Road To Next-generation UnixSCO has developed a comprehensive roadmap and product strategy for Unixsystem users and developers to quickly and easily leverage theadvancements that SCO is making for small, medium, and enterprise-classenvironments. The SCO Gemini project is the cornerstone of thisactivity. Gemini' is the code-name of a SCO engineering project thatwill deliver next-generation Unix systems from the company. Gemini' isthe consolidation of the SCO Openserver and SCO Unixware product lineswith significant enhancements to meet the demands for a new generationof distributed computing environment. It is also the SCO platform whichwill provide the easiest path to 3-Dimensional Architecture (3DA)--theforthcoming 64-bit Unix system being co-developed by SCO and HP for theIntel Merced processor.The Unix system technology being jointly developed by HP and SCO willencompass a common set of APIs and will serve as the basis or engine'for the next-generation Unix operating environments that will be offeredby the two companies. Optimized for the Intel IA 64-bit Mercedmicroprocessor and based on an advanced 3DA, the Unix system willprovide a single development and porting target for 32-bit and 64-bitapplications, enabling OEMs and ISVs to accelerate their delivery of awide range of innovative customer solutions.Moving forward aggressively with their joint development agenda, HP andSCO announced the availability of the initial API specification of theirnext-generation 64/32-bit Unix systems for review by strategic softwaredevelopers and systems suppliers. Ensuring that the customers can takeadvantage of advanced 32-bit and 64-bit computing is a priority for bothcompanies.Endorsements And PartnershipsThere were a series of vendor endorsement announcements and strategicpartnerships. IBM announced support for SCO Internet strategy bydelivering its DB2 database for the SCO OpenServer platform ahead ofschedule. IBM also announced that its Net.Data product will beta thismonth providing interactive Web access from the SCO OpenServer platformto many data sources.IBM Net.Data delivers Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) to data storedin both IBM and other databases, enabling users on the Internet andintranet to access a variety of data sources with any Web browser.In an industry first, Oracle and SCO demonstrated Oracle7 ParallelServer running the SCO Unixware 2.1 system across Intel-processor-basedhardware servers. The hardware cluster included servers from Compaq,Digital, IBM, and Unisys, communicating with the same Oracle7 databaseresiding on a CLARiiON disk array. The demonstration holds significancesince it was the first time a fail-over' high-performance clustersolution running on Intel-processor-based hardware from numerous vendorswas shown to be a viable solution."Only SCO Unixware and Oracle7 Parallel Server can transparently combinesystems from different hardware manufactures into a single, highavailability cluster," said Mike Shelton, SCO's VP, EnterpriseSolutions. "This is a compelling example of SCO Unixware providing aunified operating system for Intel-based systems," he said.Propelled by a series of major developments, SCO Unixware continued itsfast-track into the enterprise marketplace. In four months, leadingcomputer companies (Compaq, Data General, Fujitsu, Intel, NCR, Olivetti,Siemens Nixdorf, Unisys) and ISVs established SCO Unixware as the Unixoperating system of choice for Intel-processor-based volume enterpriseservers. Newer OEMs are committing to shipping SCO Unixware with theirenterprise servers. SCO calls this the Big E Initiative.These vendors can focus more resources on developing value-addedtechnologies and more innovative solutions. ISVs benefit because theycan create a single binary source code for multiple hardware platforms.This enables them to dramatically cut their development costs whileproviding their customers with a clear path to the future. The reducedR&D costs will enable greater innovation and strengthen the entireenterprise computing market. Among these ISVs are PeopleSoft, MicroFocus, Tivoli, Oracle, and IBM.SCO has formed development partnerships for Gemini. These partnershipsinclude an alliance between SCO, Data General, ICL, and HAL to provideccNUMA (cache coherent Non-Uniform Memory Architecture) capability andprice/performance. SCO has also formed a strategic relationship withUnisys that includes cooperative development to build large systemscalability and capability for Unixware.SCO continues to gain momentum in the middleware software segment. Someof the products now available with SCO Unixware include transactionprocessing software from NCR (Top End), BEA Systems (Tuxedo), and SNI(OpenUTM). Additionally, Unisys and SNI are providing their mainframecommunication suites. Finally, leading-edge Object Request Brokers(ORBs) are also available from ICL (DAIS) and IONA Technologies (Orbix).Internet Strategy And NC/OSSCO announced addition of new components to the SCO Internet Family,featuring the availability of Netscape's FastTrack Server, the OracleWebServer, the Oracle PowerBrowser, standalone PPP from Morning StarTechnologies, the Internet-ready version of SCO TermVision, and therecently unveiled SCO Network Client/Operating System (NC/OS) product.In addition, SCO outlined its plans for the new components slated forversion 2.0 of the SCO Internet Family.SCO also announced the immediate OEM availability of its NC/OS, thefirst low cost, small footprint software designed specifically toprovide OEMs with a reliable, time-to-market solution for developing NCson standard Intel-processor-based hardware.The SCO NC/OS technology combines a small 1.5 MB footprint Unixoperating system, TCP/IP networking, with Netscape Navigator clientsoftware, and Java software to provide an open NC operating system thatcan run on Intel hardware. Building on its expertise in Unix operatingsystems, communication, and Internet technology, SCO is working withindustry leaders to provide this client solution for networked end-usersto access their intranet, Internet, and enterprise applications.Client IntegrationSetting the agenda for the Windows to Unix system integration market,SCO unveiled three new members of the SCO Vision family--SCO VisionFS,SCO XVision Eclipse, and SCO SQL/Retriever 4. The new cross-platformproducts strengthen SCO's commitment to its Windows integrationstrategy, enabling organizations to fully utilize the power andreliability of Unix servers without sacrificing their investments inWindows PCs. In addition to being re-engineered for 32-bit platforms,the SCO Vision family is now geared to meet the demands of mobile usersand to cut costs of managing large groups of PCs. New, reduced pricesprovide users a cost-effective solution for integrating Windows PCs toUnix servers.The move to provide free Unix licenses for educational, non-professionaluse, highlights SCO's aggressive stewardship of the Unix systemtechnology. SCO's goals for the Unix systems are to deliver into adramatically higher-volume market for all Unix customers; extend thelead in enterprise-class and Small and Medium Business (SMB)environments through advances in technology; provide SCO customers,OEMs, and ISVs with a direct path to next-generation Unix Systems; andextend the expertise in key innovative areas such as Internet, intranet,Windows-to-Unix integration, and minicomputer RAS capabilities.Easwar Satyan in Santa Cruz, California.Enterprise Hardware Vendors Unite Around SCO UnixWareNCRICLOlivettiSeimens NixdorfIntelCompaqUnisysData GeneralWhere NT May Gain GroundMPPData Center            up to 32 CPUsDepartment:            up to 8 CPUsWorkgroup :            NT 1-4 CPUsSCO Platform Products: A RoadmapDISTRIBUTED             OBJECTSENTERPRISE TOOLSUNIFIED UNIX,           INTEL, PA, MERCED64-BIT APIINTERNET ENABLEDHETEROGENEOUS            SYSTEMS MANAGEMENTHIGH AVAILABILITY        RAS CLUSTERINGSMP/NUMAUNIFIED UNIX API  INTELGEMINI SOFTWARE         DEVELOPMENT KITSCO OPENSERVERSCO UNIXWARE64-BIT UNIX ---1998GEMINIOPENSERVER 5.0.4 ---1997UNIXWARE 2.1.1COMMON DEVELOPMENT TOOLS ---1996DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996DATA VANE: SAMSUNG DEVELOPS 14" TFT-LCD MONITORfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996Samsung Electronics has announced that they have completed developmentof a 14-inch thin-film transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT-LCD)monitor that can replace the conventional cathode-ray-type (CRT). Untilnow, the use of TFT-LCDs has been restricted to notebooks and medicalimaging machines, but technology advances have resulted in laterversions with very high picture quality.The new TFT-LCD monitor weighs only 3 kilograms, one tenth the weight ofan average CRT monitor. It is only 5 cm thick, which means it can beinstalled in much smaller space than the conventional monitors. Thisfeature alone is expected to help revolutionize the office of thefuture.SEC's recent R&D success puts the company's LCD technology on a par withthe world's best. The new monitor offers a maximum definition of 1,024 x768, the same picture quality as a 17-inch CRT monitor. It featuresSEC's unique multisync digital graphics processor, which can supportboth VGA (640x480) and Super VGA (800x600) systems. The TFT-LCD monitorcan be directly connected, without the need of a separate graphics card,to PCs now using a CRT monitor.Brightness is 25 percent more than in a CRT monitor, a major improvementover other notebook screens. The lightness-darkness ratio is 300:1, andthe device can reproduce 260,000 different color shades. Because ofthese features, the new 14-inch TFT-LCD monitor by SEC is expected tooccupy a leading position in the next-generation flat display market.DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996DATA VANE: NOVELL INTRODUCES INTRANETWAREfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996Novell Inc. has announced IntranetWare, a new product that continues theevolution of NetWare into a full-service intranet and Internet accessplatform for business of all sizes.

Similarly, acorporation marches on its sales people who maintain contact withcustomers on a regular basis and perform the vital task of ensuring thatproducts are sold--for, after all has been said and done, it is nottechnology but personal relationships that help foster growth.Till now, technology was not of much help, except probably in helpingyou print labels for a direct marketing exercise or to help you lookthrough a database that has a few marketing statistics. But now acompany called BroadVision  is helpingprovide what marketing gurus have always known to be ofessence--contact, and a one-to-one relationship.BroadVision's application system--called One-To-One--is less anapplication system and more a marketing philosophy based on the strategydescribed by Don Peppers and Martha Rogers in the book The One-To-OneFuture. This marketing philosophy is extensively centered around thecustomer--it actually helps provide some sense to the much misusedstatement the customer is king--and revolves entirely around hispreferences, likes, and dislikes.The beauty of the whole thing is that BroadVision has realized the mostimportant factor--the human factor--in pushing a product. While mostpeople are arguing about the viability of e-commerce and determining thedrivers for ensuring its success like security considerations,BroadVision has placed e-commerce where it rightfully belongs--at thebottom of the chain. As the BroadVision FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)guide puts it, expecting to profit from making e-commerce a reality issimilar to expecting to turning in good business merely by buying a newcash register. A medium for facilitating active transactions is what iscalled for instead of merely a medium that ensures that you can paywithout paper money or a cheque book.To understand the real difference BroadVision makes both to the merchantand the buyer, consider a scenario in which a hypothetical dressmerchant has a web site which can be used by websurfers to view thelatest apparels. People will login nineteen to a dozen and go throughthe various clothes on display, and probably decide to buy some of them.While the shop owner has a way of determining which goods move fasterthan the others by consulting his books, he has no way of knowing whoprefers what. He is forced to provide exactly the same interface toevery person simply because he does not have any idea about thatindividual's preferences.Now, assume that he had BroadVision. This empowers him with the abilityto determine what a particular user prefers and then providing him withan interface that is restricted to his context. For example, if aparticular person normally picks up only jeans and T-shirts, he can bepresented with an interface that only offers details about jeans andT-shirts. This provides greater focus both to the vendor and the user orbuyer. This gives the user a strange sense of belonging, simply becausehis preferences are recognized, and this, in turn, psychologicallyaffects the buying decision.Further refinement is also possible. For example, if a personessentially prefers to buy blue denims in the price range of Rs1,000-1,500, he can be intimated about fresh stock as and when itarrives. The shop owner can also keep track of the number of items thathave been purchased by a particular person and offer him a good discountbecause he has just bought his twentieth shirt this year. This helpsfurther customer loyalty. Essentially, this scenario is the foundationstone of the one-to-one philosophy which believes that a great businessis built one customer at a time and each customer is crucial to thesuccess of an enterprise. BroadVision's philosophy is indeed a welcomeextension to the concept of tailor-made solutions.One thing to note in this case is that e-commerce is not exactly anecessity because payment can be made on receipt of goods, though, ofcourse, it would have been helpful to an extent. But understanding yourcustomer and his needs, as always, is. Come to think of it, it is reallyamazing what a little rule-based reasoning can do. BroadVision, whichalready uses rule-based reasoning is contemplating licensing apersonalization algorithm from Firefly, a company which uses such analgorithm to identify user trends and personal tastes.This idea is indeed a good one, but one item that could mar it is theissue of privacy, an issue that most people take quite seriously--forexample, a computer consultant in Oregon paid the state $ 222 for itscomplete motor vehicles data base, which he then posted to a Web site,prompting charges of privacy violations from people who complained thathe had invaded their privacy because anybody can trace, from an Oregonnumber plate, the vehicle owner's name, address, birth date, driver'slicense number, and title information. But BroadVision's philosophymirrors what Professor Anne Wells Branscomb mentions in her book WhoOwns Information--consumers will be willing to provide information aboutthemselves provided they get something in return for that information.And in this case, after providing his personal information, the persondoes get something in return, namely an environment that is tailored tohis needs.Surely, this would have pleased Napoleon.BALAJI N in BangaloreExpecting to profit from making e-commerce a reality is similar toexpecting to turning in good business merely by buying a new cashregister.DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996DATANEWS: ONWARD NOVELL TO PROMOTE CENTURA PRODUCTSfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996Akshay Software Technologies Ltd has entered into a strategic alliancewith Onward Novell Software (I) Ltd to promote its Centura range ofproducts and Centura-based solutions on the NetWare platform.

As the manufacturingtechnology--based on guidance from General Cars of USA--was not suitablefor Indian roads, the company went into red and incurred cumulativelosses of Rs 27.80 crore in 1982. Two years later, the company wiped outits accumulated losses and recorded a profit of Rs 57 lakh. Since then,ATL has never looked back. In the fiscal year 1990-91, the companyregistered a turnover of Rs 190 crore. Growing six-fold, the companyadded Rs 1200 crore to its kitty by 1995-96. This turnaround--largelydue to the vision of the Chairman and MD, Onkar Singh Kanwar--wasaccompanied with significant improvements and investments in the usageand adoption of IT.The Technology RoadmapIn the last two years, ATL underwent massive restructuring. The mainobjective of the radical transition was to use information as a tool fordecision-making. Besides, with the increase in corporate size, it wantedinformation technology to address certain business needs. Primary amongthem being increasing competition, rising customer expectations,reducing scrap and rework, economizing on the cost of production, andimproving process capability and yield. While doing all this,cost-effectiveness still remained the buzzword.Jumping Onto The Client Server BandwagonInitially, the use of IT was minimal. It was restricted to payrollsystems, accounting packages, and store management systems. All thelocations were equipped with single-user PCs which were used on thebatch processing mode. The software was developed in-house on Foxprowith Oracle as the RDBMS.But as the company grew, so did the needs. To successfully address theseneeds, it was important that information was integrated. To whit, thesales and the production department had to be synergized, therebydeveloping an enterprise-wide network. And for the same, climbing ontothe client server bus seemed to be the wisest thing to do. Instead ofdeveloping the system in-house, the company acquired MARSHAL, theEnterprise Management System (EMS) from Madras-based Ramco Systems Ltdon the Windows NT, Windows SQL server platform. "We realized softwaredevelopment was not our forte and hence getting a standard package wouldsave much of our time and effort," says Ashok Kumar Wahi, GeneralManager (Information Systems and Human Resources), ATL. The companychose MARSHAL over the internationally acclaimed EMS packages from SAP,Baan, and Avalon due to its cost-effectiveness and rich features.This system is being implemented in three phases. In the first phase,accounts payable, human resources and payroll, general ledger, andpurchase and inventory have been integrated. In the second phase, whichwould be complete by the end of April 1997, Supply Purchase Control(SPC) and Supply Quality Control (SQC), production, and maintenancemanagement systems would be integrated. In the third and the finalphase, the rest of the modules like fixed assets, management accounting,and sales will be integrated.Preceding the integration of the modules, a business analyst surveyedthe company's operations and outlined the business needs which had to beaddressed by information technology. These included identification ofthe training requirements, installation of the base product, master datacreation, development and testing of product extensions, trial runmodule wise, and the integration and installation of the productextensions. "When all the modules have been integrated, a trial run ofthe EMS would be performed," informs Wahi. Today, everything in thecompany has been standardized on the Windows platform. "We are a totalWindows company," says Wahi. The company also uses MS Office for OfficeAutomation and MS Mail for groupware.Communicating For Better IntegrationFor better integration of information, it was important that the variouslocations of the company were also connected. The company's networkconsists of its manufacturing locations in Perambra and Kalamassery inCochin, Limda in Gujarat, and a recently opened plant in Pune. Besidesthese manufacturing locations, the marketing network consists of fourzonal marketing offices located in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, andCalcutta. All these zonal offices together govern the working of the 100marketing locations of the company. The Head Office (HO) and the variousoffices within Delhi also had to be brought under the communicationsnetwork. Far as Roi is conecerned, as compared to quantitative returns,qualitative returns have been moreTo achieve connectivity while being cost-effective, the company decidedto adopt a simple model under which only their prime locations are on aWAN. Their five offices, including their HO in Delhi, boasts of 20 to50-node LAN connectivity, while the factories at Baroda and Cochin claim75-node connectivity each. Further, all these locations have beenconnected by a 64 Kbps leased line from DoT. Besides these, the Punefactory enjoys a 20-node connectivity.The Marketing NetworkWhile the production side and the offices in Delhi are equipped with aWAN, the same is not true for the marketing locations of the company. Itis interesting to note that the marketing function, which can benefitmost from a WAN, is devoid of this facility in ATL. The four zonaloffices have five-node LAN connectivity each, while the 100 marketingoffices around the country still operate with single-user PCs. Theselocations use the dial-up formula equipped with modems for connecting totheir zonal and head offices. "Our product being a non-perishableproduct, promptness in this segment is not required," justifies Wahi.Besides in the eight locations where ICnet is available, connection fromthe ICnet has been acquired. While the locations operate on basic stockaccounting packages, the logistics have been centralized at the HO and adaily report from each of the locations is sent to the HO.On the hardware front, while the Proliant 5000 servers form the backboneof the network, at the front-end they are still operating on 486/DX2machines from Compaq, Dell, and Acer. To save on costs, the companyre-installed their existing 286 and 386 machines into their marketinglocations all across the country.The Shop Floor SceneIT deployment and penetration does not confine itself to post-productionbut to the pre-market cycles as well. An efficient, across the board ITusage has to be worked out from the bottom up.All efforts of the company would have been of no avail, if the use of IThad not been extended to the shop floor. To this end, ATL went in for anextension of the restructuring paradigm, right down to the shop floor.Here, besides the EMS, the factories utilize certain packages specificto tyre manufacturing. Typical to any manufacturing industry, the use ofIT at the shop-floor level starts from the use of a process controlsystem. This means that the very innards of the system--be it design,testing, or prototyping--have to be attuned to the corporate philosophy.One of the most important aspect of tyre manufacturing is the design.The product portfolio of the company contains an assortment of tyres forpassenger cars, heavy vehicle like trucks and tractors, two wheelers,and even animal-driven vehicles. The sheer variety and profusion of theis an inventory controller's nightmare. In ATL, each tyre is designedusing the Finite Element Analysis package. This helps in bringing outworkable and relevant decisions along-with the entire bill of materialsand the process support, all at the click of a button, and with enoughaccurate details to satisfy the most demanding of customers and the mostfluid of markets. To further add value to the data collected, thissystem has been interfaced with the help of MARSHAL for maintenancemanagement. The data collected serves as a record for preventivemaintenance management and calculating the mean time between failures.All this is intended to manage maintenance and not merely control it.Dividends From ITThe massive restructuring has been accrued with an investment of Rs 4.02crore. But what has been the return on investment for the company? "Asfar as return on investment is concerned, as compared to thequantitative returns, the qualitative returns have been more," saysWahi. In qualitative terms, the implementation of MARSHAL has resultedin better co-ordination and streamlining of the activities betweenfar-flung plants and the HO. With the communication system in place, theHO is well-informed of the daily stock situation in the factories andplants.The company has also been able to reduce the inventory cycle time.Another benefit which ATL has accrued consequent to reengineering hasbeen the flexibility, adaptability, and quickness in operations, asaccess to all relevant information has made quick decision-makingpossible. Today, strategies are validated and deployed across the entirecompany, instead of in small pockets. Besides, simultaneous updation ofinformation has helped ATL employees to take decisions based on presentevents and not on past records. At ATL, information is being used moreas a decision-making tool rather than a management tool.Apart from these qualitative benefits, the most significant and visiblequantitative benefit has been in terms of reduced claims on batches. Thecompany has managed to reduce its claims to less than half a percent.Claims are vital to a tyre manufacturing company as high claims onbatches can at times wipe out the entire profit. However, now with theEMS in place, it has become easier to trace the defect and theexplanation for the same.Plans On The AnvilThe action does not end here. Though, the existing communication networksuits the current communication needs of the company, to meet the futureneeds, it has worked out an extensive communications network. Theimplementation of this network would not only connect its remainingfactories, but would also cover the sales depots. With this, the companywill achieve better transparency across their factories and marketinglocations. Keeping up with the current trend, the company plans to equipits employees with notebooks. Besides, ATL plans to have an Internetserver and install a video-conferencing system. The specifications forthe same and the plan of action have not been worked out as they are notfor the near future. "Though still a dream, it would not be long beforethey are realized," asserts Wahi. And going by the track record of thiscompany, that may well be true in more than one way.DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996PICK OF THE FORTNIGHT IN HARDWARE AND SOFTWAREfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996New fully non-interlaced, Goldstar 1467 SVGA color monitors have beenintroduced by Aditya Promoters.

However, because ORBs still lackthe services (transaction integrity, TP monitors, scalability, etc)required for mainstream adoption, ORB functionality will be bundled intopackages, tools, etc., with proprietary extensions.Bottomline: While ORB vendors provide messaging services that facilitateOO-based distributed computing, the necessary services required forlarge-scale adoption will not exist for at least 2 years.Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: BORLAND SCALES UP WITH OECfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996Borland announced it would acquire Open Environment Corp. (OEM) forabout $ 65M. OEC's products, like the Entera high-end RPC-basedmiddleware and tools, will complement Borland's tool suite (Delphi,Latte, and C++). With appropriate integration, Borland could offercomprehensive products, enabling developers to scale from low-end C/S tohigh-end applications. There are integration and management challengesin merging the companies, but ultimately we believe the combination willbe attractive. Despite a cutthroat market with PowerBuilder 5 and VisualBasic 5 (4Q) purporting to scale, and Forte, et al. pressuring from thehigh-end.

Indeed, webelieve the primary motivation of IBI is to stem attrition of itsclients to vendors such as Red Brick, Arbor, and Oracle. To make Fusionsuccessful, IBI must focus on developing industry-specific applications,broadening its VAR channels, and re-tooling its skill sets to provideFusion integration services.Bottomline: Fusion will be primary an installed base play, unless IBIcan aggressively deliver industry-specific applications through strongerVAR relationships.Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: NETSCAPE GETS 'PROFESSIONAL' WITH HPfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996A key component of last week's HP and Netscape (NSCP) products/salesannouncement is services.

While implyingrudimentary interoperable solutions in heterogeneous environmentscomposed of these vendors, we believe users will ultimately realizegreater functional value with single-vendor backbone solutions. Thecomplexity of combining multiple vendors, coupled with the historicfailure of network industry partnerships to sustain long-termcollaborations (eg., Cisco/Synoptics, IBM/Chipcom), makes us skepticalthat this alliance will bear fruit.Bottomline: Despite industry alliances' promotion of interoperable, opensolutions, users should plan on selecting a strategic vendor forscalable switching infrastructures.

The parties disagree on what happened next, but the junk emailis still coming. And Cyber Promotions President Sanford Wallace isn't abit apologetic: "You're doing something the whole Internet world istelling you not to do, but we've been doing it quite successfully."How true. Cyber Promotions says it mails up to 3 million messages andadvertisements per day for companies selling everything from videos tovitamins (table). And that's just the start. Nobody can say preciselyhow big junk email is, but Internet experts agree that the volume willsoar as more marketers discover how cheap it is. A mailing to 1 millionpeople would cost about $ 827,000, including postage and printing, theDirect Marketing Assn. says. Internet advertisers can reach the samenumber for the price of a local phone call plus a few hundred dollarsfor time spent online.BacklashEven as marketers catch on to junk email, they face a backlash. Netsurfers already complain about unwanted messages, and Internet serviceproviders grouse that they aren't being adequately compensated. Evensome pioneers of junk email concede that there's a risk that zillions offree and other marketing messages could overwhelm the Net. "It could bea serious problem to the efficiency of the Internet," says Neil Albalaof Tucson, who developed a so-called bulk email loader called Floodgatefor Windows.Like other junk-mail programs, Floodgate lets an ordinary PC blastmessages to email addresses sniffed out from online directories, WorldWide Web sites, and electronic bulletin boards. For marketers who don'twant to operate junk-mail systems themselves, services such as CyberPromotions will send the ads for them. A few of these services blockadult ads, but most will mail whatever a client wants.What can consumers do to avoid the onslaught? There is no legalprohibition against the practice, but in the Internet community therelated practice of blanketing message boards--known as spamming'--isdealt with by cyber vigilantes. Spammers are flamed'--vilified in replymail. Likewise, technically-savvy email targets can turn the tables onmailers by deluging them with thousands of flame-mail messages or bysending email bombs' containing huge files that tie up computers forhours. But these measures hurt service providers worse than the junkemailers, who wind up hopping from system to system--or develop theirown domains.Perhaps most troubling for Internet users, junk emailers areincreasingly adept at targeting them by gleaming personal informationfrom the Net. For example, purveyors of quack remedies might grab theonline addresses of participants in health-related newsgroups, some ofwhich attempt to be as private and sensitive as support groups.The rapid expansion of targeted junk email worries privacy advocates."If you lack adequate privacy safeguards, you could anticipate Internetmeltdown," says Electronic Privacy Information Center Director MarcRotenberg. But it's unlikely that the federal government will step in tomandate protections. Federal Trade Commission Credit Practices AssociateDirector David Medine says he doesn't favor government involvement inthe issue, saying that "regulation stifles development."Fighting BackFor now, the FTC is working with two industry groups--the DirectMarketing Assn. and Interactive Services Assn.--on guidelines to protectprivacy in targeted emailings. "The rules are being written as we go,"admits Interactive Services Assn. spokeswoman Sara Fitzgerald.Irate Internet surfers are also beginning to fight software withsoftware. James Howard, a University of North Carolina student, iscreating a program to block unsolicited email. Says Howard: "We thinkthere should be technical solutions so you don't get it if you don'twant it." If such blocking systems spread, consumers and serviceproviders might finally be able to shut out this cyber-annoyance.By Randi Feigenbaum in New York.Copyrighted from BusinessWeek International, September 9, 1996 byMcGraw-Hill Inc.

It allows a realtime chat betweenInternet users and at the same offers voice-grade communication at aninexpensive rate. An Internet phone call can be made with the callerlogging on to the Internet through an access provider. Both, the callerand receiver have to be logged into the Internet and it is imperativethat both users have the identical software. The additional componentsneeded, apart from the PC and modem, are a sound blaster card, amicrophone, and a speaker.Once hooked on to the Net, one can access Internet Phone facilitiesprovided free by over 30 companies worldwide. Initial access to theInternet is still made over local phone lines in the dial-up mode. Afterthis, the call travels over the computer networks that make up theInternet. The caller's voice travels as bits of data which are sent outin pieces or packets to various switches and then pieced back togetherat the other end of the call. The Internet call costs Rs 30 an hour,which is much cheaper than an ISD or STD dial-up charge. Though theInternet phone appears to be very convenient, it has some inherentlimitations.To establish an Internet phone connection, both users must have the samesoftware and also be logged in at the same time. Further, thetransmission quality on these lines is very poor, almost one-fourth thatof normal lines. It is difficult to receive the communication clearly.Moreover, transmission/reception delays are due to the slow speed of theline.Not every PC can have an access to Internet phone. To be able to availthis facility, the PC must have multimedia facilities. In the West,where the Internet culture is much more pervasive, virtually all userswill have access to the popular Internet phone facilities, but in Indiathis is not possible.But this is not VSNL's main worry. VSNL is anxious that the Internetphone will hit its ISD revenues which is its bread and butter. Hence, ithas gone ahead and banned this service in India. According to AmitabhKumar, Director (Operations), VSNL, "This service is not allowed inIndia. To offer the Internet service, a person needs a licence. Anyonefound offering the Internet phone service will have his licencesuspended. In fact, when a person is contracted as an agent, he has tosign an agreement which states that he will neither use or provide thefacility for voice."Inspite of the fact that Internet phone service is banned, manymarketing agents are still selling the registration for Internet phoneservices at Rs 34,000. And the main bait they use to entice customers isthe cost of the phone call which they claim is to the tune of just Re 1for five minutes.There are quite a few vendors who are poised to sell Internet phones andhave advertised so. Mumbai-based VocalCall which was to sell VocalTec'sInternet phones in India, had to postpone its product launch. Accordingto Rajnikant Parekh, Director, VocalCall, "For the time being, we havedecided not to go ahead with our plans. What VSNL has done is good if weconsider it from the Government's point of view. But can VSNL stop theuse of Internet phones? I don't think VSNL can monitor all lines,especially the TCP/IP lines. Internet phone calls are definitely beingmade." In fact, VocalCall inserted an article about its product in anewspaper about two months ago and so far it has received more than 600enquiries. This only goes to show that a market exists for the product.As the popularity of the Internet increases, usage of the Internet phonetoo is bound to increase. Says Vijay Mukhi, founder member of theInternet Users Club of India, "As the number of Internetters increase,users of the Net's telephone facilities will also proliferate. Then VSNLwill certainly have a reason to worry." And worried VSNL indeed is.PRAGYA BHARATI, in Mumbai.DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996SILICON VALLEY: ROOTING FOR BILLfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996As the American economy goes through a phase of rapid growth, SiliconValley has announced its support for Bill Clinton.In 1992, the endorsement of some 25 leading Silicon Valley high-techexecutives, many of them staunch Republicans, played a key role inputting Bill Clinton into the White House. In subsequent years, Clintonhas managed to alienate himself from many of his high-tech allies. Butfollowing a month of heavy lobbying, including several meetings withSilicon Valley leaders, a group of 75 executives announced their supportfor the President.Clinton and Vice President Al Gore video-conferenced from the WhiteHouse to a reception in their honor at Adobe Systems to personallyaccept the endorsements.Venture capitalist John Doerr of Kleiner PerkinsCaufield & Byers, a Republican, told Clinton and Gore that their groupsupports the Administration on positions ranging from jobs and theeconomy, to foreign trade and open markets, research and development,and education and training.Doerr was one of the 25 original executives supporting Clinton in 1995.Almost all of them reaffirmed their support for the Democratic ticket.Less than a year ago, that possibility had seemed remote, particularlyafter Clinton vetoed a bill that would have made it far tougher forlawyers to file shareholder lawsuits.Clinton told the executives that he is the candidate with a vision ofthe future, as opposed to Bob Dole who sees the past as the best modelfor tomorrow. "We need this election to be a referendum on the future.People need to vote for the future. They need to vote for their family'sfuture, their children's future, their nation's future," Clinton said."You don't even have any idea the kind of appeal that your voice has toAmericans all over this country who see you as our leaders in the marchto the future. And if we can make this election a referendum on thefuture, I have no doubt how it will come out," he said.Asked why the conservative executives had rejected Dole, Adobe CEO JohnWarnock, said, "From the Republican convention we heard a lot ofbackward thinking, looking into the past and reminiscing about good oldtimes. In high-technology, we look at the future. We don't look at thepast."The group of 75 executives included Paul Allaire, CEO of Xerox; CarolBartz, CEO of Autodesk; Steve Jobs, CEO of Next and Pixar AnimationStudios; Bill Hambrecht, CEO of Hambrecht and Quist; Ed McCracken, CEOof Silicon Graphics; and John Young, retired CEO of HP.Steve Jobs, never shy about sharing the spotlight at a major event, tookthe opportunity to tell Clinton that Silicon Valley business leaderstraditionally reject government handouts or special tax credits.Instead, the high tech business community looks for "a solid businessclimate, based on economic policies that make sense. We all feel thatwe've had that over the last four years and what we're looking for isfor that to continue for another four years. I've lived in SiliconValley since I was five years old, and the past four years have been thebest Silicon Valley has ever had in terms of growth in revenue, jobs,international market share and just sheer momentum," said Jobs.Bob Dole is not without some Silicon Valley high-tech supportershimself. TJ Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor has already endorsed Dole,and additional support could come from Gil Amelio of Apple, Jim Morganof Applied Materials, Jerry Sanders of Advanced Micro Devices, andGordon Moore of Intel. Under Clinton, the budget has seen four years ofdeficit reductions, the creation of 10.4 million new jobs, and a stockmarket that has added more than 2000 points.MARK HARRIS, SVNS.DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996COMPUTER ASSOCIATION: ASSOCIATING MORE STRONGLYfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996As a part of its Asian thrust, Computer Association is taking a freshlook at the Indian opportunities.Despite being amongst the top three independent software companies inthe world, not many IT users in India know about Computer Associates(CA). Enterprise-management solutions and mission-critical applicationsare the two areas that CA is best known for. With very few users havingimplemented enterprise management solutions in India, it comes as nosurprise that CA is not a well-known brand name here compared tocompanies like Microsoft, Oracle etc.In its twenty-first year of operations, CA currently has over 9,000employees and a family of 500 software products. For the year endedMarch 1996, it posted a revenue of $ 3.5 billion and a net income ofover $ 75 million. Contributing to this growth has been the Asian regionand according to Chua Tock Ling, Senior VP, CA Asia, the growth in theAsian region is the fastest in CA. Within Asia, attention was first laidon the Chinese market. "We have invested a lot of time, efforts, andresources developing, in the last year, in North Asia (China, and tosome extent Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea) which are all fast-growingmarkets," adds Tock Ling.During the latter part of this year, CA is expected to announce itsplans for South Asia, in which India is the key market. In India, thecompany has been having some discussions with various people about howit can do business in India. Says Sanjay Kumar, President and COO, CA,"We are comfortable with what is happening in India and we have workedout some pretty aggressive plans which we will be announcing soon." Whatseems to be on the cards is the enhancing of its direct presence byopening a liaison office in Mumbai or Bangalore in the next threemonths.CA's entry into the Indian market was an indirect one. In 1993, itacquired a company called Nantucket whose product Clipper was being soldin India initially by Peutronics and later by Infosys. This trendcontinued with CA's acquisition of The ASK Group in 1994, whose product,Ingress, was being distributed by Mastek. Subsequently, approaching themarket in a more direct manner, CA appointed L&T in end 1994 as itsdistributor for Unicenter, which has been the key product for CA so far.This year, CA appointed its fourth partner, SE Business Solutions fordistributing its business application software.Bulk of CA's revenue from India has been through the sale of Ingreswhich is estimated to have brought in Rs 11 crore in 1995-96. Commentingon Mastek's performance, Low Gee Sing, Manager (Asia Channels), opined,"Mastek has been doing a good job and customers are satisfied." Ingreshas not been amongst the best-sellers in the RDBMS market worldwide andthe situation in India is no different. IDC (India) estimates that themarket share of Ingres dropped 4 percentage points to 14 percent in1995-96, and in its outlook for 1996-97 feels that prospects for Ingresare not very upbeat. Ravindra Govil, CEO, Mastek, says that theimmediate objective is to regain the market share and moreoptimistically feels that beating Oracle is doable, albeit difficult. Ona more global scale, Gee Sing feels that Open Ingres is technically asolid product and is being used in mission-critical applications.However, he concedes that the product has not done well on the marketingaspect and that it does not have enough visibility and mindshare.CA-Unicenter, the enterprise management solution of CA has been theprimary catalyst for the company's growth since its introduction in1993. According to Yogesh Gupta, Senior VP (Product Strategy), CA,"Since its inception, Unicenter has been the fastest-growing product inthe history of software. In calender 1995, Unicenter revenues were $ 500million. This year, Wall Street expects us to almost double that." Butthis "billion dollar potential" software product has less than fiveusers in India. Gee Sing says, "India is very different from a lot ofother countries. The concept of systems management is pretty alien." Oneof the primary reasons for CA's lackluster performance with Unicenter inIndia is because of the lack of the mainframe culture to any significantextent. CA has its task cut out in making its prospects understand thatsystems management is equally important in the client server and Unixenvironments.Considering the market share that CA enjoys in many of the developedcountries, its revenue from India are perhaps far below its expectation.When asked if CA's partners in India have not been particularly strong,a hesitant Tock Ling says, "I wouldn't put it that they are notparticularly strong. It is a matter of focus, and I think if you putyour mind to develop a brand name and to market and organize your salesand support forces into developing that brand, then I think we will do abetter job." In any case, that is the prime reason why CA believes thatit needs to have a direct presence in India to develop the market and toassist partners.Reiterating this stance is Kumar who says, "We have always been a directcompany and we will continue a direct presence anywhere we go. It isvery important for us." In other words, even if CA works through apartner, the company would like to have a CA person ultimatelyaccountable for the solutions that it implements. However, for the kindof software that CA sells, the company may require more directinvolvement in India than what is currently under consideration. This isespecially relevant for the distributed client server, automatedproduction control, security control and audit, performance management,and accounting solutions etc. that CA has to offer.E ABRAHAM MATHEW, in New Orleans.Revenue Growth (in thousands)Year        Revenue ($)FY 92      1,508,761FY 93      1,841,008FY 94      2,148,470FY 95      2,622,992FY 96      3,504,629DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996OLD BOOK, NEW JACKETfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996The recommendations of the Ramani Panel regarding software exports hasnothing new to offer.With software exports touching Rs 2,300 crore in 1995-96, the Indiansoftware exports industry is emerging as a unique and profitable forexearner for the Government of India. Therefore, the initiative taken bythe DoE to prepare a general outlay of plans for the ninth five yearplan (1997-2002) in consultation with IT industry veterans is notsurprising. A panel of experts comprising 14 members from the ITindustry, academic institutes and the DoE was formed under thechairmanship of KV Ramani, VP, NASSCOM, early this year. Started inMarch, the study was completed and the report delivered to DoE recently.It reviews the present industry, projects Indian software exports forthe next five years, examines the weaknesses in the software sector, andidentifies the thrust areas.The Ramani Panel report however, has its limitations. It is like theeconomic theory of demand and supply which postulates that demand goesup when supply comes down, given the assumption that everything else isequal. The report states that software exports from India, growing at aCAGR of 42.6 percent, could touch Rs 21,800 crore by year 2002--aneight-fold increase--provided all the recommendations are implemented.Says Ramani "We could get a 7 percent share of the global softwaremarket." In the event that only 60 percent of the recommendations getimplemented then exports would be in the region of Rs 12,680 crore. TheCAGR in this case is assumed to be 28 percent. Just as assuming thateconomic conditions--which are rarely ever stable much less equal--asbeing equal is wrong, to assume the probability of all recommendationsbeing implemented is also wrong.Though long overdue, given that the last report on the software industrywas compiled in 1992 by the World Bank along with the DoE, the reportdoes not throw up any new ideas nor does it explore any differentapproaches. For instance, the lack of packaged software products fromIndia has been highlighted as one of the key weaknesses. And the causeof this--the exorbitant cost of marketing--is by no means a revelation.Indeed, Indian software companies do not have the means today to absorbsuch costs, but the question is, when is it likely to happen? It is anissue which merits more than a cursory reference, since products have amajor role to play in achieving the year 2002 target.Similarly, the other two major problem areas--lack of adequate venturecapital and absence of original technology--are not new either. However,with the entry of several foreign venture capital funding firms intoIndia in the recent past and the steps taken by TDICI, matters relatingto the funding of small software companies have been mitigated to someextent. Cause for concern remains though, as what steps the Panel wouldtake to further this has not been touched upon in depth. Coming to theabsence of original technology, one wonders if it merits being mentionedat all, if no attempt is made in the first place to see why it is so.As for manpower shortage and dearth of professionals with projectmanagement skills, it is a subject that has been of concern for overfive years now. And we are yet to arrive at a consensus on how thiscould be achieved. We are still stuck at the MCA course level andtalking of the need for standardization of these courses. Since thishasn't happened despite DoE's efforts, it is safe to assume that it isnot likely to happen in the near future also. For the Panel to bank onit, is an exercise in futility. However, its suggestion that the IITsdouble their current output of students by opting for a shift systemwith the existing infrastructure has some merit. But again, what are welooking at? Doubling from an average of 500 professionals from all theIITs put together? Surely, when we are talking of growing by 10 times,it would be but a drop in the ocean?The Panel's recommendation of forming at least 50 software cities acrossthe country and, better still, closer to engineering colleges isinteresting. Given that the major metros are increasingly getting out ofreach for most start-up entrepreneurs, this concept is bound to go downwell. It would also mean less clogging of the metros like Bangalore.However, creating these alternate cities with sops for investors is amust to attract them. Clearly, the Government has to start makinginvestments in this direction. And meetings with DoE officials is yet tobring out the Government's clear stand on this study.For long we have been talking of India's inherent advantages of a lowcost, high-quality, English-speaking workforce. But over the years, evenas we have been boasting, other Asian countries, having realized thepotential in this business, have begun catching up with India.

The new technology will add theequivalent of a postal zipcode' to each email message. By attaching anelectronic destination tag to an email message, Internet routers don'thave to concern themselves with the often lengthy destination code of amessage until it has been delivered to the server handing the account.The new routing technology is expected to help unclog many of the dataarteries suffering from an overload of users during peak hours, causingemail messages to take considerably longer to get delivered. Cisco saysthat the tag technology, combined with other throughput-boostinginnovations will enable existing Internet equipment to process data upto four times faster. Another major advantage of the tag technology isthat paths of travel through the Internet can be established so reliablythat Internet access providers will be able to offer their customers upto three levels of service and prices.Cisco will present the new router technology, to be made as the standardfor traffic routing, to the Internet Engineering Task Force. As such,the company would give up ownership of the technology and allow otherfirms to use it as a common tool or feature in their Internet products.Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996HOTLINE: PACKARD BELL SETTLES A CASE: USED PARTS CASEfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996Without admitting guilt, Packard Bell Electronics Inc. has settled acase brought up by 22 states in the US, accusing the PC-maker of sellingnew computers which contained parts from returned, previously soldunits. According to the terms of the settlement, Packard Bell has agreedto pay attorney fees and investigative costs to each of the 22 statesinvolved in the case. Additionally, the company will label all packageswhich contain systems involved in the practice and provide retailerswith point-of-sale material to inform potential customers. January 1997has been set as a date for beginning the labeling process. Any systemcontaining parts from returned PCs will also have to be warranted asnew.Significantly, Packard Bell has walked away from the settlement with nofines, no penalties, and an agreement of no further litigation.

At thesame time, reports of a power struggle in the boardroom have surfaced,with several senior staff members reported to be leaving.The rocky path that Olivetti has trodden in the recent times hassuddenly become even rockier. The activities of its executives are underinvestigation. The investigation centers around the possibility that thecompany's losses for the first six months of the year have beenunderstated. Olivetti's board announced worse-than-expected pre-taxlosses of 440.2 billion lire ($ 290 million) and a net debt of 1,260billion lire ($ 860 million) for the six months ended 30 June 1996. Muchof the blame for the losses has been laid at the door of the PCdivision, plus the cost of on-going restructuring. Olivetti has beenspraying its profit and loss account with red ink for four years now.Despite claims that the PC division had turned the corner, the divisionis still costing the firm large chunks of operating revenue, andinvestors are less than pleased with the division's performance.To prevent any share sell-offs, the ISE has suspended the company'sshares. Although the investigation announcement and share tradingsuspension would have upset investors, industry experts have welcomedthe management changes. They are talking about the possibility that thecompany may pull out of PC production altogether.Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996HOTLINE: DECKS CLEARED FOR TISL NAME CHANGEfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996The reported name-change of TISL to Tata-IBM Ltd is expected to takeplace in the next quarter with the Tata empire changing the royaltystructure levied on its stable of companies. The revised royaltystructure dividing the companies into A', B', and C' categories have twoIT companies--Tata Elxsi and Tata Unisys--in the A' group and because ofthis these companies will have to pay the highest royalty--0.25 percentof their net turnover or 5 percent of their net profit, whichever islower. These royalty structures are effective starting 1996-97 fiscal.Says Ravi Dubey, VP Corporate Communications, Tata,"The change of nameof TISL is driven by the market needs of the company itself. It is in noway linked to royalties. As a matter of fact royalty is not consideredat all when a company name is to be changed." As for an officialstatement he said that they did not have any to make as yet.However, in case of joint venture companies where the foreign partnerdoes not charge a royalty fee and offers the brand name on a gratisbasis, Tata will waive the royalty fee. Applicable to TISL and Tata's JVwith AT&T, the rumors pertaining to the name-change of TISL to Tata-IBMLtd, long doing the rounds, may finally be cleared. The name changingexercise has taken so long because negotiations between IBM and TISLwere getting stuck whenever the issue of royalties came up. With theroyalty terms now cut and dried it will be easier for both parties toconclude their deal smoothly.Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996HOTLINE: OVER RS 9 CRORE EXPORT ORDER FOR MASTEKfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996Mastek Ltd has bagged an order worth Rs 9.66 crore from AcademyInformation Systems Ltd of UK.

The ease of useusually associated with Mac is finally going to be available on the PC.There is a widespread belief that the success of Windows 95 will spur amassive surge in the sale of PCs and hence spark off a serious demandfor hardware. Orders for semiconductors--a leading indicator of PCsales--has risen 54 percent. The expectations across the board from thestock market to average PC user are extremely high. Microsoft hasplanned its greatest ever media blitzkrieg to entice 85 millioncustomers and a $ 130 billion industry to upgrade to Windows 95. An adcampaign costing several tens of millions of dollars and featuring rocklegends such as Mick Jagger and his 1981 classic, "Start me up" has beenplanned. That was August 95.Windows 95 is the first operating system Microsoft has offered both onCD-ROM and floppies, giving the company lots of extra space forgimmicks. A CD-ROM holds 660 MB of data, compared to 1.4 MB for a floppydisk; Two full length music videos and a film trailer are available onall CD-ROM versions. Three video clips alone hog up to 220 MB of data.The company says that more testing has gone into this software than anysoftware ever written. 400,000 beta copies, 15 million lines of computercode. A year and several bugs later, what has been the impact of thishype and the hoopla? What does one really get from Windows 95? What arethe lessons learnt and the long term implications on the computerindustry in general? To upgrade or not to upgrade? What does the futurehold for the competition. This article explores these fundamentalissues.What do you get from Windows 95?32-bit OS: From a user perspective, 32 bit programs are a little fasterthan conventional 16-bit programs. But the real benefit is forprogramers. Gone are the days of large and tiny memory models, gone arethe days of Intel's segmented memory addressing.PLUG-N-PLAY: You get a plug-and-play OS, which promises relativelysimple management of hardware configuration on your PC. Anybody who hasjuggled IRQ numbers and memory addresses to install a PC card willappreciate the plug-and-play features of Windows 95. Mac users havetaken plug-and-play for granted for years. It is finally time for thePC. What does plug-and-play mean? This means that Windows 95 has theability to automatically recognize a new piece of hardware as it isadded to your PC. Plug-and-play works only if the peripheral bus on yourmotherboard and the new piece of hardware you are adding areplug-and-play compatible. It detects such things as modems and printersautomatically and configures them. Plug-and-play is the new standarddeveloped by a whole slew of hardware vendors led by Intel andMicrosoft. Unfortunately, plug-and-play does not work on the millions ofnew PCs and adapter cards available in the market. However, Windows 95still does a reasonably good job of identifying most of the popularlegacy adapter cards automatically during installation.EASE OF NETWORKING: This is one of the really positive features ofWindows 95. You get support for TCP/IP, IPX/SPX straight out of the box.To make things even more simple, Windows 95 even throws in a NetWareclient for free. Since it is a Win32 compatible platform, all of thepopular Web browsers--Netscape, NCSA Mosaic, Spry's Air Mosaic work justfine in Windows 95. Other networking goodies include--Dial-up networkingsupport, including PPP, SLIP, and RAS for Windows NT.UNIVERSAL MESSAGING LAYER: This is the very first implementation ofMicrosoft's long awaited Messaging API, also known as MAPI. This allowsvarious messaging service providers to "plug-in" their services, andthus achieve seamless integration with the built in messaging client inWindows 95. MAPI is a powerful API, going beyond simple messaging. It ismore like an API for information exchange, and it really opens the doorfor useful applications like document storage and retrieval, and Lotusnotes type of bulletin board-like applications. The downside to this isthat although MAPI is an open standard and thus would work with anymessaging service, the only built in messaging services in Windows 95are for Microsoft Network, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft Mail,and Internet POP mail. If you want email connectivity to other messagingservices, you would have to get your own MAPI providers.USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE: Microsoft has spent countless hours onusability testing to improve the interface for Windows 95. Consistencyand convenience are a few of the key features of Windows 95. The rightmouse button has had its day at last. If you click the right mousebutton, almost always a pop-up menu comes up, listing the most commonlyused operations that can be done on that object at that time. Amongthose menu-items there is almost always a menu-item called"Properties..." If you choose "Properties..." you usually get a"Property Sheet" (Everyone else in the world calls them "TabbedDialogs"!) dialog listing all the settings. For instance if you clickthe right mouse button on the desktop and choose the "Properties..."menu-item, a dialog box comes up, which lets you change colors, displayresolution settings, screen savers etc. etc.DRASTICALLY IMPROVED SHELL: If you have never considered yourself a fanof Windows 3.1 Program Manager, you might end up liking the Windows 95shell. The desktop finally gets a life of its own. You can at lastcreate program icons (called "Shortcuts" in Windows 95) right on thedesktop. If you've always got lost in Windows 95 as soon as you createmore than 3 or 4 windows, you would appreciate the new "Task Bar" at thebottom. Whenever you minimize a window in Windows 95, the icon moves tothe bottom, on something which looks like standard status bar. As youminimize more and more windows, all of those icons move to the same bar.This "Task Bar" is always visible and hence, if you quickly want to goto some other application it is just one-mouse click away.What I don't get from Windows 95?BLAZING SPEED: In fact, all 16-Bit Windows 3.1 applications would run alittle bit slower. The actual speed would depend on many factors likethe amount of memory etc., but no matter how much memory your system hasthe speed is a little bit slower.ROBUST OS: Windows 95 is a lot more robust than Windows 3.1. Windows 95is more stable than previous versions of Windows and crashes less often.It is now more difficult for mis-behaving applications to crash theoperating system, though it is still possible to do it. Microsoft paid aheavy price for speed and compatibility. Under the hood of Windows 95,there is still a lot of old DOS and 16-bit Windows code! Hence, thereare a lot of back-door entries into the operating system code. The othermain drawback--all 16 bit applications share the same message queue, andit is the systems message queue. So if you have a 16 bit applicationwhich has gone into an infinite loop, you have a hung system!To upgrade or not to upgrade?It often makes sense to upgrade with drastic improvements in softwarecapability. However, one begins to think twice when upgrade costs top 25to 30 percent of the cost of a new machine. In general, with anythingolder than a 486 based machine, it is advisable to upgrade--Windows 95or otherwise. Windows 95 will typically stake out at least 40 MB of harddrive with Windows 95 ready application programs hogging up several moremegabytes of space. So it is probably a good idea to have a larger harddisk (at least 300 MB or more). In addition, running multiple programssimultaneously implies one will be inclined to go in for a largermonitor (15 inch or bigger) of some sort.Will Windows 95 boost PC sales?It was anticipated that is would. It turned out that the expectationswere far over-estimated. Several PC manufacturers cancelled orders forhardware, thereby drastically affecting semiconductor manufacturers.Several leading semiconductor companies had to resort to lay-offs tocounter the unprecedented drop in sales. The next couple of fiscalquarters are critical to the success of several of these companies. Allthe anticipated surge in sale of new PCs never really occurred. On theother hand, several existing PC users have upgraded to Windows 95, ashave several corporations with PC networks, though gradually. The resultbeing, semiconductors stocks taking a beating while Microsoft's stockhas continued to surge ahead on Wall street.What is the future for Windows 95?The biggest threat to Microsoft seems to be the rapid growth of theInternet and software drive by this growth. Netscape, which has been atthe forefront of the Internet revolution, appears to be the leadingplayer in this area. With the growth of intranets (computer networkswithin corporations) and the WWW, the Netscape browser is fast becomingthe interface of choice in corporations. Meanwhile, leading companiessuch as Oracle, IBM, and Sun Microsystems are anxious to break theWintel monopoly (Intel-Microsoft PC monopoly) and are defining theNetwork computer along with "Java applets" (applications that reside ona network rather than on a local hard disk) as next wave in computingtechnology. The result of this intense battle remains to be seen and wehope to discuss this more in detail in a future article.Pran Kurup, is the President of the Silicon Valley Indian ProfessionalsAssociation (SIPA).Jyoti Nath, is senior engineer in the Silicon Valley, CA and thewebmaster of the SIPA web-site. www.sipa.org.

But what could have been a no-holds-barred OS war looks likeending without even a whimper!Uncharacteristically, Microsoft is first off the block this time with NT4. IBM will pitch in with Merlin, Netware Green river is in advancedBeta, Apple promises to have long delayed Copland out by mid-97, androunding off the year will again be Microsoft with Windows 97. Add toit, new stuff like Spring and Inferno and you have quite a potent brew.Before the marketing whiz kids take over, here is a quick look at thepromises each OS has to keep.Green River--Netware To IntranetWare?At Novell, the spotlight has shifted from Green river to the search fora new CEO. In a sudden move, Novell and CEO Frankenberg parted ways,with Novell searching for new corporate directions.Meanwhile, Green river is not exactly a major upgrade if one goes by theversion number--4.11. The major deliverables of Green river are SMPscalability or an ability to handle multiple CPU's, better printing andnetwork management capabilities, and automatic detection for networkcards.With better security and full TCP/IP support, Green river is beingsquarely positioned as an Internet-compliant intranet platform. Novellhas also announced IntranetWare, which over and above Netware 4.11,includes Netscape Navigator, FTP Services for NetWare, an IPX/IPGateway, and a multiprotocol router for WAN and Internet connections.Copland--A Complete RewriteCopland is the first complete rewrite of the Mac OS. Apple is giving upits long standing commitment of complete backward compatibility for itsoperating system and is writing Mac OS 8 only for the PowerPC platform.(Apple promises to continue support and upgrades for OS 7.5)Copland has been due for a long time. It was first expected in 1995.Current target is mid-97.Copland promises a better interface with customization options,preemptive multitasking, international language support, and bettercommunications. Native PowerPC code is expected to make the OS manytimes faster. OS 8 will also be the first one from Apple's stables whichcan run on boxes other than the Mac. It will run on any machine meetingthe PowerPC specifications.Merlin--But Where Are The Knights Of The Round Table?There have been no two opinions about the technical finesse of OS/2.Merlin is the upgrade of OS/2 Warp. Now scheduled for a 25 Septemberrelease, it will be the first OS for the Intel chip with built-in voicecapabilities. Departing from the made-at-IBM-only policy, IBM willactually replace its own internet explorer with an OS/2 version ofNetscape Navigator. Also, making its debut will be Warp center--based onLotus smart center--an object-oriented icon ribbon on the desktop thatwill allow users to group and quickly launch programs and check onsystem status.While IBM continues to blow hot and cold about OS/2, the question is notwhether Merlin will deliver on its promises but whether it cancapitalize on the deliverables. Will the magician take OS/2 onto thewinning league? or will this damsel in distress have to continue to waitfor a Knight in shining armour to come to her rescue?Windows 97--A New Way To Organize Your FilesAfter Win 95, it's going to be Win 97 with no 96 in between. Officialinformation is still scarce on what it will be like in 97.A major change is to be in the way files are organized and accessed.Windows 97 will have an Internet browser type explorer with a Web pagelike organization of directories and files, in place of the currenthierarchical one. Is this Microsoft's version of the Internet PC, withlocal disks mimicking the Internet, and both being accessed byapplications in the same way.Oh! and by the way, what will it be this time in place of Start me up'?NT and Win 95--Will The Twain Ever Meet?Microsoft has not been clear about the future of NT and Win 95. Currenttrends seem to indicate that NT is going the Win 95 way in look andfeel, while Win 95 seems to be going the NT way (in 97) as far as OSorganization and drivers go. Will the two merge into one or will they goseparate ways?Inferno--A Long Way To GoWhen it was first announced, Inferno was seen by many as a potentialchallenger to Java. But while Java (and Java hype) continues to rule theNet, Inferno is nowhere near to being the challenger it was supposed tobe.Inferno is actually a combination of the Inferno operating system, theLimbo programming language, the Dis virtual machine for Limbo, and theStyx communication protocol. Behind all these strange names, Inferno issupposed to provide transparent distributed computing in a local area,wide area or global client server environment.Resources on Inferno are represented as files and most functions areimplemented as basic file commands. Irrespective of the physicallocation of a resource, it will show up on the same hierarchical filesystem and will be accessed by Styx. Object code written in Limbo willexecute in the Dis environment with as little as 1 MB memory.That makes Inferno sound like the operating system for the Internet PC.So, is Inferno's time yet to come?NEXTSTEP--OS To API?NeXTSTEP was Steve Jobs' attempt at recreating the Mac magic after hisouster from Cupertino. Somewhere along the way, he gave up in part andsold off the hardware--NeXT Cube and NeXT Station--but continued thedevelopment of NeXTSTEP as an object-oriented OS. Now with theannouncement of OPENSTEP, an API--for among other things Windows NT--asthe upgrade to NeXTSTEP, Jobs seems to have given up the effortcompletely.NeXT Software continues, 300 people strong, focussing on Internettechnologies and products.ConclusionThe general directions seem to be the same in every case. Good old DOSis dead. The Internet is in and so are intranets--at the OS level.Graphics, distributed computing, and networking seem to be theloadstones for the future.Apple has more or less squandered its huge lead in things graphical andis grappling with enormous problems on all fronts. Whatever advantageCopland would have bought, ***it has been greatly eroded by Win 95. OS2,acclaimed for its technical finesse, is caught midway between IBM'sprevarication and a lack of application base. Netware is the only one inthe pack which is not a true operating system. It is also the only onewhich is not fully graphical.Does that mean that we are in for a more-dominated-by-Windows world? Anywagers that one of the others will still rise, a phoenix from the ashesof the past, to mount a successful challenge to the Microsoftjuggernaut?Editor's Note: Got a point?Want to take a pot-shot at someone who has done the dirty withyou, some opinions on technology, its (ab)use, (ir)relevance. Go on, share youridea and we will share it with the rest of the world.

An analysis of the promises threatsIBM, Sun, Oracle, Wyse, NCD, Acer, Sony, Acorn, Nintendo, Toshiba,Digital, ViewCall Europe plc., and other vendors have announced plans todevelop and build low-cost devices targeted to replaceIntel/Windows-based PCs. These devices go by many names--`NetworkTerminals', `Network Computers (NC)', `Internet Terminals' and so forth.Whatever the name, a great deal of interest has been generatedthroughout Asia-Pacific in these emerging alternative computerplatforms.The level of interest differs from one country to another, varyingaccording to the installed corporate PC base, the strength of corporatenetworks and local Internet services, and the dominant culture, whichinfluences the level of employee autonomy. In Japan, China, and Korea,highly centralized organizations micro-manage employees and haveconsequently resisted movements to have a `mainframe on every desktop'and to have `distributed, empowered workers' that have swept over theworld in the last 10 years. Many enterprises in these countries arefollowing the debate over `Internet Terminals' with enthusiasm. They seean opportunity to reap the rewards of distributed computing withoutincurring the pain of high total costs of ownership that come with it.These countries are investing in nation-wide high-speed networks usingthe latest technologies. If they invest more in the network, do theyalso need to invest more to maintain and manage the PCs?These so-called `Internet terminals' have been widely ridiculed by manyin the Western media, but for the wrong reasons. While everyone agreesthat these devices cannot, and will not, replace already purchased PCs,we believe there will be value in these devices.Generically, we define a class of devices that is totallynetwork-dependent as `Network Interface Devices' (NIDs). Thus, whiletraditional fixed-function terminals and X-terminals are indeed NIDs, alow-end PC that can independently run some personal productivityapplications along with Internet access is not, according to ourdefinition, a NID. Today, the two new classes of NIDs that will beentering the market are browser-based NIDs and Windows-based NIDs. Theability to distinguish between these two classes of NIDs is criticallyimportant for enterprises to properly leverage these technologies.The browser-based NID is a device dedicated to Internet access (boththrough the intranet and Internet), mainly World Wide Web server access,through browser-like functionality. These devices range from productssuch as the ViewCall set-top box--where `Surfing the Web' is performedthrough the remote control and a TV screen--to those envisioned by Sunand Oracle--where, equipped with extensions like Java, the productsdeliver application functionality that can be executed on the device.Ventures like Sun's and Oracle's exploit the capabilities of largeserver configurations, leveraging the core capabilities of thesevendors. As innovative as these solutions are, however, they areprimarily incremental markets to those of traditional PCs and will havelittle long-term effect on user's choice of enterprise desktop. Theability to run applications locally will be enabled through the additionof Java-like capabilities. Yet few productive Java applications existtoday, which restricts the initial application of browser-based NIDs tothose enterprises that want to provide low-cost, low-complexity Internetaccess, such as hotel suites, kiosks, libraries, and educationalfacilities.The Windows-based NID is a device that has more of a role to play withinthe enterprise today than the browser-based NID. Vendors of thesedevices (e.g. NCD's Explora and Wyse's WinTerm) have also characterizedtheir devices as `Internet desktops'. While this has given the vendors achance to receive more media attention than their products perhaps wouldhave gotten otherwise, this characterization overlooks the main appealof these NIDs. The remote Windows technology used in these devices isbased on presenting a Windows desktop on a NID that is not runningWindows. These low-priced desktop NIDs (less than $ 1,000) allow fullaccess to complete Windows NT desktop and to all the Windowsapplications from a central server, without the complexity of buildingand supporting the Windows environment in each desktop. While thesesolutions are not appropriate for those involved with nomadic or mobilecomputing (since there is no `offline' mode for NIDs), there areconfigurations where Windows-based NIDs are a lower-cost solution. TheseNIDs only provide the user interface, enabling any Windows application(browsers, groupware clients, or 3270 emulators) to run on the serverand facilitate full exploitation of distributed and client serversolutions. While NIDs will not replace every desktop PC, we believe thatNIDs will comprise 10 percent of new corporate desktop purchases in 1998(0.7 probability).While both the NIDs can evolve to support complete computingenvironments, their initial approaches are different. The majordifference between the Windows-based NID and the browser-based NID isthat browser-based NIDs rely on the Web connectivity paradigm, in whichthe browser is the presentation platform through which a user accessesits computing environment. The Web approach is very network-centric,independent of the hardware platform, and desktop operating system (OS).For the execution of applications, browser-based NIDs are totallyreliant on programming languages, environments, and collaborative suites(such as Java) that are in the early stages of development, but arenetwork-enabled. No mainstream versions of these types of NIDs arecurrently available. Windows-based NIDs use a standard Windows interfaceas their primary presentation platforms and an NT Server as the `host'.For applications, the main feature of the Windows-based NID is theremote presentation of NT server-based Windows applications allowingaccess to the "legacy Windows environment". However, the Windows-basedNID technology does not address any `network-enablement' that Microsoftmay introduce into the application environment. Note, a Windows-basedNID can access any browser running on the NT Server, providing Webaccess and, therefore, duplicating the functionality of a browser-basedNID.These devices are not just for accessing the Internet. Initiallyenvisioning a low-cost network-connected device, the market referred toNIDs as Internet terminals. This name is completely misleading. A moreappropriate term could be a "Web terminal" or "Web computer," but eventhese names are too restrictive. These devices are not only designed toaccess the Internet via the Web, but to run applications as well. Shortterm, the Windows-enabled NIDs (e.g. from NCD and Wyse) will be able torun applications using technology licensed from Citrix. With the Citrixremote Windows presentation protocol, NIDs will be able to remotelypresent a Windows desktop and any Windows-based application. Longerterm, as applications based on Java appear, both the Windows-based andbrowser-based NIDs could run applications based on Java. The attractionto organizations will be in a lower total cost of ownership. In manyGartner Group research papers, we have indicated that the mostsignificant portion of the total cost of ownership of PCs is in theongoing support and maintenance of the PC platform. The fundamentalproblem of how to implement software distribution to hundreds orthousands of desktops is one of the most significant issues faced bylarge organizations. Supporting the underlying complexity of today'snetworked computing environment is another significant issue. Supportfor the underlying complexity of these environments includes service andsupport when moving parts break (most NIDs do not have hard drives,floppy drives or fans), and support when users inadvertently corrupttheir desktop operating environment. All of these issues are resolved byusing NIDs. The browser and remote presentation code can beelectronically updated over the network into `flash ROM'--a technologythat is available today, but has rarely been used over the network. Theprimary attraction of NIDs is to reduce the complexity and, therefore,the cost of network computing.Another user misconception is that enterprises will be running NIDsdirectly on the Internet or somehow using the Internet to deploymission-critical corporate applications. This is a completemisunderstanding of the technology and is propagated by marketreferences to all of these devices as Internet terminals. The typicalconfiguration will not be as an access device to the Internet. Instead,like other Internet technologies (such as Web servers and Web browsers),these technologies will be deployed internally within the securecorporate network to serve as `information portals' to the corporatenetwork infrastructure--with data access enabled through Web pages andapplication access enabled through Citrix-like technologies and, longerterm, by using `Java-like' technologies.For Windows-based NIDs the applications are available now. Forbrowser-based NIDs, the applications will be coming soon. SunMicrosystems has received a lot of attention for its Java programminglanguage. Any Java-enabled browser (including Netscape) can execute aJava application. However, there are no significant mission-criticalJava applications available today. Even with the promise of futureJava-based applications, users could be unwilling to give up theirfavorite Windows-based word processing application for one written inJava that may not provide the same functionality and is probably slower.Users who are concerned that Java is too slow for many applicationsshould take into account the continual improvements in the language asthe environment matures, improvements in hardware capabilities, and thewhole concept engendered by the Java paradigm--which we call NetworkedDynamic Functionality (NDF). NDF means that network-centric applicationevolved to run its `applets' at the place where they perform best andapplication functionality is available when required.NIDs are not X-terminals. X-terminals provided a GUI to UNIX-basedapplications that were stored and executed at the UNIX server. Severalsignificant differences exist between X-terminals and NIDs. First,X-terminals solve a specific problem--providing GUI access to UNIXserver-based applications. Performance was tolerable on a local networksegment, but scaled poorly on WAN links. Second, X-terminals areexpensive--typically averaging $ 3,000. Last, the personal productivityapplications that users wanted to access were rarely UNIX-based.UNIX-based emulation of Windows applications (e.g. WABI) was limited toa subset of applications and suffered from poor performance. NIDs arebased on technologies that were designed around the need to access themost ubiquitous environments (the Web and Windows) and evolved with anemphasis on performance across a WAN. For NIDs, price structures arehitting new low points, through set-top and game-player configurationsand following the pricing trend of PCs.NIDs are not traditional diskless workstations. Traditional disklessworkstations (TDWs) still run a `full-blown' local OS and `localapplications' that are stored elsewhere. Therefore, a TDW carries alongall of the internal complexity of a full-blown PC, minus local storage.With a NID, the only OS services available will be those used to servethe user interface (therefore, a reduction in internal complexity ispossible within the device). Execution of applications will not occur ona NID, but will be distributed to an appropriate server system. Whilethe NID model is more biased toward distributed computing, TDWs werebiased toward networked storage.For Information, contact: Gartner Gropu Info Technology Advisor (India)Pvt.

Computerapplications that use the date for commutations, comparisons, andsorting will produce incorrect results or fail due to invalid data. Theproblem stems from programming techniques used during the 1960's and1970's, when two-digit representations of years were used in mostmainframe applications. Since dates are often used in mathematicalcomputations and comparisons, errors can easily occur when the two-digityear is 00'.The OptionsCompanies would first have to take an inventory of all their code anddecide upon a strategy. The strategy would involve a combination ofdiscarding code, replacing some of the code with standard Year-2000enabled packages, and Year-2000 enabling of the remaining code. Theproportion of code falling under each of these categories would dependon the complexity of the systems in a company. Companies that have asizable portion of their critical systems developed and maintainedin-house would address this problem by looking at reengineering andplatform migration options.A challenge most companies will face is having to justify spendingmillions of dollars on a problem that seems so trivial. At the end ofthe exercise, there may be no perceived business gains, except that theorganization would continue operations as usual. The tendency will be topropose to reengineer some or most of the systems--the perceivedbenefits would justify the expense. Before choosing the reengineeringoption, however, factors such as cost, time available, resourcerequirements, risk, and the company's record of success withreengineering efforts should be considering. The cost of process andbusiness reengineering includes training, personnel reallocation, andchange management--making it an extremely expensive affair. Mostcompanies may end up choosing a mixture of the two options. This choicemay not be available as the time available decreases.Date Enabling The Code And DataIn all probability, organizations will choose to enable some portion oftheir code base as there is just not enough time to handle the issue anyother way. Year-2000 enabling could be done in one of three ways--dateexpansion, date interpretation, or date manipulation.* Date expansion involves increasing the year data to store four digitsand modifying all applications that store and access this data. Whilethe software development effort involved in this strategy is relativelylow, the impact on operations and the coordination required is veryhigh. This is an ideal strategy for a software product manufacturer,since such a company would not have the problems of large data andproductionization.* A date interpretation strategy does not involve changing the data, butonly involves changing the source code to read the data differently. Forinstance, in a 70/30' strategy, any year data that is above 70 impliesthat the data represents the twentieth century and any year data lessthan 70 implies that the data represents the twenty-first century.Although no major coordination effort is required, every program thatrefers to a date field should be changed and significant testing isrequired.This is best employed where the data cannot be changed as it is livedata being used by several applications. This is the ideal strategy forin-house and production systems.* A date manipulation strategy involves adding a specific number ofyears to the year field. This strategy is ideal for in-house orproduction systems where the input and output processing is wellcontrolled through a limited number of programs. The ideal solution inmost cases may be to implement a mixture of these strategies to areasmost applicable rather than forcing one strategy.The MethodologyThe methodology that would be followed is fairly well defined. Aninventory collection phase is followed by a study of the impact of theYear-2000 issue on the code. Several commercially available tools helpautomate this effort for some of the more popular programming languagessuch as COBOL and PL/1. Normally, impact analysis tools are complementedby code conversion tools which automate the process of enabling thecode. Such tools process several million lines of code per month and areavailable for some popular programming languages like COBOL. Forproprietary languages both the analysis and conversion effort will haveto be done manually--a process that takes a lot longer, costs more, andintroduces more bugs.By the end of code and data enabling, only half the work is done. Therest--unit and system testing--is not automatable. Unit testing may beminimal if no manual changes are made and the tool is very reliable andcovers all possible cases. In most cases, unit testing is not trivial.The most difficult part of the methodology is system testing, sinceapplication knowledge is required. In most cases, this is difficult tofind, especially for the areas of the system that have been stable andfunctioning well for several years.Regardless of the strategy chosen for Year 2000 enabling, the effortrequired does not vary much. In case the choice made is to work with aservice provider, the total effort required for data manipulation may bethe lowest. However, it involves the maximum on-site effort, therebymaking it expensive. The data interpretation option would be leastexpensive in terms of resources.Factors Influencing Actual Year 2000 Cost Per Line Of CodeSimplistic code enabling sizing exercises focus on the number of Linesof Code (LoC) and attach a rate to each LOC. The rate quoted varies from$ 0.50 to $ 1.50. However, Gartner projections and DBSS experience showsthat the quoted include only the cost of labor and tools of the serviceprovider for a line of structured COBOL code. The actual expenseincurred by a company for a Year 2000 project could work out to severaltimes the rate per LoC often quoted by the service providers. Some ofthe factors to be considered are:* Availability of tools for the target environment.* Availability of application expertise.* Programming language complexity (in case the language is not COBOL).* Missing source code.* Multiple versions of source code* Testing requirements and complexity.* CPU and DASD resources for parallel and integration tests.* Permanent increase in DASD requirement.* Availability and opportunity cost of using internal resources.* Implementation and productionization.* User training.* Post-implementation supports costs.In one production environment, the cost per LoC for the softwaredevelopment effort of the client and DBSS together worked out to$0.87/line of COBOL code. Of this, the DBSS cost for the on site andIndia effort together was $0.45/line of COBOL code. The total costworked out to $2.81/LoC. This includes the cost of deciding upon thestrategy, post-implementation support, reengineering lost code, andincreased volumes. Based on the initial assumption of $1.00/LOC thecompany had budgeted $18 million for the project. However, the totalcost of the project was $50 million.For another client, a product vendor, the total cost did work out toless than $1.50/LOC. This included the cost of internal resources aswell as the cost of testing. Of course, they did have better code, nolost code, and existing test plans.Next StepFor a company that is yet to start or just becoming aware of theproblem, a few steps need to be taken immediately. The organizationshould try to understand the real size and cost of the problem andanalyze the impact to their business. Waiting for the magic bullet'would only result in the business having to shut down. Finally, acompany would do well to invite solution providers to at least help themin a preliminary impact analysis exercise while continuing to educateitself of the nature and size of this self-designed virus'.S Rengarajan is Senior Project Manager, and T Sridhar is ProjectManager, Dun & Bradstreet Satyam Software.DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996The Right Mix: Breaking into the US marketfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996What are the options available to Indian companies wanting to make theirmark in the US market? Which is the most viable? A look at the pros andcons involved.In my last article (Where are the right people, September 30),I hadaddressed the manpower issue to emphasize why we need to improve revenueproductivity. In this article, I will address the viability of theproduct option.There is a perception among many software companies that the only way toimprove revenue productivity is by taking up packaged products. However,many senior people in the industry are taking a pragmatic view inpointing out the risks associated with doing that.Very few non US companies have been successful in the product marketworldwide. The general expectation of customer support and services inthe US market (which is also the biggest segment) is one of the highestin the world. Meeting this expectation requires huge investments and adeep pocket. Given the difficulties in getting finance and the cost ofcapital, products may not be a very profitable option! The Indiancompany could focus entirely on engineering and let the US partnerhandle the entire marketing. In this case, sharing of revenues andprofits may not be favorable to the Indian company, because thedevelopment cost is often about 10 to 20 percent of the total cost.The virtual monopoly of US companies in the product market is a fact toreckon with. An analysis of the world's top 100 IT companies and the top50 companies by software and services revenues (Source: Datamation)provides some interesting results:Top 100 IT companies: Of the 33 based outside the US, 30 deal withhardware, two with services (Cap Gemini Sogeti, Italy, and Intec, Japan)and one with software (SAP, Germany).Top 50 companies (by software product revenues): Only two (SAP andSoftware AG, Germany) are based outside the US.Top 50 companies (by services revenues): eight are based outside theUS--Cap Gemini Sogeti and Finsiel (Italy), Intec and Nomura (Japan),Sema Group and Sligos (France), SAP and British Telecom.Non-US companies seem to be more successful in services than products.To understand why, let us look at the challenges of marketing productsin the US and what kind of resources it takes. While the US is thebiggest market for software products, it is also the most competitive.Taking the product route therefore requires a lot of resources, whichcould become a bottleneck for many Indian companies. First, you needmarket information to decide what is state-of-the-art and what featureswill sell. Your US-based competitors have an edge over you, simplybecause they have a better feel of the market and a local presence. Howmuch could you spend on market research or how far could you depend onyour US partner for market information? Second, the cost of marketing inthe US is phenomenal and even the top Indian software companies oftenfind it better to tie up with a US distributor rather than handlemarketing entirely on their own. A distributor in the US (like anywhereelse) looks at any product from two perspectives--margins and volumes.Can every Indian company offer products which are high value or whichare fast selling? To protect their own margins and improve volumes, theyhave to offer something very innovative and something not yet availablein the US market. With limited information and the pressure on time,success depends on the kind of resources that can be pumped into productdevelopment.The general expectation of product marketing and support in the US isvery high. Most product vendors in the US have toll free (1-800) numberswhere one can contact (free of charge) to obtain product and marketinginformation. Distributors in the US are responsible only for providinglocal contact, carrying inventory, and providing first-level support ortraining (often at extra cost). Installation is always do-it-yourself,using manuals. If a user has a difficulty with manuals or needstechnical support, he is expected to contact the vendor directly using atoll free number. Even if a US distributor provides the infrastructure,the Indian company has to provide people to handle installation andtechnical support. Support costs in the US can therefore be considerable.Obtaining finances and bearing the interest cost could be a problem formany Indian companies taking the product route. In turnkey projects,most companies get paid periodically on completion of a milestone andcash flows are more predictable. But the in-flows of product revenuesare highly skewed against out-flows of investments and expenses. First,where is the mechanism to fund product investments? What kind ofpressure will investors, financial institutions, and the top managementput in order to maintain or improve the bottomline? If Indian companiesstart cutting corners to save costs, will it not work to theirdisadvantage? These are important questions to be answered.Some Indian companies feel that they could get into a two-way marketingand support tie-up with a US software vendor. The US vendor could handleIndian products in the US with a similar arrangement in the Indianmarket for his products. This helps the Indian company avoid investingin infrastructure (like 1-800 lines) and people in the US. But thisoption has to be carefully evaluated from both sides. First, most USvendors are more interested in selling their products in India (or theAsian market) than selling Indian products in the US. Second, Indianproducts in general and the brand "Made in India" are not popular in theUS. Will the US vendor's commitment to the Indian product be strongenough? What happens, if at a late stage, the US partner backs out? Willthe Indian company be left high and dry?Products carry a higher risk because marketing is often not entirelyunder your control and your investments and returns are often spreadover a longer period of time. Does this mean products fetch higherprofits? Not necessarily. Development costs are often far lower thanmarketing and distribution costs (which form a bigger share of the totalcost). If your investments and risks are only in development and yourpartner picks up all the costs (and associated risks) of marketing, theprofit sharing is bound to be in his favour. If you take on moreresponsibility by sharing the marketing and support costs you can claima bigger share of profits. But then, your investments and expenses willbe higher. Either way, there is a trade-off.Of course, Indian companies have to improve their revenue productivityand reduce the dependency on people. But given the resourcerequirements, the product route may not be the best solution for everyIndian company. Two models can achieve this objective, without demandinga lot of resources. One is creating intellectual property usable acrossmultiple projects or products. This allows companies to leverage theinvestment and get higher revenues over a period of time. The other isto ask customers to pay for the value of the solution regardless of theeffort or input. My next two articles will examine these models(Intellectual Property and Pay for Solutions) in detail.K R Kashyap, is Senior Manager (Business Development), Tata Unisys Ltd,Bangalore.DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: A TIME FOR VISIONfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996Strategizing for the future may seem a little irrelevant, and perhaps alittle trivial, in the Indian context. For an industry that is a modestRs 9,712 crore, which is just a little were than the size of India'slargest corporate entity--Telco--but an industry which made the axiom`change is the only constant' true more than ever before, it appearsthat planning for the future is the only way to survive. This applies toIndian companies participating in this nascent industry, irrespective ofsize or content. We examine where we are in terms of future planning,how we got here, and what are the issues that we need to tackle torealize the true potential of India Inc.It has been argued at length that the Indian IT industry (read hardware)is a mere subset of the US (read global) IT industry--there isn't asingle player of global significance that does not have a presence inIndia, either as joint ventures or as fully-owned subsidiaries. It isalso said that these companies do not have any strategies far removedfrom their parent companies and that they merely follow the trend thatis extant overseas. What we have is both a technologically volatile andtechnology-dominated industry. Hence, fashioning a strategy in Indiathat is separate and removed from the West, in this case the US, wouldneed a combination of creativity and taking cues from what has happenedelsewhere in the world. There are two problems here. For one, it is anindustry which is driven by technological advances--from microprocessorsto system software--in all core competency areas, and which for the mostpart resides in the West. Two, given the rapid changes that are takingplace in the Indian market, strategizing is as much keeping pace withthe market changes as it is keeping pace with technology. Historically,while in India, computer usage has been traditionally low, theassimilation of computer technology was not too far behind than that inthe US. And increasingly we are bridging that gap. The possibility ofIndian companies increasingly choosing a foreign brand of PC as againstthe existing local brands (HCL, Wipro, PCL) became more than real.Viewed in this context, a Shiv Nadar joining hands with Hewlett Packard,Ashok Soota tying up with Acer, Ratan Tata signing up with IBM, DadanBhai setting up Altos to manufacture Dell motherboards are instances ofstrategic thinking for the future.The Indian ImperativeThe other side of the picture is that a strategy which leads to closureof local manufacturing is no strategy at all, and least of all aforesight. This is where strategizing in the Indian context has come toembody certain focussed moves in the market. But Indian companies had tojuggle between an Indian market that is not only notoriouslyprice-sensitive and averse to changing old systems for new with the samealacrity as in the West, but also had to contend with some draconianduties in the form of import, excise, and countervailing duties etc.They had to judiciously mix and match their strategies when it came toproduct launches as well as pricing for various market segments.For instance, though Wipro discontinued its brand of PCs, HCL's Busybeeand PCL still exist as a brand. We could split hairs on manufacturingversus assembly and on how many local brands there are vis-a-vis foreignbrands, but the fact is that these brands have retained their identitydespite the odds. And, even though HCL pushed boxes up until the earlynineties, it gave birth to NIIT more than a decade ago, which, in turn,spawned off the training industry in India. This is one of the rare butsubstantial examples of how a brand-building strategy can come tomaturity in an entirely different product segment.The other aspect of the Indian strategic initiative is the capacity andthe inclination to leverage and adapt on partner skills. Wipro, whichcould hit the Indian shores even before liberalization, had marketingand distribution agreements with companies like Sun Microsystems andTandem in order to leverage on their strengths to provide solutions. Thephrase `embrace and extend' may have been coined by the Internet team atMicrosoft but it was definitely adopted first by Indian IT companies, asa strategic tool. And it has worked wonders here, in different ways fordifferent companies. Thus, if HP lent engineering skills, world-classmanufacturing methodology, and credibility to HCL, Wipro got a wider PCproduct portfolio through Acer, and high-end mission-critical solutionsthrough Tandem. The locals also figured out that multinationals wouldfind it difficult, if not impossible (as Compaq has proved in the PCmarket), to enter the Indian market all alone.Similarly, in software too, India has evolved, though it hasn't had tocontend with competing products. It is moving from providing onsiteservices to offshore, and is among the most preferred choices forcompanies in the US and Europe. Thanks to our USPs. There is a gradualemergence of software products like Bancs 2000 and Marshal for globalconsumption.The Value Of ForesightThe last four years have been cataclysmic in many ways. Some companiesmade a success of it, whereas others weren't as lucky. If there haven'tbeen any instances of failures in the software industry, it doesn't meanthat they have all been singularly smart or right with their strategies.It is just that their fate was not as inextricably tied with theemerging Indian market as that of the hardware industry. CMC is one suchinstance. A model company once, it completely failed to see the impactof having a DEC and IBM locally. And soon it started losing out on TPMcontracts to the foreign companies who were operating directly. This isa clear example of how medium-term strategic thinking is important for acompany, and how often Indian corporates fail to appreciate this.Tata Unisys, Tata Elxsi, DCM DataSystems, and PSI Data Systems are allinstances of companies that were late off the block in asking thiscrucial question: What will the market look like four to five yearshence? It was not enough to merely read the technological trendoverseas; it was imperative to read the changes taking place in theIndian market scenario too. Tata was early in acquiring Elxsi, which wasahead of its time elsewhere and in India, with its 64-bit systems. Bullmainframes had no takers in the world market, pushed as they were fromthe bottom by powerful workstations. The mainframe market in Indiadidn't exist, except in the minds of a few at PSI.In the recent past we have seen DEIL coming out of a trough successfullyand then going downhill again. DEIL failed twice, first with itsdecision to manufacture a particular range of VAX systems in India, andsecond, when it went in for manufacturing Apple systems. While in thefirst case, DEIL mistook the latent demand for VAX systems in India tomean that its demand will continue, in the latter case, it failed toanticipate internal issues in the company which, inhibited a low-valueitem to be pushed alongside high-end VAX and Alpha systems. In both thecases, it had to suffer losses.At the same time, there are some companies which have pulled themselvesout of the mess quite admirably, for e.g. DCM DataSystems, Tata Elxsi,and PSI Data Systems. For instance, DCM, after going through severalrounds of restructuring (which resulted in several heads rolling) andreengineering, is well on its way to full recovery. In the lastfinancial year, the company grew by around 100 percent. This wasachieved through its strategy of focusing on customer as a verticalsegment instead of any geography or domain like finance ormanufacturing. According to Veer Sagar, MD, DCM DataSystems, "Bycombining responsiveness as an USP, and lowest delivered cost in thecountry as the business mission along with customer focus, we have beenable to increase profits by 300 percent over the previous year." DCM hasalso cut down management layers from eleven to five, reducing thedistance between the customer and president to just three layers.PSI Data Systems metamorphosed from PSI Bull, which had set up amanufacturing site in India to manufacture mainframes. It missedeverything--from the first stirrings of liberalization to the swiftlychanging Government policies to the market demand for open systems asagainst proprietary systems. In 1992-93, the company declared nearlyhalf its turnover of Rs 18.5 crore as loss. The company reengineered itsbusiness operations around software and is now into software servicesand systems integration. Says Ajay Mehta, CEO and MD, PSI Datasystems"Having met all its four objectives set in 1993 at the time ofreengineering, PSI made a modest profit of Rs 1 crore on a turnover ofRs 20.7 crore."The Choice Of LearningDo these successes mean that Indian companies have learnt their lessonswell and are into long-term strategizing? Compared with the India of thelate eighties, we have taken giant strides and are on par with theworld. Today, we talk of the application of leading-edge technologieswith the same level of ease and expertise as anybody else from the samebackground in the US does. But take a few steps backward and view thescenario from a distance. What we see is an India that is still as faraway from the US as it was a decade or two ago. In fact, further off, asin the same time that we have taken giant strides, the US has takenquantum leaps in technology. While in India PC penetration has justcrossed 1 million, a company like Compaq alone makes over three millionPCs a year. J Ramachandran, Professor of Corporate Strategy and PolicyArea at IIM Bangalore, says, "It is difficult to envisage an Indian ITplayer in the global hardware industry. We were very late in opening upthe economy and today, it doesn't make sense to make India amanufacturing site. The economies of scale will not work out." GopalSrinivasan, Past President, MAIT, has a different point of view.According to him, the hardware industry is divided into severalsegments, of which India has a better chance of breaking into areas likenotebooks assembly, peripherals' assemblies and sub-assemblies. What isimportant is that in the last one year, more thought has gone intodevising a strategic line of thinking for charting the course of Indianindustry than at any time in the history. The Arthur D Little studycommissioned by MAIT has also looked at the Indian strategic issues andhas made some recommendations in this regard.The Question Of NeedIndian companies have been hamstrung by the notion that productdevelopment is a resource-intensive business and has not been veryaggressive in that area. However, in the process several importantissues have got sidetracked and not been pushed as aggressively as theyought to have been. For instance, surely, we could have worked ondeveloping regional language interfaces for operating systems and made adifference to acceptance of computers across the country, and not justin English-speaking pockets. These are simple straight-forward answersto admittedly complex issues. Clearly, Indian companies need tore-invent industries and re-generate strategies as opposed to merelyreengineering their processes. For, strategizing is not all aboutsafeguarding the present businesses and industries. It has more to dowith inventing new ones and re-inventing the old ones. Like Dr CKPrahlad and Gary Hamel say in their bestseller Competing For The Future,"It's a pre-requisite for getting to the future first and a pre-condition for staying out in front." Dr MB Athreya, Management Advisor,comments, "I have been advocating since the liberalization paradigmshift of 1991 that Indian companies should go for a grand vision of highgrowth, with long-term strategic planning. This is particularly true forIndian IT industry, where hardware is growing at 40 percent p.a. andsoftware at 60 percent p.a. There is a possible vision of India beingthe world's fifth largest economy by year 2000 A.D., fourth by 2005 andthird by 2010. Indian IT companies should plan with that mindset. Thenew Compaqs and Microsofts could emerge from India."The Road Less TravelledBut for that to happen, Indian IT companies need to pause and askthemselves a few crucial questions. How do they see themselves by year2000. Who will be the customers? Would they have the wherewithal to meetthose challenges? What core competencies can they exploit? It is simplynot enough for these companies to go with the tide as we see today inthe case of hardware companies. There isn't a single player who isn'tinto software exports as well. It's high time we moved into developingengineering software as against commercial software. Engineering is anarea where India has immense talent and we could leverage on it and moveup the value chain, instead of deploying them to create commercialsoftware. The Internet and intranets have come to India in less than 18months of their capturing the popular imagination of people in the US.It is still evolving. New ideas and products are emerging daily. It ishailed as the great equalizer between companies and between nations.This could be India's chance of becoming first among equals. Nothingbest paraphrases the sentiment than the quote in Competing For TheFuture, "Getting to the future is not just about out-running yourcompetitors bent on reaching the same prize. It is about having one'sown view of what the prize is. There can be as many prizes as runners;imagination is the only limiting factor."DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996THE CORPORATE REALMS: A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE PARTICULAR NATURE OFSTRATEGIES THAT SOME IT COMPANIES IN INDIA FOLLOWfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996In India, we may not have instances like Hewlett-Packard--whichre-invented itself and recreated an industry--but we have been witnessto companies that have restructured and re-invented themselves.Companies that have successfully carved out a space for themselvesdespite the presence of bigger players and in some cases, like Intel,developed their market beyond the limiting borders.There are quite a few companies--like Mindware and UB Networks--that aretrying to do what has never been done before in India, or elsewhere. Forinstance, UB is introducing the concept of buy-backs--a popular conceptin the white goods industry--wherein it will replace all old unmanagedstackable hubs with chassis-based hubs. Similarly, Mindware isexperimenting with a new concept in people management.The companies that follow have employed various strategies at variouspoints in time, to anchor themselves better in the market. It mightappear that several segments and companies have been left out orignored, but we have taken representative categories and not companies.INTEL INSIDE:This insignia stamped outside the CPUs of PCs was Intel Corp.'s firststep to come out from the bowels of the motherboard to the outside worldand virtually swamp the world of computing with Intel-made newer andfaster chips. Hardly surprising that soon Intel Inside became more of`Intel Everywhere'. In India too. And it is to Intel's credit that ithas succeeded in the Indian market which traditionally has been slow toaccept change on a first-come-first-serve basis.The world markets may have been all frenzied over Pentium, but even in1994-95, less than 9 percent of the PCs sold in India had Pentiumprocessors inside. And the situation a year ago hadn't changeddramatically--the Indian market lagged behind the developed world byapproximately 12-18 months in terms of usage of the latestmicroprocessors. In less than a year, the time lag has been cut to ninemonths, and today, the penetration of Pentium's stand at over 60percent.The credit in large measure goes to Atul Vijaykar, who came as CountryManager (India) mid last year. If, on one hand, he pushed Intel Corp. toreduce prices on its chips, on the other, he convinced the Indiancorporates to adopt the latest chip technology. He pushed for increasedusage of computers not just in corporate segments but in schools aswell. In fact, he set up a Cyber School at the Delhi National ScienceCentre and recently organized a multimedia show for children along withTangerine. He went one step further and brought virtually an army ofsmall vendors who were assembling PCs, including the grey marketvendors, under the ambit of Intel. So much so that, today, they use theIntel Inside logo as a seal of guarantee and quality.Pushing the market in all possible directions, he has succeeded inkeeping up the promise made a year ago that 75MHz Pentium systems ofstandard configuration would be available between Rs 50,000 and Rs60,000, not of an MNC brand though, by late 1996. Of course, Intel'stask was made simpler with the reduction in duties and falling prices ofmemory. Admittedly, Intel really has no competitors in the Indian marketto lose sleep over yet, but Vijaykar, not leaving anything to chance,has managed to galvanize the market for Intel and Pentium-based systemslike never before. The only semblance of competition that they face isfrom Apple's PowerPC systems. And if Apple had harbored hopes ofharnessing a bulk of the market before everybody swung the Intel way,clearly Vijaykar's coming has hammered the proverbial last nail on thecoffin.MICROLAND'S MACRO VIEW:MicroLand certainly didn't discover networking. That was done by Zenithway before MicroLand even came into the picture. But it sure pioneerednetworking as an industry in India. And if we have over 35 systemsintegrators today, providing networking solutions in the low and mediumend of the corporate market, it is thanks to MicroLand, whichsingle-handedly spawned off the industry.But that is not the only reason why MicroLand gets mentioned here. Ithas consistently looked beyond the `now' and done what most othersconsidered impossible. For instance, when it landed the authorizeddistributor deal from Compaq, it was an insignificant company, barely aforce to be reckoned with in India. Similarly, when it tied up with allthe leading players in every aspect of networking--from local toenterprise-wide--it was doing more than just bringing world-classnetworking products to India. Pradeep Kar, MD, was also communicating atlarge that if the world leaders thought fit to go with MicroLand, thenMicroLand must be a company capable of delivering world-class solutions.Every single move was pre-meditated. Like in the old days when Jensonand Nicholson became synonymous with paints through its advertisingslogan `When you see color, think of us,' MicroLand has used the sameassociating strategy with Connectivity India (CI). MicroLand effectivelyexploited the potential of the CI forum to leverage its networkingsolution-providing capabilities. A measure of MicroLand's success can begauged from the fact that, despite its size, it is associated withcompanies like Wipro and TISL.Though MicroLand is viewed with skepticism in some quarters--it isbelieved that MicroLand has reached its peak and will flatten out--it ismore of a proactive company moving up the value chain more consistentlythan many others. It exploited the fact that organizations moved to arhythm and that this would deter companies like TISL or DEIL from doingthe same. The general belief is that the associating strategy thatworked so well for networking is unlikely to work in case of InternetIndia. Since the market is yet to open out, it remains a debatableissue.ADVANTEC'S ADVANTAGE:Two years ago, Advantec Network Systems was hardly known but today it isone of the fastest growing companies in the field of providing aone-stop shop for networking solutions. No, it is not a systemsintegrator. It just acts as a `via media' for the systems integrators bystocking all the major networking products like hubs and switches.Neither is it a master warehousing agent. Advantec is somewhere inbetween the two. Today, Advantec is the single-point hub that supports,trains, and provides just-in-time delivery and credit to over 120systems integrators. These 120 systems integrators include the smallestto the largest, namely, Wipro. It has spread itself over two regionaldepots and 40 warehouses in India to deliver network components wheneverand wherever in the shortest possible time. Though Advantec started as adistributor for AT&T's structured cabling Systimax--it accounts fornearly 60 percent of AT&T's Systimax sales in India--it figured quicklyenough that the number of companies providing network solutions would goup considerably.It stepped in and devised ways of meeting this need early on byconcentrating on developing skills in the areas of network design,installation, testing, and certification besides training programmes forend-users. It acts as a consultant to its team of systems integrators,pitching in to help them. Now leveraging on its reach, it has put itsnetwork out for the benefit of small systems integrators to pool theirtalent and resources to address large enterprise-wide networking tasks.GODREJ'S GAINS:Godrej nearly came to be labelled the Jack-of-all-trades,master-of-none, for reasons more than not having a focus--it changed itsname thrice in as many years. It was into everything--from research anddevelopment in CAD/CAM to the manufacture of printers and distributionand marketing. It came close to losing everything but fortunatelyseveral rounds of transformation led the company to its area of corecompetency--distribution--sooner than later. A competency Godrej andBoyce is traditionally known for.Today, Godrej Pacific Technology Ltd (GPTL), after its joint venturewith Tech Pacific of Australia--one of the largest OA productdistribution company in Asia--is one of the largest distributors inIndia. Given that distribution is now a major strategic area for mostcompanies in IT, GPTL can be safely said to have arrived.LATHA KUTTAPPANDataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA QUEST via NewsNetOctober 15, 1996INDIAN IT COMPANIES: A CASE FOR REENGINEERINGfrom DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996If Indian IT companies desire global competitiveness and viability, itis necessary that they transform now and wholly.The World Competitiveness Survey of 1994 ranked India 39 out of 41emerging economies on parameters ranging from customer responsiveness toTQM. The recently released 1996 Update hasn't shown much change withIndia ranking 46 out of 49 countries. If this is representative of theIndian standing in global markets in general, the IT industry doesn'tfare much better. Despite the brave show put on by the software exportsindustry in the face of accelerating worldwide competition, penetrationof IT within India and the ability of Indian organizations to standshoulder to shoulder with global leaders is still poor, with only theodd firm standing out occasionally as an exception to the generalmediocrity that pervades the Indian IT scene.What ails this industry? Can the entire blame be assigned to thesluggish domestic demand or is the malaise within the industry itself?If India is to be a force to be reckoned within the next millennium,will a little patching and plumbing suffice or do we need fundamentalrethinking and radical redesign of the industry's business processes toachieve a dramatic turnaround in perception and fortunes?The case for reengineering is brought into sharp focus if we analyze thestatus of the industry today and the achievements it has made in thelast few years. We see a domestic hardware industry that is on its kneesand under threat of obliteration by foreign brands, a software industrythat is still known more for its forays overseas with a serviceportfolio that is only slowly shifting from body shopping and legacysystems to leading edge technologies, and a training industry thatproduces close to a million trained personnel every year but is stillmaking only a small dent in the demand-supply gap for internationalquality software professionals.On the other hand, the industry still has a lot going for it. The ArthurD Little Survey for MAIT on the Competitiveness of the Indian ITHardware Industry for Exports mentions low labour rates, well-trainedengineers, and a large domestic market as key opportunities that canpropel Indian IT companies to worldclass status. The presence of wellorganized associations in every segment of the industry--NASSCOM, MAIT,NACT, Indian Internet Forum etc. augurs well for the collectivecapability of the industry. But as the study points out, the perceptionof the global customer ranges from, "Doing business with India is aheadache," to, "I would source from them if they had better quality!"A look at the Arthur D Little perception of the weakest areas in theIndian hardware industry compared to global brand owner expectationsshow the following areas to be addressed in order of weakness.QualityVolume FlexibilityDeliveryCost Reduction AbilityManagement CapabilityTechnological PositionCommunication CapabilityFinancial StrengthCostWhile this is based on the hardware industry, the software sector toowould exhibit a rather similar list of priority areas. And these can bebroadly classified in three areas that require drastic improvement.A Business ProcessesB Customer ResponsivenessC Infrastructural SupportIf each of these areas are addressed meticulously and urgently, there isstill a chance that India can be an IT Superpower by the year 2000. Letus see what that is going to take and who are the parties that will haveto get involved to expedite the transformation.Reengineering Business ProcessesFor both the hardware and software sectors of the industry, the two keybusiness processes are new product development and order fulfillment.While new product development may still be a little while away for thehardware industry and is just being seen as crucial for the softwareindustry, this will be a process that will determine our long-termsuccess in the global arena. What is, however, crying out for immediatereengineering is order fulfillment. Day after day, one hears horrorstories of computers delivered months after the committed date, softwarecontract cancellations on account of major delays, and even trainingcourses that finish a year later than the committed finish date. EveryIndian company must understand that delivering on time is not an optionbut an imperative for international business. Comprehensivereengineering exercises of the entire process, from the time the firstbuyer-supplier handshake takes place, to the receipt of the last paymentmust be done with no respect for existing functions, departments, andnon-value adding activities that inhibit on-time fulfillment.Anticipating And Satisfying Customer NeedsThe best product in the world is no good if the customer needs orperceives he needs something else. The slow take-off of the SOHO marketin India is just one case in point of international products launched inIndia with mega advertising and great fanfare only to meet with strongdisinterest from skeptical customers. The IT vendor in India is alreadyknown as a hit-and-run salesman, more interested in closing the sale andcollecting his commission than building long term alliances with thecustomer.The venerable CK Prahlad talks about building opportunity share ratherthan getting obsessed with today's market shares. The companies whosucceed or even survive into the twenty first century will be those witha clear vision of customer needs, a commitment to satisfying andexceeding customer expectations at all times, and building long-lastingcustomer value. In the decade that this author has spent in the ITIndustry, no Indian company can truthfully claim this stature today!Creating A Supportive InfrastructureOne of the gems that Vittal used to throw at IT chieftains was "When thegoing gets tough, the tough go to the Government!" While this point isworth noting, when it comes to improving organizations within theexisting framework, the Government too has one responsibility if ittruly wishes to see a global IT industry emerge in India--and that is toprovide at least a semblance of infrastructural support that will enablecustomer response and order fulfillment to be maximized and force theworld to take India seriously. In a world where electronic datainterchange is the order of the day, email is struggling to make itspresence felt in India, and while the information superhighway isknocking at Indian doors, the number of Internet subscribers is still totouch the five-figure mark.This is one activity where the industry associations have to be workingon a daily basis with the Government. Instead of attempting to be allthings to all people and spouting new jargon at every conceivable forum,MAIT, NACT, and IIF should follow the excellent example of NASSCOM andwork hard to make the Government and their respective segments of theindustry, work together to create a better future for the entire IndianIT industry.Will the industry captains wake up and steer the IT ship to the promisedland or will we all flounder and see our global aspirations shattered onthe stark rocks of global realities?Ganesh Natarajan is Managing Director of Aptech Ltd and Director ofHexaware Infosystems Ltd.DataQuest (not affiliated with Dataquest Inc., a company of the Dun &Bradstreet Corp., USA).Copyright 1996 Dataquest (India)Back to Headline List WT03-B32-3IA059-000323-B021-59http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec03.html 205.156.212.5 19970114215450 text/html 30179HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:53:03 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:23 GMTContent-length: 29992Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec03.html Sample Issue Copyright DATATRENDS REPORT ON DEC via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES *LATEST NEWS* ALPHA REVENUE PACES SOLID SECOND QUARTER FINANCIALS (896 words) DIGITAL UNLEASHES HARDWARE BARRAGE (1478 words) ENHANCED INTERNET ALPHASERVER SOFTWARE KIT UNVEILED (219 words) "SUPER SPIDER:" DIGITAL'S INTERNET SEARCH TOOL (784 words) PRICING FOR PENTIUM 150 MHZ, 166MHZ COMMERCIAL DESKTOP SYSTEMS (439 words) PRICING FOR PENTIUM 150 MHZ, 166MHZ COMMERCIAL DESKTOP SYSTEMS (437 words) CopyrightDATATRENDS REPORT ON DEC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996ALPHA REVENUE PACES SOLID SECOND QUARTER FINANCIALSCASH PICTURE UNCHANGED:  DIGITAL ON JAN. 23 REPORTED NET INCOME OF$148.8 million, or $0.91 per common share, for the second quarter,which ended December 30, 1995, compared with net income of $18.9million, or $0.07 per common share, for the same period last year.But cash remained the same as in the first quarter, and grew lessthan $400 million since last year.Digital cited the strong performance of its 64-bit Alpha-basedcomputer lines as one of the key reasons for healthy sales.  Salesin these lines grew by 50 percent over the prior year, withstrongest demand shown for AlphaServer systems.  Strong salesgrowth was reported also in the Alpha workstation products,especially those shipping with Windows NT.Total operating revenue for the quarter was $3.95 billion, up 14percent from the $3.47 billion for the comparable quarter a yearago.Gross margin for the quarter was 32.6 percent, compared with 33.1percent for the comparable period in the prior year and 32.2percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.11 billion,essentially unchanged from the same period last year, on higherrevenue.  Current period operating expenses reflected previouslyannounced demand generation initiatives, including variable salesand distribution costs associated with increased volumes.The increase in product sales over last year is a healthy signthat Digital's profit is not just coming from belt-tightening.The company ended the quarter with approximately 61,100 employees,down 4,500 from a year ago and 400 from the first quarter of thecurrent fiscal year."Digital is solidly into a strategic growth phase, as demonstratedby our highest quarterly revenue ever," said Digital ChairmanRobert B. Palmer.  "We enjoyed significant revenue growth in allof our product businesses and in our new service offerings.  Wealso recorded good revenue growth in all geographies.  I amoptimistic we will experience continued growth as we move into thesecond half of our fiscal year.""I am pleased that our efforts have produced five consecutivequarters of improving profits, on a year-over-year basis," saidCFO Vincent J. Mullarkey.  "We clearly achieved acceleratedrevenue and profit growth during the quarter.  We are experiencingstrong demand across the company for all of our new product andservice offerings."Over the course of the next two years, Digital will continue toconcentrate on improving operations to bring profit levels in linewith the computer industry's leading financial performers,"Mullarkey said.Product revenues were up 26 percent in the quarter to $2.35billion from $1.87 billion in the second quarter of last year, andthe seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year product revenuegrowth.ALPHA RESULTSThe company's 64-bit Alpha systems sales grew by 50 percent overthe prior year, driven by strong demand for AlphaServer systems.Digital's total Alpha-generated revenue since introduction threeyears ago, now exceeds $7 billion.The company reported revenue growth and increasing demand in itsAlphaStation line, with particularly strong growth in workstationsshipping with Windows NT.  Workstation products range fromIntel-based personal workstations to the industry-leading 64-bitAlphaStation 600.Digital also unveiled an advanced software translation andemulation technology that enables high-performance x86compatibility on Alpha systems.  The FX!32 software provides Alphausers the same suite of Microsoft Windows applications that run onx86 systems.PERSONAL COMPUTERSDigital recorded strong revenue growth in its personal computerbusiness."Two quarters ago we redirected the course of our PC business tobalance growth and financial performance," Palmer said.  "Thisstrategy is working.  We continue to capture additional marketshare, with more than 40 percent revenue growth in the secondquarter, as demand for our full range of Intel-based personalcomputer products accelerates."Revenue from the company's components product businesses,including storage subsystems and network products, grew more than30 percent over last year.  The Storage Business Unit, a supplierof platform-neutral storage solutions, saw strong revenue growthin its StorageWorks products.  The Network Products Business Unitalso experienced revenue growth in its switching and hub products.The company's service revenues were $1.604 billion, essentiallyunchanged from the same period last year.  While VAX maintenancerevenues were down slightly, the decline was offset by thesignificant growth in the company's new multivendor services,network integration services and Alpha systems maintenance andsupport.The company continues to make progress in improving overall grossmargin trends, Mullarkey said.Product gross margin was 32.5 percent, compared with 30.5 percentin the second quarter of a year ago.  Service gross margin was32.7 percent compared with 36.1 percent in the comparable periodlast year, reflecting the expected shift in mix towards new highgrowth, but somewhat lower margin multivendor service and supportofferings.Digital ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash,essentially unchanged from the first quarter and an increase of$362 million compared with last year."I am pleased with many aspects of our asset managementperformance, with solid improvements in asset turns for bothinventory and property, plant and equipment," Mullarkey said.

A description follows.The inner surface of a video display panel such as cathode ray tube(CRT) glass faceplate is initially coated with a mixture of one ofthe primary color phosphors, an organic binder such as polyvinylalcohol (PVA) diluted with water, and a photoresist agent. Theorganic binder overcomes the poor adhesion to the glass faceplateof the photoresist which typically includes polyvinyl pyrrolidone(PVP) and reduces the oxygen which decreases phosphor exposuretime.To overcome PVA and PVP incompatibilities which give rise tononuniform film thickness, a vinyl pyrrolidone-vinyl alcohol (VP-VA) copolymer is added to the phosphor, organic binder andphotoresist mixture in the range of 0.1-30 wt%. The copolymer withboth the VP and VA functioning groups serves as a coupling agentbetween the PVA and PVP and eliminates incompatibilities betweenthese components. The VP-VA copolymer preferably has a VP/VA moleratio in the range of 20/80 to 80/20.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Single Board ComputerSupports CRTs and FPDsDensitron Corp. of America's latest Single Board Computer, calledthe DPX-57, breaks new ground for the level of integration,performance and functionality at a reasonable cost.

One is improving performanceof the LCD and the other, possibly more important, is the gradualreduction in LCD monitor prices.  As the two key types of displaysget closer, pressure is mounting on the CRT.A key advantage of flat panels is, and has always been, the needfor less space.  Recently, the New York Stock Exchange upgraded itstrading floor and, in the process, replaced their CRTs with LCDsmade by Sharp.  This is a prime example of how these flat panelsare being adapted even though the price is several times that ofthe conventional CRT.  Another advantage that led to thereplacement of cathode ray tubes in a hospital is the fact thatLCDs do not present magnetic interference problems with medicalequipment.Now that the laptop market is close to saturation, LCD makers suchas Sharp Electronics are saying that replacement of the CRT desktopcomputer monitors will begin in the fourth quarter.  Sharp usessome rough calculations about relative prices that we have alsoheard from other companies and industry watchers.  For example, ifprices of LCDs fall to 3 times that of CRTs, there will be a marketpotential of 5% of the desktop monitor market or 3 million units by1997.  If LCD prices drop to 2 times the CRTs, the potentialincreases to 15% or approximately 9 million units.  Most industryexperts agree that if price parity were to be achieved, the LCDwould be far ahead of the CRT in the desktop market.Sharp isn't the only company playing in this field.  Others,including Compaq and NEC, are also looking at the vast potential inthe desktop market.  Aerospace, graphic design and medical imagingare emerging markets for the LCD desktop monitors.  But Sharprecently opened an advanced manufacturing facility in Japan andthird generation manufacturing techniques will mass produce largeformat LCDs.  Competition is heating up and, with all the emphasison reduced production cost, our guess is that it won't be longuntil the CRT is under more pressure from LCD desktop units.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Memory CapabilitiesCan Be ImprovedFerroelectric chiral smectic liquid crystals with improved contrastratios and memory capabilities, developed by scientists at SumitomoChemical Co., Ltd. (Sumitomo Bldg., 5-33 Kitahama, 4-Chome, Chuo-ku, Osaka 541, Japan; Tel: 6/220 3272, Fax: 6/220 3345), areintended for use in optical shutters and liquid crystal displays(LCDs).  Among the advantages of LCDs, reports Chizu Sekine in U.S.Patent 5,545,345, are a thin profile, light weight, a low drivingvoltage, and low power demand.Two types of driving systems, active matrix-addressed and passivematrix-addressed, are commonly used.  In active matrix-addressedsystems, a thin film transistor or diode made of polysilicon oramorphous silicon is connected to each picture element.  Thedrawbacks of active matrix-addressed systems include problems inassembling large area displays with good memory density.  Achievingreasonable production costs is difficult, too--manufacturing iscomplicated, and yields are low.Passive matrix-addressed systems include two types: twisted nematicand supertwisted nematic LCDs.  The optical response of such adevice is based on the average orientation of the molecular axis ofthe liquid crystal in a specific direction, based on anisotropy ofthe dielectric constant of the liquid crystal molecule, which, inturn, is caused by the application of an electric field.  As aresult, the device's optical response speed is measured inmilliseconds, far too slow for the computers of the future.The new Sumitomo Chemical ferroelectric chiral liquid crystals arecharacterized by bistability, a property that causes such acrystal, when held between a pair of glass plates--each carrying atransparent electrode--to have two different optically stablestates, depending on directions of the applied electric field.  Thetwo optically stable states are maintained after the removal of theelectric fields.  As a result, such devices do not suffer fromdecreased contrast ratios or cross-talk, even when the number ofscanning lines is increased.Another advantage of the ferroelectric liquid crystals is theirhigh response speed, about 1,000 times faster than those of twistednematic and supertwisted nematic LCDs.  The crystals are based onan alkyl group with 5-15 carbon atoms.  They also include a secondalkyl group with 1-10 carbon atoms or an alkoxyalkyl group with 2-10 carbon atoms, of which one may be replaced by a halogen atom.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Two DimensionalView in 3-D DisplaySanyo Electric (Tokyo, Japan) has done something unique to its 3-Dmonitor that is intended to make it more practical.  The companyoffers an option to 2-D viewing as well.The 3-D display is based on Sanyo's image splitters, which areextensions of a technology developed by Japan's government-ownedbroadcasting network, NHK.  But viewers have difficulty in readingtext in 3-D so Sanyo added the 2-D function.  If, for example, the3-D monitor is used with a PC, the operator can specify one portionof the screen as 3-D and another as 2-D, thus separating objectsthat will be seen in 3-D from text.Switching back and forth is done with the assistance of special on-off shutters.  When the switch is on, the splitters divide theright and left eye images which creates the 3-D effect.  When theswitch is off, the image becomes 2-D.  The shutter is a singlesheet that can easily be added to the 3-D monitors.Markets include medical applications, where a CAT scan image can beshown in 3-D and the patient's chart could be read in twodimensions.  The education field also offers numerous opportunitiesfor this technology with images in 3-D and explanatory text in 2-D.Games are also seen as a potential market.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Microlens ArraysImprove LightingLight throughput in a helmet mounted display has been increased bytwo orders of magnitude through the use of microlens arraysaccording to researchers at Hughes Danbury Optical Systems (HDOS,Danbury, CT).  The company is developing a subtractive colordisplay that includes a lamp, polarizers and three 1024 x 1024active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs).In a typical display of this type, there is a loss of light thatlowers brightness and contrast since light passes from one pixel onthe first AMLCD through several pixels on the second and thirdAMLCDs.  To overcome this problem, the researchers sandwich theAMLCDs between microlens arrays that focus light into the activearea of each pixel.  There is a microlens before and after eachpixel in the light path.There is one major problem, however.  Diffractive microlens arraysare not totally effective because of the small size of each lensand some light scattering problems.  To solve this dilemma, HDOSresearchers designed and made, by a proprietary process, analogrefractive elements.  The minimum center-to-center spacing of thesemicrolenses is about 10 um, and they are supposedly working betterthan diffractive optics.To compare the difference using the arrays, about 30% of theillumination reaches the screen location, as opposed to less than1% with no microlenses.  The company is looking into additionalapplications for these lenses.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Active Matrix ColorTouch MonitorNational Integration Services (Rochester, NY) a leader incustomized touchscreen products, introduced the 1040VTT, a new10.4-in.

It canimprove quality control, increase soldering productivity and lowerthe cost of training new workers.  Since changes in temperature andsoldering duration at each site are seen in real time, there arefewer mistakes and less wasted time, according to the company.Temperature variations during soldering operations are detected bya heat sensor at the tip of the iron, and adjustments are madethrough a patented "on-load temperature management" method, whichthe company is trying to make into an industry standard.Information is displayed in graphic form on an LCD panel and can beprinted out.  The soldering iron can function as a teaching toolsince it can collect data on the soldering operations of a seasonedworker and this data can be made into guidelines for new employees.Japan Boncoat expects to sell 1,000-2,000 units at about $1,100 thefirst year in Asia and North America.

Ltd. in Japan was awardedU.S. Patent 5,543,947 for devising a new way to drive an activematrix LCD with short pulses for gray scale.The method consists of driving a liquid crystal electro-opticaldevice in such a way that the device produces accurate gray toneswith high reproducibility. In this device, a complementary TFT(thin film transistor) configuration consisting of at least one p-channel TFT and at least one n-channel TFT is formed per pixelelectrode. One of the input/output terminals of this configurationis connected to the pixel electrode. The other is connected to afirst signal line.All the gate electrodes of the TFTs of the configuration areconnected to a second signal line. High-speed pulses are applied toone of the input/output terminals of the TFT configuration via thefirst signal line. A high-speed bipolar signal is applied to thegate electrodes in synchronism with the pulses, to electricallycharge the pixel.  After the completion of the charging, thebipolar signal is again applied to the gate electrodes to dischargethe pixel. This series of operations is repeated to producehalftones.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Production of TVMonitors Moved UpIn recent additions of DTN, we have reported the rather long rangeplans of many plasma panel makers to get into production of TVdisplays by 1997 and 1998.  Now it appears there are two updates tothis story: mass production of TV panels is set for this fall, andmany manufacturers are expecting to make plasma displays for thedesktop market.Plasma display panels are thinner and larger than LCDs and are alsolightweight.  A 40-in. panel is only 10-12 cm thick making thistechnology the favorite for wall mounted TVs and placing it incontention for the desk top market.  Although many in the industryagree that plasma technology will eventually share the desk topmarket with LCDs, they predict it will be a gradual process becauseof the high plasma display prices (just over $9,000 for a panel atthe current time).But plasma makers are building facilities.  Fujitsu Ltd. isbuilding a 20 billion yen manufacturing plant in southern Japanthat is expected to begin production of 42-in. screens in Octoberor November of this year.  By 2000, the company expects to investanother 20 billion yen in production facilities.Other companies are also expanding.  Pioneer Electronic Corp. hasbroken ground in a location northwest of Tokyo that will be able tomake 10,000 panels per month.  They are targeted for production inMarch, 1997.  Hitachi Ltd. is building a new production line inYokohama that will produce 26- and 40-in. displays.  By 1997, thecompany plans to enter the 26-in. version in the desktop market.NEC Corp. plans to spend 25 billion yen on a new plant in KagoshimaPrefecture that will be able to make 10,000 screens per month by1998.  NEC has been making 1,000 panels per month at its Kawasakiplant since June.Asahi Glass, which already produces glass substrates for LCDs, willbegin commercial production of substrates for these plasma systemswithin a month.  The company expects plasma to become the dominanttechnology for screens larger than 40 in.  Asahi is planningmonthly production of 100,000 glass substrates for 42-in. plasmadisplays.Another company, Dai Nippon Printing, is also planning to producesubstrates for large plasma screens by the end of 1997.  Inaddition, Corning Inc. and Cie de Saint-Gobain have plans to startproduction of large screen plasma display substrates later thisfall.Despite all this activity, there is a general note of caution inthe plasma display sector.  Demand is still not as strong as manywould like and much of it is focused on public displays such asthose used in train stations and hospitals.  But the large sizescreen, thin construction and light weight are advantages that willassist plasma technology in finding a market.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Organic PanelNeeds Less PowerIdemitsu Kosan Co. (Tokyo) researchers have developed a multicolor,organic EL display that may portend lower power consumption, fullcolor displays that will be practical for mobile multimediaapplications.  The company plans to sell the material and licensethe technology used to make the display, and reports that it hasalready supplied material to several potential customers.Idemitsu wants companies to evaluate their technology.  Accordingto a senior researcher, VGA resolution is possible on anexperimental basis, but the driver circuitry and productiontechnology for a large screen must be developed at the displaymanufacturers side.EL displays that use inorganic materials for the emitting layerare already on the market and are typically in green or orange andblack configurations.  Organic EL displays are capable of brightcolors, good brightness and contrast, and a better viewing anglethan LCDs.  Idemitsu's EL research started about 10 years ago whenthe petroleum refining company began working with an organicmaterial called DPVBi which emitted a blue light.The current EL device developed at the Idemitsu Central ResearchLabs is a 5-in. square prototype with limited resolution of 16 x 16pixels.  It has five layers: metal cathodes, an electrontransporting layer, an emitting layer, a hole transporting layer,and a hole injection layer, topped with anodes made of indium tinoxide.  This entire sandwich is only 200 nm thick.A dopant added to the emitting layer improves the emission of abright blue light, reaching a peak wavelength of 468 nm.  At 5 V,the brightness level was approximately 100 candela.  With a 10 Vfield, the level rose to about 10,000 candela.Idemitsu decided against developing multiple emitting materialsthat could, on their own, emit red, blue and green.  The processwas considered to be too expensive.  Instead, the blue lightgenerated by the emissive layer passes through phosphor layers thatact as color filters, changing the blue light to red and to green.The phosphors absorb a portion of the high energy blue light andemit green or red light.The prototype display has 256 square pixels measuring 4.5 mm on aside.  They consist of three 1.5 x 4.5 mm subpixels of red, blueand green phosphor stripes.  Most organic materials deterioraterapidly, but the material used at Idemitsu has a long life.  Theprototype's half-life is more than 10,000 hrs.Other companies that are working on organic displays include SanyoElectric and Pioneer Electronics.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996High Luminance DevicesUse Oxide PhosphorsResearchers at the Electron Device System Lab (Kanazawa Instituteof Technology, Ishikawa, Japan) have demonstrated that oxidephosphors, which exhibit higher chemical stability than sulphidephosphors, show promise as emitting layers for thin filmelectroluminescent (TFEL) devices.  Zinc gallate (ZnGa204), whichhas received attention as a blue-emitting phosphor for vacuumfluorescent (VFDs) and field emission displays (FEDs), has beendeveloped for a thin film emitting layer combined with a thickbarium titanate (BaTi03) ceramic sheet insulating layer.The researchers used a non-symmetrical single insulating layerdevice in their study of this material.  Every constituent, exceptthe back electrode (thermally evaporated aluminum) of this devicewas an oxide material.  The emitting layer, insulating layers andtransparent electrode, were composed of ZnGa204 phosphor thinfilms, thick BaTi03 ceramic sheet and aluminum-doped zinc oxide(Zn0:Al) transparent conducting thin film, respectively.Zinc gallate phosphor thin films were deposited by rf magnetronsputtering onto the polished barium titanate ceramic sheets.  Thethickness of the films deposited was controlled almost to aconstant 1500 nm.  The phosphor thin films were post-annealed at1020 C in an argon gas atmosphere.  Luminances as high as 630 and200 cd/m2 for green emission were obtained for a manganese-activated zinc gallate device.  Multicolor emission was alsorealized through the use of other dopants.A detailed description of this project is available in the Julyissue of the Journal of the Society for Information Display (SantaAna, CA 92705, Tel: 714/545-1526, Fax: 714/545-1547).Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Robust Organic HighTemperature DeviceA group at Toyota in Japan (Contact: Shizuo Tokito, Toyota CentralResearch & Development Labs, Inc. 41, Aza Yokomichi, Oaza Nagakute,Nagakute-cho, Aichi-gun, Aichi-ken 480-11, Japan; email:e0943@mosk.co.jp) reports in Applied Physics Letters thedevelopment of an organic electroluminescent material which canfunction at temperatures up to 140C with a turn-on voltage of 2.1V and an efficiency of 1.25 lm/W.These materials are being looked to as active components of flatpanel displays but to date the organic electroluminescent materialshave been plagued by degradation of the hole transporting layer,probably due to Joule heating from the high injection currentutilized for the device operation.

Then, a mirror is depositedover the layer, followed by a second elastomer layer.  The layersare then covered with a dielectric layer which is more rigid thanthe elastomers.The mirror is used as one electrode and the charge patterndeposited by the electron beam on the dielectric layer makes up theother electrode.  The electrostatic forces that result deform themirror and produce ripples or grooves.  When the mirror is flat,incident light from the lamp will be reflected and imaged on theschlieren stop which blocks it and causes the screen to becomeblack.  When grooves are written, however, incident light will bediffracted at an angle, lets it miss the stop, and a bright spot isprojected on the screen.  Gray scale can be effected by varying themagnitude of the charge.  TV pictures are projected by scanning andmodulating the electron beam with video signals.  The chargepattern and grooves can be removed or erased by secondary electronemission.Elastomers can be used inside the vacuum tubes without impactingthe life of the cathode or the electron beam environment.Prototypes of the modulator have been developed and plans are inplace to build an electron beam-addressed projector.

The display is based on a newswitching technology for routing laser light among a set of opticalwaveguides and coupling the light toward the viewer.  Essentially,the device is an electrically-switchable mirror.  The novelswitching method is based on poled domains established in electro-optical crystals, such as lithium niobate.  Using this technology,Deacon claims that both miniature high resolution displays andlarge screen display for television formats can be manufactured.Problems with existing waveguide flat panel display technology arethat compact high resolution displays can not be fabricated due tothe large pixel spacing, inefficient "waveguide taps" limit thebrightness of the display, the power efficiency is low because ofthe optical losses, and power cannot be efficiently switched intoanother waveguide.The electrically-controlled switching element is a poled grating,consisting of alternating poled domains of opposite sign in theelectro-optical crystal.  Within the poled domains of aferroelectric crystal such as lithium niobate the electric dipolesare aligned in the poling direction.  The pattern of poled domainsmay be established using an electric field, in-diffusion, or ion-exchange.After the poled domains are a set of waveguides fabricated in or onthe substrate.  Typically for lithium niobate, annealed protonexchange is used to fabricate waveguide structures in the substratevolume.  The waveguides traverse (are not parallel to) the poledgratings.  Electrodes are laid to control the gratings; when anelectric field is applied across the grating structure, therefractive index of the grating region is modulated, depending uponthe direction of the domain poling.The poled region must extent far enough into the substrate tointeract with the light propagating through the waveguide.  Whenthe field is off, the refractive index is not modulated, and thepropagating light is not affected.  The propagating beam can becoupled to another element of the same substrate, or it can becomean output beam toward the observer.  An antireflection coating isapplied at the output point.  The refractive index gratingstructures may be tuned by a number of methods.  Further detailscan be found in U.S. Patent 5,544,268.According to Dave Deacon, president of Deacon Research, DeaconResearch recently formed a new company to spin-off this technologyand develop products for market.Contact: David A.

This material is one type of polymer that is beingdeveloped as light emitting diodes (LEDs) for use in displays.  Nowthat it has produced laser light, the material has proven itself tobe good for light emission, a fact that was questioned by some inthe scientific community, according to Richard H. Friend of theCavendish Lab in Cambridge.To achieve this feat, scientists sandwiched the PPV between twomirrors.  They consisted of a thin silver film and a layeredmaterial called a distributed Bragg reflector, which reflectsvisible light with nearly 100% efficiency.  This kind of deviceproduces light by stimulated emission.  Shining light through thereflector causes the PPV to emit photons, some of which arereflected back and forth between the mirrors which starts a cascadeof more photons.  These photons are not reflected but pass throughthe silver film.  They have a single wavelength and are in phase,thus forming the coherent laser beam.Although the emitted light was a yellow-green color, polymer laserlight could cover a range of visible wavelengths according to theCambridge researchers.  The next step is to develop polymer lasersthat can be excited by electricity rather than light.A key driver in the use of this material for displays is the factthat it can be easily deposited over large areas which comes inhandy when making large, flat LED panels such as billboards or evencomputer screens.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Work Progresses onRetinal DisplaysAt the University of Washington's Human Interface Technology Lab(Seattle, WA), researchers funded by Microvision Inc., a Seattle-based electro-optics company, are developing the ability to create"virtual retinal displays."  Images are projected pixel by pixel,or point of light by point of light, from an outside sourcedirectly onto the retina of a viewer's eye.These kinds of displays allow viewers to see information on whatappears to be a translucent computer screen hanging a few feet infront of them.  The reality is that there is no screen--the imageexists only inside the eye.  Application examples abound.  Surgeonswill be able to call up high-resolution x-rays of patients as theylie on an operating table and, in the military, soldiers will beable to use virtual displays to see mines as they are projectedfrom helmet mounted, ground penetrating radar.Support for this technology is strong as research continues.Microvision hopes to eventually mount a retinal scanning device ona platform as small as an eyeglass frame.  Prototypes should beavailable within two years.University of Washington researchers are working on ways to projectalmost a million pixels on the retina (300,000 each of red, blueand green), one pixel at a time, thus creating 60 full retinalscreens, or images, each second.  Anything less will cause flicker.The lab currently has a table-top retinal display apparatus, whichuses gas lasers or laser diodes that create laser light beams, tobreak down video images into green, blue and red streams of light.The light streams are then manipulated by the system's electronicsand combined using a series of mirrors and lenses onto a fiberoptic cable.Following this, the merged beam is channeled to small horizontaland vertical scanners that "paint" the image onto the retina.  Theviewer sees a high-resolution image that appears to be focusedseveral feet in the distance.  In addition, the display can beprojected from a hand-held device onto the retina.  In thatinstance, however, the image appears to originate inside thedevice.CRTs have created an image pixel by pixel to create images.  What'sdifferent in the virtual display is beaming light directly onto theretina to create pixels that form an image.  According to theresearchers, the retinal display produces a brighter, higher-resolution image that the CRT or LCDs.  Since the image comes fromlow intensity lasers, it doesn't damage the eye.The Army seems eager to start testing these displays.  The Pentagonhas been funding LCDs and other flat panel technologies for threeyears, but a retinal display presents the possibility of higherresolution at the same cost.  And, since they are virtualprojections, virtual displays don't block the viewer's forwardvision.  Microvision seems to be targeting the high-end militaryand medical markets.  Estimated costs of these displays is placedbetween $5,000 and $50,000 each.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Polymer MakesAll Plastic ElectrodesAl-Coat Ltd. (Ness-Ziona, Israel) has developed a process in whicha conductive transparent polymer is applied as an electrode in aPDLC device.  So far, the new polymer has been a successfulsubstitute for indium tin oxide (ITO).In the process, two PET substrates, approximately 200-micronsthick, are each coated on the inside with 100 nm of the conductivepolymer thus building "all plastic" transparent electrodes.  ThePDLC layer in the middle is separated from the electrodes on bothsides by a 0.5-um thick electric insulating layer.  The electro-optical properties of this device match those of the conventionalITO-based devices.The all plastic electrodes provide mechanical flexibility to thedevice and reduce electrical current in the on-state.  Thiscondition implies a low energy consumption when the device isturned on.Contact: Al-Coat Ltd., Bldg. 3, Kiryat Weizmann, Science Park,Ness-Ziona 70400, Israel; Tel: 972/8-9407874, Fax: 972/8-9408085.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Lithography Systemfor Flat PanelsA new step-and-scan option has been added to Tamarack ScientificCo.'s Series 300 large area scanning projection lithography system.Called the Model 320, it handles vary large substrates up to 18 x20 in., exposing multiple images of a smaller mask.

The inventor of the newprocess is Ka-Ngo Leung, leader of the Plasma and Ion SourceTechnology Group in the Lab's Accelerator and Fusion ResearchDivision.  "Although the new technology can help improve themanufacture of conventional silicon-based semiconductors,"  Leungsays "its primary application will be the manufacture of flat-paneldisplays. Leung's solution to a variety of manufacturing problems was todevelop an ion source technology that uses just enough energy toselectively ionize only the phosphine (PH3) (or diborine, B2H6, orother gas), but not enough to ionize the hydrogen gas.  Thiseliminates most of the unwanted impurities from the ion streambecause they are electrically neutral, and reduces both excessheating and the charging problem.Flat-panel displays consist of many pixels, each of which iscontrolled by transistors,  Leung said.  The transistors are formedfrom semiconductors consisting of silicon doped with phosphorus orboron.  One way to dope a layer of silicon with phosphorus, arsenicor boron ions is to aim a stream of dopant ions into the silicon,a process called ion implantation.He went on to explain that the manufacturing process must ensurethat the dopant is pure and as free as possible from unwanted ions.Conventional implantation might start with a beam of phosphorus orboron scanning the silicon wafer to dope it uniformly.  However,flat panel displays start with a panel of glass that is too big touse the conventional method effectively.  So, a technique calledion shower is used, which employs large beam of phosphorus orboron.  The panel is immersed in the shower, which implants theentire panel with the dopant, requiring a large ion source.The source generates a stream of dopant ions such as phosphorususing the phosphorus-containing gas.  However, phosphine is sotoxic that it is always sold heavily diluted, often in a mixture of95% hydrogen gas and 5% phosphine.  Used as a conventional ionsource most of the ions coming out are hydrogen, creating twoproblems.  One is that the energy of the beam is so high that thesilicon-coated glass blank is heated too much by the acceleratedhydrogen ions causing damage to the glass surface.  A secondproblem is damage caused by the buildup of excessive electricalcharges in the plate from the unwanted ions.The new technology solves yet another problem.  Conventionalsources use a tungsten filament to inject the gas with electrons.However the tungsten is an impurity that is easy to ionize, asource of contamination.  So the researchers inject electrons usinga principle called radio frequency (RF) induction discharge.  "Wecreate plasma using RF induction discharge and then injectelectrons into the main chamber to ionize the source gas," he says."The device is called an RF plasma cathode." Leung also has another invention which consists of an apparatusfor creating a large-diameter ion beam from a small-diameterdiverging beam.  In conjunction with the selective ion source, thisinvention can be used to generate a beam appropriate for ionimplantation of large areas of material such as those used in flat-panel displays.Developmental work on the selective ion source is supported by acorporate sponsor under a cooperative research and developmentagreement with DOE.  The University of California was awarded U.S.patent number 5,517,084 for  Leung's selective ionizationinvention.  Patents are pending for his RF plasma cathode and largediameter ion beam apparatus.  The three patents are available forlicensing from Berkeley Lab's Technology Transfer Department.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996ElectrochemicalEtching PerfectedA new electrochemical etching-based method of making siliconcarbide (SiC) semiconductor optoelectronic devices has beendeveloped by scientists at NASA's Lewis Research Center (21000Brookpark Rd., Cleveland, OH 44135; Tel: 216/433-5568, Fax:216/433-3344).  The technique, reports Joseph S. Shor, whoperformed the work for NASA, may facilitate the building ofultraviolet light-emitting diodes, ultraviolet lasers, blueelectroluminescent devices, and filters for solid state chemicalsensors.  The electrochemical etching method provides for theformation of selected porous regions with variable macrostructures,microstructures, and compositions in SiC wafers.In the NASA process, a SiC wafer is mounted in a carrier with anickel electrical contact and covered with black wax everywhereexcept for an opening at the designated surface location of theregion to be made porous.  The wax prevents etching everywhereexcept at the exposed area.  The carrier is placed on a pedestal ina polytetrafluoroethylene vessel filled with an etching solution ofdilute (normally 2.5%) hydrofluoric acid.  A saturated calomelelectrode and a platinum wire counter-electrode are immersed in thesolution,  Through the nickel contact, a variable voltage DC powersupply circuit applies a bias voltage to the wafer.  A controlcircuit maintains the bias at a prescribed voltage with respect tothe saturated calomel electrode.If, for example, the SiC is doped with electron donor atoms (n-doped), the exposed surface of the wafer is illuminated through asapphire window at the top of the vessel, while the SiC ismaintained at an anodic potential of 1.8-2.8 volts to promotephotoinduced corrosion.  If the SiC is doped with electronacceptors (p-doped), it can be etched in the dark at 0-2 volts.The depth and structure of the porous region is determined byfactors such as the anodization time, the applied potential, theintensity of the ultraviolet light (if used), the pH of thesolution, and the concentration of the dopant.In the fabrication of a SiC p/n-junction diode supported by abroad, electrically insulating substrate, for example, engineerscan take advantage of the fact that porous SiC may be oxidized tosilicon dioxide (SiO2) at a rate much greater than that of solidSiC, because the pores present a much greater surface area foroxidation.A wafer is fabricated by the chemical vapor deposition of a p-dopedSiC epilayer, and then an n-doped SiC epilayer on an n-doped SiCsubstrate.  A mask is placed on the top n-doped epilayer and thenpatterned photolithographically.  The electrochemical etchingmethod makes the part of the n-doped epilayer not covered by themask porous and, as a result, highly susceptible to oxidation.The resulting porous part of the layer is oxidized to SiO2 to makeit highly susceptible to etching using hydrofluoric acid.  It isthen etched, leaving a mesa of n-doped SiC.  The electrochemicaletching method is then used again, this time with processconditions selected to impart porosity to the exposed part of thep-doped SiC.  Then the porous material is oxidized to SiO2, leavinga 2-layer, n-doped/p-doped mesa. The electrochemical etchingtechnique is then applied, this time under process conditions thatimpart porosity to the n-doped SiC substrate only.  Finally, theporous substrate is oxidized to SiO2, which is electricallyinsulating.Back to Headline List CopyrightDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetOCTOBER 1996Contract to DevelopStorage SystemThe U.S. Display Consortium (USDC) awarded a contract to PRIAutomation (Billerica, MA) to develop an automated storage andretrieval system for work-in-process for flat panel displaymanufacturing.  The USDC will fund $820,000 of the $1.6 billiontotal cost.PRI will develop a stocker system that will store work-in-processcassettes or pods vertically in units up to 12 ft. high.  The goalis to more efficiently utilize cleanroom space that is presentlyoccupied by carts and storage racks.  Each stocker will feature ahigh-lift capacity robot to store and retrieve cassettes under hostor operator control.  The stockers will be designed to operate ina Class 10 cleanroom environment.PRI's stockers will accommodate all standard cassette and pod sizesbeing developed under other USDC contracts, including the nextgeneration 600 x 720 mm glass size, and they will be compatiblewith Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), Manual Guided Vehicles(MGVs) and host communications software specified by the USDCproject team.

The goal will be "passing information between vendors ... via E-mail or the Internet," says Ed McIerney, vice president of softwarebusiness with Wang Laboratories Inc. of Billerica, Mass.         Another big factor to look for in 1996 is more cooperation amongvendors as the industry seeks to deal with the consequences of itsconsolidation last year.  Companies will have to work together ondeveloping software and faster- peripheral products, to address users'demands, we're told.       Collaboration also will help the industry come up with newinnovations more quickly, simplifying the offerings for systemsintegrators who are often left to choose between a large number ofcompanies to create a complete solution, says Harold Gubnitsky,director with Cambridge, Mass.-based Cambridge Technology Partners'Intelligent Document Management division.    Ally with Large Partners     Alliances with large partners who plan to take advantage ofelectronic commerce opportunities will enable mid-sized imagingvendors to make a name for themselves.       Previously hidden behind the giants, they now can begin to shine,the experts say.  Be advised vendors must choose, however, whichsegment of the market to shine in, or be left behind.     Vendors who choose a specific market for their imaging productswill provide their customers with greater value-add than those who donot strengthen their hands by finding a specialty to serve within analready niche- marketplace.  Health care providers will know they aregetting the best imaging system designed for health care, for example;the same will be true for the financial area, say the experts.     Both users and vendors are looking toward the "commoditization"or interoperability of imaging components.  Experts predict more andmore components will be off-the-shelf next year.  In addition, theemergence of more standards will help propel further growth,particularly in the storage arena.     Look for the Internet to play a much larger role in thedevelopment this year of imaging technology as an increasingly mobileworkforce demands links not only to text, but also images.  "How youroute the image, share the indexing information about a file not onlywithin a department, but within regions or districts around the world,will play a significant part of the document management" and imagingmarketplace, says Gubnitsky.     David Skok, president of Burlington, Mass.-based Watermark saysin agreement:  "The keys to success in 1996 will be the Internet/Webenabling of imaging, document management and workflow products."      Simplifying the industry from one saturated with too many imagingvendors in all segments of the business, to one with only a few largeplayers means that systems integrators and users will find it easierto choose a complete imaging solution.  "Most potential buyers are notable to make informed decisions, relying instead on serendipity," saysGubnitsky.     Only three major platform vendors will dominate production-levelimaging this year, predicts Suresh Shenoy, vice president withInformation Management Consultants, based in McLean, Va.  They are: FileNet  and its acquisition Watermark, Microsoft  and its alliancewith Billerica, Mass.-based Wang and the combination of IBM andacquired Lotus.  He says mid-sized vendors will cooperate forsolutions at all levels of the enterprise.     "The challenge for the mid-tiered [companies] will be to find amaturing channel and name recognition for themselves," adds ErikBrown, senior analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research. This name recognition will tie a vendor nicely with what has become amore segmented or specialized marketplace.Specialized Market Segments To Grow     Many analysts agree that vendors are going to have to specializein specific market segments in order to make a name for themselves. For instance, Brown says it won't matter whether or not yourprocessing system works in two-tenths of a second or one-tenth of asecond.       The real challenge for 1996 will be in how a vendor adds value toits imaging product line.  This will be achieved by "choosing aparticular      application within the technology," he says.  Otherwise, "the doorwill close."      What does this mean for those already working within an industrysegment?      It means that companies such as Dallas-based BancTec, whichmerged with Recognition last year, is poised to work even more closelywith its partners in the financial marketplace.  With BancTec alreadya player in remittance processing, you can expect it to work moreclosely with community banks, spokesman George Christian told us.  Storage Technology Set To Advance     According to industry insiders, the advancement of imagingtechnology continues to develop.  In particular, vendors are expectingbetter interoperability for Computer Output to Laser Disk (COLD)storage this year as standards are perfected.      BancTec plans to concentrate on what Christian callsopen/archiving.  This is a concept designed for customer service, hesays.      For example, a request is scanned into an imaging system andstored on the hard disk for up to three days.  Then, the data will bemoved to an optical media for up to 60 days, after which it will betransferred to either linear tape or some other inexpensive device forone year's storage.       The reason for this new technology?  Many customers tell BancTecthat 80 percent of all their requests are received within the first 30days of processing, so after 30 days the information does not need tobe immediately accessible, says Christian.     "COLD technology is one that has not had as much attention [asothers],"  says Gubnitsky.  The challenge will be to separate COLDwith traditional document management, he says.  Commoditization of Imaging:  Help or Hurt?     It's hard to predict whether or not commoditization of imagingtechnology will help or hurt the industry.  Experts differ in theiropinions, particularly those involved most directly with designingsystems.  McIerney says commoditization will provide his company withmany opportunities in 1996.  The free-bundled imaging now availablewith Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows NT, for example, will provideusers previously unfamiliar with imaging a taste of it.     "People will work with images, like it, enjoy it, start using itmore, then discover they have a disk full of images," he says.  Whatthis means is a need for more storage.  Wang will now be able toprovide a storage solution through its recent acquisition of Avail ofColo.  In addition, Wang will be poised to handle any calls requestingimaging upgrades--something the stockholders are counting on, saysMcIerney.  Where Does Document Management Fit?     Vendors look to 1996 to be the year that users apply new foundunderstanding of document management to purchasing decisions.  Theexperts agree that document management is more of a process, underwhich technologies as imaging, workflow, faxing and storage operate ascomponent parts.     Shenoy explains that document management is not imaging and it isnot workflow.  "Document management is being able to manage theproduction, revision, storage, access, presentation and distributionof information created in such an imaging system," he says.

JeffMeshinksy, one of the founders of INTRAFED, along with his father,says his company plans to "use its installed base" as its majorresource against its competitors like Cornerstone and Irvine, Calif.-based Kofax.      INTRAFED is a developer of software capture systems and acts asboth a value added reseller (VAR), as well as competes as anindividual vendor for  contracts in both the commercial and governmentarena.       INTRAFED has "good reference lists" for a shrink-wrapped product,says Kimra Hawley, vice president and general manager of softwaretools and input systems division with Cornerstone (see related story,p. 5).  If the user wants to purchase all the component parts forimage capture from one company INTRAFED is the choice for them becauseits product is "straight-forward and very production oriented," shesays.  This type of component-based system will help save money andtime because users don't have to build the systems themselves.INTRAFED at a Glance6903 Rockledge Drive11th FloorBethesda MD 20817301/564-5600Contact:  Jeff Meshinsky, vice president, sales and marketing,301/564-5600Founded:  1984Products:  PowerScan; StageWorks Production; StageWorks Industrial;StageWorks OfficeAreas Served:  Commercial, government (30 percent federal)Customers:  U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, Federal ExpressChoosing Multiple Partners     INTRAFED has made it a point to work with 36 different suppliers,integrating their products directly into the INTRAFED image capturesolution, in particular Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak's scanners.       Dan Elam, consultant with Imaging Consulting of Saluda, Va. saysINTRAFED has worked exclusively with Kodak for some time now.  Thisrelationship is something to follow as INTRAFED moves toward a moreopen-architecture strategy to include any scanner as the front-end toits imaging solution, he says. Gulf War Continues to Bring in Dollars     One of its original production-level systems in 1990 was forDesert Storm during the Gulf War--scanning and processing more than 12million intelligence documents in two-and-a-half months.  The U.S.Army needed intelligence data available to them in the bunkers aboutthe Iraqis, which before would have been decrypted by hand, saysMeshinsky.  Using Kodak scanners, INTRAFED uploaded the data into anIBM ImagePlus retrieval system, integrating the intelligenceinformation quickly for the solders' retrieval, says Meshinsky.     Another project expected to continue the Gulf War work forINTRAFED is the Declassification program.  It involves converting 17million pages of records from the Gulf War operations to images. These records will be used to research potential causes of theillnesses experienced by Gulf War veterans, often referred to as the"Gulf War Syndrome."       The U.S. Army is intent upon putting this declassifiedinformation onto the Internet and the World Wide Web for medicalpersonnel to evaluate and review for possible cures.  Up to 20,000document images will be converted per day, according to INTRAFED.  Forthe high-speed capture of the images, INTRAFED's PowerScan softwarecontrols two Kodak 500 ImageLink scanners, which will produceelectronic image files and related indexing information.  Images thenare passed directly to StageWorks for quality control, rescanning ifnecessary, image enhancement--such as deskewing, optical characterrecognition and directly to the Excalibur EFS Format Bridge.       This bridge--a point of pride for INTRAFED according toMeshinsky--formats image, text and index data for use in aspecifically designated indexing system.  INTRAFED Allies with ICS     INTRAFED recently allied took a partner in the conversionbusiness, Image Conversion Systems based in Arlington Heights, Ill. ICS was a division of Anacomp, also of Arlington Heights.  Its focushas been on image conversion, but John Messinger, formerly withAnacomp, wanted to buy out the ICS division to stand on its own.  Thebuyout took place Nov. 1.     As part of the new alliance with ICS, INTRAFED will help thecompany upgrade its 11 conversion centers in such cities as San Diego,Chicago, Indianapolis and St. Louis.  ICS will use a combination ofPowerScan and StageWorks to convert 52 million images per year.

CORNERSTONE RELEASES INPUTACCEL     It may seem that San Jose, Calif.-based Cornerstone's InputAccelhas been on the market for some time because of the company hyping itfor so long, but it was finally released at the end of last year.  Themodular image capture solution was pre-announced in April, 1994, to"signal the market" that Cornerstone was entering the image capturemarket.  It also enabled the peripherals vendors to begin making theirproducts compatible with InputAccel, Kimra Hawley, vice president andgeneral manager for the software tools and input systems division,said.     The product was six months late from a development standpoint,says Hawley--although it was held on purpose.  After bringing inrepresentatives from service bureaus, systems integrator and scanningoperators, Cornerstone decided to make some changes to the productbased on the users' feedback.  "Fortunately, we weren't in need ofrevenue," says Hawley, so we could afford to wait.     Hawley describes the possible solutions in the input capturemarket in four categories:     * A modular approach--such as InputAccel which includes server,scan, image processing, OCR and image export.     * Shrinkwrapped--hard-coded systems offered by INTRAFED or Kofax.      * Monolithic suppliers, such as FileNet, may already have animaging installation--they will most likely just "add-on" the imagecapture portion of the system.     * Toolkits--Users can build their own system from the ground upwith DiamondHead or Imagination Software's products.     Cornerstone can plug and play its "modules" in InputAccel with upto 33 different image capture vendors' products without the integratorhaving to do any programming, says Hawley.  The product was designedbased upon extensive interviews with systems integrator like PriceWaterhouse and Grumman, which were looking for a less expensive, lesstime-consuming solution to the image capture industry.      Cornerstone's first customers are:  CTB-McGraw Hill, CADPAC ofOhio, and Stanford Health Services of Palo Alto, Calif.  (Cornerstone,408/325-3840.)

Blueridge Technologies of Flint Hill, Va., installed its OPTIXDocument Management System at Memphis, Tenn.-based Federal Express AirOperations Department.  The system is used to store, retrieve andmanage engineering and maintenance records for FedEx's fleet of morethan 500 aircraft.  FedEx has accumulated over 700,000 aperture cards,with a backlog of "several million documents" according to companyexecutives.  As many as 165 employees at FedEx headquarters haveaccess to the records archived on the OPTIX system.  Engineers inremote locations may retrieve records in seconds by means of a dial-inconnection, say executives at FedEx.  FedEx serves more than 325airports and more than 200 countries.  OPTIX helped the company solvea problem directly from the Charles DeGaul airport in Paris whentechnicians misplaced a serviceable tag on an oxygen tank.  UsingOPTIX, a copy of the serviceable tag was "pulled up" on the system andfaxed to Paris, enabling the plane to continue its route.  Otherwise,the plane would have been grounded, said company executives. (Blueridge Technologies, 540/675-3015.)

Back to Headline List CopyrightDOCUMENT IMAGING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996AIIM SEARCHES FOR NEW LEADER IN 1996 The Association for Information and Image Management International(AIIM) faces a crossroads in the loss of its 20-year veteran,president Sue Wolk even as the market is shifting from proprietary- toclient-server- and open-systems.       In what several AIIM members say will be a large leadership gapto fill as one who was always far ahead of the power curve, Wolkleaves AIIM at an important time in the history of imaging, saysThorton May, consultant with Cambridge, Mass.-based CambridgeTechnology Partners.       Wolk plans to stay through the end of April.  The goal is to finda replacement by the time the yearly AIIM convention convenes inChicago this March 31 to April 3.  If they do not meet that goal, Wolksays she will stay a little longer.     The board of directors has established a search committee and putin place a management transition team, with Wolk aiding the team.  Thecommittee will work directly with Washington, D.C.-based FosterPartners, a division of Washington, D.C.-based KPMG Peat Marwick,AIIM's auditing firm.  AIIM's Diversity Adds to Search     In addition to this historic shift in the industry from largeproprietary systems to more workstation, client-server-based systems,Wolk says AIIM has become a very diverse organization with bothcorporate members and end-user members.  "This [diversity] is whatmakes us successful," she says.       This diversity requires a leader who will not go along routinelywith the board of directors, as one member said Wolk has done.  Yetthe new president will have to balance new leadership with recognitionof AIIm's advancement under Wolk, the same member told DIR.      As the chief staff officer for the last eight years, Wolk iscredited with taking AIIM to a leadership position in the workmanagement and workflow arena.  Her accomplishiments at AIIM include: significant gains in membership, product offerings and increasing thenumber of regions served by AIIM, according to the association.     AIIM's membership includes 600 corporate trade vendors with atotal of 9,000 members in 150 countries.  AIIM members and others whowish to provide input to the search committee, may contact DannStringer, senior managing director with Foster at 202/467-3093. Resumes and credentials may be faxed directly to Foster at 202/785-0683.  (AIIM, 301/587-8202 or http://www.aiim.org.)

Ongoing reviews by MCI's Internet Security Departmentindicate widespread attempts by ill-intentioned hackers to break intobusiness computer systems via the Internet.  With this in mind, MCI'sInternet security experts have developed some security guidelines thatwill help businesses protect their systems."It is important for companies to do a thorough security audit of theircomputer systems and to keep these systems up-to-date in order to thwartcomputer hackers," said Robert Hagens, director of Internet Engineeringfor MCI's Data Services Division.  "Computer hackers are constantlysharpening their skills and inventing new schemes to break into companycomputer systems.  Businesses also need to ensure that they continue tostay one step ahead of the bad guys in securing their systems."According to MCI's Internet Security Department, most of the successfulcomputer break-ins are the result of exercising old, known weaknesses inoperating systems which system administrators and managers have notremedied.  Despite the best efforts of the Computer Emergency ResponseTeam (CERT) and others, many system operators have shown remarkablecomplacence about security until they are hit by a hacker.  MCI hopes thismessage will encourage more pro-active efforts by managers of systems onthe Internet.MCI has identified the Top 10 Threats that businesses should be aware ofand the Top 10 Precautions that businesses can take to protect theircomputer systems.TOP 10 THREATS1. FIREWALL & SYSTEM PROBINGHackers are using sophisticated, automated tools to scan forvulnerabilities of a company's corporate firewall and systems behind thefirewall.  These hacker tools have proved to be quite effective, with theaverage computer scan taking less than three minutes to identify andcompromise security.Companies can prevent this by ensuring that their systems sit behind anetwork firewall and any services available through this firewall arecarefully monitored for potential security exposures.2. NETWORK FILE SYSTEMS (NFS) APPLICATION ATTACKSHackers attempt to exploit well known vulnerabilities in the Network FileSystem application which is used to share files between systems.  Theseattacks, usually through network firewalls, can result in compromisedadministrator access.To combat this, ensure systems do not allow NFS through the firewall, andenable NFS protections to restrict who can access files.3. ELECTRONIC MAIL ATTACKSHackers can compromise network systems by simply sending an e-mail to it.Companies who accept e-mail from the Internet and who have exposedversions of the sendmail program are potential targets from this attack.Last year more than 20,000 systems were compromised due to this exposure.To prevent this from occurring, check with vendors to ensure systems arerunning a correct version of sendmail or some more secure mail product.4. VENDOR DEFAULT PASSWORD ATTACKSSystems of all types come with vendor installed usernames and passwords.Hackers are well educated on these default usernames and passwords and usethese accounts to gain unauthorized administrative access to systems.Protect systems by ensuring that all vendor passwords have been changed.5. SPOOFING, SNIFFING, FRAGMENTATION & SPLICING ATTACKSRecently computer hackers have been using sophisticated techniques andtools at their disposal to identify and expose vulnerabilities on Internetnetworks.  These tools and techniques can be used to capture names andpasswords, as well as compromise trusted systems through the firewall.To protect systems from this type of attack, check with computer andfirewall vendors to identify possible security precautions.6. SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKSHackers will attempt to gain sensitive or confidential information fromcompanies by placing calls to employees and pretending to be anotheremployee.  These types of attacks can be effective in gaining usernamesand passwords as well as other sensitive information.Train employees to use a "call-back" procedure to verify the distributionof any sensitive information over the phone.7. EASY-TO-GUESS PASSWORD COMPROMISEMost passwords that are easy to remember are also easy to guess. Theseinclude words in the dictionary, common names, slang words, song titles,etc.  Computer hackers will attempt to gain access to systems using theseeasy-to-guess passwords usually via automated attacks.Protect systems by ensuring that passwords are not easy to guess, thatthey are at least eight characters long, contain special characters andutilize both uppercase and lowercase characters.8. DESTRUCTIVE COMPUTER VIRUSESComputer viruses can infect systems on a widespread basis in a very shortperiod of time.  These viruses can be responsible for erasing system data.Protect systems from computer viruses by using anti-virus software todetect and remove computer viruses.9. PREFIX SCANNINGComputer hackers will be scanning company telephone numbers looking formodem lines, which they can use to gain access to internal systems.  Thesemodem lines bypass network firewalls and usually bypass most securitypolicies.  These "backdoors" can easily be used to compromise internalsystems.Protect against this intrusion by ensuring modems are protected from bruteforce attacks.  Place these modems behind firewalls; make use of one-timepasswords; or have these modems disabled.10. TROJAN HORSESHackers will install "backdoor" or "Trojan Horse" programs on businessescomputer systems, allowing for unrestricted access into internal systems,which will bypass security monitoring and auditing policies.Conduct regular security analysis audits to identify potential securityvulnerabilities and to identify security exposures.TOP 10 SECURITY PRECAUTIONS1. FIREWALL SENSITIVE SYSTEMSEnsure corporate systems are protected from Internet attacks. Deploy afirewall between these systems and the Internet to guard against networkscans and intrusions.2. OBTAIN SECURITY ALERT INFORMATIONSubscribe to security alert mailing lists to identify potential securityexposures before they become problems.  CERT (Computer Emergency ResponseTeam at Carnegie Mellon University) is a good place to start.  The URL forCERT's Web site is cert-advisory-requestcert.org.  The e-mail address iscertcert.org.3. REVIEW SYSTEM AUDIT TRAILS REGULARLYRegularly check logging data and audit trails to look for unusual orsuspicious activity.4. BACKUP DATADon't be a victim of accidental or malicious data erasure. Backup allsensitive data on a regular basis.5. PURCHASE & DEPLOY ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWAREComputer viruses can spread throughout a system in minutes. Check systemsfor viruses on a regular basis.6. CHANGE PASSWORDS ON A REGULAR ROTATIONAL BASISDon't pick easy to remember passwords and change them often. Consider theuse of one-time password tokens to avoid password compromise threats.7. DEPLOY VENDOR SECURITY PATCHESConsult with vendors and obtain any system security patches that can beused to add additional layers of protection.8. ESTABLISH & ENFORCE A SECURITY POLICYDevelop and enforce a company-wide computer and physical security policy.9. EMPLOYEE AWARENESSEnsure all employees and management are briefed regularly on securitythreats, policies, corrective measures and incident reporting procedures.10. MAKE USE OF PUBLIC DOMAIN SECURITY TOOLSA wide variety of public domain security tools exist on the Internet, manyof which can be used to assist in the protection of computer systems.The above information was developed by MCI's Internet Security Department.To find additional information on security checklists and resourcesavailable to combat security threats, view the MCI security homepage athttp://www.security.mci.net.MCI, headquartered in Washington, D.C., is one of the world's largest andfastest-growing diversified communications companies.

This latest version of InocuLAN,which just received the "Designed for Microsoft BackOffice" logo, is thefirst product on the market with the ability to scan Windows NT basedcomputers for viruses in real-time. InocuLAN is the first and onlyanti-virus solution to receive the "Designed for Microsoft BackOffice"designation.InocuLAN 1.01 sets the standard for Windows NT-based virus protection.Like the previous version of the product (Version 1.0 - Windows NTMagazine's Editor's Choice award, Oct.  '95), the new release is a 32-bit,multithreaded, client/server application that protects against over 6000viruses, including virtually all viruses 'found in the wild'.  The newversion not only scans in real-time, it is also able to scan compressedfiles - allowing viruses to be detected without users having to riskdecompressing those files. InocuLAN 1.01 runs on Windows NT for Intel,MIPS and Alpha platforms. "Windows NT Server provides a secure, reliableoperating system for distributed computing," said Rich Tong, generalmanager in the business systems division at Microsoft.  "By delivering areal-time virus detection product Cheyenne is helping further strengthenthis promise.  And because InocuLAN carries the Microsoft BackOffice logocustomers can be assured that it will integrate into their BackOfficeenvironment."Behind InocuLAN's Windows 95-like interface is a state of the art,heuristic-based, polymorphic scanner that detects nearly all known virusesas certified by the National Software Testing Laboratories (NSTL).InocuLAN detects, identifies and cures -- boot, file, multipartite,stealth, polymorphic, and macro viruses.  When a virus is detected,InocuLAN notifies the user immediately, as well as sends an alert viaMicrosoft Mail, alphanumeric pager, SNMP, network broadcast, fax, orprinted trouble ticket.  InocuLAN maintains a detailed activity log of allvirus scans across the network.  The product also records to the WindowsNT system event log.InocuLAN 1.01 for Windows NT is unique in that it allows administrators tomanage an entire network of InocuLAN hosts from a central Windows NTServer or Workstation.  Unlike competitive products, it is implemented asa service that can provide enterprise-wide remote management, includingunattended remote virus scans, even when the remote workstation is notlogged into the network.  In addition, InocuLAN further integrates withMicrosoft BackOffice by supporting long file names and Universal NamingConvention (UNC) and is Unicode compliant.  InocuLAN utilizes a kernelmode device driver to allow it to scan incoming and outgoing files inreal-time."Cheyenne's expertise in providing enterprise tools allows us to take thelead in helping administrators deploy anti-virus measures across theenterprise", said Rei Jane Huai, president and CEO for Cheyenne Software."Cheyenne will continue to work closely with Microsoft to make BackOfficea secure environment and to support mission critical applications."Cheyenne Software, Inc. is an international developer of essentialsoftware solutions for NetWare, Windows NT, UNIX, Macintosh and OS/2networks.

A prototype of the Newton-based network computer (NC) -also dubbed the US$500 'communications box' -- will bedemonstrated this February in San Francisco, California.     NC will feature word processing, Internet access andpossibly videoconferencing.  And for about US$30 a month,customers would subscribe to 'Web TV,' a simplified andstreamlined network that provides quick access to newsbites, the ability to download video on high quality lines,surf the Net or send e-Mail.     "Web TV will be available by the end of the firstquarter, or in the second quarter," said Oracle CEO LarryEllison.  "It [Oracle's network computer] will video-enablethe Internet."     The kind of information that would be on Web TV wouldbe informative, fast-changing news such as the stock market.Also the entertainment industry could utilize Web TV as anadvertising tool.     "Companies like Time Warner would make great suppliersof content, (News Corp's) Rupert Murdoch's stuff would begood, Disney, and news organizations. There'd be no risk;they would control their own servers," said Ellison, astaunch believer that education and electronic commercewould be the most successful interactive TV ventures.     NC would also get its 'brains' from the servers. Thecommunications box will have no hard disc, software orfloppy disc.  Each time users turned on their NC, itwould download the latest network upgrades.     Recently LSI Logic Corporation recently unveiled amicrochip technology intended to support a US$500Internet device.  The company already specializes inintegrating functions on a single affordable chip,prompting such popular low-cost products as Sony'sPlayStation.According to LSI, it will be able to design a chip foras little as US$50 that, when combined with a US$100memory chip, will provide the core of an Internet device.  PC's have long been a relatively expensive commoditywhose cheapest price for a new stripped down machine isstill around US$2,000.  And many industry analysts agreedthat the price of the machines would not drop below theUS$1,000 floor because of the ripple effect it would haveon the rest of the computer industry.     "To get to a US$500 point would probably meaninventing a new business model, new OS, newmicroprocessor, new group of competitors and new ballgamewith entirely new rules," said Mark Stahlman, presidentof market research firm New Media Associates based in NewYork.     The cheap PC is also nothing new to the computerindustry.  The most successful machine via the nowdefunct Commodore Amiga had the fastest sales ramp-up inPC history. Although Commodore failed, the computerindustry today is spurred by the need to bring multimediatelecommunications en masse.     Frontiers such as video-conferencing, educationalinteractive TV and electronic commerce make it ripe forbrave new worlds.  "Can the industry withstand a new set of rules?" saidStahlman.  "It might be here sooner than you think."     Maybe in February.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDITTECH'S INTERNATIONAL HIGH-TECH ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996THE RACE FOR 'DATABASE ON THE NET' HEATS UP  The race to become the leader in managing data on theWeb heated up when two prominent Silicon Valley databasemanagement companies agreed to a merger.     Database software leader Informix Corp. willpurchase for about US$332 million Illustra InformationTechnologies, a California-based information managementtool vendor.  The merger was spurred by the World WideWeb's need for sophisticated software to manage complextypes of data such as audio, video, 3-D graphics and time-series 'stock markettype' information.     Roughly 12.9 million shares of Informix stock willbe issued to acquire all outstanding shares of Illustra.And an additional 2.1 million will be reserved forIllustra's stock options.  The value of the deal was inthe neighborhood of US$332 million when plans for themerger were announced.  The actual price tag will bedetermined by Informix stock price when the deal finallyis signed.   "In addition to our shared visions and markets, thesynergy with Illustra's technology gives us a significanttime-to-market advantage," said Phil White, Informix CEOand chairman.     Although Informix had been developing its own toolsto handle complex data types, Illustra has slightly morecomprehensive technology and should help Informix' speedto market by as much as a half-a-year.     The challenge now facing the two companies is tointegrate their different database products into one line-in this case, Illustra's management system and Informix'core parallel database technology known as the DynamicScaleable Architecture (DSA).     Currently the Illustra tools are compatible with DSAas a layered environment, requiring developers torecognize they are dealing with two different products.A complete integration of the two is expected later thisyear and should be a more intelligent repository,according to Dan Kusnetzky, industry analyst at marketresearch firm International Data Corporation.     The companies plan to hire 1,500 to 2,000 newemployees, and have the new integrated product on themarket by October 1996.     "On one hand I see it as advanced technology and putthem in position of having a very modular environment,"said Kusnetzky. "But I also feel that maybe Informix mayhave paid too much."     The market for relational database software iscurrently anywhere from US$6 billion to US$8 billion,according to Informix.  That figure is expected toincrease ten-fold within five years due largely in partto the advent of the World Wide Web.     The big three database vendors -- Sybase, Oracle andInformix -- have been jockeying of late for position inthefast-growing Internet market.     Informix also recently announced a linking of itsdatabase offering with Netscape's browser and teamed withInternet software provider net.Genesis Corp. in a multi-year bundling agreement.     The bundled package will include Informix-SE, a'loadand-go database server; net.Genesis' net.Form, anautomated forms processing engine for the Web; andnet.Genesis' net.Thread, a software product that createsand manages interactive discussion forums on Web sites.   The package, carrying the promise to make Web sitesmore functional for both consumers and suppliers, will beintroduced sometime in the first quarter 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDITTECH'S INTERNATIONAL HIGH-TECH ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996FIBRE CHANNEL PRODUCTS STARTING TO SHIP     Users can expect to see much more of Fibre Channeltechnology over the next few months as products arefinally starting to ship and industry confidence has beenraised a notch.     Fibre Channel -an American National StandardsInstitute (ANSI) developed standard- was designed as asingle high performance interconnect for use inenterprise network settings. Fibre Channel is essentiallytouted as a highspeed interface for linking mainframesand peripherals.     The almost year-and-a-half old standard vendors sayprovides for scalability, high performance as well asinteroperability with existing network technologies likeSCSI and TCP/IP. At the most basic level, Fibre Channeltransports data between one buffer at the source deviceand another buffer at the end, or destination device.  The speed and scalability of Fibre Channel, said DougAnderson, product manager for Fibre Channel switchsupplier Ancor Communications, are two of thetechnology's big perks. Fibre Channel switches, as wellas adapters provide 266Mbps to 1 Gbps per port. Customersare able to scale of to tens of thousands of ports withrelatively little hassle.     More so, Fibre Channel offers a high level ofreliability through a credit-based flow control feature.     "Fibre Channel combines all of the positive     propertiesof both channels and LANs into a single fabric that doesnot have any of the disadvantages associated witheither," Anderson said. You are guaranteeing that alldata that is sent is always received...channels offervery high reliability so you don't end up with droppeddata."     Proponents of Fibre Channel say that the technologycan practically be used in a LAN as a way of movingmissioncritical traffic over a network, and to storageand cluster environments.     But Michael Howard, president of consultancyInfonetics Research, said that Fibre Channel lookssomewhat limited in its use, and has a long way to go asfar as gaining widespread acceptance within the industry.At this point there is "a lot more awareness" ofasynchronous transfer mode (ATM)  technology than thereis of Fibre Channel.     "The real use for Fibre Channel is really in a datacenter, not as a hub to hub connector or backbone foryour LAN," Howard said. "Other than H-P, there are norouter or hub companies that are [incorporating] FibreChannel. That would say to me that the applications arein the data center."     On the product front, two major disk drivemanufacturers have begun jumping on the Fibre Channelbandwagon. Seagate Technology and Western Digital are nowshipping product based on a jointly developed FibreChannel interconnect specification that enables highspeed datatransfer between CPUs and their drives.     One of the main advantages to the Fibre Channelconnectors will be that network managers can add storage totheir systems without actually having to take the serveroffline. The interconnect specification has been a jointeffort of Western Digital, AMP Inc., Compaq Computer Corp.and Sun Microsystems.     From the systems builders, Compaq said it will use thetechnology for storage applications which require largeapplication systems. The company will include a FibreChannel connector on each of its four server clusters thatare due out sometime next year. The servers, analysts say,are likely to include support for Unix as well as WindowsNT operating systems.   The companies are touting the connector specificationas key to enterprise computing environments where makingchanges to mission-critical systems are made on a regularbasis. By being "hot pluggable" the Fibre Channeltechnology assures companies of fault-tolerance in theirsystems.    By having a Fibre Channel connector specification,users can now count on lower cost systems. Before, userswere required to purchase systems which had proprietaryconnectors, which hiked up costs. According to BryanYunker, engineering manager at Western Digital, the FibreChannel spec will ultimately give users more storage forless cost.     "[With Fibre Channel] you can have a lot of storageattached, very simply," Yunker said. "You can attach largequantities of disk drive capacity to a very simple daisychain BUS...you can create very cost-effective clusters."

IBM recently filed papers with the the US regulatorybody, the Securities and Exchange Commission, that say itwants to add US$1.7 billion to its already massive US$7billion war chest.     The filing ignited speculation amongst industryanalysts that plans for Big Blue's often referred to 'KingKong' acquisition may be in the works.     IBM quietly registered to issue up the added amountof stock, debt or warrent just before Christmas.  As wordof the filing spread, analysts quickly became divided onthe motivations behind the company.   "It doesn't surprise me because IBM will need to makeanother acquisition," said Mark Magillivray, president ofH&M Consulting.  "It's no secret IBM is trying to buy itsway into the markets, it constantly talks to companiesbehind the scenes."     Last year, US sources say IBM's offer of US$4.5billion for Apple was rebuked.  IBM was also believed tohave looked at Novell with or without its WordPerfectsubsidiary.    Any plans it had of taking on the WordPerfect lineappeared to be failing as a management group backed byventure capital money is reported to be the front-runner.     According to Magillivray, the stockpile of cash alsooffers important acquisition advantages over borrowedmoney. The former gives IBM the option to pursue hostilepowerplays similar to the one in the Lotus deal.     "Whatever they decide to buy, they will pretty muchget it," said Magillivray.  "And although it may not betomorrow, IBM is still interested in Apple... and IBM iswise to be getting cash together to buy Apple if and whenthey get in trouble."     But not all analysts agreed the 'King Kong'acquisition -- a term used by IBM's then-Chief FinancialOfficer Jerome York after the Lotus buyout who maintainedthat this was not the 'King Kong' acquisition IBM hintedat earlier -- is Apple or any other company.     One insider, who wished to remain anonymous, believesIBM may be saving up for a telecommunications company,while others speculate the company is simply trying toinitiate a stock buyback or firm up its bottom line.     Another analyst is skeptical of the filing believingit to be an empty shell.   "I don't think IBM would have an interest in any megadeals," said Bob Djurdjevic, lon-time IBM watcher and headof research firm Annex Research.  "I don't see a reason tobother with Novell, and although I see an opportunity forthem to get together with Apple, why take on all thosemanufacturing problems?"     Despite the $US3.0 billion acquisition of Lotus andthe over $US4.0 billion of common stock repurchasescompleted during 1995, IBM has maintained excellentliquidity.  And, as IBM continues to improve, the companywill have the increased ability to dedicate a portion ofits internally generated cash flow toward otherdiscretionary uses.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDITTECH'S INTERNATIONAL HIGH-TECH ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996HIGH-TECH COMPANIES DELIGHTED AFTER CLINTON VETO OVERRIDE     The U.S. Congress overturned a veto by PresidentClinton for the first time... and Silicon Valley's high-tech companies are celebrating.     The reason is that the new law Congress passed isintended to protect companies from frivolous lawsuits.     High-tech companies are frequent targets of     securitiesfraud lawsuits as a direct result of volatile stock pricesand disgruntled investors.     A letter from the industry lobby group AmericanElectronics Association directed to the president andsigned by over 200 companies including 3Com, Hewlett-Packard and Apple, included a statement from anunidentified Silicon Valley CEO.     "There are only two kinds of California technologycompanies - those that have been sued, and those about tobe sued," he wrote.     President Clinton's veto took the AEA by surprise.In his veto message, Clinton voiced concerns regardingthe difficulty for shareholders to file lawsuits and theavoidance of liability by high-tech companies for faultyfinancial projections.     Nearly 53 percent of technology companies locatedin the Silicon Valley have been sued under currentsecurities law, including each of the top tencorporations.     Estimates total over $600 million in settlements,     onethird of which was spent on legal fees.     The Securities Litigation Reform Act willaccomplish increases in corporate disclosurerequirements, including information concerning economicdownturns.     The bill also provides judges with the mechanism toforce plaintiffs to post bond to cover expenses inadvance of trial.     In addition the plaintiffs will be required tosubmit documentation that a company's conduct wasintentional orreckless.     Congressman Sam Farr, a Democrat from California,spoke on the House floor in support of the bill followingPresident Clinton's unexpected veto.     "We need to keep America competitive. Technologydevelopment depends on risk-taking. This bill allows risksto be taken and rights to be protected. I was shocked bythis veto... I am going to vote to override it. I urge mycolleagues who supported it in the first instance to do soin the latter."     Securities legislation was designated as a priorityfor the House Republican's "Contract With America" and hassince attracted strong bipartisan support in a politicalclimate focused on U.S. tort law reformation.     Mr. Kenneth Glueck, Vice-president of Financial andRegulatory Affairs for AEA said the organization wasstunned by President Clinton's veto.     "It was not on anyone's radar screen," Glueck said."We were never given any indication."     Mr. Kevin Richardson, Vice-president of GovernmentRelations for the Electronics Industry Association,another industry group, was not surprised by the veto.   "In the president's weighing of a variety of factorsboth substantive and political, he came down on the wrongside, in favor of the plaintiff bar rather than thetechnology market."     Richardson said he was equally delighted by theprompt Congressional override as he was disappointed byClinton's veto.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDITTECH'S INTERNATIONAL HIGH-TECH ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996PC SALES SOAR TO SENIORS   PC companies are honing in on a new group of buyers -people who are 55 plus.     According to Census Bureau data, 22 percent of adultsover the age of 55 use personal computers, with the mostpopular applications being word processing, home/personalfinance and telecommunications.     The numbers of senior users are only increasing,according to a recently released Times-Mirror poll, whichindicates a two point percentage gain from just 18 monthsago, totaling 600,000 users age 65 or older.     The purchasing power of those over 55, who control 40percent of all discretionary income, has prompted vendorsto try to entice more seniors to the PC marketplace.     Packard Bell conducted a recent survey of 1,700 PChouseholds, finding that senior citizens spend more timeon the computer than all other family members, an averageof 12 hours per week conducting personal business. Thesurvey also found that senior citizens go on-line 3.9hours a week.     Packard Bell's arch-rival, Compaq Computer Corp. lastmonth introduced an advertising campaign with televisionspots featuring a pair of older women using a Compaqsystem to fax recipes to each other.   A spokeswoman from Compaq's marketing group said thisdoes not indicate a move by the company to specificallytarget the senior citizen demographic, although the WallStreet Journal cited a Compaq survey which determined that11 percent of purchasers of consumer models in the firsthalf of 1995 were over the age of 55.     Acer is currently running a print ad featuring anolder male user on-line with the caption, "I surf with myfriendsin Orlando and Sun City." Both these cities are inFlorida's retirement belt.     An Acer spokesperson said the company "definitelyrecognizes that the senior citizen market is booming."     Acer also recently partnered with Intel to provide     100Pentium-processor-based Aspire computers to SeniorNet, aSan Francisco-based non-profit organization, which boastsnearly 19,000 members and 78 centers nation-wide since itsformation a decade ago.     Free classes offered through SeniorNet have trainedmore than 65,000 older adults age 55 to 101 across theU.S. Founder and president Dr. Mary Furlong attributes thesuccess of SeniorNet to "steady growth of on-line use byseniors... (we) expect this to grow as our population agesand as we continue adding more services and features toSeniorNet."     The volunteer-operated SeniorNet estimates thatcomputer use among the elderly population has increased by15 percent on an annual basis since 1990.     In coordination with Furlong's organization, theMicrosoft Network launched SeniorNet on-line in lateAugust 1995.Pathways to Learning, the primary SeniorNet service,functions as an on-line educational series focusing oncomputer literacy and the Internet.     SeniorNet also encourages senior users to compileliving archives, personal on-line accounts andperspectives on historical events available for access byyounger users.     Every major on-line provider offers senior-specificservices, from Prodigy's Seniors Bulletin Board toCompuServe's Retirement Living Forum.

Gigabit Ethernet - which would provide a ten-foldperformance increase over 100 megabit Ethernet - is stillin the idea stage, said Les Poltrack, director of networkconnectivity marketing for Sun Microsystems.     Though there are no designs or standards in place atthis point, Poltrack said that Gigabit Ethernet is seen aspotentially attractive backbone technology for users withEthernet networks already in place. At the same time,Gigabit Ethernet would be a technology nicely complementedby companies who have started slowly incorporatingAsynchronous Transfer Mode into the network.      In short, Ethernet could become for users atechnology applicable to the desktop all the way up to thebackbone, with 10 megabit up to one gigabit transmissionspeeds.   The idea of Gigabit Ethernet has been proposed to theIEEE as a LAN standard, but there reportedly is still nota working group in place to draft the standard. Thestandards process could take years to complete, let alonecrafting a viable specification. Sun could not provide anytimeline for when Gigabit Ethernet might reach the market.     Achieving Gigabit Ethernet is at least a couple ofyears away, said Michael Howard, president of consultancyInfonetics research.     Work has been done in the laboratory to achievegigabit speeds, but at very short distances. As such,feasibility of Gigabit Ethernet is still not a sure thing.     Although ATM is slated to finally take off in late1996, the concept of Gigabit Ethernet would be a nicealternative for companies looking to stick with anexisting infrastructure.     "The real ATM market has not hit yet," Howard said."There are a lot of smaller and medium sized companies andportions of larger companies that are counting on doing asmuch as they can with Ethernet. [With Gigabit Ethernet]users have the hope that they can built very fastbackbones with Ethernet."Back to Headline List CopyrightEDITTECH'S INTERNATIONAL HIGH-TECH ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996MICROSOFT BACK IN THE GAME WITH INTERNET PLANThere were a few surprises when Microsoft finallyannounced its Internet game plan.    It included an intention to license technology fromcompetitors Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp., and thepromise of creating a "community" on the Internet with itsMicrosoft Network (MSN) on-line network.     Microsoft has detailed a number of plans which ithopes will help paint Netscape and others out of thepicture. In the broadest sense, Microsoft's strategy isone of integration.     For example, it has plans to incorporate Internetaccess into virtually all of its "mainstay" PC productssuch as Windows 95, Windows NT and 3.1, Excel andMicrosoft Word. Microsoft also plans to deliver to usersof Microsoft and Macintosh computer systems free Internetsoftware. The Internet will become an integral part ofMicrosoft's development in every area.   "You won't see us having an Internet division," saidMicrosoft's CEO Bill Gates at a industry briefing. "Thatwould be like having an electricity division. The Internethas become pervasive in everything we are doing."     On to Explorer, Microsoft's Internet browser: thecompany is touting several key features with Explorer thatmake it a superior technology over competitors.     For example, multi-threading and progressiverendering features help with responsiveness of the userinterface to complex Web pages. A proprietary Place HolderMode allows for text to be downloaded quickly and easilybefore graphics are so users do not have to entertainthemselves in the meantime.     Unlike other browsers, Explorer supports advancedmultimedia and 3-D capabilities. Explorer 2.0 includesinline AVIs for embedded videos, scrolling banners,background audio, context-sensitive menus, as well asinline Virtual Reality Markup Language for fast viewing of3-D objects and animation.     The company has also madeofficial an intent to deliver its previously named"Blackbird" electronic publishing tool kit to users in thefirst part of 1996.     With a release expected in March of next year,Blackbird, now renamed "Internet Studio," will serve as atool for site developers to create interactive multimediapages, without any programming or HTML coding. WithInternet Studio, developers can expect the task ofcreating similar static web pages to be made easier, andat the same time be able to jazz up those pages that needbe more snazzy, said Mike Conte, group manager forMicrosoft's personal systems division.     "It turns out a lot of people are just using texteditors to create content for their site which is a veryprimitive way of doing it," Conte said. "This is a bigstep forward, it allows you to create a rich interactivesite without having to know HTML or how to program."     Sound, graphics, animation and other features areeasily integrated simply by dragging and dropping objects.The design of a page is essentially separated from thecontent of a page, so designers can easily "refresh"information on a page with little effort. Microsoft claimsthat with Internet Studio, businesses are expected to savetime and money it terms of web site maintenance.     "With Internet Studio, you can create a format onceand simply flow new content into it without having to re-author your site," Conte said. "It takes care of creatinglinks between stories and so on... its quite a time saverfor creating stories of equal impact but also have sometools for creating more exciting sites than you are ableto do today."     Finally, another "bit" of Internet news: Microsoft'sjust announced partnership with the National BroadcastingCompany to deliver an interactive computer news serviceand a 24-hour news channel.     The venture, which from the onset looks to cost inthe whereabouts of $420 million, holds the promise ofproviding comprehensive news and a plethora of archivedinformation for the viewer. Data such as photographs,videos, historical data and like will be available forviewers wanting more than just a 30 second news bite.     According to industry analyst Rob Enderle withresearchfirm Giga Information Group, Microsoft's just-revisedInternet strategy is a giant step in the right direction.Though Netscape is in the headlines now, Enderle warnedthat there is still plenty of room for other vendors tocapitalize on the promise of the Internet.     "The Net is still very new as far as a culturalmainstay or icon," Enderle said. "The final impact isstill a long way off. We've got a number of years to flushit out and for vendors to emerge. Netscape was one of theearly players, but its not often that the early playerssurvive the entire generation."     At the same time Enderle gave Microsoft high marksfor its company-wide involvement and effort surroundingthe Internet. "It's a level of commitment for a companyMicrosoft's size that's pretty unheard of. I think aboutsix or seven months ago they were completely off track butthey've done a great job of refocusing."Back to Headline List CopyrightEDITTECH'S INTERNATIONAL HIGH-TECH ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996CABLE TELEVISION INDUSTRY EXTENDS TECHNOLOGY TO THE NET    With lines running past 97% of residential America,cable TV has the potential to put the Internet at thefingertips of anyone with a remote control at a speed1,000 times faster than telephone lines.     CableLabs, the American cable television industry'sresearch and development consortium, announced a move tostandardize modem connections with cable systems by April.     At least 63 million sites already exist as part of     thehalf century-old cable TV infrastructure, which will haveto be overhauled and revamped in order to accommodate thehigh market demand for set-top box technology.     Mike Schwartz, vice-president of Communications,describes the CableLabs project as a non-profit,cooperative information clearing house and technologywatchdog.     "We're not competing with anybody, frankly. We wantto foster an open process for standard specificationswhich will bring production costs down."     There are eight interfaces which CableLabs willspecify: the connection to the consumer's personalcomputer; the consumer radio frequency interface,connecting the cable network to the home; five interfaceswithin the cable headend or distribution hub includingrouter and operation support system interfaces; and aninterface from the headend to wide area networks, toinclude Internet backbones and other global data networks.     CableLabs chairman Dr. John C. Malone acknowledgesthat cable operators have already purchased thousands ofcable modems to date, however he says these modems are notinteroperable."We applaud the research that went into today's modems,and obviously wish to use it to get into the marketplacefirst. But in the next generation of modems, we look formore commonality in cable so that vendors may enjoy massmarket sales."   Plans to unveil the standard specifications for cablemodems, or set-top boxes, may not come early enough forvendors and manufacturers. Those cable operators reluctantto wait until April will not be disappointed.     Motorola has already accepted 500,000 orders for itsCyberSURFER modems and Hewlett-Packard is also contractedto produce 150,000 set-top boxes before the Aprildeadline.    A resulting de facto standard from these models isanticipated by Rick Lehtinen, senior analyst for In-Stat'sMultiMedia Group. He remains skeptical of CableLabs' Aprildeadline. According to Lehtinen, "In the face ofprevailing buzzes, I saw nothing to dance in the streetsabout," at the1995 Western Cable Show in Anaheim, California, whereCableLabs made the standardization announcement.     Malone sees the new initiative on high-speed cabledata modems in a different light. In his announcement atthe Western Cable Show, Malone said "This internationalspecification will take the World Wide Web a step further,bringing broadband interconnections into homes worldwide."     However Lehtinen perceives difficulty in the     modulationand inception cable backbone which currently exists."There is a finite number of channels available throughcable, whereas wireless cable advanced modulation systemsand satellite systems have achieved phenomenalpenetration."     Although coaxial connections offer 1,000 times thebandwidth of the fastest available telephone networkconnection, according to Lehtinen, this by no meansindicates a plethora of alternatives. He says that thenation's cable TV network, which has primarily been usedfor "downstream" or one-way transmissions, is subject tointerference from police scanners, CB radios and evenChristmas lights.     A pilot scheme, Project Agora is designed to testthese and other problems in large-scale, "upstream" or two-way use of set-top boxes. Continental Cablevision, thefourth largest cable operator in the U.S., is sponsoringthe test, using Boston College faculty and students as afocal group.     Continental furnished 6,600 dormitories, 2,500classrooms and 400 offices on the campus with cable modemsfor a period of several months. The company found that online users prefer the speed of cable modems for functionssuch as downloading graphics and massive files.     Telephone companies are currently in the process oflaunching a competitive alternative to cable modems,offering a service known as ISDN, dedicated lines whichwill carry digital data at higher speeds, but still notcomparable to the speed which set-top boxes provide.     The question remains, however, who shall lead andeventually dominate the cable TV industry's onramp to theinformation super highway, exacting monthly tolls ofanywhere from $20 to $30 for leasing the modem alone.Estimated rate projections fluctuate from $30 to $40 permonth for service providers, which the cable televisionindustry hopes to become.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDITTECH'S INTERNATIONAL HIGH-TECH ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996DESKTOP VIDEOCONFERENCING STILL NOT SET TO TAKE OFF   1995 was touted as the year desktop videoconferencingwould blossom as prices dropped and standards weresolidified.   Not so and now some industry watchers are painting agloomy picture for the technology's future.     The hardware and software costs for desktopvideoconferencing are falling, but analysts point to thehidden costs of installing and managing videoconferencingon the network as a source of discouragement amongst MISmanagers. More so, there are simply are not enoughapplications available for companies to deem desktopvideoconferencing an essential component on the network.     TeleSpan Publishing Corporation indicates there was aslump in worldwide desktop videoconferencing shipmentsfrom the second to third quarter of 1995: in the secondquarter, 19,693 units were shipped, whereas in the thirdquarter, 17,176 units were shipped, a 12.8 percent drop.     On the other hand, a wide angle look at the marketshows much more promise: TeleSpan reports that in thethird quarter of 1994, shipments totaled 7,013 - there hasbeen a 120 percent jump over the past year.     Tom Pincince, analyst with Massachusetts basedresearch firm Forrester Research, said that desktopvideoconferencing has not taken off because it has notbecome an essential part of conducting day to daybusiness. For the most part, such units are typicallyinstalled for only the top 10 or so executives in acompany.     "There is just not this compelling need for everyoneto go out and get it on their desktop," Pincince said."It's a really sexy application, but if you are an MISmanager trying to figure out whether or not this is anapplication that you want to deploy on thousands ofdesktops...it's not hard to figure out the answer is no."   A study conducted by Forrester further indicates thatdesktop videoconferencing has a long way to go beforereceiving universal acceptance. The company just presented50 Fortune 1,000 data communications andtelecommunications managers with the following question:"What would it take for you to put videoconferencing onyour LAN?"    For the most part, responses indicated that lack ofapplications, lack of bandwidth, and the high cost ofoverhauling a network to include video to the desktop meandesktop videoconferencing will not become prevalent on theLAN for five years. Forrester concluded that even when itdoes become commonplace, videoconferencing will nottransform business interaction.     In terms of costs, Forrester estimates that in orderto successfully implement video at the desktop, totalcosts to lay the foundation for videoconferencing will runin the whereabouts of US$6,000 per seat. The costs includenot only the video equipment: camera, software and soundequipment, but a router upgrade, "people time," a switchedworkgroup, a video LAN/WAN gateway, and Pentium-classmachine with a fast monitor.     "[Hesitancy] used to be about cost and complexity;that has gotten fixed over time," Pincince said. "The realissue is that there is a big hidden cost in LAN-basedvideoconferencing. Even if they zero out the cost of thedesktop, there is still a significant infrastructurecost."     Other industry watchers say that though desktopvideoconferencing has been slow to gain momentum,proliferation will take less than five years.     Ultimately, the prices for the basichardware/software components will become so attractiveover the next few years that "everybody is going to jumpinto [videoconferencing]," said Will Strauss, president ofresearch Forward Concepts. Now though, Strauss said marketgrowth has been "painfully slow," and Forward Concepts is"in total dismay with the way things are going."     Though companies like Forrester claim that there is ahigh price to pay for video on the desktop, Strauss saidit is simply a matter of sacrificing quality. Users willnot in every case require the best possible conditions todeploy videoconferencing.     A survey conducted by Forward Concepts of more than250 end users indicated that a majority of users will besatisfied with video over the plain old telephone lines(POTS) and will want video to the desktop as an option.The company predicts that LAN pipelines and ISDN willproliferate as well, and in the next three years two-waycable TV will prove a popular videoconferencing pipelineoption.   "We've got [interoperability] industry standards likeH.324 which will enable a lot of people to call up eachother and see some incredibly bad video," Strauss said."What we have found is nobody wants it[videoconferencing], but everybody will use it if theprice is close to free."     As it stands, basic software/hardware costs willdecline over the next few years, Strauss reports. Thisyear, Strauss predicts that the cost of avideoconferencing "essentials" will be US$1,948. Nextyear, that cost will be down to US$598, and by the year2000, that will price will be around US$207, Straussclaims.     On the applications front, analysts have mixedopinions of how and when desktop videoconferencing will beuseful. On one hand, Pincince emphasizes that "thebusiness applications where you need to see someone's faceare really limited." Even though data collaboration isbecoming a more popular reason to utilizingvideoconferencing equipment, analysts say the time spentactually looking at one another on the screen is usuallyvery little. Still, many employees will desirevideoconferencing capabilities to avoid travel and tomaintain contact with key associates.     Outside of a traditional business setting, desktopvideoconferencing will increasingly become an importanttool in specialized fields, such as for telemedicineapplications.     Beyond staring at a jittery picture of businesspartner's face, Forrester predicts in the future - beyondthe year 2000 - there will be more unique ways ofutilizing video to the desktop. For example, businessesmight create "virtual environments" somewhat like thosecreated for games like Doom where a number of players - orin this case business partners - can interact by taking onthe persona of a character of a machine. Far out maybe,but not far off, Forrester predicts.   Of course, the vendors themselves do not admit to anydisappointing figures in terms of desktopvideoconferencing units. Intel, for example, says that thenext year, and years beyond look bright.     Intel with its ProShare videoconferencing system,along with companies PictureTel, Compression Labs Inc. andthe like are promising users increased functionality,lowered prices and better computing power to deliverhigher quality systems this year - all over the globe.     Intel, for example, says its videoconferencing unitshave been deployed in around 28 countries across the globeto date, including locations in North America, LatinAmerica, the Asia Pacific and European regions said ScottDarling, director of marketing for Intel communications.Many countries of course have a different level ofrequirements based on factors like the sophistication ofthe network.     "There are subtleties in each country by media typeand other various factors," Darling said. "Moreimportantly, the critical thing to do is work withcustomers around defining applications."     "It's not a matter of going in and sellingconferencing as a broad, horizontal capability... it'simportant to go in and talk about specific applicationsand what the return on investment for those applicationsis," he continued.    Intel said in terms of a desktop videoconferencingstrategy, the whole point is to further make the PC a"communicating PC," providing users with every possibleoption to make communication easier.

It is clearthat the island's chip makers are emerging as a force in theworld market. In the next few years, we will be hearing a lotmore from the executives behind these fast-growing companies,but these execs are not well-known names in U.S. business circlestoday.For that reason, in this first edition of Marketplace Taiwanfor 1996, Electronic Buyers' News has brought together fourexecutives who are playing major roles in Taiwan's drive tobecome a semiconductor production powerhouse: Morris Chang,Chin Wu, Miin Wu, and D.Y. Yang.Morris Chang, chairman, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.Ltd., Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp., and WyseTechnology Inc.One of the architects of Taiwan's IC business, Chang has heldmany top posts in the island's high-technology companies. Heis currently chairman of three companies: TSMC, the world'slargest wafer foundry company; Vanguard, a dynamic RAM (DRAM)startup; and Wyse, a supplier of X86-based servers.Chin Wu, president, Acer Laboratories Inc. (ALI)ALI, a subsidiary of Acer Inc., is one of Taiwan's largest designhouses, providing core logic, Super I/O, and other products.Miin Wu, president, Macronix International Co. Ltd.Macronix is Taiwan's largest supplier of nonvolatile memories,including flash, EPROMs, and ROMs.D.Y. Yang, president, Winbond Electronics Corp.Winbond is Taiwan's largest maker of static RAMs (SRAMs). Thecompany recently entered a foundry and technology alliancefor DRAMs with Toshiba Corp.Electronic Buyers' News (EBN): Taiwan's semiconductor industryis one of the fastest-growing in the world, with somewherebetween 15 and 20 8-in. wafer fabs under construction or inthe planning stage-with most scheduled to come online by 2000.Are the island's chip makers having any second thoughts aboutthe world market? Are there concerns about a glut of capacity?Morris Chang: I'm optimistic about the worldwide chip business.I believe the world IC market will grow an average of 20% peryear in the next five years, and will reach $300 billion bythe year 2000. While supply will catch up with demand in thelate 1990s, I do not see a capacity glut at that time.Miin Wu: By the year 2000, compared to 1995, the chip businesswill double. The semiconductor demand is very strong becausePC prices are going down fast, and other factors.D.Y. Yang: In the long run, the chip business will continueto show strong growth. Some basic drivers will be personalcomputers, wireless phones, and all the features that makethe PC user-friendly. The basic issue facing the industry issupply and demand. The industry has been investing for sometime, but there have been product shortages, thereby causingprices to stabilize. Suddenly, companies [chip makers] findthemselves very profitable, and then they've tended to increaseinvestment. So maybe during the next two years we could seesome of this capacity catching up with demand. But in general,we don't foresee an oversupply.EBN: Taiwan's semiconductor industry has experienced doubledigit growth in recent years, and many analysts expect thatagain this year. Can the industry continue to sustain thatpace of growth in 1996 and beyond?Morris Chang: In recent years, the world IC industry has grownat a rate of 25% plus per year, and Taiwan's IC industry hasgrown at an even higher rate every year. Looking ahead at thenext few years, I think that worldwide IC growth will moderateto about 20% per year, and Taiwan's growth will be correspondinglymoderate. However, I think Taiwan's IC industry will stillgrow faster than the worldwide total, because Taiwan has beeninvesting more than average, and the availability of talentat all levels and functions is still greater in Taiwan thanin many other parts of the world.Chin Wu: For Taiwan's chip makers, it heavily depends on thePC business, because Taiwan's IC companies supply a lot ofPC-related products, such as SRAMs for core logic. Even [foundry]TSMC has many PC-related customers who are in the graphicsI/O market and so on. So the outlook for Taiwan's IC industryseems promising, since the PC market is still showing 20% growth.Miin Wu: It's going to be difficult to sustain the growth ratefrom the last couple of years, but it's difficult to predictthe future. If you look at the total capacity output from Taiwan,it still has a small part in the world IC market, less than10% market share. But many Taiwan companies believe they canhave a piece of the pie. That's why there are almost 20 fabsbeing built in Taiwan. If you look at these 20 fabs, some companiesare doing foundry. Some companies are doing DRAM. If the marketis big enough to support those companies, everybody will besuccessful. If not, this may create a problem.D.Y. Yang: In Taiwan, there's been a lot of announcements ofnew fabs. But basically, those new fabs are foundries. So thatmeans we have an increase in capacity. However, many of theU.S. companies are coming to Taiwan and using the foundry capacityhere. We shouldn't be too worried about those new fabs.EBN: How concerned are Taiwan chip makers about Intel's pushinto the motherboard and chip-set business?Chin Wu: The core-logic market could experience 20% growth,or just under 30% growth, this year. If Intel takes 50% or60% of that market, the overall core market is smaller. Thiswill have a lot of impact on the individual core-logic supplier.Let's say there's going to be 60 to 70 million PCs shippednext year. At least 10% of those shipments will be PowerPCbased systems from Apple. We'll still have at least 55 to 60million sets with an equal number of PC chip sets. No doubtIntel could get half of those shipments, perhaps a 50% to 60%market share.Miin Wu: There may not be a major impact in the long run, becausewe are seeing the bigger players dominate the local PC industry.Smaller companies are dying out, because of cost and qualityfactors. In the long run, this will make Taiwan's PC industryhealthier.D.Y. Yang: Looking at the bigger picture, Intel is doing a favorfor the entire industry by trying to improve the price/performanceof the PC.Intel is improving the performance while cutting down the costof the CPU. Intel's priority is to maintain growth and enlargethe demand for personal computers. Of course, since they area leader, all the players have to watch the leader's behaviorvery closely. There's a saying: "If you are dancing with anelephant, it's your responsibility not to get stepped on."EBN: Taiwan's electronics business, much like Korea's and Singapore's,has reached the point where it can no longer compete on lowcost manufacturing. Now it takes real investment in R&D, seriousmoney, and companies have to compete on technology that theythemselves have developed. Can Taiwan's chip makers competeon that level against Japanese and U.S. companies?Morris Chang: Let me limit my answer to Taiwan. In the nextfew years, I believe low-cost manufacturing will still be akey strength of Taiwan. Low-cost manufacturing is very importantin the chip business. It is the ever lower cost per electronicfunction that makes Moore's Law a reality.To develop ever more advanced submicron technology in orderto achieve ever higher performance and lower cost per function,heavy R&D spending is required, and Taiwan is investing inthat.Chin Wu: In the past two or three years, Taiwan's design houseshave demonstrated they have the technology to compete in theworldwide chip-set market. In the graphics controller segment,S3, Cirrus Logic, and ATI are the leading vendors. But ALIand SIS [Silicon Integrated Systems Corp.] can make a productas good or better than the market leaders. What Taiwan's designhouses need to do is to be more involved in talking with U.S.customers and more involved in associations to find the righttrends.Miin Wu: To survive in this business in the long run, Taiwanhas to move into more value-added products. At Macronix, wehave a different strategy than other companies in Taiwan: Wewant to be a leader in value-added product development. Butit's up to every company to decide what strategy to follow.If Taiwan companies continue to believe in the manufacturingor foundry philosophy, then Taiwan will be in trouble lateron. Manufacturing or foundry has a lower barrier to entry inthe semiconductor industry. But China, and most recently Malaysia,are catching up very quickly in the semiconductor business.If [China, Malaysia, and other nations] move into the foundrybusiness, they don't have to worry about product, or even processtechnology; the customer provides this. If they want to buildup their volumes, they could someday undercut the prices ofTaiwan's manufacturers.D.Y. Yang: Taiwan has proven its excellence in manufacturing,in terms of technology and engineering. For example, we canimprove the yields, and we are also capable in terms of manufacturingmanagement, that is, cycle time and so on. But there's roomfor improvement in design and product development.There are very few countries-maybe none-that can compete withthe U.S. in that regard. The U.S. is still the leader in developingdigital and information technologies. Our objective is to minimizethe gap, and to try to follow U.S. trends as closely as possible.EBN: We've seen some chip partnerships between Taiwan and multinationalchip makers, like TI-Acer, Powerchip Semiconductor, TSMC, andothers. Is that kind of partnership business model going tobe necessary for Taiwan semiconductor makers to succeed asthe technology stakes get higher?Chin Wu: When you advance from 0.5-micron to 0.35-micron anddown to 0.25-micron, you need more and more investment. Youwill need certain economies of scale. If you don't have economiesof scale, then you may have to partner with others to offsetsome of your risk.D. Y. Yang: International alliances are a trend in this business,because of the huge capital investments involved. The requirementsfor capital expenditures have increased so fast. So there'svery few companies-maybe only Intel-that are profitable enoughto generate the necessary capital to sustain the growth. Becausewe cannot establish the design capabilities in a very shorttime, we can move into the industry by doing foundry or forminga joint venture in DRAMs. You don't need product in these twobusinesses. You need capital.EBN: Should we expect to see Taiwan IC companies investing infabs or making acquisitions in the United States in the future,much like Korean chip makers?Morris Chang: TSMC is investing in a foundry company in theU.S. However, I don't see this as a trend yet for Taiwan'sIC industry.Chin Wu: We haven't seen many successful mergers in the electronicsindustry. But I could see more joint ventures developing betweenAsian and U.S. or European companies.Miin Wu: It makes sense to develop some future expansion planoutside Taiwan. At this point, we'll keep our eyes open, butwe have no firm plans yet.D.Y. Yang: The Koreans have their own DRAM design and technology.So they can move their manufacturing to a lower-cost site ora place to gain market access. We must seriously study theadvantages before we move a fab outside Taiwan. On the otherhand, we may have to look outside Taiwan. Taiwan is perhapsrunning into some infrastructure issues-not now, maybe in thenext two, three, or five years. For example, we are runningout of qualified people and engineers. We also have shortagesof water and electricity.EBN: Singapore's IC industry is tiny but very aggressive rightnow, especially in the foundry business. Government there isputting the infrastructure in place for two or three "fab parks"that could accommodate 25 to 30 fabs. Do you see Singaporeposing a threat to Taiwan's semiconductor industry?Chin Wu: First, let me say that Taiwan's success in electronicsis due to several factors. Taiwan has 20 million people. Thepeople from the operator to the engineer and to the managementhave learned through solid education and experience duringthe last decade. Also, a lot of Taiwan people who went abroadto study or work have come back to Taiwan. Most of the peoplefrom Taiwan who went to the U.S. are more technically oriented,compared to people in Singapore. Singapore is limited in resourcesand technical people. They are successful in running corporationslike Chartered [Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte. Ltd.], butthat's small-scale. Up to now, they are only running 20,000wafers per month. However, the companies in Singapore are wellmanaged. That is their strength.Miin Wu: In some areas in the semiconductor industry, Taiwancompanies are better. In other areas, Singapore companies arebetter. Over all, Singapore is as good as Taiwan. Also, Singaporehas been known as a financial center, which will attract alot of multinational [semiconductor] companies.Actually, Singapore may be in a better position than Taiwan,because of its political stability and the freedom of the financialcommunity. Certainly, I think Singapore will be a threat toTaiwan. So I think that's another reason why Taiwan has tomove into more value-added products instead of staying on themanufacturing-only side.D.Y. Yang: We can't underestimate the aggressiveness of theSingapore government. The government has been the driving forcebehind all the success we've seen in Singapore. I believe theywill become a serious competitor in doing at least the foundrybusiness. Over all, Singapore may not be a threat, but theywill certainly become a competitor. But Singapore needs toresolve one issue: Where will the qualified people and engineerscoming from? Even if they hire some people from China, is thatgoing to be enough to support 30 fabs?EBN: Taiwan's government has played an important role in theestablishment and growth of the island's semiconductor industry,both as a financial backer and through organizations like theIndustrial Technology Research Institute and the ElectronicsIndustry Service Organization. Will ITRI and ERSO continueto play an important role in the industry's growth? Have yourown views on industrial policy changed over time?Morris Chang: While ITRI/ERSO played a significant role in Taiwan'sIC development, it has recently shifted its emphasis away fromMOS ICs. The reason is that the private sector is sufficientlydeveloped and should grow on its own. I don't foresee a majorrole for ITRI/ERSO in future MOS IC development.Chin Wu: In the past, the government has contributed to Taiwan'ssuccess. ITRI/ERSO formed the nucleus of the semiconductorindustry, including TSMC and UMC. The government also establishedthe Hsinchu Science Park. Now, Taiwan's semiconductor industryno longer needs a sector like ITRI/ERSO.Miin Wu: Certainly, Taiwan's semiconductor industry has beenfully supported by the government, and government did an excellentjob in creating this opportunity. It minimized the risk forthe private sector in the beginning, but [the private sector]has since been able to bring out advanced products and technology.In the future, ERSO will have a difficult time to positionitself.D.Y. Yang: I believe Taiwan's IC industry is too big for thegovernment to support. The industry is capable of being onits own. ERSO can do some coordination or provide some marketinginformation. So that means its role has been reduced, and itwon't play a significant role in the future. ITRI's existenceis due to the weakness of the industry. But the industry isvery strong [now]. In terms of research, some universitiesin Taiwan may take over the role of ITRI; it is a self-destructinginstitution.EBN: What are your views on the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement?Should it lapse?Miin Wu: This is difficult to answer, but I believe in freecompetition. If every country opens up its market for peopleto freely compete, there's no need for any agreements. Rightnow, the Japanese believe they are buying enough from overseas,so there's no need for an agreement. We should look at thefacts, and whether or not Japan is really doing that. If thingsgo the wrong way and Japan closes its door, then I'm sure theU.S. government will come back again.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987The Next Wave -- A new generation of chip makers targets foundriesand DRAMs to compete with neighbors Korea and JapanBy:Mark LaPedusTaiwan's semiconductor industry accounted for a mere 3% of theworld market last year. But while the island's IC entrepreneursmay not yet pose a threat to Asia's two chip-making powerhouses,Japan and Korea, it is clear they soon will be a force to reckonwith. The island's semiconductor revenue is expected to reach$6.5 billion in 1996, a 54.7% jump from 1995, according toBen Lee, an analyst with Dataquest Taiwan, Taipei.The pace of change in the island's IC sector during the past18 months can only be described as frantic. With startups,technology alliances, and joint ventures being announced ona monthly and sometimes weekly basis, U.S. OEMs looking foropportunities in Taiwan's chip industry need a scorecard justto keep track of who the players are and who owns what company.Only 18 months ago, the island's entire IC industry consistedof eight companies with fabs, plus a dozen or so design houses.But booming sales in the chip market worldwide, coupled withreadily accessible and affordable capital in Taipei, have ledto the launch over the past year and a half of eight semiconductorcompanies with plans to build fabs. Put those new makers' planstogether with expansion at the island's original eight andyou have some 15 to 20 8-in. fabs now being planned for thenear future.Taiwan's new wave of chip hopefuls is focusing on the two hottestsectors in the business: dynamic RAMs (DRAMs) and foundry services.These new contenders, some with little or no experience inthe semiconductor business-one calls itself a "Livestock Corp."are certainly not household names. Some are a mystery evento industry analysts who track Asian business. However, theycannot be ignored.That's why EBN has prepared its own scorecard-a Directory ofTaiwan's Semiconductor Industry-which follows this introduction.A thumbnail sketch shows that in 1994, Taiwan's industry consistedof two DRAM makers-Mosel-Vitelic Inc. and Texas InstrumentsAcer Inc., a joint venture between TI and Acer. During thepast 18 months, three more DRAM companies have been launched Nan Ya Technology Corp., Powerchip Semiconductor Corp., andVanguard International Semiconductor Corp.Nan Ya's parent company, Nan Ya Plastics Corp., is Taiwan'slargest printed-circuit-board maker, while Powerchip is a jointventure invested in by Taiwan's Umax Group and Japan's MitsubishiElectric Corp. and Kanematsu Corp. A little more than a yearago, Vanguard was a government-owned R&D facility. The fabwas spun off to become a commercial DRAM maker, thanks in partto a group of investors led by Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingCo. Ltd. (TSMC)Two old-timers in Taiwan's IC industry, United MicroelectronicsCorp. (UMC) and Winbond Electronics Corp., also plan to jumpinto the DRAM business by 1997.To complicate matters, UMC and several fabless IC houses haverecently announced the launch of three joint-venture companiesin the wafer foundry business: United Semiconductor Corp.,United Silicon Corp., and a yet-to-be-named foundry.Another wafer foundry service launched earlier this year isAsia Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., not to be confusedwith TSMC. The Hsinchu Science-Based Park foundry will operatean 8-in. wafer fab that is scheduled to start production in1997.Perhaps the most bizarre entrant in the chip business this yearis the Chia Hsin Livestock Corp. Little is known about thecompany other than the fact its primary investor is HualonMicroelectronics Corp., a Taiwan IC maker whose parent companyis one of the largest textile concerns on the island.Buyers sourcing chips in Taiwan are advised to obtain copiesof product guidebooks from local trade associations such asthe Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association(TEEMA), which can be reached by telephone at 886-2-999-2828,or by fax at 886-2-999-2626, or the Science-Based IndustrialPark Business Directory-tel: 886-35-773-311, fax: 886-35-776222.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Directory Of Taiwan's Semiconductor IndustryMerchant IC Makers-With FabsHoltek Microelectronics Inc.(Est. 1988)No. 5, Creation Road II, Science-Based Industrial Park, Hsinchu,Taiwan R.O.C.; Tel: 886-35-784-888; Fax: 886-35-770-879;Keith Wu, presidentSales: 1993: $61 million; 1994: $69 millionU.S. office: Holmate Technology Corp., San Jose, Calif.Tel: (408) 894-9046Fax: (408) 894-0838Holtek sells microcontrollers and consumer electronics ICs.Hualon Microelectronics Corp.(Est. 1987)No. 1, R&D Road IV, Science-Based Industrial Park, Hsinchu,Taiwan R.O.C.; Tel: 886-35-774-945;Fax: 886-35-774-305;Andrew T.M.

Other distributors with similar programs include FutureElectronics Inc., which launched its Future Active Industrial(FAI) effort two years ago, and Bell Industries Inc., whichcreated a telesales/account development program five yearsago. Marshall Industries launched its effort around the sametime.Centralization efforts in the middle to late 1980s, which pulledinventory and sales- people into regional "hubs," led to increasedcustomer traffic at fewer locations and placed tremendous demandon inside salespeople. The small accounts got poor serviceor none at all. One distribution insider recalls faxes constantlygetting misplaced and quotes taking days. And since salespeopleusually are commissioned, large orders received the most attention.By their own accounts, the efforts of Hamilton Hallmark, Bell,and Future are working. Avnet telesales is tracking 20,000incoming calls per week. Bell Industries' account developmentprogram has grown from $8 million in 1991 to $50 million thisyear. Although Future declined to disclose sales figures, itsFAI program has grown from 47 to 55 locations and from 400to 500 FAI account executives in the past year.Admittedly, these efforts were designed in part to offload trafficfrom inside salespeople, but they've also educated distributorson the small-customer base. For example, instead of the onepiece or two-piece MRO orders Avnet thought could be servedby a catalog, the company discovered otherwise, said Gary Berg,vice president and national director of telesales."At launch [of telesales], we did not distinguish catalog salesfrom small customers," he said. "But we didn't get the basewe expected. Instead of one- or two-piece orders, we got customerswith large DTAMs [distribution total available markets] notdoing business with Avnet."The ultimate goal of these programs is not to hand customersoff-although customers may feel differently-but to dedicatea group of people taking ownership of "their" customer base.Each approach is a bit different.Hamilton Hallmark Express Service and Time Electronics RegionalSupport, both of which are under Avnet EMG, are handled bythe same two sites: Tempe, Ariz., and Peabody, Mass. Despitesharing these resources, Hamilton Hallmark and Time handlecustomers differently. While both organizations handle incomingcalls directed to their respective reps, Time's salespeopleare more actively involved in external marketing, includingdirect mail followup calls.Hamilton Hallmark Express Service has grown to become a $75million operation and generates 500 new or re-emerging accountsper month. Although average orders are about $361, orders ofup to $50,000 are handled by the operation, said Lloyd Kaplan,Hamilton Hallmark's senior vice president of marketing.Sales reps have phone and PC integration. Caller ID shows thenumber of the caller, and a window automatically pops on thePC screen with the caller's sales history, the customer's profile,account number, notes, address, buyer contacts, and other information.Incoming calls are automatically routed to the next availablerep, but can also go to a particular rep or product specialistif the customer prefers. Express Service has approximately70 sales reps, all handling "generic" calls, although ExpressService is realizing the need to specialize. Supplier representatives,called supplier advocates, train telesales people to handlesupplier-specific calls. Time's reps receive intensive producttraining on its interconnect, passive, and electromechanicalproducts, said Time president Burt Katz.Sales reps are salaried, which discourages competition betweenExpress Service and field salespeople. Bonuses are based oncustomer-satisfaction reviews.Express Service customers needing technical assistance can beconferenced in to Hamilton Hallmark's Technical Support Centerin Chandler, Ariz. Telesales can also arrange for customersto be called on by either a technical or field sales rep, althoughthat customer can still be supported by telesales.Orders, including parts that are design-registered, are flagged,and field offices are notified (because design wins are subjectto special relationships with suppliers), as are customersthat a supplier may not sell to. For example, Motorola SPS,Phoenix, has asked its distributors not to sell to certainnon-OEMs, and incoming calls from those customers are flagged.In development is a technology to directly route incoming callsto the last rep to whom a customer spoke. All the informationgenerated in the telesales database will eventually be downloadedto a master Customer Contact Database, which will track customerinformation and be used, among other things, to generate relevantinformation for the distributor and the customer.Bell Industries realized about five years ago it could not beall things to all customers, said Bonnie Cunningham, vice presidentfor account development at the Los Angeles distributor. Bellconstructed its account development program with two goalsin mind: to allow Bell's outside and inside sales forces topartner on the largest customers, but to also dedicate a groupfor which developing customers is the most important goal.Although customers sometimes are referred to inside or outsidesalespeople, Bell reps may stay with a customer no matter howlarge the account becomes.The account development group is located in Bell's Los Angelesheadquarters and acts as an extension of the field sales organization.Reps have their own geographies and frequently cooperate withtheir respective field salespeople. The customer can be servicedeither locally or through Los Angeles, an arrangement generallytransparent to the customer.Bell maintains that these accounts have the best of both worlds regional support plus a toll-free number and the West Coasttime zone. With corporate buyers, product managers, and othersupport in Los Angeles, telesales can often get answers morequickly and with fewer phone calls.Account development reps are salaried plus commissioned, andhandle both incoming and outgoing sales calls.Reps are networked with Bell's divisions, and through its ContactManagement software they keep customer records, notes, phonenumbers, and fax numbers in a file that can be accessed byanyone taking the call. Caller ID is in the works.Future's FAI program "has had a significant positive impacton our ability to service our tier-2 and tier-3 customer base,and our emerging accounts," said E. Stephen Segal, executivevice president of the Pointe Claire, Quebec, distributor.FAI began in 1993 and was designed to be more than a telephonebased operation. "Each local division has FAI," Segal explained."They are part of the branch but dedicated to that customerbase. People are account executives and visit their customers.In fact, they are required to do some face-to-face meetings."This is the key differentiator from other programs, Segal said.Every North American branch has FAI reps, as do several locationswhere Future does not have a branch. Small customers can alsoget access to technical support: their FAI rep will "qualify"them and can recommend support from field application engineers.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Vendors Shun SDRAM 'Lite'By:Anthony CataldoSan Mateo, Calif. - NEC Corp.'s bid to promote a stripped-downversion of the synchronous DRAM is losing support from othermajor vendors, which are opting to offer a full-featured SDRAMinstead.Hitachi Ltd. and Samsung Semiconductor Inc. are among thosethat have declined to build the SDRAM lite, which NEC billsas a low-cost SDRAM solution for PC makers wishing to adoptsynchronous memory technology by early next year.Conceived as a way to reduce the high test costs associatedwith the JEDEC-standard SDRAM, the SDRAM lite uses a subsetof the JEDEC architecture and is compatible with standard DRAMtest equipment and techniques.Some memory makers expect to rein in test costs during highvolume SDRAM production. "In the long term, there isn't enoughcost difference to justify two types of SDRAMs," said Jim Sogas,product manager for the Semiconductor & IC Division of HitachiAmerica Ltd., Brisbane, Calif. "I think the whole industryis better served by dropping the concept of a low-calorie SDRAM,and I think most other manufacturers are coming to the sameconclusion."NEC has been lobbying other DRAM makers to gain support forSDRAM lite, which is said to be easier to make than the fullstandard SDRAM. "It's a challenging part to make," said JimHandy, principal analyst at Dataquest Inc., San Jose. "Peoplewere finding out they could not get [full-standard SDRAM] partsto yield to such a high clock cycle. [But] those who can fielda fast part don't need the SDRAM-lite spec."The different SDRAM types should pose no compatibility conflictsfor desktop PCs, although there may be some difficulty in swappingthe two designs for other applications such as set-top boxesand workstations, said Mark Ellsberry, vice president of marketingfor Samsung, San Jose. "Our part will be fully compatible withSDRAM lite," he said. But SDRAM lite "won't be fully compatiblewith ours because it's a subset of the [JEDEC standard]."Samsung chose to stick with the full-standard design after concludingit could eliminate any price premium by the time significantvolume shipments begin in 1997, Ellsberry said. Analysts saidthat low yields and the accompanying higher selling priceshave hampered the efforts of other memory makers to lower SDRAMprices. "We've determined that in the first half of 1996, volumewill still be relatively small," Ellsberry said. "I think we'regoing to see some wholesale switches in '97."But NEC said demand for SDRAMs will crop up earlier, creatingdemand for both versions of the part. NEC now offers both SDRAMversions."We think the market is real for SDRAMs before 1997," said KevinKrehbiel, DRAM product marketing manager for NEC ElectronicsInc., Mountain View, Calif. "We're trying to reduce costs toenable price-sensitive markets such as PCs to adopt SDRAMsas early as possible."NEC hopes to offer its SDRAM lite for a 5% premium over thestandard DRAM by the first half of 1996, while Samsung is aimingfor an 18% premium for the full SDRAM over the standard DRAM.Samsung will close that gap further in the second half of 1996by selling the parts for 8% above standard DRAMs, Ellsberrysaid. And by 1997 the parts will be offered with no price penaltyover standard DRAMs, he said.Sogas said PC makers are also becoming more interested in usingsome of the functions removed from the full SDRAM to createSDRAM lite, such as additional timing variations.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987PCBs Face Materials ShortageBy:Diane NormanChicago - Printed-circuit-board manufacturers can expect higherprices and longer lead times next year for laminates basedon fiberglass, as shortages of the critical material are expectedto worsen.Even board makers that produce their own laminates will be pinchedby restricted fiberglass supplies, which will worsen when themarket's leading glass manufacturers shut existing furnacesto perform necessary maintenance."The board business is going to be kind of bleak over the nextfour or five months," said Robert Herring, president of HercoTechnology Inc., a $48 million board maker in San Diego. "Ourglass suppliers tell us we are only going to be able to get80% of what we want. Meanwhile, our board business is expanding."Herco has held the line on board prices even though its materialcosts increased 12% this year, Herring said. Other board makerssaid they have also kept prices stable because the market isso competitive and customers strongly resist any increases.But Advanced Flex Inc., a $30 million printed-circuit-boardmaker in Minnetonka, Minn., has told its customers to expecta price increase after the first of the year. The company didnot provide specifics.Advanced Flex is quoting lead times of eight weeks, comparedwith lead times of four to five weeks that were common earlierthis year. "We've asked our laminate suppliers to increaseour inventory, but they said no, " said general sales managerButch Chayer. "If you don't have an alliance or some sort ofagreement with your supplier, you could be in a little trouble."Resin-coated fiberglass cloths are widely used as laminatesin printed-circuit boards. The leading domestic suppliers offiberglass strands-Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., Toledo, Ohio,and PPG Industries, Pittsburgh-have announced plans to closesome of their lines in 1996 to perform routine maintenance,a process that can close a furnace for two to three months,analysts said. "They have been milking the [equipment] along,but now they are at the point where they are going to haveto take some of them down," said Dave Bergman, technical directorof the Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging ElectronicCircuits (IPC), Northbrook, Ill.Neither glass supplier returned calls for comment last week.Owens-Corning will spend $105 million over the next three yearsin addition to its standard $100 million annual investmentto increase its production of composite materials, but companychairman Glen H. Hiner warned customers against expecting immediateadditional supplies. "Most of the additional capacity [is]expected to come on line in 1997," he said.About 10% of fiberglass material is sold to laminate suppliersfor printed-circuit-board applications, with the remainderused in other industries."There has been incredible demand for fiberglass materials becausethe printed-circuit-board market is very strong," Bergman said."Demand is higher, not just in the United States, but worldwide."Printed-circuit-board sales last October increased 18.7% comparedwith October 1994, and bookings increased 29.9% for the sameperiod, according to the IPC. Year-to-date sales had increased15.8% and bookings were up 21.5%, the trade group reported.If fiberglass shortages continue, Bergman believes the materialwill be placed on allocation next year.Ed Henderson, president of Henderson Ventures, Los Altos, Calif.,saidboard customers are not likely to see major price increasesin the first half of 1996, but may see them later. "Manufacturersare under continued pressure to keep prices elastic, but theywill be pushed to raise prices as materials costs increase,"he said.Kalmus & Associates Inc., a $16.8 million printed-circuit-boardmaker, has avoided severe delivery problems due to its goodrelationships with laminate suppliers, said Hank Kalmus, presidentof the Broadview, Ill., company. "We've maintained very longand important relationships with our laminators, and hope thiswill pay back as we go into this period of severe shortages,"he said.Kalmus is also looking into composite epoxy materials as analternative to fiberglass. Such materials use fewer glass strandsthan current eight-ply products and are competitive in priceto fiberglass-based laminates, he said. "The composite materialsare already gaining acceptance in Japan. I think people mightshift over to composites if the shortages become too severe."Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987AT&T Kills LCD R&D ProgramBy:Jack RobertsonWashington - In a double blow to hopes for a U.S. flat-paneldisplay industry, AT&T has axed any immediate plans for activematrix LCD production, and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.Ltd. of Japan is negotiating to buy Plasmaco Inc., a plasmadisplay manufacturer in Highland, N.Y.A spokesman for AT&T Bell Laboratories last week confirmed thatthe company's AM-LCD development program was being scrapped.That effort, along with AT&T's companion FPD packaging programat Princeton, N.J., had been touted by former Pentagon flatpanel chief Kenneth Flamm as a "manufacturing testbed to allowa faster startup of production." AT&T is continuing the FPDpackaging efforts.But the fast production startup won't happen at AT&T anytimesoon, as the company is drastically cutting back to gain abetter financial posture in preparation for its upcoming splitinto three companies and subsequent initial public offering,sources said.Separately, it was learned that Matsushita was negotiating toacquire Plasmaco for an unidentified amount. Larry Weber, chiefexecutive of Plasmaco, was out of his office last week, andthe company's financial officers had not returned calls bypress time.Matsushita is very interested in Plasmaco's AC plasma-displaytechnology because its DC plasma display faces strong competitionfrom NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd., both of which sell displaysthat use AC technology. Plasmaco has developed a 21-in. plasmatelevision screen, and is working on a 30-in. prototype with1,2801,024 line resolution.If Plasmaco were acquired, it is uncertain if Matsushita wouldretain the operation at its present site, consolidate it withother Matsushita facilities in the United States, or transferthe technology back to Japan for future production.An AT&T decision against AM-LCD production closes the door onone of U.S. industry's best hopes for a giant electronics companyto jump into the market. The Defense Department's AdvancedResearch Projects Agency (ARPA) earlier awarded $50 millionto a joint venture of AT&T, Xerox, and Standish Industriesto set up a "manufacturing testbed" in the hope it would beexpanded to full-scale production.The AT&T Bell Labs AM-LCD development program was also expectedto funnel technology into an anticipated production operation.Until this fall the research program had a 'dotted line' reportingconnection to Richard Archambault, AT&T's vice president ofhigh-resolution technologies in manufacturing.Mark Hartney, ARPA director of High-Definition Display Programs,is hopeful the preliminary production data gathered at thetestbed could help other potential U.S.-based AM-LCD manufacturers.The ARPA-funded joint venture work continues with limited screenassembly at Princeton, where AT&T packages AM-LCD panels madeby Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and StandishIndustries into final products. AT&T wants to expand its FPDcontract assembly operation if it can secure work from otherpanel fabricators, sources said.With AT&T's dropout, sources said Xerox may expand into someinitial production using leading-edge AM-LCD technology atPARC. Xerox has studied the possibility of producing high-performance,high-resolution displays for document reading, map displays,and medical imaging, said Malcolm Thomson, PARC's chief technologist.A few U.S. suppliers build limited quantities of conventionalAM-LCDs for the military and avionics markets. The pendingpurchase of Plasmaco by Matsushita would further curtail U.S.hopes of penetrating the global FPD market. Plasmaco reportedrevenue of $800,000 in 1994, down 20% from $1 million the previousyear. Plasmaco was founded in 1987 and acquired plasma-displayproduction equipment and technology from IBM Corp. It had hopedto sell displays back to IBM, but the computer maker choseMatsushita to supply plasma panels for its early laptop computers.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987A Closer Look: The Year 2000 Doesn't ComputeBy:Jack RobertsonWashington - Just as you are recovering from the New Year'scelebration, here's a new hangover headache for you:When the Times Square sphere falls four years from now, it couldusher in more than a new century. At the stroke of midnight,billions of lines of computer code could go haywire, unlesscorrected.While humans are putting up a new-century calendar page, computerswill be internally clicking to a new "00" annual date. Butunless they are told otherwise, computers see "00" as the year1900, not the dawn of a new millennium.That's not a problem for newer PCs, servers, and mainframesrunning programs written in the last several years. The "00"time bomb is ticking away in mountains of old 8-bit and 16bit spreadsheet programs and countless antiquated applicationsthat are still running on even the most modern PCs. The "00"fuse is even shorter for tons of old COBOL and mainframe softwarestill chugging away.In recent years, software developers foresaw the Year 2000 snafuand adjusted code to reflect the 21st century. But even ifmodern operating software has corrected the Year 2000 wipeout,untold storage vaults of critical archival data with unmodified"00" code are out there waiting to corrupt or crash programs.These programs were written so long ago that developers considered2000 as distant science fiction. Memory was tight in thosedays (if you can believe it), and abbreviating the year toonly two digits in computer code seemed an ideal solution.John Phelps, a consultant with The Gartner Group, said softwarefixes to the Year 2000 blowup are simple enough. "The realcrisis is finding the code that must be fixed," he said. Withnew client-server interrelated networks, vulnerable code canbe lurking almost anywhere in the system.Some systems will be immune, and the witching hour for old Unixbased software isn't 2000 but 2036. Like most computer code,Unix keeps track of time by the number of seconds that haveelapsed since a baseline date was established for the system.Unix operating software will keep ticking away until 2036,when the timing word length runs out of bits to account forthe number of seconds from the original baseline date. Butaside from these systems, a good number of miscounting systemsmust still be accounted for.No, it's not Stanley Kubrick's 2001 computer time warp thatshould rivet our attention. It's the warped "00" time hacksof the past that haunt us. Unless corrected, on Jan. 1, 2000,some computer programs aren't going to be as up to date asour futurists proclaim.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Blue Christmas For 800 At AugatBy:Bettyann LiottaNew York - Holiday spirits were crushed at Augat Inc. when thecompany said it would eliminate up to 800 jobs by consolidatingmanufacturing operations at its Interconnection Products Division(IPD) and Automotive Division to improve the profitabilityof those units.Augat, Mansfield, Mass., said the restructuring would be completedby the end of 1996. The company also said it is exiting themarket for low-margin commodity IC sockets. Augat's resultsfor the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 1995, will include chargestotaling $23 million related to the consolidations and itsexit from the socket market.To reach its $1 billion sales goal by2000, Augat wants to changeits sales mix. The company reported sales of $531 million infiscal 1994 and currently derives 40% to 45% of revenue fromits automotive division, about 27% from the CommunicationsProducts Business Division, and about 28% to 33% from IPD.In the future, Augat wants to obtain 50% of its sales from itscommunications division-which sells coaxial, fiber-optic, andbroadband products-with the remaining sales split between automotiveand IPD, according to Ellen B. Richstone, chief financial officerfor Augat."The communications division will grow at a very fast rate,and we will continue to grow, albeit slower, the IPD and automotivedivisions," she said. "All three divisions [will be] focusedon moving up the technology chain, providing more value-addedand increased global penetration."Augat will transfer IC socket production from its facility inMashpee, Mass., to operations in Sanford, Maine, and Lugano,Switzerland. The Mashpee plant will close by September 1996."[IPD] will focus on existing product lines, including terminalblocks, switches, miniaturized connectors, and customized sockets,"Richstone said. "We are only exiting the low-margin commoditysocket lines that are available from many other companies."Automotive division operations in Montgomery, Ala., will beclosed by the end of this year. Those production lines willbe transferred primarily to Mexico, with some moving to Detroit.About 800 workers will be affected by the company's decisionto shut these locations, but Augat's head count will only declineby 100 since the company will add workers at its other facilities,Richstone said. Though some workers will be offered relocationpositions, Richstone said she would be surprised if 50 to 75workers out of the 800 actually moved.Augat's restructuring follows disappointing financial resultsfor the third quarter of 1995. Net income fell to $4.2 millionin that quarter from $6.4 million in the prior year's thirdquarter. Sales for the quarter were $132 million compared with$128 million for the year-ago quarter. The company blamed theresults on "weakness" in its automotive business, which sellscustom automotive electrical power distribution systems andinterconnect products.Augat also noted that sales for the IPD demonstrated real growthand improved performance in the quarter vs. the prior year'squarter. IPD's sales had increased 12% from $31.6 million to$35.3 million during the third quarter. While the company saidit was pleased with the division's progress, it was not yetperforming at its long-term targets, which includes operatingprofits of 10% vs. 2% at present."Next year, including restructuring benefits, we expect salesto grow 10% to 14%, and net income to grow roughly 30% beforethe restructuring. Most of the benefits from the restructuringwon't be seen until 1997," she said.In a separate move, Augat said it would acquire certain assetsof Lindsay Specialty Products, a supplier of RF distributionproducts. Located in Lindsay, Canada, Lindsay Specialty Productssells to the CATV, wired communications, and wireless industries.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Powell Names New PresidentBy:Diane NormanChicago - Powell Electronics Inc. has selected Ernest Schillingas its new president.

Analysts have identified that customeras Packard Bell, a major buyer of Intel Corp. motherboardscontaining Cirrus graphics chips. This time, Cirrus blamedthe poor results on slower than anticipated growth in the homePC market and the somewhat related softness in its Taiwan business,which combined to reduce demand for the company's graphics,audio, and modem products.Sales of audio and graphics chips declined, while growth inrevenue from Cirrus' modem business did not meet expectations,said George Alexy, senior vice president of marketing for Cirrus,Fremont, Calif. Meanwhile, Cirrus' sales of PC products notdirectly targeted at home systems-such as mass storage-grewin the third quarter, Alexy said.Analysts don't believe Cirrus' results reflect a weakness inthe home PC market."The home PC market is not weak, but it may be softer than expected,"said Drew Peck, analyst with Cowen & Co., Boston. "What's hurtingCirrus is an industrywide problem of high inventories for PCproducts due to summer's huge order activity. The other issueis that Cirrus is in the midst of a transition between itsfirst-generation 64-bit graphics controllers, which are gettinglong in the tooth, and its second-generation controllers."Peck said the Taiwan market has become important to Cirrus becauseit is trying to dispose of its older 64-bit graphics controllersthere.The downbeat earnings news came just one week after Cirrus addedDEC to a growing list of manufacturers that the company haspartnered with in a $2 billion, five-year effort to increaseownership of its production resources. Under terms of the agreement,which still awaits approval, Cirrus will provide to DEC about$355 million worth of equipment that will be used in DEC's8-in. wafer Fab 6 in Hudson, Mass.In October, Cirrus revealed pacts with a group of semiconductormanufacturers, including AT&T Microelectronics and Taiwan SemiconductorManufacturing Co., as well as the expansion of its relationshipwith IBM Microelectronics.Alexy said third-quarter results will not harm its manufacturingpartnership plan, but will let Cirrus cut costs and offsetthat period's poor earnings."We were able to make modifications in our capacity investmentprogram that reduced forecasted cash use by $600 million overthe next five years without [affecting] the program," Alexysaid. "DEC was expected to be a joint venture. But it hasn'tended up [that way], so we can reduce our cash requirementsto the tune of $100 million."Alexy said Cirrus also lowered projected expenditures by $500million in a manufacturing deal with another partner-cuttingexpenses over the next five years by $600 million.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987AMD, Cyruix Have X86 Shot At IntelBy:Jonathan CassellSan Mateo, Calif. - Despite announcements from Advanced MicroDevices Inc. and Cyrix Corp. that fourth-quarter results willbe hurt by a declining 486 market, analysts and industry observerssaid the two companies are likely to re-emerge soon as viablecompetitors to Intel Corp. in the X86 business.AMD, Sunnyvale, Calif., said it expects earnings for the fourthquarter to be below those in the third, due to lower-than-expectedshipments of 486 microprocessors.The company's revenue willrise for the quarter, but not enough to offset depreciationand startup costs from AMD's new Fab 25 in Austin, Texas, saidW.J. Sanders III, chairman and chief executive.Cyrix announced it will report a loss in the fourth quarterdue to poor prices in the 486 market and a write-off of inventoryof that microprocessor, despite the company's long-plannedmove to exit the 486 business. The loss-the first in Cyrix'shistory-will cause the company to default on some repaymentsof debts to creditors, according to Jerry Rogers, presidentand chief executive of Cyrix, Richardson, Texas.Meanwhile, as AMD and Cyrix struggle, X86 leader Intel is continuingto hit the jackpot, with the company expected to report recordearnings for the fourth quarter, according to Alex. Brown &Sons Inc., San Francisco.Analysts said AMD and Cyrix's problems are a result of Intelusing its prodigious manufacturing might to reduce microprocessorprices and rapidly transition the market to the Pentium andaway from the 486."Intel changed the rules of the game in 1995 by acceleratingMoore's law," said John Marren, an analyst with Alex. Brown& Sons. "Intel now can deliver doubled performance every year,instead of every 18 months. It has made it difficult for othersuppliers, as Intel has driven the margins out of the 486 business.It's a real scorched-earth strategy."In the past, AMD and Cyrix were able to carve out a market nichesimply by offering lower-performance products that undercutIntel's pricing, said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst for DataquestInc., San Jose. However, companies who want to compete in theX86 market must offer an equivalent or higher-performing microprocessorthat costs about the same as what Intel offers, Brookwood said."There are a lot of companies out there that will buy from anIntel competitor, if they can deliver a working product," Brookwoodsaid. "The challenge for AMD, Cyrix, and others is to delivera product that gives their customers a competitive advantage."Using this strategy, non-Intel X86 vendors still have the opportunityto claim from 10% to 25% of the market in the future, he estimated.Analysts said Cyrix is the first company that is likely to makea comeback in the X86 market as it ramps production of its6x86 microprocessor in 1996. Cyrix's new 120-MHz 6X86, whichanalysts view as a Pentium-class microprocessor because ofits Pentium-style pinout, is expected to outperform Intel'supcoming 150-MHz Pentium, according to Steve Tobak, vice presidentof corporate marketing for Cyrix.Cyrix will begin volume shipment of the 6X86 in the first quarterand could ship as many as 200,000 units during that time, Tobaksaid. Tobak said Cyrix is targeting shipment of 2 million to3 million 6X86 microprocessors in 1996.Analysts said Cyrix's main challenge in the short term willbe moving mass production of the 6X86 to a smaller die. Cyrixalready has converted all production of the 6X86 performedby its manufacturing partner IBM to a smaller, five-layer-metaldie that is 50% smaller and far less expensive to manufacturethan before, according to the company. Tobak said he was confidentthat Cyrix's second manufacturer, SGS-Thomson, will be ableto begin volume production of the die-shrunk 6X86 in the secondquarter of 1996.AMD can still be a viable player in the Pentium Pro-class marketin 1997 if it successfully completes its acquisition of NexGenInc. and completes development of its K6 microprocessor, Brookwoodsaid. Analysts agreed that the Nx586 AMD obtained from itsacquisition of Nexgen and its own K5 microprocessor-which willbe introduced in 1996-are unlikely to be high-volume products.The K6, really a rebadged NexGen NX686, will offer the performanceadvantage over Pentium Pro that an X86 competitor needs tocompete with Intel, Brookwood said.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Chips Galore At Vegas CESBy:Mark HachmanSan Mateo, Calif. - Chip makers won't be left out in the coldthis week at the winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.Not only are semiconductor manufacturers the star players ina host of end products, but the show has become the spot todiscover the next killer application.A recent study conducted by International Data Corp., Framingham,Mass., and Semico Research, Phoenix, found that 15.2% of 1995's$147 billion worldwide semiconductor market will be used inconsumer applications."I think it's right to say that due to the increasing valueof semiconductor content in products such as those featuredat the [CES] show, more semiconductor manufacturers find itimportant to attend," said Todd Mozer, president of SensoryCircuits Inc., San Jose. Indeed, Sensory's voice-recognitionchip-called Voice Password-has been designed into the productsof at least four attendees of the show. Voice Password's recognitionalgorithm can be limited to a unique voice, making it suitablefor security applications. Sensory is not displaying productson the show floor, but potential customers can see demonstrationsin an off-site hospitality suite.Representatives of Samsung Semiconductor Inc. are attendingthe show "to find out what people are doing," said John Weekley,associate director of microproducts marketing for the San Josecompany. "The whole consumer electronics market has becomeso semiconductor-oriented that we can't figure out all theuses for something like an LCD or a microcontroller," Weekleysaid.Last year's consumer electronics sales-from electronic typewritersto personal copiers-totaled over $55 billion, said Joseph P.Clayton, executive vice president of marketing and sales forthe Americas and Asian/Pacific regions of Thomson ConsumerElectronics, and chairman of the Consumer Electronics ManufacturingAssociation (CEMA) Board of Directors and Executive Committee,Arlington, Va.However, increasing integration has produced lowered costs."While other products on the Consumer Price Index have escalatedin cost [by more than] 45% since 1984, consumer electronicsprices continue to decline. A color TV, which had an averageretail price of $430 10 years ago, now carries a suggestedretail price of $350-a decrease exceeding 22%," Clayton saidin a recent CEMA report.AT&T Microelectronics hopes to make a splash at the show byintroducing digital signal processors for the first all-digitalspeakerphones with built-in answering systems. AT&T will demonstrateits DSPhone digital speakerphone and FlashTAD telephone-answeringdevice ICs. Both the LJ30 NAND FlashTAD subsystem and the LF30NAND FlashTAD with DSPhone incorporate AT&T's DSP1605 device.The LJ30, however, provides functionality for all-digital answeringsystems, while the LF30 is designed for digital answering systemswith integrated acoustic-echo-canceling speakerphone.The LJ30 is the first DSP that manages the use of both NANDand NOR flash memory devices, according to an AT&T spokesman.Voice prompts and messages can be stored in the flash memoryof both subsystems, eliminating the need for OGM chips, analogspeakerphone ICs, dual-tone multiple frequency receiver ICs,and voice synthesis ICs, and reducing system costs for OEMs.The DSPs are offered in a 68-pin PLCC or 80-pin MQFP, and costless than $8.50 in quantities of 100,000.Zilog Corp. is aiming to take a big bite out of the market fordigital telephone answering devices (DTADs) as that businessbuilds volume in 1996. The Campbell, Calif., microcontrollermaker will show at CES this week its new generation of DTADcontrollers, the Z89175 and Z89176.Building market share in the DTAD business will depend on providingOEMs with a cost structure that will allow them to competewith the rock-bottom prices of tape-based answering machines,said Philip Levine, Zilog's tactical marketing manager forDTAD products. "The other half of that equation is to add featuresand improve voice quality at the same time you cut prices,"he added. Zilog says its Z89175 solution will allow OEMs toachieve a $29.95 retail price.The Z89175 and Z89176 offer a single chip plus memory solutionwith recording times of six to 10 minutes; enhanced voice qualityfrom the previous-generation Z89165 solution; multiple memorysupport of ARAM or flash memory devices; and caller ID."Perception is the problem in moving consumers from tape-basedanswering machines to digital machines," said Gerry Kaufhold,vice president of ThorKa Research, Dayton, Ohio. "You can goout and buy a tape machine that gives you 15 minutes or moreof message time for $19.95. Add a cassette player and you get30 minutes. But to do that with a digital telephone answeringmachine, you're talking about $100 or more-so the price barrierremains a problem."The Z89175 and Z89176 are sampling and will be available involume before the end of this year's first quarter, said AlanZhu, technical marketing manager of DTAD products at Zilog.Zhu said pricing will depend on order size, but that a goodrule of thumb would be $6.30 each in quantities of 50,000.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987IDT In S. Korean SRAM PartnershipBy:Mark LaPedusTaipei, Taiwan - Integrated Device Technology Inc. has formedan alliance with a little-known South Korean company, the IljinGroup, which will use IDT's technology to enter the SRAM businessnext year.Under terms of the deal, IDT, Santa Clara, Calif., will licenseits SRAM, RISC-based processor, and other IC designs to Iljin,a maker of aluminum, cable, and various telecommunicationsproducts that hopes to follow in the footsteps of Korea's threeIC giants: Hyundai Electronics Co., LG Semicon Inc. (formerlyGoldStar), and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.To do so, Iljin has licensed IDT's CMOS process technology,and will use it to build an 8-in. wafer fab in Suwon, Korea.The fab, to begin production by the third quarter of 1997,will be capable of making 15,000 wafers per month. The initialcost of the fab is about $777.6 million.The move represents Iljin's entry into the semiconductor business,according to S.K. Park, manager of strategic planning for theSeoul concern, a 20-year-old company with revenue of about$640 million last year. "We are scheduled to break ground onthe fab in March [of 1996]," Park said. "As for the alliancewith IDT, we have the option to license any products from IDT'sportfolio within the next year."He declined to elaborate on Iljin's future product plans ortimetables, but sources indicated the company has the rightsto license IDT's SRAM lines, including its high-speed, synchronousproducts. Reports also surfaced that Iljin could license IDT'sRISC-based processor line built around the technology licensedfrom Mips Technologies Inc.In the meantime, IDT will begin the technology transfer processafter it completes the deal with Iljin by the end of January.Additionally, IDT will provide technical training and supportto Iljin employees, primarily in the U.S. company's new waferfab in Hillsboro, Ore., the companies said.Iljin, which has no experience in the chip business, in early1995 formed a team to find a suitable partner to propel itinto the IC business."We are pleased that Iljin selected IDT as its source for processand product technology," said Len Perham, IDT's president andchief executive. In return, IDT will be able to expand itsSRAM capacity in the long term, and possibly get a strongerfoothold in the Korean semiconductor market, analysts said.Iljin's move into the IC business was viewed by analysts assomewhat unusual, in that Korea's semiconductor industry isdominated by three large conglomerates, or chaebols: Hyundai,LG, and Samsung.However, there appears to be a change in Korea's corporate culture,as other, smaller concerns are also looking at the IC business.In fact, Korea's total IC production is expected to jump from$13.6 billion in 1995 to $21 billion to $22 billion in 1996,a 38.2% growth rate, said Jonathan Dutton, senior analyst withS.G. Warburg Securities Ltd., Seoul.Still, Iljin faces an uphill battle in the IC market, he added.Aside from no experience in the IC business, Iljin hopes tomove into the SRAM and other markets amid stiff competitionfrom several companies, including Samsung. Prices for SRAMsare also expected to tumble this year. Reports surfaced inTaiwan last week that 1-Mbit SRAM products could drop to aslow as $7 per unit next month.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Relays To Get Mil-Spec QualityBy:Diane NormanChicago - Two relay manufacturers expect to have their linesfully qualified to military specifications by the end of theyear, offering relief to buyers plagued by long lead timesfor the last 12 months.Magnecraft/Struthers Dunn (MSD), Darlington, S.C., will havesome relays qualified to MIL-R-83536 in late March, and CommunicationsInstruments Inc., Fairview, N.C., will have a complete lineof MIL-R-39016 and MIL-R-28776 relays qualified in the firsthalf of this year. Communications Instruments is already shippingsome MIL-R-39016 relays.The companies are trying to pick up the pieces of the marketdropped by Struthers Dunn/Hi-G after it ran into testing problemsand economic difficulties that forced it to close in June 1994.The military relay market has fought long lead times sincethat supplier's unceremonious exit. "We created a real voidin the marketplace," said Bruce Armstrong, former general managerof Struthers Dunn/Hi-G. "There is a real demand from buyersfor mil-spec relays."Last February, Magnecraft Electric Co. purchased the mediumpower relay line once built by Struthers Dunn to MIL-R-83536specifications. Communication Instruments last year purchasedthe MIL-R-39016 and MIL-R-28776 low-level switching signalrelays formerly built by Hi-G.The merged Struthers Dunn/Hi-G voluntarily suspended shipmentsof some military relays in 1991 because the devices did notmeet government testing requirements. Though it resumed shipmentsin 1992, the company never fully recovered from that setback.Military products must be requalified when they change ownershipor when their production is moved to a new location. The relaysnow in the hands of MSD were never a part of their previousowner's voluntary suspension.MSD plans to have its 2-pole, 10-amp, and 4-pole, 10-A mediumpower relays qualified in late March. Other MIL-R-83536 partswill be qualified by the end of the year, said Armstrong, whois now national sales manager of MSD.MSD is already shipping noncertified relays for high-reliabilityapplications. "Our catalog [nonqualified] parts are built onthe same production lines and meet the same [MIL-R-83536] specifications,"Armstrong said.Communication Instruments is quoting 26-week to 30-week leadtimes today for its mil-spec relays, which are comparable tothe lead times of other suppliers of the same parts, the companysaid. The supplier will qualify the rest of its relays in thefirst half of the year, and it expects to reduce its lead timesto 16 weeks to 18 weeks by midyear. It currently offers nonqualifiedversions of relays that conform to the military specifications,the company said.The market will benefit from newly qualified suppliers, saidJim Bedell, director of marketing for Deutsch Relays Inc.,East Northport, N.Y., a competing military relay supplier.Deutsch is now quoting 22-week lead times, and is working toreduce them further from a high of 28 weeks at the beginningof last year."At first there wasn't a big reaction when Struthers Dunn/HiG closed, but then reality kicked in," Bedell said. "When wesaw what was happening, we ramped up production and now arerunning two shifts, six days a week."The market for military power relays is growing between 4% and5% a year, Armstrong said. "For us, the big challenge is torecapture market share."The company is working on a "re-entry strategy" that includesmaintaining profit margins while qualifying the relay products,targeting catalog sales as well as military sales, and operatingwith a smaller sales network, Armstrong said.MSD has cut its distributor lineup from 10 to five regionalcompanies and has also eliminated its direct sales force. "Wewant to keep things simple with a low overhead," Armstrongsaid.

"We've seen cases where the merger of two distributorshas caused customers to find another source of supply," Walsersaid, pointing to the Hamilton Hallmark and Avnet marriage."During the transition period, there's concern over loss ofsupply."Although some M&As are not successful, high-tech companies joinhands in hopes that theirs will be. In fact, 1995 was a blockbusteryear for M&As in the information technology (IT) industry.Deals in that sector exceeded 1,400, compared with 750 in 1994,said Janet Swift, director of marketing at Broadview AssociatesL.P., a Fort Lee, N.J., M&A advisory firm that focuses on informationtechnology.As the entire IT market gets more competitive and product cyclesshrink, many companies are looking to establish market dominancesooner, said Larry Lenihan, principal with Broadview. Therefore,the ability for an IT company to fund or compete purely oninternal development is nearly impossible, Lenihan noted. "You'reseeing a lot of technology companies looking to acquire hottechnology and product diversification where they can expandthe use of their infrastructure and channel mass," he said.M&As in the electronics industry this year will be more activelypursued by software product and services companies and telecommunicationsconcerns than by hardware firms, according to Broadview Associates'study of U.S. companies.Of the 150 U.S. IT companies surveyed for the Broadview study,64% are "very likely" to pursue M&As this year. Roughly onethird of the software and telecom companies questioned reportedthey are "more likely" to aim for M&A activity in the next12 months than in 1995. Software has traditionally led thenumber of deals that are done in IT; telecom is now close behind,Lenihan said. "In telecom, you've been seeing the concept ofmass and getting big to compete, and infrastructure has beenkey. Smaller vendors really can't compete, so they're beingbought out and we're going to see that market concentratingespecially Internet service providers, where there will onlybe a handful left," Lenihan said.While the number of Internet service providers dwindles, thenumber of vendors that provide the channel to get to the Internetkeeps growing. An increasing number of companies, such as HewlettPackard and Fujitsu, have jumped into the PC scene, makingproduct differentiation more difficult.Analysts said that consolidation in the PC industry is highlyunlikely, but if one company were to be acquired, Apple ComputerInc. would be the most likely. "Apple makes an attractive target,not only for its installed base but also for its technology,"Lenihan said. In addition to interesting software technology,Apple has a strong presence in unique markets, which the othertraditional hardware PC companies don't have, Lenihan added.Although the PC industry will not see any major strategic deals,cash-strapped companies may continue to sell themselves toforeign competitors that are looking to enter the U.S. market,Lenihan said. An example of that this past year was the ASTResearch/Samsung deal, in which Samsung acquired 40% of AST.Since the top dozen PC players account for more than 55% ofthe worldwide market-with scores of other PC companies followingbehind-it isn't unusual to believe that consolidation shouldoccur, said Richard Chu, managing director with Cowen & Co.,Boston. "The fact is that the industry's conditions have beenreasonably benign; there has not been any economic pressurefor consolidation in the past year," Chu said.The semiconductor industry should not experience any more M&Aaction this year than it did last, analysts said. The mostnotable deal was Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s acquisitionof NexGen Inc., to build muscle against Intel Corp. "As faras seeing other high-profile public acquisitions like we sawwith AMD and NexGen, it's hard to say-those are harder to accomplish,"said Mark Edelstone, senior semiconductor analyst at PrudentialSecurities Research, San Francisco. "The dynamics in the industrywould have to change before you see a lot of M&A activity."Lenihan foresees M&As occurring with specialized semiconductorcompanies. There have been several public specialized semiconductorcompanies acquiring private companies-such as Exar Corp.'sacquisition of Startech Semiconductor Inc. and Oak TechnologyInc.'s acquisition of Pixel Magic-which the industry couldsee more of, Edelstone said.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Stockholder Lawsuit Bill OK'dBy:Jack RobertsonWashington - Industry executives rejoiced last week as Congressoverrode President Clinton's veto of legislation curbing stockholderclass-action lawsuits based on financial projections.The bill, which goes into law this week, protects companiesfrom liability concerning earnings and sales projections aslong as they are accompanied by a warning about factors thatmight upset the predictions. It would also reduce the statuteof limitations for such suits to three years from the currentfive years.The law has been a major legislative priority of the high-techindustry, which complained that companies are being inundatedby alleged frivolous class-action lawsuits by disgruntled stockholders.It was unclear what political impact the president's veto wouldhave on his support by high-tech companies, which up to nowhave supported him because he has supported high-tech programs.With the stockholder-lawsuit curb now passed at the federallevel, lobbying activity has intensified on the state level,where companies might still be subject to what they call frivolouslegal actions.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Expansion SlowsBy:Ismini ScourasNew York - The electronics industry continued to grow in December,but experienced the slowest rate of expansion in more thantwo years, according to purchasing managers surveyed for EBN'sQUEST report.The study's composite index fell to 52.3 from 53.6 in Novemberand 53 in October, the lowest reading since the index registered52.2 in November 1993. The index's average for the three monthsended in December was 52.96, down from 54.13 in November and54.46 in October. Still, the index is above 50, as it has beensince early 1992, suggesting industry growth is still healthybut stabilizing. A reading above 50 indicates expansion; areading below 50 means contraction."The industry is still strong, but probably transitioning toa more sustainable pace," said Vladi Catto, chief economistat Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas. Catto believes the industrycan maintain this pace through 1996, as well as the remainderof the decade. And he does not expect the index to fluctuateas sharply as it has in the past.Although QUEST's production index dropped to 52.5 from 54.2in November, the new electronics orders index inched up to53 from 52.6, while the new export orders index grew to 51.2from 50, indicating continued growth in the industry.Growth in the PC market, an industry toward which the overallelectronics industry is heavily weighted, has moderated inthe past quarter, negatively influencing the overall expansionrate."Computers are clearly driving the [composite] index, and whenyou look at the strength in orders, that reflects the strengthin the PC market," Catto said. QUEST's computer index droppedanother 3 points to 45 in December, compared with 48 in Novemberand 53 in October.Communications is a key sector that has affected the rate ofexpansion, Catto said. The communications index for Decemberwas 53.2, compared with 52.7 in November and 43.6 in October.The military index rebounded to 57 from 53.2 in November anda low 41.6 in July. The components and industrial controlscomposite indexes were 55.2 and 53.6 in December, respectively.In addition to an uptick in the orders index, another positivesign is the electronics materials inventories index, whichwas 48.7 in December, down from 49.3 the prior month, reflectinglower inventory levels, Catto said.However, some economists said that a general slowdown in theU.S. economy will affect manufacturing and build up inventorylevels, causing companies to cut back production and lay offemployees."What we're seeing and expecting is a general slowdown, andwhile the electronics industry has been fairly strong, we arelooking for that to slow some," said Marlene Grabau, economistwith Hong Kong, Shanghai Bank Corp. Washington Analysis, Washington.When manufacturing and production levels fall, it usually createsfear and uncertainty among consumers, who will then be frugalin their spending habits. The cautious spending will ultimatelyhurt sales of big-ticket electronics products. "It all tiestogether, so the consumption of everything slows-but electronicseven more so because it is more of a discretionary item," Grabausaid.Despite the slowdown, TI's Catto predicts the U.S. economy,as well as the economy in other regions of the world, willimprove as the year progresses and once interest rates arelowered, which most economists expect."Japan appears to be recovering and is getting stronger as wespeak, and Europe is holding its own," Catto said. "Asia-Pacificcontinues to be strong."Economic conditions in the United States and abroad have beensome of the key elements affecting electronics production,analysts said. But the connection between economic progressand the electronics industry will grow even stronger as worldwidemarkets become more liberal and technology advances throughthe decade, according to a Henderson Ventures report.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987BusLogic And Mylex Agree To MergerBy:Mark HachmanSan Mateo, Calif. - Mylex Corp. and BusLogic Inc. have agreedto join forces, merging two successful I/O companies in a dealcompany executives call unusually synergistic.Mylex, which specializes in RAID disk controller and networkmanagement products, signed an agreement to purchase BusLogican SCSI card manufacturer competing with suppliers such asAdaptec Inc.-in exchange for approximately 2.7 million sharesof Mylex common stock, worth about $50.4 million. Additionalstock options, exercised after the agreement, could tack onup to $11 million more.Pending approval by BusLogic shareholders later this month,BusLogic would continue to operate under its name and at itspresent location as a wholly owned subsidiary of Mylex.Mylex president and chief executive Al Montross noted that thelack of technology overlap should spark gains in the qualityof future product releases as well as market share. "I canthink of only four positions [between the two companies] thatoverlap," Montross said from the company's Fremont, Calif.,headquarters, "and there is no overlap in our product line,as well. We expect this deal to help our OEM sales to currentcustomers, including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Siemens. It'sa great fit in terms of sales power and engineering resourcesand costs."According to Disk/Trend Inc., Mountain View, Calif., Mylex shipped60% of all RAID controllers to the network, minicomputer, andmultiuser systems markets. In 1994, the market for RAID controllersgrew 125%, with Mylex's share increasing nearly 20%Both companies are free of debt, Montross said. Mylex reports$34 million in liquid cash assets, while the privately heldBusLogic has reportedly been debt-free for 22 straight quarters,with $5 million in cash currently on hand, Montross said. Theshort distance between Mylex and BusLogic, Santa Clara, Calif.,is an added bonus, he said.BusLogic also indicated it would turn the new partnership intoan increased share in the OEM marketplace. "The positive synergycreated by the joining of Mylex and BusLogic will result ina significantly enhanced market presence for both companies,"said Jesse Chen, president and chief executive of BusLogic."Both organizations will be able to broaden their product offerings,better serve their existing customers, and offer increasinglymore competitive products and customer service."BusLogic, whose proprietary MultiMaster bus-mastering ASIC technologyallows for a common driver to be used for major bus architecturesincluding Peripheral Component Interconnect, EISA, VESA, andMicro Channel, recently announced a PCI Ultra-SCSI host adapterfor personal workstations."This is a merger of two successful independent entities," saidTom Lahive, industry analyst with the Storage Research Groupof International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. "The combinationwill allow BusLogic and Mylex to more effectively compete inthe accelerating storage marketplace."Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987FED Startup Seeking Mfg. Partners, FundingBy:Anthony CataldoSan Mateo, Calif. - Field-emission- display (FED) startup SiliconVideo Corp. (SVC) is looking to enlist two manufacturing partnersand to add its own high-volume production facility in orderto square off with active-matrix LCD (AM-LCD) suppliers by1997.In addition, the San Jose company hopes to collect $80 millionin funding in 1996 to support the cash-hungry development ofprototype 3-in. displays, which will serve as a precursor tolarger panels for notebook computers.Though no manufacturing partners have signed on yet, the companyhinted that Hewlett-Packard Co., which has been the company'slargest investor, may commit to building the FEDs. "They havethat option," said David L. Bergeron, SVC's vice presidentof manufacturing.To meet its manufacturing goals, the company will eventuallyneed the backing of two manufacturers that are willing to investin developing the process to build FED screens, which promiseto combine the high quality of cathode-ray tubes with the lowpower and small-form factor of flat panels."The idea would be to get two partners as early as possible,"Bergeron said. "It becomes unmanageable to have more than two."The partners must also be willing to build the FEDs in highvolume to ensure reliable second sourcing. "You don't wanta company that views this as an appendage, because they mayend up killing it," he said. "You don't want to focus on peoplewho want the AM-LCD fab investment."What SVC does want is partners who can bring key manufacturingtechnology to the table, particularly in the areas of roboticsand floor control. SVC points out that 85% of the FED manufacturingprocess is based on standard tool sets, while the rest requiresspecial equipment. "They would help define the process andput the plan in place," Bergeron said.By adhering to standard tool sets for the majority of the manufacturingprocess, the company hopes to keep costs low enough to be competitivewith AM-LCDs. And unlike AM-LCDs, the FEDs will be built withoutusing a costly stepper.Furthermore, Bergeron said the company will achieve yields equalto AM-LCDs while offering superior brightness. That's becauseeach FED subpixel contains 1,000 emitters that are 0.2-micronin width, which allows a high margin of error for failed emitters,said Nicholas G. Sturiale, SVC's director of marketing.SVC plans to show off a 5-in. prototype display at the DisplayWorks conference in February, an event that the company saidwill prove that the technology is not only feasible but manufactureready. "It will be a demonstration of the process technology,"Sturiale said. "Most other companies show a demo first, raisesome money, then go out and build it."The flip side to SVC's early emphasis on developing processtechnology is that it has consumed a lot of cash. To beginmass production by 1997, the company needs to raise about $80million next year, nearly the same amount it has gathered sinceits founding in 1991. Eventually, the company hopes to takein a total of $300 million from outside investors by 1998,Sturiale said."The pace of development is extremely fast," he said. "We'reburning a lot of dough."If all goes as planned, the company will have secured two manufacturingpartners in time to start sampling its 5-in. Edison productby the end of 1996. The company also plans to ramp up a new100,000-sq.-ft. manufacturing plant of its own by 1997.Edison is slated to be succeeded by a 12-in. DaVinci displayand the 7-in. Edison II screen in 1997. SVC also plans to startsampling a 15-in. screen, dubbed Michelangelo, in 1998.Though SVC insists that its FEDs will be competitively pricedwith AM-LCDs once they are in full production, Japanese andKorean manufacturers continue to drive AM-LCD prices down tonear-cost levels through heavy capital investments."The ability to get to low-cost manufacturing to a large extentcomes from building lots of products," said Joel M. Pollack,senior product marketing manager of display products for SharpElectronics Corp., the largest supplier of AM-LCDs. "That sortof experience hasn't even begun in the area of FEDs."Even so, some AM-LCD makers are hedging their bets by keepingFED technology at arm's length. "We have our eyes on the technology,"said Robert Biega, program manager of mobile computing forIBM Corp., which is producing AM-LCDs with Toshiba througha joint venture. "Right now it's still in our research divisionand hasn't come down to product planning."Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Asia Watch: Wafer Fabs As National PolicyBy:Tom McaleIn the 1980s, U.S. semiconductor makers debated whether governmentshould play a role in promoting development of the industrywith funding for programs like Sematech. But Washington's toein-the-water approach to high-tech policy pales in comparisonto what is happening in Singapore today.The tiny Asian Tiger has virtually made wafer fab constructionand the development of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturingprocesses the centerpiece of its national economic policy forthe 21st century.In a series of announcements during the past two months, officialshave made it clear that the country's electronics industrywhich accounted for 50% of the island's manufacturing outputlast year-must quickly move to higher value-added businesses.That means a move away from dependence on the disk drive business,which is moving to Malaysia, Thailand, and other lower-costcountries in the region, and a new focus on wafer fabs.The plan calls for Singapore to have at least 25 fabs in operationby the turn of the century or very soon after. Land, a highlyprecious commodity in a country with an area of only 600 sq.km, is already being set aside for two fab parks at Woodlandsand Tampines, and light-industrial operations there are beingmoved out. A third park will be named later. Each of the parkswill accommodate up to 10 fabs.Today, Singapore has only four fabs in operation, but anothersix are in the pipeline. Chartered Semiconductor ManufacturingPte. Ltd., a government-funded foundry operation, has two fabsrunning, a third in construction, and recently announced plansto have three more fabs running by 2000.Tech Semiconductor, a DRAM joint venture of the government'sEconomic Development Board, Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and TexasInstruments, has one fab running, one scheduled to come online in 1997, and a third scheduled for 1998.SGS-Thomson Microelectronics last month announced a $35 millionexpansion plan for its Singapore fab, and sources say the chipmaker is soon likely to announce plans for a second fab.The big question now is who is going to pay for the fabs thatwill carry an estimated price tag of $32 billion. The answeris a combination of government and private investment, mostlyfrom U.S. and Japanese chip makers.To succeed in having 25 fabs up and running by 2000, Singaporewill need to see at least half a dozen investment announcementsthis year. But industry watchers across Asia tend to agreethat if any country can pull it off, it will be Singapore.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Taiwan Computer Industry To Undergo Growth In 1996 -- But MotherboardBusiness May Move At Slower RateBy:Mark LaPedusTaipei, Taiwan - Taiwan's computer industry is expected to growmore than 27% this year, but local companies will lose somemarket share in at least one of the industry's mainstays.Total revenue of Taiwan's computer and peripherals industryis projected to hit $27.13 billion in 1996, up from $21.3 billionin 1995, according to the government-sponsored Market IntelligenceCenter, based in Taipei. By 1998, Taiwan's computer industrywill reach $40.9 billion, according to MIC."1996 will be a good year," said Stan Shih, chairman and chiefexecutive of Acer Inc., Taiwan's largest PC company. "We expectdouble-digit growth this year, maybe more than 20%."On the downside, motherboard production in Taiwan will growonly 15%, from 20.86 million units in 1995 to 23.9 millionunits in 1996, according to MIC.Taiwan's worldwide market share in the merchant motherboardbusiness actually dropped to 65% last year from about 81% in1994, MIC said. Some analysts blamed the shortfall on IntelCorp.'s thrust into the motherboard business.On a positive note, Taiwan's desktop and notebook computer productionwill jump from 7.16 million units in 1995 to 9.44 million unitsin 1996, a 32% growth rate, according to MIC.Desktop PC production will increase from 4.57 million unitsin 1995 to 6.12 million in 1996, and notebook PC productionwill jump from 2.59 million units in 1995 to 3.32 million in1996, according to MIC, which added that Taiwan will continueto be the world's leading producer of portable computers.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987NEC Creates Taiwan VentureBy:Mark LaPedusTaipei, Taiwan - Continuing to shift production offshore inresponse to the yen's appreciation, NEC Corp. of Japan hasformed a subsidiary in Taiwan to manufacture optoelectronicand microwave semiconductor products.Microwave and Optical Semiconductor Taiwan Co.

While many other manufacturers ofX86 microprocessors have abandoned their efforts in the 8086and 286 generations, Harris said the need for them continuesto remain strong."Most of our head-to-head competition in CMOS has upgraded fabs,and when they've done that they are using more state-of-theart process and are developing new products and haven't goneback to redesign some of the more mature products," Muns said.Harris is increasing the speeds of its devices, as well as addingnew packaging options, such as surface-mount packages, he said.Including the processors and peripheral devices, such as timercircuits and direct-memory-access controllers, Harris soldmore than 5 million of the 8086 and 286 devices in 1995."The company strategy is that we recognize this is a base businessthat is profitable and we are committed to those products,"a Harris spokesman said."They provide a good earnings stream. As we invest in new technologiesfor wireless, multimedia, automotive, and power control, werecognize that [the embedded X86] business is very importantto keep money coming into the company and helping us defineour future in other areas," the spokesman said.Muns said Harris is currently "evaluating the possibility ofmigrating to the next generations of X86 processors," althoughhe declined to specify what company Harris has been negotiatingwith."We've been making these parts for many, many years now, butwe're seeing demand increase to the point that we've had togo back in and reallocate fab capacity, and we are investingsignificant money in new speed upgrades and package types,"he said.

Should be. It forgetswhat it was told to remember in 50 or 60 milliseconds. So,in order to reap the dramatic cost-per-bit savings, one merelyneeds to check with each memory cell about 20 times per secondto ask it what it was supposed to remember, and then remindit to remember that!Analog systems, once the premier platform of electronic design,have been driven to near extinction by the "asynchrocidal"digital revolution. Revolutionist leaders have implicitly insistedthat the greater good would be served when every circuit wouldfinally conform to the tick of a single clock. Memory chips(bless their defiant souls) have traditionally retained thefreedom and independence that asynchronicity affords. No longer.Today's frantic pace and ever-expanding "to do" list has finallydriven even the forgetful DRAM into fully synchronized operation.Without the use of geometric reductions, refined lithography,or breakthroughs in materials science, synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)provides unprecedented silicon data transfer rates. In fact,SDRAM is capable of supporting today's 100-MHz microprocessorswithout cache, without multichip expense, and without the speedcurbing frustration of the dreaded wait state. SynchronousDRAM blows the lid off system speeds by integrating multichipmemory management strategies into blazing monolithic solutions.SDRAM functionality is principally distinguished by four features Synchronous Operation: The system clock gates all SDRAM operations.(Conventional DRAM has no clock input.) Cell Banks: Internally, memory cells are divided into independentlyaccessed "cell banks," which may be treated as if they wereseparate memory chips. This makes it possible to address alocation in one bank while simultaneously reading the datarequested during a previous cycle from another bank. Whilethe first read cycle is as long as a typical DRAM's, subsequentcycles conduct the address input and data output delays concurrently,resulting in increased data transfer rates. This method iscalled pipelining. Burst Mode: This rapid data- transfer technique is accomplishedthrough the use of an Internal Column Address Generator. Oncethe column address for the first memory location is set, subsequentaddresses are automatically generated internally. Either sequential(for Motorola CPUs) or interleaved (for Intel CPUs) addresssequences may be programmed for automatic generation. Burstmode may be applied for data transfers into memory (burst write)or out of memory (burst read). The number of words to be transferredwith each "burst" can also be specified. Command (Mode) Storage Registers: These internal registersare loaded with system configuration command codes upon powerup which define column-address strobe latency, the burst typeand burst length desired, addressing mode, test mode, and varioussupplier-specific options to optimize the SDRAM performancein a wide variety of applications.If doing more things faster with fewer chips is our aspiration,then SDRAM will be an architecture which, along with processtechnology advancements, will pioneer the frontiers of throughputright into the next revolution.Reggie Huff is president of Huff Communications, San Jose.

Not only are the end markets themselvesgrowing, but semiconductor content has grown from 9% in 1985to 20% in 1995, and will grow to 25% by 1999, said Jim Feldhan,president of Semico, Phoenix.Investments in capacity will also be among the most importantevents in the coming year. While OEMs may turn an anxious eyetoward their suppliers' manufacturing efforts, chip makersappear to be maintaining a conservative approach to new fabdevelopment, Feldhan said. Rather than the 15% to 20% of salesinvested in manufacturing during the "big '80s," silicon vendorsappear to have returned to historical levels of about 15% ofsales.To no one's surprise, IDC is predicting that levels of siliconcontent on PC motherboards will nearly double in 1998 due toincreased memory demands. Yet while the average PC memory willbreak 30 Mbytes by 1998, doubling the value of silicon contentfrom $600 to more than $1,200, DRAM prices should finally beginto decline, Feldhan said."In 1995, we've had a PC boom together with slowed Windows expectations.Nevertheless, prices increased [in 1995] during a period ofexpected decline," Feldhan said, indicating that he was speakingof the fundamental decline in DRAM pricing over the last fiveyears. Feldhan expects a 5% to 7% decline per quarter in overallDRAM pricing during the next year.However, the increased use of DRAMs may not be a universal phenomenon,particularly for older DRAM generations that have been enjoyingstrong demand long past their projected lifetimes.Feldhan warned that inventory re- adjustments by PC vendorsPackard Bell and AST Research, together with AT&T's exit fromthe PC market, could spell spot fluctuations in 4-Mbit pricingfor the first quarter of 1996.The continued transition from fast-page-mode to extended dataout memory adds additional uncertainty to spot markets, hesaid.Feldhan also noted that a warm welcome to the 64-Mbit generation,together with high yields and competitive pricing, could makeunified memory architecture offerings "go away."Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987First CardBus-Complaint 3-V FPGA Is Sampling -- Xilinx EntrySuitable For Telecom, Datacom AreasSan Mateo, Calif. - Xilinx Inc. has introduced the industry'sfirst 3-volt CardBus-compliant field-programmable gate array(FPGA)The introduction allows the company to triple its 3-V device,speed, and package combinations from 17 to more than 50.The Xilinx XC3100L-2 is the first FPGA device to support boththe emerging CardBus PC Card and 3-V Peripheral Component Interconnect(PCI) Local Bus specifications, Xilinx said.CardBus, which merges the PCMCIA form factor and the PCI-buselectrical standard, is becoming widely accepted for portableand mobile applications that demand both high performance and3-V operation, according to the company.Based on 0.6-micron TLM process technology, the XC3100L familyoperates at up to 85 MHz and reduces system power consumptionby over 50% when compared to 5-V devices. The XC3100L familyis pinout- and bitstream-compatible with the XC3000A and XC3100Adevices, providing easy migration from 5-V to 3-V versions.Additional 3-V choices include the XC4000L family. With gatedensities up to 20,000 usable gates, the XC4000L family issuitable for replacing low-end gate arrays in more complex,low-power designs. Previously, designers had limited choicesfor low-voltage devices greater than 10,000 gates."Until now, 3-V designs were mostly limited to laptops and cellularphone applications," said Chuck Fox, vice president of productmarketing at the San Jose company. "Now we see major designactivity in the mainstream telecom, datacom, and instrumentationareas. Xilinx's expansion of its 3-V portfolio addresses thisgrowing market need," Fox added.Both the XC3100L and the XC4000L families are sampling now,and volume production is expected in the first quarter of 1996.Devices are available in a variety of packages, including PLCC,PQFP, VQFP, TQFP, and BGA.Prices for the new devices in the XC3100L family start at $31for the XC3142L in 100-piece quantities. Prices for the XC4000Lfamily start at $54 for the XC4005L device, also in 100-piecequantities.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Keyboards Seek More Functions -- Adding Value Is Critical ToSuccessful MarketingBy:Mark HachmanSan Mateo, Calif. - The trustworthy keyboard is in no dangerof extinction, but the threat of commodity status has forcedkeyboard makers to integrate ever-increasing levels of functionalityinto their products.With suggested retail prices hovering at $30 or less for a standard104-key keyboard, system manufacturers and consumers now regardthe keyboard as a throwaway item.A sales executive at a leading mail-order PC vendor was clearlypuzzled when asked if a customer could opt not to buy a keyboard."That'll save you $16, but I don't get it," he said. "This[PC] product is going to cost you more than that in shippingalone."Some manufacturers were able to claim a slight premium withtheir recently introduced 104-key keyboard with three specialfunction keys designed to provide shortcuts for Microsoft'sWindows 95 operating system. The quest for any competitiveadvantage quickly prompted virtually all of the industry'splayers to follow suit with the configuration."That was probably the most exciting industry event since theintroduction of the number pad," one executive ironically observed.While a business model based on volume shipments remains viable,keyboard makers know well that integration means added valueand higher profit per unit.The GlidePoint touchpad of Cirque Corp. migrated from notebooktrackpad to desktop keyboard. "While not everyone can followsuit, Microsoft proved that you can sell keyboards if you canadd value," said Jim O'Callaghan, executive vice presidentof marketing for Cirque, Salt Lake City.Manufactured by Alps Electric (U.S.A.) Inc., San Jose, the 108key Cirque GlidePoint Wave Keyboard carries a retail priceof $129. While conceding that price is still the deciding factorfor buyers, O'Callaghan touted the keyboard's ergonomic featuressomething of a new religion in keyboard design.The Cirque keyboard is split to allow a more "natural" posturewhen entering data, O'Callaghan said. Extra backspace, tab,and mouse keys have been added, as well as the integrated GlidePointtouchpad and wrist rest."As stress-related injuries become more prevalent, there isa growing need for manufacturers to provide responsibly designedproducts for computer users," O'Callaghan said.

These are sold to commercialapplications in the heavy-industrial and transportation markets,and make up approximately 60% of Array's sales.Founded in 1989 when the assets of three small companies-a distributor,a defunct connector maker, and a machine shop-were merged,the company initially offered a broad range of connector productswhile it worked to integrate the three businesses.Array expects sales of $6 million in 1995, and is forecasting30% compound annual growth over the next four years.Part of that growth will be fueled by an acquisition and a licenseagreement with offshore producers, said sales and marketingdirector David Shaff, Miami.The company is in the final stages of negotiations to acquirethe assets of a connector company in Europe, Shaff said. Arrayalso plans to sign a license agreement with a Japanese connectorcompany that would expand its circular connector product line.Shaff also indicated that Array will continue to introducenew products for the military and commercial markets.The company offers both standard and custom products and pridesitself on quick response time, he said. Because Array is small,management operates with a "hands on" entrepreneurial style,Shaff said."Our marketing strategy is to use MIL-C-26482 as a foundationfor a variety of connectors."The vertically integrated company runs in-house plastic molding,metal fabrication, machine shop, assembly lines, and a qualityassurance test laboratory, he said. It employs 60 workers andhouses its operations in a 20,000- sq.-ft. facility.Most of Array's business comes from sales in the North Americanmarket, but the company expects to expand in global marketsthrough the aforementioned joint ventures and licensing agreements,Shaff said.Array plans to sign several new distributors and sales representativesin 1996 to help achieve its expansion goals, he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Briefs: Beta Phase To Merge With MolexBeta Phase Inc., Menlo Park, Calif., has agreed to merge withMolex Inc. effective this month, a company spokesman said.Molex, Lisle, Ill., a leading connector maker, has held anequity interest in Beta Phase for several years.

The companyexpects the device to find use in burglar alarms, factory automation,comfort control, irrigation control, greenhouses, and vendingmachines.Two voltage sensors and two output transistors inside the DS2407can be dynamically configured for operation as one sensor andone switch, as two sensors, or as two switches."This chip was designed to exploit the computational, display,and connectivity features of the PC," said Michael Bolan, vicepresident of product development for Dallas. "From the serialport of the PC, a twisted-pair telephone wire can be routedup to 300 meters to multiple addressable switches. One signalplus ground provides the digital communications link as wellas the power for the sensors and actuators."The DS2407 draws its power from the communication line, so noexternal power supply is required.Each device is individually addressable, and dozens of chipscan be put on the same twisted pair, where a central processorcan turn them on and off individually.This is made possible by a guaranteed-unique serial number thatis laser-etched into each chip that serves as a node address,and by an on-chip multidrop network controller.The DS2407 provides a simple way to build a closed-loop system,Bolan said. The device sensor responds to a stimulus and reportsit to the processor. The processor makes a decision based onthe sensor input and the switch turns on or off to controlthe process.The flexibility of the DS2407 is enhanced by 1 Kbit of userprogrammable and write-protectable EPROM. Data stored in memorycan describe a physical location, identify the controlled equipment,calibrate the sensor, or reference the actuator to a specificsensor.Because it is dual-channel, the DS2407 can drive bidirectionalopto-isolators. One channel can light the LED while the othersenses the response. This feature is used to build electricallysafe opto-isolated interfaces to control high-power devicessuch as electric motors or heating and air-conditioning systems.The DS2407 is available in either a 6-pin, C-leaded surfacemount package, or as a single-channel version in a TO-92 package.The dual-channel DS2407 is priced at $1.96 in quantities of5,000, which works out to less than $1 per input/output node.Dallas Semiconductor Corp., 4401 Beltwood Parkway, Dallas, Texas75244-3219; (214) 450-0448.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Isotek Ships Low-Ohmic Surface-Mount Resistors -- Devices IntendedFor Use In Current-Sensing AppsBy:Bettyann LiottaNew York - Isotek Inc. has unveiled two low-ohmic surface-mountresistors for use in current-sensing applications."The low-ohmic feature is important for current sensing becauseit offers the ability to sense high levels of current whilehaving relatively low power loss," said Isotek president BillPoisson.The two-terminal SMR resistor and the four-terminal SMV deviceare both rated at 3 watts and measure 6 mm x 12 mm x 3.4 mmand require only 7.2 cm of space on a circuit board.The SMR is available in values from 10 milliohms to 4.7 ohmswith a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of lessthan 50 ppm/C from 20C to 60C. The SMV is available with resistancevalues from 1 m to 1 with a TCR of less than 30 ppm/C. Bothmodels are available with tolerances of 0.5%, 1%, or 5%As members of Isotek's ISA-PLAN family of precision resistors,the SM resistors feature etched manganin foil resistor elementsto facilitate long-term stability, and sport low TCRs and lowinductance of less than 10 nanohenries. Heavy copper-alloylead frames and massive copper power terminals serve as heatsinks to the PC board.Isotek is the sole distributor of the devices in the UnitedStates, though the resistors are manufactured by IsabellenhutteGmbH of Dillenburg, Germany. Isabellenhutte developed the alloymanganin foil used in the products more than 100 years ago,Poisson said. "Most competitors utilize nickel chrome alloy.[Our]manganin material has the benefit of very low TCRs at theselow ohmic levels," he said. "As you get down to very low ohms,the TCRs go up exponentially with nickel chrome. We have lowohms and low TCRs. And, unlike wirewound resistors, the ISOPLAN technology is a flat foil, so it has much lower inductancethan wirewound resistors."SM series resistors are intended for current-sensing applicationsfound in automotive controls, stepping and servo motor controllers,power converters, power supplies, digital multimeters, andmedical instrumentation. They are packaged in standard EIA481 24-mm tape.Prices vary by resistance value and tolerance. A 100-m SMR with5% tolerance is priced at $1.74 in 1,000s. A 10-m SMV with1% tolerance is priced at $2.02 in the same quantities.

Ltd. hasentered the RISC embedded-controller market with a trio ofproducts built around R3000 processor technology licensed fromMips Technologies Inc.Though Macronix licensed the technology in 1992, no generallyavailable products resulted from the agreement until now. Macronix'sR3000-based controllers are designed for 32-bit embedded applicationssuch as laser printers, car navigation systems, and handheldequipment, said vice president Chris Kao.Other applications for the R3000-based controllers include localarea networking equipment such as bridges, routers, and relatedproducts, Kao said. Macronix is also looking to develop a separateline of RISC microcontroller units for the set-top-box market.The 3.3-volt MXR3500 is an entry-level controller with a 40MHz clock rate and 28-million-instruction-per-secondperformance."It also has built-in power management features, making itideal for handheld devices," said Albert Sun, department managerfor Macronix's custom design department.The MXR3500 is also available as an ASIC core, which is Macronix'ssecond 32-bit embedded offering. The core measures 5.2 mm2,making it the world's smallest 32-bit RISC core for the embeddedmarket, positioned against the products of AT&T, Advanced RISCMachines, Hitachi, NEC, and others, according to the company.The third controller is the 3.3-V 40-MHz MXR3520 with powermanagement features and on-chip cache memory. Priced around$10 in quantities, the device comes in a 100-pin PQFP. Thesingle-chip device will ship in the third quarter of 1996.The MXR3500 is packaged in a 128-pin PQFP, but price was notdisclosed.

RoosOn a roller coaster for the past year, the capacitor markethas been coping with capacity constraints and high demand inaddition to raw-material shortages and price increases. Asa result, several capacitor makers raised prices more than20% in 1995, and placed capacitors, particularly tantalum chips,on allocation. This year, capacitor producers expect pricesto stabilize and availability to improve as more capacity continuesto come on line.After concentrating on capacity expansion last year, the capacitormarket will likely resume its focus on reducing costs and packingmore capacitance in smaller case sizes. Buyers can typicallyexpect a price reduction as a result of this downsizing, inaddition to improvements in capacitor performance, includinghigher operating temperatures, higher capacitance, and lowequivalent series resistance (ESR)This year, many suppliers expect double-digit growth in alldielectrics due to exceptional demand. AVX Corp. anticipates20% growth, Philips Components predicts its aluminum electrolyticbusiness will grow 20% to 30%, and film supplier ITW Paktronbelieves its dollar sales will rise 22%. NEC Electronics hopesto report 25% growth for its fiscal year ending in April.Demand remains strong from the communications, disk drive, andcomputer markets, particularly as faster systems require morepassive devices. The exception is the cellular telephone market,expected this year to show modest growth compared with thebreakneck pace of the past few years. More moderate growthin the cellular business should considerably ease the demandfor tantalum-chip capacitors, some suppliers noted.Last year's severe shortage of tantalum chips appears to havesubsided. "The supply situation is approaching demand. We'vegotten off the life-support system as far as critical shortagesare concerned, but we are still at a critical stage," saidEd Bost, vice president of tantalum marketing at Kemet ElectronicsCorp., Greenville, S.C. But an unexpected spike in the cellularmarket could cause spot shortages, Bost added.Recent capacity additions should help suppliers cope with surprises.Some examples: Ceramic-capacitor maker Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd. has increasedcapacity by 30% in 1995, with another 25% coming this year. Kemet will boost both its ceramic and tantalum production by30%. Tantalum-chip maker NEC Electronics Inc. plans to add about10% to 15% capacity. Vishay Electronic Components has added roughly 40% to 50% toits tantalum-chip capacity.However, tantalum-chip lead times are not back to normal. Newcustomers are unlikely to receive products in less than 14to 16 weeks, although lead times also vary by capacitor value,said Judy Hausman, product marketing manager at NEC ElectronicsInc., Mountain View, Calif. The most popular capacitors are1-microfarad, 16-volt devices in an A case size; 10-F, 16-Vcomponents in an EIA B case size; and 10-F, 20-V parts in anEIA B case.Because of the tantalum-chip shortage, users have started substitutingceramic and aluminum electrolytic capacitors. A few suppliersthink the use of substitutes has eased with the added capacity;some maintain that the alternatives could compromise systemperformance."I think it's a stopgap measure and not a permanent move touse them in place of tantalums," Hausman said. Aluminums donot offer a wide operating- temperature range. And ceramiccapacitors' capacitance value changes with variations in temperature,although they are cheaper than tantalums and will not catchfire when inserted backward, she said.Still, others expect the switch to substitutes to be permanent.As long as ceramics are priced competitively and meet performancerequirements, they will be used instead of tantalum chips,said David Kirk, manager of marketing and engineering for electronicinfrastructure products, Murata Electronics North America Inc.,Smyrna, Ga. In addition, ceramic-capacitor lead times are holdingsteady at four to six weeks. Murata's ceramic capacitor businesspicked up for values between 1 F to 10 F during the periodof critical tantalum-chip shortages, he said.Kemet's Bost also saw users shifting to leaded tantalum devices.Although unit consumption of leaded tantalum devices is decliningabout 3% to 4% a year, Kemet will remain in the market to fillthe void left by manufacturers shifting capacity to surfacemount lines or no longer supporting the leaded market, he said.Bost expects leaded prices to climb about 3% a year.Tantalum-powder suppliers Cabot Performance Materials and HCStarck would not comment on pricing strategies for 1996. ButVishay president Don Alfson said tantalum suppliers have toldhim to expect hikes of 6% to 10%. Vishay and its competitorsare negotiating with powder suppliers.Tantalum powder averages $150 per pound and accounts for 10%of a tantalum capacitor's cost, said Hongju Chang, managerof R&D at Cabot Performance Materials, Boyertown, Pa.NEC, which increased its prices 10% to 20% in 1995 because ofexchange rates and tight supply, is expecting tags to stabilizebarring a sharp rise in tantalum-powder prices, Hausman said.However, Kemet is looking at potential price hikes of roughly12%, although a portion of the increase will be offset by theuse of higher-charged powders, Bost said.Pricey PalladiumMost of the raw-material cost in multilayer ceramic capacitorscomes from palladium. As a result of higher prices of thatmetal, coupled with scarce production capacity during the firsthalf of 1995, ceramic-capacitor prices rose 5% to 10%Palladium prices eased in late 1995, settling in the range of$130 to $140 a troy ounce, after having doubled from $89 atroy ounce in 1992 to $180 a troy ounce in 1995, accordingto Gordon Bassett, general manager for the Precious Metal MarketingDivision of Johnson Matthey Inc., Valley Forge, Pa."As additional capacity comes on board, we anticipate seeingprice pressures in those areas, but the cost of palladium hasalso fallen a little bit. We'll see some price pressures ifthe cost of palladium doesn't accelerate again," said JohnSarvis, manager of product marketing for ceramics at AVX Corp.,located in Myrtle Beach, S.C.As a result of the rising cost of palladium, many ceramic-capacitorsuppliers are considering alternatives. Some are using otherbase metals, such as nickel, to replace palladium in the innerelectrode systems. Murata Electronics has developed ceramiccapacitors made with nickel inner electrodes.When there are many layers, the cost difference between nickeland palladium becomes significant; for the high-layer parts,the savings is about 5%, Murata's Kirk said. Ceramics madeof nickel inner electrode could now account for as much as10% of Murata's ceramic-capacitor business, according to Kirk.Aluminum foils used to manufacture aluminum-electrolytic capacitorsare still in limited supply from major Japanese producers,and lead times have stretched in some cases to 24 to 26 weeks.Heavy demand from the power-supply market has fueled shortagesof large-can, high-voltage aluminum electrolytic capacitors.These parts also go into motor control and industrial applications.Prices are also on the rise. Philips Components increased aluminumelectrolytic prices by as much as 15% to 25% last year. Thecompany may again increase prices because of higher raw-materialcosts, according to Al Sembos, marketing manager for aluminumelectrolytic capacitors at Philips Components, Columbia, S.C.But currency is not a major factor. "The increase reflectsthe attempt by the foil suppliers to improve their financialsituation, and the demand is so strong, especially from theFar East, that it has caused a shortage," he said.Limited supply has resulted in Philips Components placing aluminum electrolytic capacitors on allocation for the last nine months,and the company is not accepting additional customers. "Thedifficulty with the aluminum foil is more acute in the highvoltage range-200 V and up-impacting both screw- terminal andsnap-in products, which are significant in size and requirelarge amounts of foil," Sembos said.Lead times at Illinois Capacitor Inc. are six months, said MikeShade, operations manager at the aluminum-electrolytic andfilm supplier, located in Lincolnwood, Ill. The company istrying to stock as many high-voltage parts in its standardline as possible. "We are hoping the material crunch will letup, but we don't expect marked improvement in 1996," Shadesaid.According to Tom Green, vice president of sales and marketingat North American Capacitor Co., Indianapolis, another pricehike is possible for 300-V to 450-V aluminum-electrolytic capacitors.The limited number of facilities that can etch and form highvoltage aluminum foil has led to the shortage, he said.Another dielectric that has taken a turn for the worse is polycarbonate,used to manufacture specialty film capacitors. Reportedly,supply is severely limited since its sole producer, Bayer inGermany, sold the technology and equipment to Electronic ConceptsInc., Eatontown, N.J. In addition, suppliers report that priceshave doubled. Electronic Concepts could not be reached.The polycarbonate is typically used in applications requiringstability at high temperatures or over a wide temperature range,with tight tolerances of 1%, Shade said. He believes many engineershave moved away from the material in favor of polypropylene.There is some interest in polypheny-lenesulfide (PPS) as a replacementfor polycarbonate because of similar characteristics. PPS usehas risen because it is a high-performing dielectric that canbe used in resonant-filter capacitors for power supplies, saidDick Slocum, sales and marketing manager for ITW Paktron, Lynchburg,Va. Unfortunately, the cost of PPS is four times that of polyester,according to film supplier DuPont Electronics, Wilmington,Del.DuPont expects to cut the price of polyethyleneaphthalate (PEN)film this year. The monomer used to produce the film is expectedto drop from $5.50 per pound to $1.50/lb. when Amoco Chemical'snew plant comes on line. The biggest advantage of PEN: It canbe dipped in molten solder in the wave solder process, saidMike Popowich, business manager for the films for the Americasand Far East at DuPont Electronics' films division.More In Less SpaceCapacitor makers are packing more capacitance in the same unitarea across all dielectrics. In tantalum capacitors, suppliersare looking for higher-charged powders to give them an extraboost. Any capacitance/voltage per gram (CV/gram) rating above40,000 is considered high-charged."We try to use the highest-charged powders to get the smallestpackages. We're at a point where we can't go on until the tantalumpowder producers improve their technology," Hausman said. Currently,NEC makes tantalum in an 0805 case size designed for consumerproducts.The main driver is achieving a higher charge per gram and perunit volume, said Chang at Cabot Performance Materials. Thehighest-charged powder available is 40,000 CV/gram, which canreach 100,000 CV/gram in two years, he said. Cabot is in pilotproduction with tantalum powder at 65,000 CV/gram. But thereare safety and purity issues with the higher-charged powders,he said.Tantalum-powder supplier HC Starck Inc., Newton, Mass., is alsodeveloping a 60,000-plus CV/gram powder. Terrance B. Tripp,manager for powder R&D, said most powders used today are inthe 20,000-class range, and the industry is rapidly movingto 30,000 CV/gram.Aluminum-electrolytic capacitor makers are also in the gamefor more CV. "Everyone is attempting to increase the numberof microfarads they can realize in a unit area of foil. Wecan utilize less material and be able to build more pieces,"Sembos said.There has also been a move to lower- voltage parts driven primarilyby the portable communication and computer markets. "A lotof computers are being designed to run at 3.3 V, which hashad a dramatic impact on capacitor voltages, typically at astandard 50 V and 100 V," Sarvis said. "Those voltages arebeing driven down to 16 V and 10 V, and eventually to 6.3 V,which was unheard of three years ago," he said.AVX reports increased interest from the computer market forits integrated passive component lines.Introduced in late 1995, these devices are similar to resistorarrays, and integrate two or four capacitors in a surface-mountpackage.Although downsizing to save space will continue, demand forlarger case sizes will not disappear, particularly at highCV values. AVX maintains that its 10-F product is still themain driver for the 1210 case size, and values of 1 F, 2.2F, 3.3 F, and 4.7 F are the 1206 leaders. Still, products of1 F and less are moving into 0805 and 0603 sizes.AVX sees a trend this year to broaden the range of the 0805and 0603s, which could affect the number of 1206s sold nextyear. The tiny 0402 is still not cost-effective, and the primarymarkets remain applications with very tight space requirements,such as communications and hearing aids.Leaded aluminum-electrolytic and film capacitors are still indemand because the devices do not easily lend themselves tosurface-mount technology."Films still have a long way to go for us to realistically addressanything smaller than a 1812 case size, so we're going in theother direction: packing a lot of capacitance in 1812 and 2824sizes," Slocum said.In addition, polyester, the most widely used material for films,is now available in the thinnest gauge, which has allowed thecompany to pack more capacitance into standard sizes."We've expended our energies during the last three to four monthson making polyester, which has a rather low melting point,[and is] more survivable in infrared reflow," Slocum said.ITW Paktron expects to release a polyester-film line of surfacemount chip films in the larger case sizes with increased voltageratings of up to 100 VDC, targeting the high-frequency powersupply market with 1-F and 2.2-F parts. Slocum said you cannotget those values in a chip that is going to survive IR withother film materials.With capacity problems behind them, capacitor suppliers willrefocus their efforts on R&D. A number of new products arelined up for this year.Illinois Capacitor is introducing a line of snubber caps. Theupdated design provides more current handling and better dVdt ratings in a smaller package. The company also is standardizingthree of its power-cap lines.In addition, it will introduce two aluminum-electrolytic lines the LSR series of low-ESR capacitors for switch-mode powersupply applications and the SAK series aimed at applicationswith low-height requirements.Philips reports good results in developing longer-life and highertemperature caps. Watch for a new product release in the firstquarter of 1996.Also expect a new low-ESR tantalum series in April,which willbe available in several values in A to D case sizes from NECElectronics.Gina M.

WillettI can't say we at EBN get all the most exciting assignmentswhile covering the electronics and computer industry. Comparedwith journalists covering troop deployments to Bosnia or thebudget battle on Capitol Hill, the latest components mightseem a little boring. But don't forget: While they get to wearflak vests and talk to anonymous sources in darkened garages,we get to cover the Information Revolution as it happens.And I think 1996 is going to be quite interesting for thoseof us covering the high-tech business. In fact, I'll bet thatwe have some of the most exciting stories to hit our industryin a long time.First of all, we have the component shortages to think about.For the last couple of years this story has been a no-brainerto cover. Shortages, shortages, shortages-we basically couldfly on automatic pilot for a while. This year the componentdrought is supposed to break, but which shortages are goingtoease up and which components are actually going to be inoversupply?In the SRAM markets, I think some of us are already talkingabout a balance in supply and demand that will eliminate thekind of price gouging that was going on last year. Sure, everysystem shipped will have cache, but the supply of such partsis already meeting demand and more suppliers are coming online. Look for at least a couple of stories in the coming yearabout new suppliers, cache RAM alternatives, and on-board cacheschemes from Intel's P6 to Cypress Semi's cache/logic chipsets and how all of these relate to the supply/ demand balancein the SRAM markets. I would not be surprised to see big changesby midyear.Calling the turning points in the DRAM market could be a littletrickier than in SRAMs because there seems to be such elasticityof demand that any time the supply increases enough to havean effect on pricing, demand soars again. For example, I needed8 Mbytes of RAM to run Windows 95, but I wanted 16 Mbytes toreally run it well. When I found out I could afford 16 Mbytes,I jumped at it. When the PC support people said they couldleave the old 4-Mbyte module in place for a total of 20 Mbytes,I again said yes. If they had asked me if they could put inanother 4 Mbytes, I'd also have said yes. I've figured outthat you can't have too much RAM, and sooner or later I'llneed more.My guess is that the market will go through turmoil this yearas we shift from supply balance to falling prices and backto strong demand and stable prices and back to rising priceson some types of DRAMs. If everybody drops out of 4-Mbit DRAMsbecause the margins have fallen, then 4-Mbit chips become morescarce and prices rise again. The organizational mix withinthe various densities will make keeping track of what's scarceand what's not a full-time job for reporters, analysts, andOEMs. The old "parts is parts" line just doesn't hold truein the DRAM market anymore. We're ready for the "big memorycrash of '96" story, but I hope we don't get fooled on thisone. The big story for the past two months has been DRAM pricesdeclining, but I am not fully convinced we've turned the corneron this one just yet. At this stage, I'd be resisting the urgeto play payback with my suppliers until I'm sure.One thing is for sure. We won't get the story exactly rightuntil after it's already happened; no one will, it's just toohard to see into the future. So we'll do our best and try tohelp OEMs make better buying decisions while the suppliersclaim we're too low on our price predictions and the big OEMssay our price predictions are too high. Maybe I'll get to wearthat flak vest after all?Hugh G. Willett is executive editor of EBN.

Withthat price point, the Mitsubishi set could serve as the basisof a low-cost digital video-encoding system or as part of afuture MPEG-2 decompression add-in card for personal computers.The ability to build low-cost compression systems based on theMitsubishi chip set contrasts sharply with the state of themarket at the beginning of 1995, when a low-cost MPEG-2 encodingend system cost around $100,000.During 1995, several companies offered lower-cost MPEG-2 encoders,hoping to capture a piece of the burgeoning market for videocompression systems used in applications ranging from digitalcable- and direct-broadcast satellite television networks toadvertisement insertion at local cable head-ends.C-Cube Microsystems Inc. in April introduced the CLM4400, whichwas priced at $1,950 in 100s, as opposed to the company's olderMPEG-2 compression chip set-the CLM4700-which was priced at$12,000 for a version that supports main-profile, main-levelencoding. The CLM4400 could achieve such a low cost by halvinghorizontal resolution, allowing a complete compression systembased on just four chips.IBM in March introduced a $700 MPEG-2 encoder that reduced costsby exclusively performing I-frame compression and omittingmotion-estimation functions.Unlike the C-Cube CLM4400, the Mitsubishi chip set supportsfull-resolution display. The Mitsubishi set also supports allMPEG-2 prediction modes, including I-, P-, and B-frames, incontrast to the IBM chip.To perform MPEG-2 compression with full-frame prediction andmain-profile and main-level support, the Mitsubishi chip setrequires at minimum a single M65722FP pixel processor, a M65721FPcontroller, and eight M65727FP motion estimators. Another featureof the Mitsubishi chip set is a built-in interface to synchronousDRAM.The M65722FP pixel-processor and M65727FP motion-estimator chipsare available now, while the M65721FP controller will be availablelater this month. The motion estimator by itself is pricedat $500 in 1,000s.

This new capability is forcing chip companiesto obtain more pieces of the PC technology pie to stay in thebusiness. As chips add more and more functions, the PC technologypie increasingly is being split into fewer and fewer pieces.For PC chip suppliers, the key question is: How will the PC'ssilicon pie be split between the traditional suppliers, andwho will be left standing when the music stops?We have seen silicon process technology advance rapidly from1.0-micron drawing rules to 0.35-micron geometry. Chip packaginghas now evolved so that 208-pin and 240-pin PQFPs are commonand much higher pin-count devices are possible with ball-gridarray packaging. This rapid technology advancement has caughtmany suppliers of PC chips off guard.Some companies find they now need new technology pieces to continuetheir participation in the market. Many companies are scramblingeither to develop or to acquire new technologies just to remaina player.Traditionally, PC chip suppliers were partitioned by the functionalblocks of the PC, i.e., processor companies, memory companies,core-logic companies, and peripheral-chip companies. Thesesuppliers took advantage of advancements in process technologyand in packaging to improve the performance and functionalityof products within their narrow band of expertise.Silicon process technology has advanced more rapidly than performance,however, and functional enhancements have been developed forindividual PC functions. To fill this silicon vacuum, majorfunctional blocks are now being combined in a single device.It's unclear who the winners and losers will be in this siliconconvergence. Will microprocessor companies such as Intel, Cyrix,Advanced Micro Devices, and others absorb much of the PC'sfunction into their products? Intel has tried this with littlesuccess in its SL family of products, which added peripherallogic to the microprocessor die.By pushing the concept of Native Signal Processing, Intel indirectlyis absorbing functions into the processor by enabling softwareto perform traditional peripheral functions such as audio,video, and graphics. Multimedia microprocessor instructionset extensions, i.e., digital-signal-processor-like instructions,now are being planned by most processor suppliers. This isanother example of how the microprocessor camp is claimingmore of the PC's functionality.A more direct example of microprocessor/PC integration is CyrixCorp.'s new CG5x86 chip, which contains a high-performance486 CPU, a memory and cache controller, a Peripheral ComponentInterconnect bridge, and a VGA graphics accelerator with videoprocessing. his chip also has multimedia instruction set enhancementsand a special virtual-processor mode enabling software emulationof legacy I/O devices.Core-logic suppliers are now developing peripheral-chip technologyto integrate into core logic. Several suppliers now providesound functionality and VGA acceleration both as separate chipsand as an integrated part of their core-logic offerings.Peripheral-chip suppliers are also responding by integratingmultiple peripheral functions onto a single chip and by developingcore-logic chip sets.The new NVidia Corp. chip set, for example, integrates VGA acceleration,sound generation and recording, game controller, and 3-D graphicsfunctions. Modem-chip manufacturers have also been quick toadd sound capability to their chips.To achieve true single-chip integration, suppliers need to integrateanalog functions such as phased-lock-loop clock generators,clock and data separators, codecs, ADCs, DACs, and RAMDACsonto their products.Without access to these mixed-signal technologies, true singlechip solutions are not possible. Integrated Circuit Systemsand other companies with expertise in mixed-signal technologiesare also acquiring peripheral-device blocks that are necessaryto compete in this highly integrated converging environment.In the face of the move by traditional suppliers to integrateexisting fixed functional blocks into products, a new approachto integrating PC functionality is being developed. Severalcompanies are developing multimedia processors that they claimare sufficiently powerful to absorb much of the PC's multimediaand peripheral functions into a single multimedia processorchip.Some of these broadband media processors basically are downloadableDSPs with RISC-processor-like enhancements, and have featuresincluding pipelining, superscalar execution, very long wordinstructions, along with partitioned arithmetic logic unitsto better handle graphics and video data types.No approach will totally win. The PC is expanding into so manydifferent application areas that multiple architectures andpartitioning will proliferate. In other words, there is morethan one pie to split. But it is clear that if the traditionalPC chip suppliers are to survive, they will need to acquireor develop more of the pieces of the PC pies.Lewis Eggebrecht is chief scientist for Integrated Circuit SystemsInc., San Jose.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987VLSI: Interconnect's The Thing -- Says Industry Needs DifferentBenchmarksBy:Anthony CataldoSan Mateo, Calif. - For those who still judge a device by itsline width, VLSI Technology Inc. has a message: Why don't youconsider the interconnect?While line width has traditionally been the chief technologyyardstick for ICs, the true test of performance depends largelyon how tightly a vendor can pack the signal lines that transferdata among stacked metal layers, especially for deep submicrondevices, said Robert Payne, chief technology officer for VLSITechnology, San Jose.The problem, Payne feels, is that the industry still hasn'tcaught on. "The modes in which people talk about technologyhave been turned into meaningless marketing hype," Payne said."We need a new way to talk about the technology that is moremeaningful to our customers."He especially takes exception when ASIC vendors boast abouttheir feature size while keeping their metal pitch-the measureof interconnect density-under wraps."Anybody that discloses process technology and doesn't disclosetheir interconnect hasn't disclosed anything," he said. "Forsomeone to claim they are a member of the 0.25-micron generationwhile they have metal pitches that barely qualify them for0.35-micron is ludicrous."If guys were to throw around financial numbers with the samedegree of casual claims, it would land them in court with theSEC," he said. "This isn't harmless marketing mischief."What the industry needs, he said, is a new set of benchmarksfor submicron designs in order to keep everyone honest. Thatmeans putting an end to quoting how many gates can be stuffedon a 4-sq.-cm die area when most customers would dare not toucha chip that large. Furthermore, vendors should quit paddingtheir gate counts by including memory gates, which are moredense than logic gates, he said.Joyce Putscher, analyst at In-Stat Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz.,agreed that there are "new rules" governing process technologyat the deep submicron level."I think [VLSI has] made some valid points," she said. "Theyobviously believe that the industry needs new benchmarks andthey are making a good case for that."But some observers noted that VLSI is also trying to undermineLSI Logic Corp., one of VLSI's chief rivals in cell-based design,a technology that enables ASIC vendors to stitch together differentlogic cores on a single chip. LSI Logic recently announceda 0.25-micron process technology, while VLSI uses a 0.35-micronprocess that it co-developed with Hitachi.Steve Roddy, product manager for LSI Logic, Milpitas, Calif.,agreed that connecting up to five metal layers on a die presentsa fundamental problem for ICs.Though Roddy indicated that LSI's metal pitch for 0.35-micronand 0.25-micron design rules equals or surpasses those fromVLSI, he would not disclose actual specifications. The companydoes share metal-pitch information with its customers, he noted.And though benchmarks may have some usefulness, they only cango so far. More important is how closely an ASIC vendor canwork with the customer, Roddy said."Many of our customers have very extensive questions. We willgo through months-long evaluations with them on the technology."Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987ASML In Deep UV Stepper SetBy:Jack RobertsonWashington - ASM Lithography, Veldhoven, the Netherlands, nextweek will unveil its first deep ultraviolet wafer stepper tojump into the fray for 0.25-micron-resolution systems.ASML joins perennial Japanese lithography rivals Nikon and Canon,which introduced deep UV steppers earlier and are already soldout on quarter-micron systems for 1996.All three use a krypton fluorine 248-nanometer wavelength excimerlaser to achieve the 0.25-micron line geometry resolution.All three use the deep UV illumination with the traditionalstep-and-repeat lithography process.In addition, Nikon has introduced a step-and-scan deep UV machine,which industry sources said has been tested at Intel and isunder evaluation for the 256-Mbit DRAM joint venture of IBM,Toshiba, and Siemens at IBM's facility in East Fishkill, N.Y.Richard George, manager of the ASML deep UV stepper program,said his company will unveil the PAS5500/300 excimer-lasersystem, and claimed it has the industry's fastest processingrate. The system is said to process more than 80 200-mm wafersan hour at quarter-micron resolution.Silicon Valley Group Lithography, Wilton, Conn., uses a mercurylamp for its deep UV step-and-scan Micrascan-II system, whichcan reach 0.3-micron resolution. SVGL claims Micrascan-II canreach quarter-micron line widths for some R&D laboratory processing.The company also is developing an excimer-laser version fora Micrascan-III system for production-level quarter-micronprocessing. No introduction date has been set.Yoshinoir Hariu, international marketing manager for Nikon'sIC and LCD Equipment Division, Tokyo, said lithography suppliershave been surprised by the strong demand for deep UV steppers.Nikon has more than 50 orders for excimer-laser steppers, inundatingproduction, he said."Deliveries are stretched out to 20 months," he said. "AlthoughNikon is expanding its own production as rapidly as possible,we don't see [it] catching up with the big demand for deepUV steppers before 1998."Philip Ware, a U.S. marketing manager for Canon Inc., concurredthat the initial rush of orders for deep UV steppers carriesthe company into 1997.All agreed that just meeting the deep UV stepper demands ofexisting longtime chip-maker customers precludes them fromtaking on new accounts for any significant orders. Nikon'sHariu said it is agonizing to be forced to defer potentialnew customers, "but we must serve our traditional customersfirst."Even with the surge in deep UV stepper orders, the equipmentmakers expect continued strong demand in traditional I-lineoptical steppers. "Deep UV tools will be used for criticalquarter-micron layers of a wafer, which may be only three orfour layers at most. All the remaining noncritical layers willuse I-line steppers. We will be selling as many or more I-steppersas ever, through the turn of the century," said Canon's Ware.Hariu of Nikon agreed. Nikon shipped 450 I-line steppers worldwidein the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, a 50% increase overthe previous fiscal year.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Briefs: MRS Technology Seeks InvestorMRS Technology, Chelmsford, Mass., is seeking an investmentpartner to help fund development of next-generation systems.The maker of flat-panel display lithography steppers said ithad failed to sell a single lithography system in the lastquarter, and hasn't sold a system in the current quarter.MRS has sold its systems to most U.S. flat-panel developers,including AT&T Bell Laboratories, Xerox Palo Alto ResearchPark, the IBM LCD research program at Watson Research Laboratories,OIS Optical Imaging Systems, and Image Quest Technology.Japanese panel makers, however, have largely shunned MRS, insteadbuying lithography systems from Japanese suppliers Nikon andCanon.

Some, however, noteda correction at the end of last year that indicated the seller'smarket of 1995 may be at an end."We've seen a correction in supply and demand that has beenso out of balance for so long," said Michael Benjamin Galinksi,chairman of American II Group, Clearwater, Fla. November wasa particularly hard month for many independents, Galinksi said.His company has had to become more proactive."There were times in 1995 where our sales reps didn't have 10minutes an hour to make an outgoing phone call," he said. "We'rehaving to reverse our strategy a bit and spend more time makingthose outgoing calls."Galinski believes that independents will see consolidation ifthe market becomes more competitive. "There is going to besomewhat of a shakeout in the industry. The strong will surviveand be very profitable, and others who can't compete are goingto get run out of the industry. If you look around, you'llsee a lot of independents scrambling to stay afloat. They'retrying to get into passives, or tantulum capacitors, or crystaloscillators, or even sports memorabilia."Leland Ackerley, vice president of Smith & Associates, Houston,is anticipating a slowdown in 1996. The company saw tremendoussales growth since 1994, but "we have reservations about theclimate for next year. We're not sure how it's going to shakeout."Memory and other commodity products are going to become morereadily available in 1996, Ackerley said. And like Galinski,Ackerley foresees a market that will drive some players out."There are almost an infinite number of independent distributorsright now, many of which have just started in the past year.In the past, when business turns down, the best ones survive."Others maintain there will be enough business to go around,and have higher expectations for 1996. "We see the market continuingto be healthy," said Susan Humerian, general manager of CommodityComponents International Inc., Peabody, Mass. Although leadtimes for power MOSFETs and discretes recently have decreased,"we're still moving a lot of them," she said.For microprocessors, price and margin pressure will continue."They are truly a commodity and buyers know the price to thepenny," she said."Obviously [additional fab] capacity will be a factor next year,"Humerian pointed out, "but there's always something that suffers.If suppliers put money into a wafer fab for memory, somethingelse will be short."Universal Integrated Circuits, Carol Stream, Ill., saw businessdrop precipitously at the end of 1995, said president HamiltonRice. "I think it's because of the holiday. People were gearingdown because they manufactured all the stuff they needed. Bythe end of January, things will be gearing up and we'll startseeing the same trends [as last year]."But leftover components following the holiday-related productmanufacturing could be a problem for independents if OEMs dumpthem into the channel.The last few months of 1995 were a boom for Advanced MP Technology,San Clemente, Calif. "We haven't had any setback," said KamranMalek, corporate vice president. Richard Kwartek, vice presidentof sales, expects 1996 to be strong. "Our customers are forecastingtremendous growth in 1996. The economy will be strong: interestrates are going down. Our customers are bullish."But no matter which way the economy goes, Advanced MP is countingon the inherent imperfections of the industry to keep independentsin business. "One major factor is JIT [just-in-time]," Kwarteksaid.

Althoughsales are generally stagnant during the end of the year, priceshave taken more of a beating this time around, he said.A similar situation is taking shape at the San Jose branch ofClassic Components Corp., where the price for a standard 4Mbit has dipped from about $19 to $13 during the past severalmonths."There's a lot more product available and prices have gone downa tad," said Jason Croteau, purchasing agent for Classic, Gardena,Calif.As for the moribund 1-Mbit parts, it is a fire sale. "One-Mbitshave dropped even more because they are becoming marginallyused," said Leo Electronics' Hartmann.Several forces have helped push prices down, although observersdiffer on which should be given the most credit. In general,the quick switch to faster EDO parts, disappointing sales ofWindows 95, a yen-to-dollar exchange rate correction, and overoptimistic PC sales forecasts are commonly cited.The rapid transition to EDO DRAMs was sparked by Intel's introductionof the EDO-compatible Triton chip set, which spurred the SantaClara, Calif., company to buy large volumes of EDO parts foruse in its motherboards. In response, memory vendors shiftedtheir production lines in favor of the faster parts, said JimHandy, analyst at Dataquest Inc., San Jose."Intel is a phenomenally large DRAM consumer," he said. "Whensomebody that major switches over, there's always a hiccup.This is the hiccup."Handy also said DRAM costs have softened recently because suppliersare feeling pressure from customers to reduce prices next quarternow that $1 can again buy more than 100 yen.Others said OEMs have been forced to sell excess DRAM becausesales of Windows 95, which was supposed to cause a surge inmemory upgrades, were not as strong as expected.The price drops are causing anxiety among brokers, who relyheavily on DRAM sales. Recent price drops for flash and cacheRAM devices have made it even more difficult, Hartmann said.That means that Leo Electronics, which garners about 40% ofits sales from DRAMs, will have to delay until next year anydecisions to expand or add staff, Hartmann said."Everyone-even the big boys-are nervous about picking up anyquantities of DRAMs," he said.Brokers said that for now, they can only keep buying DRAMs andhope that prices will not drop any further. There is alreadysome indication that prices are beginning to plateau, theysaid.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC BUYERS' NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 987Almost One-Quarter Of OEMs Sell To IndependentsAlmost one-quarter of the OEMs surveyed by EBN for its annualCustomer Issues In Distribution report said they sell surpluscomponents to nonfranchised or independent distributors.

But productlaunches could be delayed-even scrubbed-if hardware vendors,content developers and policy-makers fail to achieve commonground on thorny intellectual-property issues.Copyright questions notwithstanding, equipment makers are readyinga raft of digital products. Digital TV could debut in the UnitedStates as early as this year, and Japanese companies are alreadypreparing second-generation "combo boxes," marrying digitalvideo-disk playback with other digital functions, for introductionin 1997.Consumer-electronics vendors-left reeling by the home-PC boom,the cutthroat price competition in 32-/64-bit videogame platformsand the reversal of fortune of the cable set-top box-have peggedthis their comeback year.  They've stockpiled an arsenal ofdigital offerings, centering on digital video disk (DVD) playerprototypes, camcorders, VCRs, direct broadcast satellite (DBS)decoders, TVs and even low-cost TV top platforms for surfing theNet story, below)New digital formats and specifications are coming together thatwill allow TVs, disk and tape to "go digital" seemingly simultaneously.Such companies as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., SonyCorp., Philips Electronics, Thomson Multimedia and ToshibaCorp. all hope to ride the digital video wave-primarily onthe DVD platform-to merge products, redefine consumer-devicefeatures and spin off intelligent combo gadgets.Semiconductor executives at SGS-Thomson, VLSI Technology Inc.,LSI Logic Corp. and Motorola Inc. have acknowledged in recentinterviews that they are already competing for design slotsin second-generation combo DVD boxes. The discrete chips thatdebut this year in first-generation standalone DVD models couldbe displaced in 1997 by highly integrated two-chip sets oreven single-chip DVD offerings.The combo box may take a number of forms, merging DVD functionswith a digital satellite decoder, next-generation game platformor digital VCR. "No two DVD product designs we've looked atare alike," said Roger Kozlowski, vice president and technicaldirector of the consumer segment at Motorola SemiconductorProducts Sector.He added that "most consumer companies see DVD as a great opportunityto put their margins back into their business" and are lookingfor ways to prevent DVD from becoming just another low-cost,commodity product.Some DVD-system vendors are designing network-interface-moduleslots into their second-generation boxes that will allow thesystems to function as set-tops based on various networks.Telephone/cable set-top vendors have floated a similar strategyin recent years, albeit without turning around product.Kozlowski, in fact, said many consumer-electronics vendors considerDVD "a vehicle to ruin the set-top business. And Kishore Manghnani,marketing manager of LSI Logic's Consumer Product Division,called DVD "a means to effectively compete against multimediaPCs."Beating the bushesDVD-system vendors are beating the bushes for chip companieswith systems know-how and a range of key building blocks forDVD front and back ends. Those building blocks include opticsinterface chips; demodulation and error correction for thefront end; MPEG-2 video, MPEG-2 audio and AC-3 decoders; andNTSC/PAL encoder chips, with an anti-copy system for the backend.The challenge for silicon vendors is to find solid system partnersfor strategic DVD development. A number of alliances have beenstruck in recent months.Motorola claims to be closely working with three Japanese companiesand to be working on a DVD system design for a U.S.-based company.Jeff Hendy, vice president and general manager of VLSI Technology'sConsumer and Industrial Products Division (San Jose, Calif.),said his company is "currently partnered with two of our digitalsatellite-decoder customers in Japan to provide silicon solutionsfor their first- and second-generation DVD boxes."Sources at LSI Logic would not identify partners but said thatone of the company's Japanese allies will launch a DVD playerbased on its two-chip DVD solution before year's end.Highly integrated DVD system solutions proposed by a varietyof chip companies include designs based on ARM processors,MIPS processors, proprietary digital signal processors (DSPs)and Motorola's Coldfire embedded RISC offering.Property wrangleOne cloud looming over the parade of digital activity is theissue of intellectual-property protection-considered essentialif players, recorders and cameras are to be sold globally.The outcome of delicate negotiations now under way betweenU.S. equipment makers and Hollywood interests over copy-protectionsystems will likely set the parameters for proposed legislation.Proposed changes to U.S. copyright laws contained in a CommerceDepartment white paper have already drawn heavy fire from suchgroups as the Digital Future Coalition and the Electronic IndustriesAssociation (see Nov. 27, page 1). The groups insist that thechanges will stifle innovation and erode "fair use" provisions,which permit limited copying of protected material.EIA officials said last week that the association has joinedthe coalition in opposing proposed copyright changes.Meanwhile, the EIA is in the midst of talks with the MotionPicture Industry Association of America on compromise legislationthat would influence the design of digital recorders. Bothsides declined to elaborate, but the EIA does oppose an anticircumvention provision that would make it illegal to sellproducts that could bypass copy-protection systems. The provisionwould make a whole range of digital consumer products illegal,said the EIA's Gary Shapiro.Several copy-protection schemes are on the table. The Decembercompromise between the two DVD camps included a draft formatfor a copy-protection method, originally proposed by Philips,called the Copy Generation Management System (CGMS). Rob VanEijk, senior program manager of standards and formats at PhilipsKey Modules, said CGMS is a 2-bit code, implemented in thevideo stream, that can specify one of three provisions: nocopying, one copy only or unlimited copies.Besides CGMS, DVD manufacturers have agreed to use Macrovision6.1, the newest version of the anti-copy system developed byMacrovision Corp. (Mountain View, Calif.). Macrovision's approachprevents illegal VCR recording of copy-protected video signals.Macrovision vice president Mark Belinsky said version 6.1 employstwo anti-copy processes-one based on automatic gain controland the other on color stripes.The first relies on a fundamental difference between the automaticgain-control systems employed in TVs and VCRs. By adding brightwhite pulses to the video signal on vertical blanking intervals,the process confuses the VCR's automatic-gain-control circuit,thereby degrading recordings of protected material.The second anti-copy process exploits the fact that while thecolor-burst component of a video signal is used in a TV setonly for subcarrier regeneration, in a VCR it is also usedfor timebase error correction.By inverting a small number of color bars in each screen, theprocess confuses the VCR's velocity-error-correction system,embedding the color stripes in an illegal copy.Macrovision's anti-copy system can embed the two processes inDVD players and most digital set-top decoders. The Macrovisionwaveform generator is included as part of the NTSC/PAL encoderIC inside a DVD or a digital set-top box.Currently, 10 chip companies-including Philips Semiconductors,GEC Plessey Semiconductors and SGS-Thomson Microelectronicsare Macrovision-authorized component suppliers of NTSC/PALencoder chips. System vendors seeking to implement the approachmust license the technology from Macrovision.In Japan, a standards group is preparing to propose CGMS asan international standard, according an Electronic IndustriesAssociation of Japan spokesman.Masakatsu Ueda, a consumer-electronics consultant at CES InternationalCorp., said CGMS works as a "combination of software and hardware,and it could serve [as] a simple and effective copy-protectionsystem."Japanese observers agreed that reaching a consensus on the CGMSspecification is crucial if DVD systems are to reach the marketon schedule. Sony, Toshiba and Matsushita are said to be takingthe lead in working on the copy-protection issue.Copy protection is badly needed not only for the rewritableDVD RAM now under development but also for ROM systems. "Ifcopy protection is not legislated in the United States, thesoftware industry would not release the DVD software at thetime of introduction of the DVD players and DVD drives," aMatsushita manager said.Warren Lieberfarb, president of Warner Home Video Inc. (Burbank,Calif.), said protection schemes will be embedded in nearlyall DVD disks, with the outcome likely to be one-time-onlycopying of audio disks. For video disks, copy protection and,in some cases, parental lockout codes will be added.Many of the parties interested in intellectual-property issuesare expected to come together next week at a forum intendedto identify requirements for technological solutions to digitalcopyright protection. The Interactive Media Association (Annapolis,Md.), with the backing of the U.S. Copyright Office, has beenseeking industry comment since last summer on technology requirementsand has spearheaded the forum."By assembling requirements, we are laying groundwork for solutionsthat balance the needs of content owners fearful of losingcontrol of their intellectual property as well as end usersinterested in fast, inexpensive and legitimate access to information,"said forum organizer Brian Kahin, the association's generalcounsel.Organizers said their goal is to develop a framework for achievinga technology-based intellectual-property-management system.Differing industry practices have slowed licensing of multimediaproducts. Hence, organizers said, access to digital contentwill require automated licensing configured to accommodateuniform resource and user addresses, header descriptors andinteraction between billing and licensing servers."We are looking at definition problems, architecture problemsnot proprietary solutions," Kahin said.Despite those concerns, most leading consumer-electronics manufacturersare champing at the bit to release first-generation DVD productsthis year and to come up with winning formulas for second-generation,combo boxes. Chip vendors, for their part, are being pressuredto work concurrently on several different silicon designs ratherthan on single, simple, standard DVD chip sets.Motorola will supply three or four DVD silicon options, usingits DSP 56009 as a reference platform, said Kozlowski. Thederivatives will provide PCM, AC-3 and MPEG audio-decodingfeatures.Motorola also hopes to keep a high profile in advanced interactiveDVD systems. Kozlowski said the company is developing a singlechip DVD system based on its Coldfire 5200-an embedded 32-bitmini-RISC processor-for a system to be introduced in 1997.The chip will offer error correction, system de-multiplexing,program-elementary-stream decoding, PCM, MPEG audio, MPEG-2video decoding and fairly advanced 3-D graphics capabilities.Leverage siliconDespite the complexity of system-level integration requirements,one blessing for IC vendors is that companies well-versed indigital set-top-box designs can leverage some of their settop silicon technology for DVD products.When comparing a DVD player with any digital set-top or highspeed videogame machine, said LSI Logic's Manghnani, the gutsof the system-microprocessor, source decoder, graphics IC andmemories-remain largely the same. The only difference is inthe channel decoder. "We see DVD as a superset of set-top,"he said.For that superset, LSI Logic is using the company's corewarecapability to integrate a DVD's channel-decoder block intoone chip and the source decoder for another chip based on its32-bit MIPS RISC core. The company's two-chip-set DVD willbe ready for system integration this year, Manghnani promised.SGS-Thomson also is poised to take full advantage of its expertisein the digital set-top decoder market. Armed with its STI3520audio/video MPEG-2 decoder-already available in volume-SGSThomson plans to pitch its ST20 proprietary 32-bit RISC core,PAL/NTSC encoder embedded with the Macrovision anti-copy system,and other link ICs as a chip set in 1996.The company's road map calls for further integration of theback end, as well as development of a highly integrated frontend DVD system for 1997 introduction, said Paul Bromley, SGSThomson's chief of multimedia architectures and corporate strategy.Particularly for front-end system integration, Bromley said,"we will leverage our hard-disk-drive controller experience;mixed-signal, analog/digital design technology; and BiCMOS0.5-micron production capability."SGS-Thomson also has a development program for a completelysoftware-based media processor that would work much like Philips'sTriMedia processor, Bromley disclosed. When available latein 1997, it could serve as a core for flexible DVD-based multimediadevices.Despite similarities between the DVD back ends and digital settop boxes, DVD adds some new wrinkles to keep chip vendorson their toes. For one, DVD must be able to decode both MPEGaudio and AC-3. Chip vendors lacking AC-3 capabilities in theircurrent MPEG-decoder offerings plan quick fixes, based on proprietaryDSPs, for first-generation boxes. But the technical challengefor second-generation chips is "how to optimize the integrationof MPEG-2-level audio with AC-3 most cost-effectively," saidVLSI's Hendy. VLSI is reportedly working on a solution thattightly couples RISC and digital signal processing.Another technical challenge is how to conserve overall memoryat the system level. Because DVD players are the first fullydigital products to handle variable bit rates (VBR) off a disk,the systems must include as much as 3 Mbits of extra memoryfor VBR buffering.SGS-Thomson sources said the company is addressing that issueby developing its back-end DVD architecture to cut the memoryrequired for MPEG-2 decoding to 10.5 Mbits in NTSC and 12 Mbitsin PAL. Thus, when a 16-Mbit synchronous DRAM is used for aDVD system, a minimum of 4 Mbits is available for VBR buffering,an SGS-Thomson spokesman said.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Startup takes tiny vias to packaging marketBy:Ron WilsonSan Jose, Calif. - Prolinx, a two-year-old technology startuphere, has accomplished a unique technology transfer-adaptingfield-programmable gate-array technology to printed-circuitboards and ball-grid-array packages (BGAs)The result could substantially improve the size and performanceof BGAs in the short term and rapidly change the capabilitiesof pc boards over the next few years.But a major improvement in packaging was not on the agenda whenthe company started. "We began in October 1993 with technologypeople who had antifuse experience at Actel Corp.," said Prolinxpresident and CEO Richard Nathan. "Our idea then was to developa programmable antifuse that could be fabricated on a pcb,rather than on a chip. With a sufficiently small pcb antifuse,we could put a programmable via at every point where wirescrossed over each other, and make a fully programmable circuitboard. Unlike companies that were doing programmable interconnectin chips, where speed and cost were serious problems, we intendedto do the antifuses on the circuit board, where they couldbe large enough to have very low resistance, yet could be builtas part of the board-fabrication process."In discussions with prospective customers, Prolinx found lessthan-overwhelming interest in a programmable circuit board.There were potential applications, but they lay on the otherside of a great expanse of missionary work. On the other hand,the very small size of the programmable vias-4 to 8 mils-gotpeople excited."We came to realize that there was a long-term market for theprogrammability of our via," Nathan said. "But there was amuch greater short-term need for any kind of via that was assmall as ours."The initial application Prolinx identified was for pc boardsin such compact systems as pagers and cellular phones. Thecompany quickly recognized that it was far too small to meetthe demand for such circuit boards, however, and chose to exploitthat market by licensing the via technology to pc-board houses.But packaging provided a market that Prolinx could handle directly."Even with 50-mil spacing, the little circuit board that holdsthe die and has the solder bumps on it really stresses laminatetechnology," said Nathan.Under the padsNathan said that Prolinx can do a single-layer board with thevias that fit under the bonding pads. This board holds thedie on one side and the solder bumps on the other side. "Ourgoal is to achieve cost parity with high-pin-count PQFPs [plasticquad flat packs] using laminated packaging BGAs," Nathan said.Prolinx plans this year to begin supplying substrates to BGApackaging vendors and receiving license revenue from pc-boardcompanies. "We intend to be in production with qualified productin the second or third quarter of 1996," Nathan said.The via that makes this possible begins with a photo-imagedor screen-printed hole in the laminate material. The hole nowcan be as small as 4 mils, but Prolinx vice president of engineeringPaul Wu said the company has a road map that would take thehole down to at most 2 mils.The hole is filled with a proprietary material, forming whatProlinx calls a Microfilled Via (MFV). Then, the via is electricallyplaced into a conduction mode, as would be done for an antifuse."Unprogrammed, the via is virtually an open circuit," Nathansaid. "Once programmed, it can be less than 10 m."The fabrication process imposes no restrictions on normal circuitboard techniques, Wu said. Ground planes can be fabricatedover vias for shielding. The vias can be stacked and otherhigh-density or high-frequency techniques can be employed.The small vias are opening another degree of freedom for BGAvendors besides just simplicity, Wu said. "One of the toolswe are developing along with the MFV technology is a packagefor nearly automatic BGA design. You will plug in the parametersof the package and out will come the laminate design for thepackage," said Wu.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882CES to see low-cost Internet box for TVBy:Junko YoshidaLas Vegas - Net surfers can catch the first wave of low-costInternet-access systems this week at the Consumer ElectronicsShow. Several computer and consumer-electronics manufacturersare reportedly working on Internet-access boxes that wouldplug into a TV and sell for under $300.First out of the chute in what could become the vanguard ofa new category of convergence designs is ViewCall America (Norcross,Ga.) and sister company ViewCall Europe (London). Their WEBstersystem is said to give consumers direct access to the Internetand on-line services through their televisions. R.W. Coughlin,director at ViewCall America, noted that the company will privatelydemonstrate the box to predetermined guests in a hotel suiteat CES.Coughlin confirmed that the idea and design-based on the ARMprocessor-come from ViewCall Europe and its investor, JohnBentley. However, Coughlin declined to say who will make theboxes: "We are in the midst of negotiations with a varietyof hardware vendors."Steven Brightfield, worldwide marketing manager for Media BusinessUnit at chip maker GEC Plessey Semiconductors, said, "Thiskind of low- cost Internet box is obviously still in its veryearly days. But we are expecting to see more than a few prototypesat this CES."The notion of bringing the Internet-access capability, withother multimedia on-line services, to low-cost home appliancesis catching fire among consumer-electronics companies in Japan.Their plan is to build game consoles or low-cost set-tops thatwould allow mass consumers to access the Net.Joint ventureLate last fall, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT), SegaEnterprises Ltd., Sony Corp., JVC and Yamaha Corp. establisheda joint venture called GrR HomeNet Corp. in Tokyo. The missionis to provide an on-line multimedia communications servicethat includes not only Internet access but also electronicconferencing, karaoke, videogames, music listening, shoppingand news-all on-line. The service can be received via homePCs, game consoles, TVs and other set-tops."Building low-cost Internet-access boxes-whether it's an additionalfeature to our game consoles or TVs-is not a problem," saida Japanese executive, explaining his company's intention toinvest in the new venture. "We felt that we need to make surethat consumers will be able to get, via this box, a numberof entertainment services besides just Web browsing." Amongthe five investors, Sony is a developer of its 32-bit Playstationgame-console system, while JVC and Yamaha make Sega's 32-bitSaturn game consoles.The GrR HomeNet will have its service up and running aroundmidyear in Japan. Presumably, those who have invested willbe preparing to launch game consoles or other low-cost boxesthat can be connected to the on-line multimedia service.For its part, GEC Plessey has developed an NTSC/PAL encodingchip for a low-cost Internet box that would allow graphics originally created for a VGA screen display-to look sharperon an interlaced TV screen. The chip integrates comb filter,interpolation filter and a raster-to-interlace converter. Brightfieldcould not be reached last week for comment on whether the chipis designed into WEBster box. But he hinted that the chip isdesigned into at least one Internet terminal to be shown atCES.Meanwhile, researchers at Apple Computer are said to be definingtheir version of a low-cost Web box. The company has definedits Pippin system, a sub-$1,000 Macintosh derivative it willpromote to OEMs, including Bandai of Japan, which is preparingan on-line service for Pippin.In addition, General Magic Inc. is believed to be recruitingsenior staff to bolster a plan to ride the Internet-terminalwave by leveraging both its proprietary Telescript agent technologyand Sun Microsystems' Java.Philips Electronics has already launched in the U.K. a CD-interactiveplayer with Internet access. The Dutch giant is also expectedto launch its next-generation CD-I platform this year. By usingSilicon Graphics Inc.'s MIPS-based Magic Carpet chip set, Philips'sadvanced CD-I platform can take advantage of the latest Webtechnologies: VRML, Java and Java-Script, co-defined by SGI,Sun Microsystems and Netscape.Those developments lengthen a list of plans for Internet-accessdevices that already included Oracle and IBM. Database-softwarevendor Oracle (Redwood Shores, Calif.) has said its partnerswill launch in April versions of its Network Computer concept,a $500 terminal that draws its computing power from new Oraclesoftware running on back-end servers.Simple designWhile most of those systems are still in R&D labs, ViewCallwill formally launch WEBster, a menu-driven system, this week.The converted set-top box uses Advanced RISC Machines Ltd.'sARM RISC as its main processor. The system features a simpledesign: one port goes into the phone jack and another intothe TV.While WEBster gets under way this month with a trial at NorthernTelecom, ViewCall is negotiating with content providers forpartnerships. ViewCall has already partnered with U.S. Internetinfrastructure companies Netscape and Sun. And ViewCall's boxwill use the browser developed by Netscape.IBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Beleaguered Avant! rolls ArcCell-XOBy:Richard GoeringSunnyvale, Calif. - Forging ahead in spite of a civil suit fromCadence Design Systems (San Jose, Calif.) and a continuingcriminal investigation, Avant! this week will announce ArcCellXO, a timing-driven layout system for cell-based ICs with upto six layers of metal. Cadence claims that the existing ArcCellproduct and the new ArcCell-XO option both contain its proprietarysource code (see Dec. 11, page 1; Dec. 18, page 1)As an option that adds area-based routing to the basic ArcCellproduct, ArcCell-XO is a significant product move for Avant!,because it places the company in what it calls the "structuredcustom" segment of the cell-based layout market. This fastgrowing niche, currently dominated by Cadence's Cell3 layouttool, includes next-generation microprocessors and complexapplication-specific standard products.But ArcCell-XO is under a potential legal cloud, given thatCadence is seeking an injunction against the sale of both layoutproducts. Although Cadence hopes for an "expedited" requestfor injunctive relief, there are no legal barriers to the saleof these products today, and no sign of any imminent civilor criminal actions.Moreover, Cadence maintains that Avant! is waging a "continuedpublic disinformation campaign" by making false claims aboutCell3. Cadence representatives said that Cell3 has completedhundreds of five- and six-layer designs, and that it alreadyhas several advantages claimed by Avant!, such as a hierarchicaldatabase and all-path timing-driven layout.Avant!, for its part, is continuing a "business as usual" stance,and has provided customer testimonials for ArcCell-XO fromAlcatel and Matsushita. The company revealed that it intendsto announce a floor planner in early 1996 and an embedded-arrayplacement and routing tool in mid-1996, all using the samedatabase as ArcCell.Conflicting claimsThe Dec. 5 police search was carried out by the Santa ClaraCounty district attorney's high-tech crime unit. One day later,Cadence filed a civil suit against Avant!, alleging copyrightinfringement, unfair competition, misappropriation of tradesecrets, conspiracy, breach of contract and false advertising.Avant! subsequently announced its intent to file a countersuitagainst Cadence.Of particular relevance to the ArcCell-XO introduction is anaffidavit in the Cadence civil suit from Michael LaBouff, directorof corporate CAD at Cypress Semiconductor, saying that he hadfound 4,000 matching character strings between ArcCell-XO andCell3. "I am convinced the ArcSys product contains Cadenceproprietary information," he wrote.Chi-Ping Hsu, vice president for product management at Avant!,said there could be many other explanations for matching characterstrings. He said that many IC CAD programs use public-domainsoftware from programs such as Timberwolf, and that most EDAsoftware uses the same license manager. "Even if you compareSynopsys software against our software, you will see matchingcharacter strings," Hsu said.Throughout the controversy, Avant! has maintained its innocence,and insisted that the Cadence suit was driven by that vendor'sloss of market share and technology leadership to Avant!.The most significant aspect of ArcCell-XO is its addition ofarea-based routing to Avant!'s repertoire. Channel-based routing,available in ArcCell-BV (Basic Version), interconnects signalpins lined up in rows. Area-based routing, in contrast, interconnectssignal pins throughout the die without any such restrictions.The big advantage of area routers is their ability to handlemore than three layers of interconnect. According to Gary Smith,analyst at Dataquest Inc. (San Jose), chips with four, fiveand six layers of metal are just starting to appear, but they'llbecome more and more prevalent over the next year or two. Forthis reason, Cadence, Silicon Valley Research and Compass DesignAutomation have all introduced area-based routers.But area-based routers are generally harder to use than channelbased routers, and 100 percent completion can't be guaranteed.However, Avant! foresees a gradual transition to the new technology.Because the transition is expected to be gradual, customerscan use ArcCell-BV and ArcCell-XO in tandem. ArcCell-XO requiresthe basic ArcCell product and uses the same hierarchical database.A technology that accompanies area-based routing is quadraticplacement. Contrasted to simulated-annealing technology, whichtakes a probabilistic approach, quadratic placement solvessparse linear equations in order to find a globally optimalsolution. Cadence's QPlace product and ArcCell-XO both offerquadratic placement.Since several vendors now offer quadratic placement and multilayer,area-based routing, Avant! is taking pains to portray ArcCellXO as a technically superior solution. The company's entirecompetitive focus seems to be aimed at Cell3, which both Avant!and Cadence identify as the dominant tool in the structuredcustom cell-based market.One argument is hierarchy. "Cell3 is area-based, but it doesn'thave any concept of hierarchy in the database," said ErachDesai, Avant! member of business staff. "It can just supportbottom-up design, while we can go top-down and bottom-up. Wecan dive into hierarchical blocks and generate a complete RCtree, while other tools will stop at the boundary of the macro."Not so, responded Tom Katsioulas, director of marketing forplacement and routing at Cadence. "We have a hierarchical databasethrough Preview [floor planner] and Cell3. It allows you topartition the logical hierarchy and at the same time do physicalpartitioning."Avant! also claims uniqueness through its ability to put constraintson every path, using "slack-graph" representations. That'salready present in ArcCell-BV but is especially important forarea routing, Desai said. He claimed that run-time overheadis no more than 30 percent with constraints on every path.Katsioulas, however, said that Cell3 has had an all-path, slackbased timing capability for over a year, and that customerbenchmarks have shown "identical" run times compared with ArcCell.One argument Katsioulas couldn't counter is that Cadence productssuch as Cell Ensemble, Cell3 and Preview use different databases.Avant! views its single database as a competitive advantage.Avant! claims a closer link to Synopsys synthesis tools becauseit can directly read Synopsys timing models. "We do the sameand we think we do a little better, because we do it at thefloor-planning level," said Katsioulas.Quadratic placementDesai also said that Avant!'s quadratic placement technologyis a "third generation" version of the public-domain technologythat formed the basis of Cadence's QPlace. He said that ArcCellXO, unlike QPlace, supports congestion optimization. But Katsioulasargued that Cadence has significantly enhanced its own quadraticplacement technology, and he said that QPlace now supportsglobal and local congestion optimization.Minimizing die size is the most pressing customer concern, andAvant! is armed with customer benchmarks that claim area advantagesof 7 to 18 percent over Cell3. Katsioulas, however, claimedthat "Cell3 has never lost a technical benchmark to ArcCell."ArcCell-XO is available now on Unix platforms as an option toArcCell-BV, starting as a $165,000 upgrade.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Employers across the board will be hiring big-time this year-- Job outlook for '96 best everBy:Robert BellingerWow! What a year for landing a job in the electronics industry.No, not 1995; we're talking 1996.While "1995 was a phenomenal year for the industry," said DanSpencer, principal at Spencer Search (Austin, Texas), whichspecializes in the semiconductor field, 1996 "has the potentialto be even better."Employers in semiconductors, communications and computers eachbrought on hundreds, even thousands, of EEs, software engineers,ASIC designers and RF experts last year. And employers aretelling recruiters-and EE Times-they intend to bring on stillmore.Patrick Murphy, who specializes in IC recruiting for TechnicalEmployment Consultants, said 1995 "was as good as it's everbeen, and 1996 will get better. Everyone's making money. Idon't see it stopping soon."Semiconductor CEOs have told Spencer they are very bullish about1996. Virtually all need at least 100 engineers, and the biggestplayers talk in the thousands.This is creating some fabulous news for engineers, though itcould prove costly for the employers. Signing bonuses are nowpart of many hiring packages.An RF engineer with three to five years of experience underhis or her belt might get an initial $3,000 to $7,000 uponsigning, Spencer said. And he just placed a general managerof a $100-million division into a job that came with a $35,000signing bonus. Many packages come with stock options and otherincentives. That's how competitive the market has gotten.Spencer has listings ranging from DSP design engineers to CADdevelopment managers to ASIC design engineers to layout engineers.Depending on the job and the title, of course, senior salariescan routinely hit $80,000 to $100,000.Said Technical Consultants' Murphy: "Companies are doing whatthey have to."Quite a turnaround from the early and mid-1990s.Recruitment managers admit that the surge of hiring in 1995caught them with their guard down."We thought it would be very active," said Intel's CharlotteWells. "But it was more active than we anticipated." Intelbrought on 10,000 people in 1995. And though Wells hasn't setany hiring estimate in stone for '96, "it feels like we'llhave a similar year."Katherine Fairbanks, staffing manager for Altera Corp., theprogrammable-logic vendor, said corporations understand thatthe "candidate pool is getting narrower and narrower. It'sa very, very competitive job market. It's getting tough tofind the number of people they need." Companies are resortingto international hiring, expanded college recruitment and "creative"lures to attract qualified people.Following are openings in the chip arena.Intel"The greatest need is in manufacturing, for wafer fab, assemblingtesting, and in board manufacturing," said Wells. Intel isexpanding its Rio Rancho, N.M., fab, opening another facilityin Washington state and needs to backfill at other sites.Circuit design is another very active area. "There's lots ofneed," said Wells, for engineers with chip-set, logic, architecturaland circuit-design backgrounds. Asked about skills sets andexperience levels, she added simply that Intel seeks people"across the board," including fresh college graduates.Software people with computer-science and computer-engineeringbackgrounds are also in demand at Intel. In addition to openingsin Oregon, Intel has software positions in Sacramento and theValley.XilinxProgrammable-logic developer Xilinx plans to hire 400 peoplein 1996, including some 260 engineers and software people,said Ray Madorin, vice president of human resources."It's pretty robust" on the hiring front today, he added.Right now, Xilinx has about 100 open requisitions, of which65 are for technical people. The corporation, which has experienced40 percent annual growth for the past 11 years, seeks BS/MSEEs and computer-science people typically with four to sixyears of experience. Xilinx looks at higher levels of experienceas well. "If they have experience in programmable logic, that'sgravy," said Madorin. Xilinx would like to see people who designedFPGAs or at least worked extensively with them, who have CC++ and synthesis.AlteraOne reflection of the hiring boom at Altera is the expansionof the recruitment staff. At the beginning of 1995, three peoplehandled recruitment; today, 16 people, including outside contractors,are scouring the country for qualified, experienced BSEEs andcomputer-science people, as well as college graduates.Staffing manager Fairbanks estimates that Altera will hire 400people throughout 1996, some 300 of them engineers and technicalpeople. That's a substantial task for a company of 850 employees.The positions open now, and over the next 12 months, includesoftware, design, device, product and applications engineers.There are also needs for managers.Design engineers should have five years' experience in highspeed CMOS design and some exposure to PLD and FPGA design.Software engineers should know C++ and have some backgroundin Unix.CyrixCyrix staffing director Margaret Quinn said she has 50 openrequisitions now for engineers in all different areas of theRichardson, Texas-based company.Cyrix thinks its small size-only 400 people compared with thevastly larger competitor, Intel-is an advantage.Senior engineering vice president Kevin McDonough said thatengineers who've been on 300-person design teams find theirroles restricted and narrowed. They enjoy the challenge ofjoining a company where the latest M1-6X86 team never got higherthan 30 people, requiring everyone to take on multiple tasks.Generally, Cyrix looks for engineers with three to 10 years'experience, especially ones who've been doing transistor-levelcustom design and who have been working at the high-MHz level.C and some Unix exposure are welcomed. Engineers with designverification, circuit, logic design and ASIC backgrounds alsocan apply.Texas InstrumentsThe semiconductor group of Texas Instruments anticipates hiringmore than 500 experienced engineers and computer-science peoplein the next year. James Mitchell, staffing director, describesthe hiring environment as a "bit more aggressive" this yearover 1995, which was a very good year.TI doesn't see a letup ahead, either, even though the semiconductorindustry is traditionally cyclical. "We're betting on timesbeing good a lot longer," said Mitchell. "We're cautiouslyoptimistic."One difference between 1995 and 1996 is that TI's other divisionsare doing so well that Mitchell won't be able to draw as manyinternal transfers as previously. All the major groups-software,systems and personal products-are hiring in 1996.In demand in the semiconductor sector, of course, are EEs withDSP experience. Texas Instruments is a digital-signal-processingpioneer and continues to hire in this arena. "The whole worldis hiring RF and wireless engineers," Mitchell said, and "TIis no exception." Any RF/wireless engineer who seeks a lowercost of living might check out the Dallas area, he added. Thecost of living index is as much as 40 points below that ofSilicon Valley.IBM MicroelectronicsAt IBM Microelectronics, "this will be the most significanthiring year since the late 1980s," said Jack Sinnott, vicepresident of human resources.While 1995 was a good year, "our needs are even greater in 1996,"he added. IBM Microelectronics plans to add 450 to 500 engineers,about 200 technicians and 1,000 production people. About 25to 30 percent of the hires will be experienced people, mostlyfor positions as product engineers, semiconductor engineersand marketing and sales. Within those areas, demand is highfor experienced engineers in applications, logic, system architectureand manufacturing and equipment engineering.Ground was broken on a joint-venture fab in Manassas, Va.

Company representativeswould not comment but did not deny the reports.The company presumably will market the VeriBest line of synthesis,Verilog simulation and pc-board CAD tools sold by the IntergraphElectronics division. Headquarters is expected to be in Boulder,Colo. and be mostly owned by Intergraph.A separate company will provide more independence and autonomyfor Intergraph's EDA software business, which is a small portionof its total revenue. In 1994, according to Intergraph sources,EDA software generated $28 million in revenue, while IntergraphCorp. totaled about $1 billion.Dataquest analyst Gary Smith said that Intergraph has been consideringsuch a spinoff about a year. While the company has had a rockyhistory in EDA, that sector performed well in 1995, Smith noted.One of the company's strengths is its recent emphasis on WindowsNT and on "scalable" software that runs across different hardwareplatforms.Intergraph sells both hardware and software and provides architecturaland mechanical CAD solutions.

Thus, likethe Concurrent offering, the new FPGAs are not only SRAM-basedbut also reconfigurable on the fly. This means, for instance,that a processing pipeline can be reconfigured as data movesthrough it, permitting one chip to implement various processingelements at different stages in a task. The Concurrent FPGAswere also unusually rich in flip-flops and next-neighbor interconnect,adapting them to very efficient implementation of pipelines.IBM is believed to have preserved this feature.The first IBM offering, which is now in beta release, is reportedlya 16,000-gate device with an unusually high 448 signal I/Opins. It comes in an IBM 624-pin plastic BGA.Sources indicated that IBM has used basic concepts from theConcurrent architecture but made important changes to the implementation,increasing the I/O capability.The company plans to reach full production this year.

Ltd. has developed an optical pickupfor digital video disks (DVDs) that can read both compact andDVD disks. An LCD shutter changes the numerical aperture (NA)for backward compatibility with the CD standard.Sanyo offers yet another approach to backward compatibilityfrom the 4.7-Gbyte DVDs to the 640-Mbyte compact disks. Earlier,Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said it would employ a hologramenhanced pickup to ensure backward compatibility and Toshibasaid it would use two pickups that could be electronicallyswitched depending on whether a DVD or CD disk was in the playeror drive.Sanyo uses a 635-nm laser with 5-mW power, with a numericalaperture of 0.6, to focus on the DVD disk. Sanyo will samplein March and go to volume production in August.When it reads a CD disk, the pickup physically moves 0.2 mmcloser to the disk, and the LCD shutter behind the lens sharpensthe focus by trimming the outer edges of the beam. At thatpoint, the NA changes to 0.35 and the laser power at the surfaceis reduced to about one-third, said Tateo Toyama, general managerof Sanyo R&D.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Late News: Intel pulls back on 486 CPUsChandler, Ariz. - Essentially withdrawing from the 486 CPU personalcomputer business, Intel Corp. announced last week that itwas transferring that product family to its embedded-computinggroup here.

While initialapplications will concentrate on cordless phones based on CT1 technologies, Wireless Logic is putting a heavy emphasison CES, rather than a cellular-telephone or PCS show, becauseof the broad range of applications for its chip set and itslow-cost, high-volume orientation.In simplex mode, the set could be used for simple one-way functionssuch as baby monitors and cordless speakers. In duplex mode,the set is appropriate for everything from higher-performancecordless phones to wireless PBXs.But Wireless Logic defies some industry wisdom by sticking withanalog-cordless telephony, improving performance with directsequence spread-spectrum radio methods, rather than movingdirectly to a digital-cordless architecture. The company alsohas elected to perform despreading at RF frequencies, ratherthan at baseband, as in common spread-spectrum designs.In fact, most features in the WL9009 chip set have been optimizedfor a high-volume, low-cost alternative to the 40- to 49-MHzbands currently used for analog cordless phones, by movingto the FCC's unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical(ISM) bands.John Lee, founder and president of Wireless Logic, said thathe became familiar with several Asian OEMs in the late 1980sand early '90s, while developing digital telephone-answeringdevices for DSP Group.OEM invitation"It was at the invitation of many of these same OEMs that Imoved in this direction with the spread-spectrum technology,"Lee said. The company designed a microcontroller/DSP devicefor modulation and developed an RF device with unprecedentedprocess-gain specs.The vice president of engineering, Dan Babitch, came from TrimbleNavigation to put together an RF design team that Lee describedas "second to none."In early December, Wireless Logic brought in Andy Varadi, founderof Sierra Semiconductor and Sierra Wireless, as a board memberand executive vice president. Varadi said he has been exploringa full 3-kHz voice channel in cordless telephones for its datatransfer characteristics. Unlike vocoder compression used incellular phones, the Wireless Logic spread-spectrum radio preservesthe full-frequency channel of a wire-line analog phone."Once you have a genuine 3-kHz voice channel, you can thinkabout using regular wireline modems, with add-in cards or portablemotherboards incorporating something to take you from the notebookPC port to the wireline base station," Varadi said. Lee saidthat a major computer corporation, which he said he was notpermitted to identify, had just signed a development pact withWireless Logic to explore that application of the technology.Varadi cautioned, however, that the company's first goal wouldbe to offer a broad range of chip sets and design servicesfor cordless markets.

The products willdebut here this week at the Consumer Electronics Show.The application-specific subsystems, based on AT&T's DSP 160Xdigital signal processors, are claimed to offer consumer-electronicsmanufacturers improved sound quality and flexibility, as wellas enhanced storage time and faster time-to-market.The new DSP telephone-answering devices support such storagedevices as audio-grade RAMs (ARAMs) and NOR- and NAND-typeflash memories. AT&T has also added RCELP-a next-generation,lower-bit-rate speech coder-and will provide support for nearfull- and full-duplex speaker phones.Digitizing the telephone-answering function enables consumerelectronics developers to "improve the sound quality, suckmore features into the system and simplify the system designby further integration," said Ken Brizel, manager of microelectronicsconsumer marketing at AT&T Microelectronics.Brizel said system vendors increasingly expect silicon vendorsto anticipate system advancements by paving the way to highersystem integration, building more features into subsystemsand addressing nascent system applications before the demandfor them is clear. He said silicon vendors must provide a broadselection of features from which systems companies can choose.Brizel asserted that the DSP1605-based products offer a levelof flexibility "that cannot be seen in other chip vendors'offerings," including the support ARAM grades A through D.In addition to the NOR-type flash-memory support introduceda year ago, the new solutions extend flash support to suchNAND devices as the 4- and 8-Mbit flash offerings of Samsungand Toshiba/National Semiconductor (in each case, the 8-Mbitflash comprises two 4-Mbit devices)AT&T Microelectronics is also providing a host of system applicationssoftware, including CELP+ and RCELP speech coders. The latter,lower-bit-rate coder typically enables telephone-answeringdevices to expand storage time from 16 to 27 minutes withoutsacrificing speech quality, Brizel said.Speakerphone capabilities have also been added, with both nearfull- and full-duplex operation supported. The near-full-duplexspeakerphone "offers better sound quality than conventional,analog-switch speakerphones by suppressing a person's talkingwhen another breaks into the conversation," Brizel said. Thefull-duplex mode offers a "wide-open, digital switch qualitywhere one person can yell back to the other person's yelling."Other features include variable-speed playback, which can slowdown messages without changing the tone quality, and fast forwardand rewind.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882JVC to bring $2,200 camera to consumer show -- Digital videoVegas-boundBy:David LammersTokyo - Japan's consumer-electronics companies, buoyed by strongdemand at home, will bring digital video cameras to the WinterConsumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. But doubtspersist about how many people in North America will spend morethan $2,000 for the acknowledged superior quality of digitalvideo.JVC set out to make its digital video camera smaller, and thedesign engineers there succeeded in creating the latest testamentto Japan's genius at miniaturization. While the digital videocameras from Sony, Matsushita Electric and Sharp are lightand easy to carry, some are nearly as large as the early analogcamcorder models that were hoisted onto the shoulder.Taking advantage of the matchbox size of the 60-minute MiniDV cassette, JVC engineers built a video camera that weighsbut a single pound and is no bigger than a paperback novel.Two six-layer pc boards hold 1,005 components, and the zoomlens weighs only 1.925 ounces.One-hand operationWith its light weight and vertical design, the JVC unit canbe held and operated with one hand (image-stabilization circuitryis built in), and the company's marketers believe businesspeople will use the camera as a "digital notebook" to recordmeetings. It costs $2,200 and goes on sale in the United Statesin April.Since appearing on the market last autumn, digital video camerashave appealed because they deliver superior images and pulsecode-modulation audio, with 500 lines of resolution, bettercolors and digital reduction of signal noise.However, these first-generation systems output video to a television,not to a computer. Sony included a "digital out/in" port ona $4,000 model, but the other digital video cameras do noteasily connect to a personal computer. That will come later,after the 55-member DVC consortium finishes its work on howthe IEEE's "1394" standard serial interface will be incorporated.Until the 1394 standard is agreed upon, moving digital videoclips to a PC requires an A/V capture board.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882SRAM player aims at embedded DRAM graphicsBy:Ron WilsonSan Jose, Calif. - Alliance Semiconductor Corp. will draw onits earnings in cache SRAM, its ownership in a new United MicroelectronicsCorp. (UMC) fab and its foothold in the graphics-acceleratormarket to embark on an embedded DRAM program, the company saidlast week."We believe that we are now number four in the personal-computergraphics business, leading the pack that follows after S3,Cirrus Logic and Trident," said Alliance vice president ofmarketing Sid Agrawal. "We intend to be one of the top twocompanies in graphics by 1998. To do that, we will combineour DRAM-design and graphics-chip-design expertise."Alliance comes by its DRAM expertise from its beginnings asa DRAM design house, providing engineering to NMB Semiconductorand acting as a fabless DRAM vendor itself. As the DRAM markettightened, Alliance moved on to the fast SRAM business, wherethe growth in demand has taken the company into the $200 millionrange for 1995.Ironically, the company's strategy will now take it back intoDRAMs. "We already have prototype high-density DRAMs in house,"Agrawal said. "We will be a full participant in the marketagain by the second half of 1996."New designAlliance is relying on a new design that Agrawal said has avery compact die relative to that of the DRAM giants. The companyalso has capacity. Alliance owns a substantial portion of theoutput of one of the 0.35-micron, 8-inch CMOS fabs under constructionat UMC. This output will be used primarily for DRAM-based products,which UMC will also have the right to manufacture and sell.The fab comes on-line in late 1997.But the company is not planning just to beat its head againstthe commodity DRAM market. "We don't intend to ignore the massmain-memory market-that is where the innovation gets driven,"Agrawal said."We see ourselves getting market share quickly with this integratedapproach," Agrawal said. "We already have a prototype highdensity DRAM. It is a relatively small matter to pull off halfthe DRAM and put on logic. There are other key issues, suchas embedding testability in the logic, that we are workingon."At least one corporate relationship will exploit the embeddedDRAM technology as soon as possible. That is Alliance's technicalcooperation agreement with 3Dfx Interactive Inc. The lattercompany recently announced its multichip, but high-speed, 3D rendering engine. Currently, the 3Dfx VooDoo Graphics chipset requires three separate frame-buffer memories-one for graphics,one for 3-D triangles and one for Z-buffer and texture-mapdata. The separation of the memories is brought about by, amongother things, the very high bandwidth demands the chip setplaces on the frame buffers.Embedded DRAM, which can supply hundreds or thousands of bitsto the logic in each cycle, could eliminate the bandwidth problems,permitting 3Dfx to operate from a single on-chip DRAM and perhapsa slower external memory.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882DSP solutions for videoconferencing readiedBy:Ashok BindraHouston - Texas Instruments Inc. has expanded a relationshipwith Precision Digital Images (PDI) and IAT A.G. to securean early foothold in the videoconferencing market. The partnersplan to pool their hardware and software expertise to generatelow-cost, TMS320C8X-based digital signal-processing subsystemsfor desktop PCs and videophones.A reference-design platform and a manufacturing kit are beingreadied based on a five-chip set that includes TI's C8X DSPand supports the H.320/H.324 videoconferencing standards. TIplans a midyear release for the offering.Rick Rinehart, multimedia-DSP program manager for TI's SemiconductorGroup, said that the approach "will allow us to participatein a big way when the videoconferencing market ramps up thisyear" and will provide OEMs a low-cost path to market entry.TI is also working with a major consumer-electronics manufacturerin Japan that plans to introduce a C82-based low-cost videophonefor POTS (plain-old telephone service) applications by year'send.A recent teleconferencing study by Forward Concepts Inc. (Tempe,Ariz.) asserts that the industry is close to achieving theprice levels needed for wide-scale acceptance of videoconferencing.The study predicts that desktop videoconferencing will lograpid gains starting this year and grow at an average annualrate of 68.3 percent.The report also looks at all the major communications optionsand concludes that H.324/POTS users will dominate the videoconferencingmarket.ITU standards are being adopted worldwide to provide acceptableinteroperability, Forward Concepts president Will Strauss said,adding that improvements in the price/performance ratio areproviding the momentum needed to drive videoconferencing intothe mainstream.Such other communication pipelines as LANs, ISDN and cable TVwill also experience rapid growth in the next couple of years,according to the report, which was coauthored by marketingconsultant Andrew Davis (Southborough, Mass.)The first solution to come from the partners will be based onthe C80 and will be aimed at Integrated Services Digital Network(ISDN) implementations. That product will be followed by aC82-based approach for the POTS market. Next up will be a lowcost offering for basic-rate ISDN.The five chips used in the hardware design include the C8x,a video-capture chip, an ISDN interface or modem chip, a PDIdeveloped Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) interfaceand memory controller, and a 16-bit codec.PDI (Redmond, Wash.) is developing the PCI-based reference designas well as the hardware engine, incorporating the five-chipset, memory and software drivers. PDI president Wayne Smithsaid that his company is "matching its strength with TI's tocreate next-generation PC videoconferencing products."IAT (Bremen, Switzerland) will contribute Windows applicationsoftware libraries based on H.320/H.324 videoconferencing specifications.TI also will field a manufacturing kit, which will incorporateall the hardware and software needed to implement the subsystemdesign in an OEM system.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Sun Micro posts bright future for the InternetBy:Larry LangeMountain View, Calif. - Sun Microsystems has posted on its Website a comprehensive study on the future of the Internet, andthe results are sweeping-predicting nearly 197 million sitesby 2005 with revenue of $185 billion.Sun is both a pioneer and current leader of Internet technology.In fact, Bill Joy, now head of the Java program at Sun, alsocollaborated on Berkeley Unix in the 1970s, an early Internetplatform. Posted in the company's "electronic magazine," calledSunWorld, the report says growth will come in three distinct"waves," exponentially increasing the bandwidth and populationof the Internet. London-based research group Ovum Ltd. conductedthe study.The first wave predicted will continue to use existing switchedtelephony networks and run at data rates of up to 28 kbitssecond. "Currently in use for e-mail, the telephone networkcan handle still images fairly well, but it will become overloadedin the next two years as video and voice-processing applicationsbecome more widespread," state the report's authors, John Moroneyand John Matthews. The second wave, estimated to start in 1997,will add ISDN technology to provide low-quality moving imagesand faster connect times. "But even at 64 Mbits/s, a high-qualitystill image will take three seconds to be transmitted," theyadd.Third waveFinally, the third wave, which is estimated to start in 1998,will feature broadband capacity at 2 Mbits/s and above, toprovide broadcast-quality moving pictures and high-speed LANinterconnections. Further broken down, wave 3a will provideone-way high-bandwidth services, mainly to consumers usinga high-speed (better than 1.5 Mbits/s) link from the serviceprovider; a second link-a 64-kbit/s return channel-will connectto a set-top box, which by 1998 will cost less than $300. Then,around 2002, wave 3b will usher in two-way broadband connectivity.Both network providers and content providers will shape theInternet, the report says. The network providers will developfrom today's telephone and cable-TV companies. The telecommunicationscompanies already benefit from trends in the first two waves(e-mail and low-level video-image transmission), but thereis pressure to build broadband networks to ready themselvesfor the third wave.The content companies will emerge from existing publishers,entertainment companies and educational establishments. Contentproviders stand to win the most, with 65 percent of revenueflowing to them by 2002. "The remaining 35 percent must besufficient to cover the infrastructure cost incurred by thenetwork operators to deploy wave 3, or they will roll out theinfrastructure in a slow and patchy manner," the authors say.By 2005, nearly 197 million sites, either homes or commercialoffices, will be connected. Commercial users will provide mostof the funds, but domestic users will form the largest groupon the wave 3a developments.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Japan pushes 12-in. waferBy:David LammersTokyo - A handful of Japanese IC manufacturers this year willlay the groundwork for the shift to 300-mm (12-inch) wafers,a move that will more than double the dice yield per wafer.But doubts persist that the wafer-manufacturing industry, alreadycapacity-strained on the current, 200-mm (8-inch) generation,will be able to turn out sufficient quantities of the largerwafers to satisfy commercial requirements.NEC Corp., for one, is undaunted. Senior vice president YuichiHaneta said the company is building a pilot line for test productionof 1-Gbit DRAMs on 12-inch wafers. The $500 million SagamiharaULSI Center will begin processing in 1997, using e-beam andexcimer laser lithography to fabricate 1-Gbit DRAMs in a 0.18micron process."My target is to begin commercial production in 1998 or 1999with 300-mm wafers for 256-Mbit DRAMs," Haneta said. His boss,NEC executive vice president Hajime Sasaki, claimed to be "moreconservative. My target is not 1998, but 1999, and even thatdepends on having space at NEC Kyushu at that time."Moto's plansMotorola Inc. has stuck by its announced plans to use the largerwafers for microprocessor fabrication by mid-1998. And at theSemicon Japan show last month, Applied Materials executivesshowed a chart claiming that seven IC makers will begin using300-mm wafers for production within 1998. Though none of thecompanies was identified by name, four were identified as Japanbased.Applied demonstrated a "concept" machine at Semicon that processes300-mm wafers with four process modules: chemical vapor deposition(CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD, or sputtering), etchand rapid thermal processing.Wafer manufacturers, for their part, urged caution at Semicon.Frank Robertson, general manager of the International 300-mmInitiative-the formal name of the not-for-profit venture recentlyestablished by five member companies of Sematech Nov.  13, page2)-said a wafer shortage looms this year.  He said the initiativewill propose that a working group be established among device,wafer and equipment manufacturers to deal with the question.Robertson said the original idea of creating a pool of wafersfor use by equipment vendors was nixed by Sematech's boardas "too expensive." Instead, the initiative will encourageregional pools of test wafers for reuse by equipment vendors.Veteran wafer-industry analysts Dan Rose of Rose Associatesrestated his concerns about wafer supplies at Semicon Japan.In a detailed presentation to about 150 industry leaders ata "300-mm wafer summit" organized by Semiconductor Materialsand Equipment International (SEMI), Rose said that wafer supplierslack the money and engineering resources to develop the largerwafer generation because they are still working to improveyields on 8-inch wafers.With a host of 8-inch fabs slated to go up in the next fiveyears, Rose said, the wafer industry will need to increasethe 8-inch wafer supply from 465 million square inches to 2.74billion square inches by 2000. "To simultaneously bring upthe 300-mm generation becomes almost unthinkable," he said.'Too early'Referring to the SEMI target of 1999 for initial commercialproduction, Rose said that "the 300-mm program is five yearstoo early from a funding standpoint. The device makers mustrelease a further tiny fraction of their margins [to wafermanufacturers] to support the wafer supply."Mitsubishi Materials Silicon Corp. chairman Tomosuke Furunoconcurred, arguing that "there should be a 12-year gap betweenthe [cyclical peak] of the 8- and 12-inch wafer generations.Remember, just two years ago we suffered from price cutting,and only now have wafer prices stabilized again."The larger wafers also may require an epitaxial coating, raisingthe price for each wafer to as much as $800 each.Equipment suppliers at the 300-mm wafer summit argued that increasedcapital is already flowing to the wafer suppliers, which areseeing strong profits after a rough five years.But Robertson said device manufacturers need the larger wafersif they are to maximize throughput at new factories, particularlysince skilled manpower to build and operate fabs remains tight.By most estimates, about 2.5 times more dice will fit on thelarger wafers.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882News Briefs: Wacker to increase polysilicon outputTokyo - Polysilicon leader Wacker Chemicals will gradually expandproduction of polycrystalline silicon to about 5,000 tons ayear by 2000.Wacker now produces about 2,400 tons at its Burghausen, Germany,plant. About two-thirds of the output will be supplied to waferproducing subsidiaries Wacker Siltronic GmbH and Wacker SiltronicCorp.

(San Jose, Calif.), both have weighed in withreports that detail a wafer supply-demand mismatch that willextend through the rest of the decade.However, Jim Glaze, vice president of technology at the SemiconductorIndustry Association, questioned whether the shortage scenariosare too linear, i.e., failing to sufficiently take into accountthe ability of the industry to adapt.Too many dummies?Other sources said as many as half of the 8-inch wafers arenow being used as "dummy" wafers for testing new equipmentand process lines. If the industry could cut back on the numberof test wafers, the shortages could be less severe than predicted."We are now experiencing the fastest wafer-production ramp-upin silicon history, with over 80 new 200-mm wafer fabs expectedto be entering production by the end of 1997," said Rose, whohas been following the vagaries of the wafer industry for 25years. "But wafer manufacturers have not yet mastered the technologyof producing 200-mm slices in high volumes with optimum yield."Though the polysilicon supply is increasing, Rose predicts apolysilicon supply shortage last ing four to five years. Dataquestpredicts that a polysilicon shortage would begin to impactsemiconductor companies' operations by the middle or end of1996."The polysilicon shortage is expected to last nine to 10 months,but this shortage should come to an end with the addition ofnew polysilicon market capacity in 1997," Fuhs forecast ina report titled "Is There a Silicon Shortage Looming?"In addition to the polysilicon shortage, Dataquest predictsthat a shortage of 200-mm wafers will begin in 1996 and continuethroughout the decade.Yasumoto Shimizu, who tracks the equipment and materials industriesfor Dataquest Japan, said the eight companies that producemost of the raw polysilicon-including Wacker Chemical, HemlockSemiconductor, MEMC, Advanced Silicon, and Japan-based supplierssuch as Tokuyama, HI-Silicon and Sumitomo Sitix-together willincrease the supply of polysilicon from about 12,000 tons in1995 to about 13,000 tons this year. That rate is not fastenough to forestall shortages beginning next year, he said.Of the 11 major wafer manufacturers, nine are based in Japan,and these Japan-based companies account for about 70 percentof the total supply of wafers, according to the Japan Societyof New Metals.Yields at the various wafer manufacturers-the number of usablewafers cut from the grown ingots-are still increasing for the200-mm wafers now coming into wide use. Rose Associates estimatesthat 200-mm wafer yields per ingot are only 50 to 70 percentthat of the 150-mm (6-inch) wafer generation.Ingot yields notwithstanding, the more basic problem is thatthe production of raw polysilicon is not keeping pace withthe 20 to 40 percent growth rates enjoyed by the IC industryin recent years.Takatoshi Itojima, an analyst at the Yamaichi Research Institute,said the inventory of polysilicon is tightening. "The reservestock of polysilicon at Tokuyama was more than three monthsworth in October 1994, but over the past year it has gone downto two months and is still declining."A source at an industry society that includes all of the Japanbased wafer manufacturers said, "The biggest shortage is notthe wafers themselves, but the polysilicon material. That'swhy the wafer manufacturers cannot make enough wafers to meetthe demand."The source, who asked to remain anonymous, noted that an ICfab can be built in six months, a wafer-production facilitycan be brought on line in a year, but a polysilicon productionline requires a minimum of two years to build."We are investing to increase our wafer-manufacturing capacity,but the commensurate increase in polysilicon capacity is notkeeping pace," said a spokesman at Shin Etsu Handotai Co. Ltd.,the largest wafer supplier. "Some time ago, the wafer and polysiliconmanufacturers recognized the possibility of shortages developing,and have taken some action. But whatever we have done won'tbe enough for the new IC fabs coming on line next year. Forsure, the polysilicon supply will be a serious problem nextyear."Underlying the problem is a history of red ink at both the polysiliconand wafer suppliers. A decade ago, the polysilicon manufacturerswere left with huge stockpiles. Itoshima, who tracks the siliconindustry at Yamaichi Research, said "the polysilicon businessrequires big investments, but it is not very profitable. Afterdemand fell off 10 years ago, the price dropped drastically.At that time, one gram of polysilicon was worth about 10 yen,but now it is worth only 5 yen per gram."The investment required to produce a ton of polysilicon is about$150 million, which directly translates into an investmentof about 15 yen per gram. "Compared to the current price, itis natural that the manufacturers are hesitating to invest,"he said.Because of the tight demand-supply situation, the polysiliconmanufacturers have hiked their prices by 20 percent, from 5yen per gram to about 6 yen per gram. And the three largestmanufacturers are increasing their polysilicon output. Itojimaestimated that Hemlock (a division of Dow-Corning, based inHemlock, Mich.) is making about 2,800 tons a year, while WackerChemical currently is making about 2,400 tons a year. Startingthis month, Tokuyama (based in Yamaguchi, Japan) has expandedits capacity from 1,650 tons per year to 2,000 tons. All threehave plans in place to increase capacity to 3,000 tons peryear over the medium term, he added.However, the production increases by the polysilicon manufacturersare far less than the sharp hikes in demand for silicon wafersrequired by the IC manufacturers. Dataquest estimates thatthe demand for 8-inch wafers increased 112 percent in 1995,and will go up another 72 percent in 1996 and 41 percent in1997. "It is very difficult to decide how much capacity thepolysilicon makers should add. If the expansion is more thanactual demand, it means another period of losses," said Itojima.Sumitomo Sitix and HI-Silicon Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of MitsubishiMaterials Silicon Corp., are producing polysilicon mainly forinternal use. But the other wafer manufacturers are dependenton outside supplies from commercial polysilicon manufacturers.Also, much of the raw polysilicon is wasted. For the 200-mmwafer generation, only 17 percent of the raw polysilicon istransformed into usable wafers, compared with 30 percent forthe 150-mm generation, Rose said.Overall, however, the quick-fix solutions of improving the numberof wafers per ingot, cutting down on polysilicon waste andusing fewer test wafers, can only put a dent in a big problem,analysts said.Tomosuke Furuno, chairman of Mitsubishi Materials Silicon Corp.,noted that the wafer industry was hit by price cuts on 8-inchwafers just two years ago. In the early 1990s, the supply of8-inch wafers exceeded demand, largely because Japan's IC manufacturersdelayed bringing up 8-inch lines-one consequence of the burstingof Japan's financial bubble. The wafer manufacturers that investedheavily in 200-mm wafer capacity suffered financial lossesfor three of the past five years-1991, 1992 and 1993-accordingto the Japan Society of New Metals. Even now, Rose added, Japan'sIC manufacturers are "very reluctant" to pay higher pricesfor 8-inch wafers, while U.S. IC makers have been more willingto pay the higher prices.At a SEMI-sponsored "summit" on the transition to 300-mm wafers,Rose argued that the wafer industry has gotten the short endof the financial stick, investing a relatively high percentageof its revenues in R&D and manufacturing capacity, for relativelylittle financial return.That is changing, with healthy increases for the stock pricesof many of the Japan-based wafer producers, such as MitsubishiMaterials and Shin Etsu Chemical, whose subsidiary Shin EtsuHandotai is the largest wafer producer worldwide. Despite investmentfunds flowing to the wafer makers, Rose said he doubts thatthe wafer industry can increase the supply quickly.A shortage of engineers and other skilled technicians is strainingeveryone, Rose said, and makes it difficult to increase thewafer supply quickly even as the financial prospects of thewafer suppliers improves.Dataquest's Fuhs said that because of the shortage, "the siliconindustry, which has been a historically lower-margin 'industrial'business, will migrate to a business model that more closelyresembles the other segments of the semiconductor ecosystem."However, the prospect of severe shortages are more real forsome companies than others.Hajime Sasaki, in charge of NEC's semiconductor operations,said NEC has long-term supply contracts, and noted that oneof the largest wafer manufacturers, Sumitomo Sitix, is a memberof the same Sumitomo Group as NEC. Though Sumitomo Sitix willnot boost its internal polysilicon supply until early 1997,it plans to increase the supply of 8-inch wafers by 10 percentor more next year, said Shimizu of Dataquest Japan.For the IC manufacturers in Taiwan that plan to open about 15new 8-inch fabs over the next two years, the supply of wafershas been a major concern, sources at the recent Semicon Japanshow said. Formosa Plastics and Komatsu Electronic Metals Corp.are building a wafer-production facility in Taiwan that willbegin production in early 1997, which will increase capacityto about 200,000 8-inch wafers per month over several years.Shin Etsu Handotai also will build a wafer-fabrication facilityin Taiwan this year that will begin production in 1997, thespokesman said.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Viewlogic buys SilerityBy:Richard GoeringMarlboro, Mass. - In a new assault on the ASIC-synthesis marketplace,Viewlogic Systems Inc. has acquired Silerity (Pasadena, Calif.),a startup founded by Carver Mead and David Johannsen. WhenWill Herman, then Silerity president, returned to Viewlogicas chief operating officer early last year, the company saidit would buy Silerity.Viewlogic paid about $5.6 million in cash and payments contingenton future sales. Johannsen and Richard Doherty, another Silerityfounder, are now Viewlogic employees in the High Level Designgroup. Mead, a professor at the California Institute of Technology,will serve on Viewlogic's technical advisory board.Last June Silerity introduced PathBlazer for data path optimization.A supplement to existing synthesis tools, it optimizes datapaths at a high level of abstraction, using process-specifictopology information. Production-quantity shipments are expectedin the third quarter.The ASIC synthesis market is still dominated by Synopsys Inc.(Mountain View, Calif.). In 1994, according to Dataquest, Viewlogichad 6 percent of the synthesis market-but its sales were primarilyin FPGA, said Gary Smith, Dataquest analyst.Smith called PathBlazer a "great compiler" but noted that ASICsynthesis signals a new direction for Viewlogic. One challenge,he said, will be to generate ASIC library support.Herman said Silerity, with five R&D people, has a lot of technology."PathBlazer is the main product right now, but it's only asubset," he added. "Johannsen, Mead and Doherty have been workingon this stuff for four and a half years, and they've got atruckload of really neat physically oriented synthesis technology."Viewlogic, he said, will emphasize physical optimization fordeep-submicron designs.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Yakitori: The digital pictureBy:David LammersTokyo - In 1983, I traveled to Sri Lanka to cover the firstwave of racial violence between the Tamils and Sinhalese. There,I met a Bangkok-based Associated Press photographer named JeffRobbins, who carried a suitcase-sized photo transmitter. (Atcustoms, he said it was his sample case.)Jeff hung a "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door of his hotel room,developed each day's film in the bathroom, and transmittedhis best shots to London or Tokyo. While I was forced to dictatemy copy each night to a grumpy desk editor, Jeff was wiredin, getting front-page play in the big dailies. Our competitorswere really behind the eight ball, being forced to ask returningtourists to hand-carry rolls of Tri-X back to London or Tokyo.Hi-res scannerAkinori Kiribuchi heads the electronic imaging division at NikonCorp., which makes a reasonably priced film scanner. The systemuses a high-resolution line sensor to transform a negativeor positive (slide) film image into a digital file. Nowadays,an AP correspondent going out into the field is likely to carrya Nikon film scanner and a Powerbook.Why not simply carry a digital camera? I asked Jim Palmer, theAP photo editor for Asia. Many digital cameras have fixed wideangle lenses, and the CCD resolution usually is not high enoughfor print reproduction, he replied. Since newspaper editorslike to splash an eye-catching photo across the front page,they need color and millions of pixels.So, most AP photographers shoot color negative film, and theturnaround time isn't bad. By running the film through a portablefilm processor (or taking it to a one-hour photo shop), scanningthe best images into a Powerbook and then transmitting a JPEGcompressed image back to the home office, a photographer inthe field can deliver a digital image with high resolutionin under an hour.Of course, transmitting a compressed image directly from thecamera is faster, and Olympus Optical has a midrange digitalcamera that does just that.Some photojournalists use these digital cameras, which storethe images on flash or SRAM-based memory cards. Nikon makesa high-end digital camera, costing about $11,000, that acceptsthe range of Nikon lenses. However heavy you might find a normalSLR camera, the digital cameras are about double that, andthey cry out for a tripod. One odd sensation is that you canopen the camera back and not ruin your "film."Kiribuchi said that Nikon makes only a few hundred professionaluse digital cameras each month. Surprisingly, the biggest marketoutside of newspapers is research labs, where scientists usethe cameras to document various stages of their work-in-progress.The sales action is at the low end, and Casio has surprisedeveryone with strong sales of its QV-10 digital camera, pricedat only $500 in Japan. Many use it to post low-res images tothe Internet. Casio plans to improve the resolution and tomake the next version in Malaysia, boosting the capacity to70,000 units/month by next summer.Kiribuchi said Nikon plans to come out with a complete lineof sub-$1,000 digital cameras early this year. Until yieldson the CCDs-now in the 10 percent range-improve, digital willhave a hard time competing with silver-halide-based photography,he said. Nevertheless, Nikon predicts that by 2000, about 10percent of PC buyers will also purchase a digital camera, producinga market of more than 10 million cameras. This year will probablybe the one in which digital still cameras add their spice ina big way to the multimedia recipe.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Davic seeks modem specBy:George LeopoldWashington - With work complete on set-top and interactive-TVstandards, the Digital Audio Visual Council (Davic) is shiftinggears to tackle cable modem standards.

The group has scheduleda June meeting in New York to complete the spec.Davic also called for standards proposals for satellite returnchannels, a protocol stack for return channels, wireless modulationschemes, application and system software portability, and securityspecs. Most will be used for Davic 1.1.Another request seeks proposals for 3-D animation, higher- qualityvideo and sound, modulation schemes for terrestrial VHF/ UHF,distributed servers and services, high bandwidth interactiveaudio-visual communication, home networks, content acquisitionand production, and multimedia mobile wireless systems.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Editorial: Copy rightBy:George LeopoldA NEW WAVE OF consumer products built around digital video disktechnology will surface in Las Vegas this week at the ConsumerElectronics Show.

Pity their poor investors/shareholders.The right direction is to install a built-in "turnkey consumerfriendly intelligent Internet browser," which need not relyon the consumer entering URLs. Instead, it would allow theconsumer with an Internet terminal atop his/her TV to entera search string such as, "Show me all the car dealers in theBaltimore area that have used green mini-vans with cloth seatsin stock."URL-driven browsers will be dinosaurs.Good luck, Bill Gates.Ed MeyerPresidentMeyer InternationalIndian Lake, N.Y.On the InternetBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Crosstalk: Immigrants not the issue; job export isIn response to Bob Bellinger's "Professional Pipeline" columntitled "Friends" (see Dec. 11, page 100), I would like to bringto your attention an even greater challenge to the Americanengineering profession: The problem is not the use of immigrantlabor in the United States, but rather the use of high-techlabor overseas, where the wages are even lower. Instead ofhaving capable Americans develop software, companies such asGE and, more recently, the GE-Harris Railway Venture Co. havebeen farming out the software to a consulting company in India.Japan's cost of living is too great, so these Third World countriesare of paramount importance to the American-business greed.For about $17 an hour, the American companies levy the softwarerequirements, and the software gets developed in these sweatshopsoverseas. That not only undercuts the American EE wage butalso is a grim foreboding of the future for American technology.What type of NAFTA agreements apply to software? Surely thisis not fair to the loyal American worker, nor to the IndianEE who is not getting $17/hour-more like $5/hour.Engineers of the late '90s may go the way of the steel workersof the '70s.

I couldn'tbelieve my eyes. The demonstration product was available 10years ago: the Amiga 1000. I know, I suffered through it foryears: high-resolution text on an interlaced screen. No hightech demo is needed; just look at an Amiga 1000 on a good monitor(I used a high-resolution Sony Trinitron monitor) in "hi-res"mode, and you will hate the flicker.

Called active pixel sensors(APS), the devices promise to take electronic imaging to priceperformance levels that could someday leave CCDs in the dust.Eric Fossum, who presented a road map for APS at last month'sIEDM conference, is so confident of the technology's promisethat he's forming a startup to commercialize an APS approachhe has been developing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "Activepixel-sensor technology is highly appropriate as a next-generationcamera technology," Fossum said. "By integrating camera functionswith a light-sensing operation, APS offers far more functionalitythan CCD technology and could lead to a rugged, low-power cameraon a chip."While CCDs enjoyed brief popularity as a specialized memorytype for early VLSI generations, integration and scalabilityissues soon forced the devices out of the running. But thetechnology has long been widely valued for its utility in imagingapplications. When operating purely as an image sensor, CCDchips offer superior low-noise performance and can be manufacturedin standard silicon processes.A single CCD is essentially a MOS transistor, though with anextremely long channel that spans the entire chip. By placinga row of metal gates over the channel, an array-type memorydevice is created. A localized packet of electrons under oneof the gates can be shunted to the next gate via a simple clockingoperation. Thus, charge packets, which could represent bitsin a shift register, can be read out on the side of the chip.When each metal gate stores charge from a phototransistor, thelong MOS transistor can operate as a line in an image. Photonsstriking the silicon generate charge packets proportional tothe light intensity, and a row of the packets can be read outon the side of the imaging chip.Yet, despite its simple architecture and good noise performance,CCD technology has some inherent disadvantages that won't improvemuch with scaling. The charge-transfer operation requires particularlyhigh voltages, leading to high power consumption, and the analogoutput signal requires A/D conversion chips. And because oftheir dimensions, CCDs cannot be integrated with standard CMOSVLSI circuits to achieve the scaling and on-chip processingadvantages of standard IC technology.That is precisely where such newer schemes as APS derive theirleverage.One factor in favor of APS is CMOS technology's high level ofavailable integration. In the current Jet Propulsion Lab design,each pixel packs six transistors, which condition the signaland implement row-column addressing. Because the array of pixelsis essentially a CMOS circuit, additional A/D circuitry canbe incorporated.The approach also opens the door to any other type of digitalprocessing functions available with CMOS. "The sensor is ableto do much more than record an image; it becomes a fully functionalcamera," Fossum said.Most promising for consumer electronics is the low power andruggedness offered by APS cameras. "Because you no longer haveadditional A/D-conversion components and the sensor itselfruns off of standard CMOS power supplies, you get about a factorof 100 reduction in power consumption," said Fossum. As a result,the new chips will be ideal for portable applications. NASAis also eyeing the technology for remote robotic systems, suchas the Mars rover.The one weak point in previous attempts to build a more compatiblesensor technology has been the noise problem. In fact, theattempt to use standard transistors in imaging chips predatesthe CCD.As early as the 1960s, many research projects sought to finda viable imaging approach using standard NMOS, PMOS and bipolartransistors. Those early attempts ran up against noise problems.When the first CCD sensor was devised at Bell Laboratories in1970, it was generally recognized to have satisfactorily solvedthe noise problem. As a result, observed Fossum, "the 1970ssaw a vigorous development of CCD imaging technology and littlework on MOS sensors." He noted that a late-1970s bid by Hitachito develop camcorder MOS sensors eventually succumbed to thenoise problem. Hitachi was forced to modify its sensors withCCD technology to get a viable imaging chip.Remaining work on MOS approaches branched in two directions.One simple method, known as the passive-pixel sensor, addsa FET to the phototransistor to create what is known as a transfergate. Pulsing the transfer gate conducts photo-generated electronsout to a bus. Adding a select transistor enables row-columnaddressing of pixels.While the passive-pixel approach suffers noise problems, itssimplicity has made it valuable in certain applications.Work on the other branch, active pixel sensors, began with therecognition that performance would greatly improve by includinga sense amplifier with each pixel. Fossum, working with a groupat AT&T Bell Laboratories, has achieved the same noise marginsfor his devices as for CCDs.The final improvement that moved APS technology into the CCD'sperformance region, according to Fossum, involved the additionof a CCD-type transfer operation within each pixel.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Neural-net package offers explicit learningBy:R. Colin JohnsonBraunschweig, Germany - Combining the learning ability of neuralnetworks with the if-then rule creation of fuzzy logic, Nefclass(NEuro-Fuzzy CLASSification) sports the advantages of learningwithout the disadvantages of neural networks. The softwarepackage is offered by researchers Detlef Nauck and Rudolf Kruseat the Technical University of Braunschweig and may be freelyused for educational, scientific or personal purposes.Nefclass attacks a fundamental problem of neural learning: Aftera neural network has learned a set of synaptic weights fora problem, its solution is incomprehensible to the trainer.With Nefclass, on the other hand, its trained weights can belinguistically interpreted as fuzzy rules, such as "If thetemperature is very hot, then turn on the air conditioner."Also unlike neural networks, which must be initialized witha random set of weights, Nefclass can be initialized with apremade set of if-then rules-of-thumb, which learning thenfine-tunes."The advantage of incorporating fuzzy logic into our neuralnetwork model is the interpretation of its internal structurein the form of linguistic rules, some of which can be specifiedahead of time," said Nauck. "For instance, sometimes simplerules for extreme cases are known in advance, such as 'If allvalues are small, then it's class X.' "Nefclass fuzzifies the traditional perceptron-style neural networkby learning fuzzy rules directly from raw data. The supervisedlearning method uses a fuzzy version of back-propagation-oferrors. After training, Nefclass classifies patterns into crispsets.Technically, Nefclass is a three-layer back-propagation neuralnetwork specifically designed to apply to the controller domain.By substituting fuzzy rules with weighted antecedents for itsmiddle layer of neurons, Nefclass persuades the neural networkto learn fuzzy rules.Membership functionsCrisp inputs are fuzzified into fuzzy sets by membership functionsthat are usually labeled with linguistic terms-such as small,medium and large. The weighted outputs of the membership functionsserve as the antecedent (if-parts) of the if-then fuzzy ruleson the middle layer of the perceptron.Nauck and Kruse also suggest that partial knowledge about thepatterns to be classified-usually the bane of recognizers-caneasily be encoded in linguistic rules. Learning then resolvesthe incompleteness of partial knowledge during the learningprocess.As a further refinement, weight changes for parameters are acceptedmore readily in the middle of the fuzzy interval (0.5) thanfor those near 0 or 1. "By this, a rule is 'forced to decide'whether it wants to support a pattern or not," Nauck said.Nefclass only allows fuzzy values between 0 and 1, because theycan be interpreted as degrees of support for a rule-from 0percent to 100 percent. Negative values are not allowed, becausethere is no clear linguistic interpretation to a negative weight.Nefclass can also graphically display charts and two-dimensionalprojections of patterns. The package is available for DOS personalcomputers at: http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/~nauck.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Neural simulator harnesses multiprocessorsBy:R. Colin JohnsonErlangen, Germany - Erlangen University has translated intoEnglish its NeuroGraph simulation environment for neural networks,which features plug-in support for fuzzy logic and geneticalgorithms. Unlike monolithic simulators, NeuroGraph was designedfrom the bottom-up for multiprocessing by using separate independentmodules for all functions. Both its data structures and functionlibraries support parallel execution on multiple processorsusing either message-based or shared-memory communicationsschemes."The most unique feature of NeuroGraph is its multiprocessingsupport," said Stuart Bar-On, president of the Parallel PerformanceGroup, which is marketing a commercial version of NeuroGraphin the United States. "If you have access to other workstationson your network, for instance, you can really accelerate neurallearning and other time-consuming tasks by running them onseveral processors simultaneously."Both the learning step during system development and the laterpattern-recognition steps of a finished application can berun in parallel on distributed nets of uniprocessors usingmessage-passing, or on a local multiprocessor. Alternatively,finished applications can be compiled into standard C programsfor sequential execution on most platforms.The main control process within NeuroGraph is its project manager,which responds to user directives by starting, stopping andsupervising all other processes. Every process can be configuredand administered by the user with graphically oriented controlsthat track execution dynamically.Huge netsVery large neural networks are defined with special multipleplacement operators, which clone the user's placement of individualelements as well as create hierarchical structures, such asnetworks. Extremely complex elements can be drawn as 3-D multiplesided surfaces-such as polyhedrons-which can be rotated toreveal their many variable parameters. Built-in folding andzoom functions also assist in the visualization of huge neuralnetworks.Fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms are supported with specialprocesses. The former process permits fuzzy logic to be usedin the definition of any active element. The latter processpermits users to specify evolutionary principles for the optimizationof network topologies.Any element can be tracked dynamically with software sensors.Such sensors connect elements to virtual output devices, suchas line, bar or pie-charts, each displaying the current stateof internal variables in a separate sensor window.Once functions are created for the chosen network topology,all relevant information about the architecture is routed toa master data structure. The project manager can then splitthe execution of the data structure among available processorsin a manner transparent to the user and the application. Acommunications process ensures the synchronization of parallelexecuting functions, under the supervision of the user. Dataexchange among processes can either be performed in a sharedmemory area or with messages passed over any TCP/IP-based network.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882As new media becomes prominent, redundant arrays of independentdisks asked to do more -- RAID designers assault bandwidthBy:Terry CostlowUsers of redundant arrays of independent disks, regardless ofRAID type, are all clamoring for more bandwidth. The demandson RAID are mounting as the technology gains market acceptanceand adapts to changes in the types of data being stored innetworks and other bandwidth-hungry environments."As new media types become more prominent-Internet, the Web,graphical information, video clips-bandwidth is becoming moreand more of an issue," observed RAID product manager PeterJones at Micropolis Corp. (Chatsworth, Calif.). "People withtraditional types of data are usually looking at the numberof people they can support, and they want lots of I/O."With more graphical data, there's more focus on bandwidth andhow to sustain data so you deliver images in a timely fashion."Within a couple of years, observers say, a new segment of userswill embrace disk arrays. Disk drives are becoming the storagemedium for video-on-demand systems, storing movies that canbe called up on a whim by people in hotels, on cruise shipsand even in some homes."One of the big areas for change is in RAID for video servers,"said Dennis Waid, president of Peripheral Research (Santa Barbara,Calif.). "[Such servers are] really pushing the technologybecause of the bandwidth requirements. They need sustainedrates of 1 to 2 Mbytes/second per stream, even when they'reusing MPEG-2. When you get 30 or 40 streams for the same title,that puts a lot of requirement on the bandwidth.""We're finding that there's quite a bit of usage in medicalapplications," said Ron Englebrecht, director for OEM RAIDproducts at Symbios Logic (Wichita, Kan.). Such applications,he said, "use RAID mostly to get bandwidth. The resolutionof their images is fairly high, and in some applications, thereare lots of them."As those changes occur, the rapid rate of change in disk drivesis forcing both RAID and subsystem designers to think aboutbandwidth as well. Drive technology is moving forward at ratesas high as 70 percent to 80 percent per year, making it impracticalto stick with the 20-Mbyte/s rate of the basic SCSI interface."Drives are getting a lot faster," said Tom Lavan, storage businessmanager at Dell Products (Austin, Texas). "Head/media ratesare going beyond 10 to 20 Mbytes/s."Advanced technologyTwo avenues to higher bandwidth are being pursued: use of advanceddrive technology and use of faster data channels to link arraysto the host. At the same time, the disk drives within the boxare changing. Capacity is going up, of course, as is drivespeed. But RAID designers are looking for other factors toincrease their edge."In the past year, we have switched 100 percent away from using5,400-rpm drives. Now we use 7,200-rpm drives exclusively,"said Englebrecht of Symbios. "It's amazing how quickly that'schanged: People used 3,600-rpm drives for years and years,then went from 4,800 to 5,400 to 7,200 rpm drives in just acouple of years. We hear 10,000-rpm drives will be availablenext year. I guess when they're available, we'll start usingthem pretty quickly."But faster spinning drives can bring problems, depending onthe environment. Spinning anything faster takes more powerand creates more noise. Sound might not be much of a concernfor some servers, but for those located in office environments,it can be a problem."When we look beyond capacity and speed, we're looking at drivesfor system cooling and audible noise," Dell's Lavan said. "Somecustomers in Europe are very sensitive to that. In Japan, noiseis also more of a concern."Noise and thermal concerns are often intertwined. Most RAIDsystems need fans, since there are multiple drives in the enclosure.The noise of the fan, coupled with the noise of half a dozenor more drives, can easily become annoying if the drive islocated near someone's desk. Sound is obviously less of a concernwhen drives are located in a back room.The special requirements of video put further pressure on drivedesigners, Waid said. "When you're using MPEG-2, you've gota very high compression rate. You need a very high-performance,reliable drive because of that compression rate. If you missa compressed bit, it can make a big, big difference."Even as drive designers fine-tune their already lofty reliabilitylevels, their designs are absorbing some of the functions thathistorically have been handled by RAID controllers. Drivesare getting smarter; many now perform the XOR command thatis central to any RAID controller."In 1996 and '97, a lot of capability is going to go onto thedisk drives," said Said Rahmani Kherzi, vice president of R&Dat Pathlight Technology Inc. (Ithaca, N.Y.). "They will beable to do XORs and other functions. You'll still have adaptercards that are doing a lot of jobs, but a lot of additionalfunctionality will be on the disk drive."That can even have an impact on the available bandwidth. "Doingthe XORs in the drive's buffer instead of in the RAID controllerlets you make fewer transfers over the bus," said Jones ofMicropolis. "That alleviates some of your needs from a bandwidthpoint of view."With drives retrieving data faster, arrays adding more drivesto get higher capacities and hosts crying for more data, largerpipes between the RAID box and the host are essential.Designers can pursue one of two routes to get higher bandwidth.They can stick with parallel SCSI by shifting to UltraSCSI,which doubles the data-transfer rates of the fast and wideSCSI interfaces that have been in use for the past few years.Or they can turn to one of the new serial interfaces: the FiberChannel Arbitrated Loop or the Serial Storage Architecture(SSA)Going to serial interfaces gives engineers higher speeds, moreflexibility, more functionality and simpler cabling. But stickingwith parallel SCSI lets designers use existing software andcabling, and it's generally cheaper, since the volumes arefar larger.UltraSCSI can move data at up to 40 Mbytes/s with a 16-bit versionthat's available today. A faster version will double that,to 80 Mbytes/s for the 16-bit versions and 40 Mbytes/s for8-bitters.Fiber Channel has bandwidth of up to 100 Mbytes/s, though somevendors say it can go to 200 Mbytes/s if the proper configurationis used and commands are sent the right way. SSA currentlyhas only a 40-Mbyte/s bandwidth. But it has features, suchas spatial reuse, that enable a properly configured SSA architectureto match the performance of Fiber Channel despite the bandwidthgap, SSA proponents contend.Dicey trade-offsThe high-bandwidth needs of RAID complicate the design tradeoffs. In some instances, designers working with video dataare sticking with parallel SCSI. And some with traditionaldata bases that have little video are moving to serial links.For example, PC maker Dell has little video data in most ofits server storage systems. But the company has opted to combineRAID and a serial interface-specifically, SSA."One intriguing aspect of SSA and RAID that people are investigatingis putting multiple initiators on the same loop," said Dell'sLavan. "There is an additive bandwidth effect if you put anotherinitiator, or controller, in the loop. "The obvious link between high-bandwidth serial links and increasinglylarger and faster disk arrays is spurring an increase in thenumber of RAID vendors in the marketplace. One that plans tojoin the pack later this year is Pathlight, an early supplierof SSA adapter cards. The company has decided that the twotechnologies are so closely intertwined, it doesn't make sensenot to meld them."The reason we're convinced that we have to support RAID isthat SSA provides a number of features that are useful in RAID,"Rahmani said. "One of those is multiple initiators. Anotheris that with SSA, you can have concurrent transactions occurringat the same time. An adapter card can support 220 commandsto multiple drives, and then those drives can queue up thosecommands so they're continuously performing reads and writes."But not everyone is convinced that serial links are the answerfor designers who are working on short-term products. Micropolisis a proponent of SSA, and much of its emphasis in the pasttwo years has been in video applications. The company has developedvideo disk drives and has moved beyond storage subsystems tocreate video servers that include personal-computing technology.But Micropolis isn't sold on serial links for the near term."You've got high bandwidth with UltraSCSI and PCI," noted Jones."You can put several UltraSCSI channels on PCI and use a lotof the bandwidth of PCI."Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882DESIGN TECHNOLOGY ROI: The strong get strongerBy:Ron CollettA fundamental restructuring of the electronics industry is underway that will give the semiconductor industry unprecedentedpower. Among the drivers of the shift is the serious shortageof engineers, especially those who can design and implementvery complex ICs and ASICs. Companies fighting for the limitedpool of talent are offering sign-on bonuses, enlisting squadsof headhunters to raid competitors, boosting salaries and oftenthrowing in chunks of equity to sweeten the pot. That is creatingtremendous instability within engineering organizations, asthey face the prospect that key engineers may suddenly pickup and leave if a better opportunity comes along.Instability translates to higher risk. It becomes virtuallyimpossible to meet development schedules and take on increasinglychallenging projects.To cut their risks, companies that might otherwise have takenon in-house development of a complex ASIC may instead opt foran off-the-shelf chip. In many instances, they will sacrificesome system-level functionality or performance in the process.On the other hand, systems companies that can promise high-volumeshipments or provide some intellectual property to a semiconductorsupplier will be in a position to persuade the chip supplierto implement chips for them. Likewise, semiconductor companieswill aggressively court systems companies as chip-developmentpartners.Semiconductor companies that have fabs will be under enormouspressure to put more designs through their fab to recoup theirhuge investments. They need the architectural knowledge thatexists within systems companies, whereas systems houses needthe silicon-implementation knowledge that chip makers possess.That dynamic will strengthen the semiconductor industry asit gathers more intellectual property and pumps out more designs.The labor shortage, coupled with the increasing complexitiesof chip design and the pressure to "feed the fabs," will forcesystems companies and semiconductor houses to work togetheras never before.The semiconductor industry is getting more powerful in otherways. New suppliers, many of them spun off from establishedvendors, spring up every month. The semiconductor content ofelectronic products is clearly on the rise. In 1995, the semiconductorindustry's revenue reached about $140 billion, up 40 percentfrom the year before and almost 100 percent from two yearsago. Chip vendors are developing application-specific standardproducts (ASSPs) at an unprecedented rate, capturing more ofthe value-added that has been the traditional province of thesystems industry. The systems industry, meanwhile, is leveragingthe semiconductor companies' chip-implementation prowess.Many companies hope the EDA industry will soon introduce toolsand methodologies that will improve productivity and ease thedifficulties of designing highly complex ICs and ASICs. Inshort, they're hoping for a miracle.But no such miracle is likely this century. Design will onlyget tougher, especially given the increasing dichotomy betweenthe silicon knowledge necessary to implement deep-submicronbased chips and the higher-level abstractions at which designersmust work. That will play into the hand of the semiconductorindustry, because its very existence depends on its abilityto implement complex chips. It will invest whatever is necessaryto survive; it simply has no other choice.The systems industry, for its part, has a crutch on which tolean: the semiconductor industry.Ronald Collett is president of Collett International Inc.

MasterPort letsIC vendors migrate physical cell libraries from one processtechnology to another.Cascade is aggressively targeting the relatively small librarydevelopment niche because of a compelling need for automation,said Ken Rousseau, vice president for new product development."The way people have been doing library development to dateis starting to break down," he said. "They need a way to collapsethe library-development cycle in order to meet time-to-market."Rosseau said it typically takes six to nine months-and perhapsfive to 10 man-years of effort-to develop or migrate an ICcell library today. He claimed that with MasterPort, a customerwas able to migrate a library to a new, deep-submicron processwithin a few weeks, saving "an order of magnitude" in time.MasterPort isn't Cascade's first entry into the library-developmentbusiness. Last year, the company released Compiler DevelopmentSystem (CDS), a tool that generates geometry from C-languagefunction calls. Cascade also introduced a standalone, off-theshelf standard cell library, targeted at multiple ASIC vendors,in August.MasterPort is very different from CDS, however. Instead of takingC code, MasterPort imports GDSII and Spice data for existingcell libraries. It then outputs revised GDSII data and annotatedSpice net-lists for the same library on a different process.The tool is aimed at cells up to the size of flip-flops. Itdoesn't have a hierarchical capability, so it's not suitedfor RAMs, data paths or megacells. Cascade plans in 1996 tointroduce a hierarchical library-development tool that canhandle large geometries. In addition, a future generation ofMasterPort will include some of the C-language capabilitiesnow in CDS.MasterPort contains an interface called GrafEdit, a graphicalfront end for automatic constraint generation. It accepts technologyfiles that can be provided by Cascade or developed by the userthrough a menu-driven interface. This file provides informationon the design rules, process parameters and layer mapping ofthe target process.The tool saves leaf-cell designs in a process-portable format,so that the design is entered only once. It can then be retargetedby entering new process parameters and design rules.Rosseau noted that MasterPort does not use a "lambda shrink"approach that simply scales components into smaller sizes.Because different elements scale differently, Cascade usesa new "point landmark" technology that can manipulate geometryin two dimensions. "We understand the true 2-D relationshipof the points, and compact them to the best extent possible,taking full advantage of each process rule," Rosseau said.Cascade has applied for a patent on this technology and is beginningto use it in the module-generation products it sells to ICand ASIC designers.MasterPort is available now on Hewlett-Packard and Sun workstationsfor $150,000.Ken Rosseau, (206) 643-0200Reader Service No. 400Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Briefs: Anacad improves simulation timeMilpitas, Calif.  - Mentor Graphics' Anacad subsidiary has addedanother analog-simulation algorithm, integral equation method(IEM), to its Eldo and MixVHDL simulation tool sets.

Certainly its future is cloudy. But gate arrays arestriking back with an unexpected new weapon: FPGA-like architectures.The traditional sea-of-gates gate array is composed not of gates,but of identical transistor pairs. The metal masks wire thepairs together to form gates and flip-flops. If you want acomplicated flip-flop, a wide gate or a gate with extra drivestrength, it's no problem-you just wire in more pairs of transistors.That was great down to about 0.8-micron geometry. Transistorperformance largely determined circuit performance and interconnectwas perhaps scarce, but not actively harmful to speed or powerdissipation in most nets. But as gate arrays moved toward 0.5 or 0.35-micron rules, everything changed. Now transistorsaren't as important as interconnect.Ironically, this makes the problem of designing a gate-arrayarchitecture similar to that of designing an FPGA architecture.Logic is relatively free, but wire is everything. Not surprisingly,gate-array designers are coming up with some of the same ideasused by FPGA gurus.It has been known for some time that the granularity of an FPGAcan influence both performance and density. If you make thebasic elements too small-smaller than a gate, say-the interconnectlosses become excessive and you lose performance. If you makethe logic cell too large-an eight-input function generatorand two flip-flops, for instance-you may get wonderful speedbut will waste a lot of silicon in implementation. For modernparts, the optimum trade-off point seems to be a three-inputfunction generator, possibly with a flip-flop.Two small companies, Aspec Corp. and Silicon Architects, startedtaking the gate-array business in this direction about a yearago. Both have elaborate design environments that are saidto overcome the challenges of submicron ASIC design and toachieve standard-cell-like results. In both cases, the designsexploit a new underlying gate-array architecture built frommultitransistor logic cells rather than transistor pairs.Texas Instruments joined the discussion at the 1995 Custom IntegratedCircuits Conference with a paper describing its TGC3000 gatearray family, currently under development. In the TI gate array,a logic cell contains eight "sites," each of which containsone or two logic gates and a pair of pass transistors. Halfthe sites have high-drive gates and half have pairs of lowdrive gates. Thus, design software can use small transistorsfor feedback paths in bistable elements, medium-sized transistorsfor clock inputs or pass logic, and large transistors for criticalpath drivers.Recently, Chip Express announced that it will use a similararchitecture for its next-generation deep-sub-micron, fastturnaround arrays.The advantages to a logic-cell approach are numerous. By buildingwith larger blocks, you can implement many logic functionswith higher speed and lower power than could have been achievedwith transistor pairs. With different transistor sizes withinthe cell, you can have different strengths of the same gatewithout having to wire duplicate gates in parallel. And withcareful design, the cell can be made to implement SRAM moreefficiently than could a transistor pair.All those approaches seem to yield results much better thantraditional gate arrays, nearly the equal of cell-based designs.If they can also mask the timing complexities that render deepsubmicron design so hazardous, they might begin to recapturethe business that is drifting toward standard cells. And atthe low end of the market, they threaten to beat FPGAs at theirown game.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Low power to the coax peopleTustin, Calif. - While the bulk of attention may be on twistedpair LAN, Silicon Systems Inc. is out to prove to the coaxialcable world that power-consumption advances are being madefor 10 Base 2 and 10 Base 5 transceivers. The 78Q8392L devicedraws 50 mA when transmitting and 7 mA for line monitoringwhile receiving data.The new transceiver is a BiCMOS redesign of a custom transceiverSSI developed for Standard Microsystems Corp. Kirk Brinkworth,network product marketing manager at SSI, said that the companydecided to move to a low-power BiCMOS version after observing"a huge remaining market for coaxial adapter cards in the U.S.,Europe and the Far East. People keep predicting the declineof coaxial cable but pushing out the date for that decline."Since the BiCMOS device has such a low current drain comparedwith bipolar or CMOS parts, SSI has made a special effort towork with dc/dc converter makers, including parent TDK, todevelop a 500-mW power converter to use with the transceiver.Joint marketing efforts to promote such devices will allowPCs with a coaxial Ethernet interface to meet low-power specssuch as EPA's EnergyStar.The transceiver includes most functions offered in 8392-compatibledevices, including receiver, transmitter, collision signaling,collision detection, jabber timing and heartbeat functions.SSI is offering the 78Q8392L in 28-pin PLCC, 16-pin DIP and16-pin small-outline packages.

Some haveprovision to share their frame buffers, others don't. Somecan handle 3-D, others exclude it.It's understandable, then, that some vendors are allocatinga separate frame buffer to each new feature and combining theoutputs with a video switch. That avoids potential problemswith single-source chips and circumvents the arguments aboutwhich bus should have been able to carry which data flows.The next problem is to find a switch that can select, pixelby pixel, between two video sources. There are some very goodanalog switches out there, if you happen to have 12-V supplieson your graphics board. And there are some pretty bad switchesavailable, if you are working at limited resolution and colordepth.Pericom Semiconductor Corp. has tried to combine the virtuesin one product. The P15V330 VideoSwitch is a quad two-channelmux/demux with a single 5-V supply, 180-MHz bandwidth and 3 on-resistance.In addition, the company said, the chip can handle very high(for video) currents, and it shows very low crosstalk. Thus,it can often be used without an accompanying video amplifier,even at very high pixel rates.The part is now in production.

We apply that to the vacuous set of 1996 predictionsinside that huge stack of trade publications sitting on yourdesk. After careful deconstruction of the pontifications, weplace the remnants in a Cuisinart with equal parts of eggnogand Bailey's Irish Cream and end up with a sobering frothybrew.Unlike market analysts, I don't suffer from a bizarre bipolardisorder that says you go nuts about something for 12 months,then pan it to the high heavens. My dad always disarmed theApocalypse Now crowd with his observation that "the safestshort-term prediction is for more of the same, only more so."Thus, I come up with the following 1996 scenarios.ATM will continue its slow stumble to ubiquity, but in the WANfirst. 1996 is supposed to be the year that everyone pickson ATM for failing to replace everything in LAN and WAN infive years. Hey, it was obvious in 1990 that the move to acommon cell-relay infrastructure would be slow and difficult.ATM will broaden its reach in 1996, but folks debating over25-Mbit ATM in the local area are missing the action. ATM willmake its biggest inroads in the WAN, as a transport for Nx64services.Fast Ethernet and VG will show respectable growth but primarilyas a shared-media backbone. Last year, everyone went nuts aboutswitched LANs and assumed the 100-Mbit LANs would be used firstin switched implementation. But switched 10-Mbit LANs solvedimmediate desktop bandwidth problems. The best place for 100Mbit service is as a hub-to-hub workgroup shared backbone forcarrying switched 10-Mbit frames. Server cluster makers willprobably use Fiber Channel or SCI, not switched-100, as aninterserver link. But expect 100-Mbit PCI cards for serverand hub workgroup links to be big in 1996. Desktop 100-Mbitcards might start to grow by year's end.Basic-rate ISDN will continue to be spotty in implementation.Some analysts assume that the price cuts among OEMs for ISDNterminal adapters will force the regional Bells to get brains.Oh, PacBell and Southwestern Bell and maybe the BA-Nynex clusterwill show glimmers of intelligence but will be personnel-limitedin ISDN provisioning. Ameritech, U S West and others will gallumphalong in terminal stupidity, ignoring ISDN and trying to pushcaller ID to the world. Duh.IsoEthernet will not die. Good ol' National Semiconductor keptpushing isochronous Ethernet after pundits said it didn't havea chance. IsoEnet has 96 circuit-switched B channels. If theMCI tests prove even halfway-decent, IsoEnet could see a midyearrenaissance.PCS and digital cellular will grow, but there will still bea bloodbath (see my previous column's comment about elephantsin a kiddie pool). Services will be discounted to get usersinterested, and some will take the bait. But there are fartoo many carriers and hardware developers in wireless; manywill inevitably crash and burn.Cable modems will face a tough market. This one is too bad,since the new products from Motorola, HP, General Instrumentand Intel/Hybrid are pretty cool, and everyone wants more returnpath bandwidth than the phone company can provide. But do youknow anyone who would buy or lease hardware from their CATVprovider?Caveat: All these predictions ignore the butterfly-wing chaosfactor of an unknown variable changing everything. If so, theauthor reserves the right to shout "Never mind!" and wish everyonea happy 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Learn about RAID from RABBy:Terry CostlowEngineers who want to get up to speed in disk-array technologycan get plenty of information from the RAID Advisory Board(RAB), a 60-member organization formed in 1992.RAB's three-tiered focus centers on education, standardizationand certification. Since RAID has suffered from some misunderstandingin the user community, education has been a prime focus ofthe group.The centerpiece of the educational effort is the 200-plus-pageRAID Book, which defines the various RAID levels and providesother technical explanations. Other publications include theStorage System Enclosure Handbook, the RAID Glossary, the RAIDPrimer and the RAID Ready SCSI Drive Profile.For those who want a quick start, there's also a 15-minute videothat provides basic information on RAID. At the other end ofthe spectrum, RAB sponsors an annual seminar: RABcon, the InternationalConference on RAID and Related Storage Technologies for Usersand Suppliers. It runs almost as long as its name, from Feb.12 to16, in Redwood City, Calif.Information can also be found through the Internet at http:/www.raid-advisory.com.Six RAB committees work on standardization issues. Three ofthem focus on tests: functional tests in SCSI and Fiber Channeland a performance test. The other three tackle remote-arraymonitoring, storage-system terminology and host-interface standards.To make sure RAID systems actually deliver on the basics theypromise, the group offers certification procedures. RAB's setof storage system test suites can be run to show that the systemunder test provides data integrity even when a drive fails.There's also a performance test for comparing the vastly differentRAID technologies. The test provides a single aggregate performancerating, called the RABmark. Users who want to look at the individualcomponents of the test will be able to get full reports.Those reports will probably be desirable for most users, sincethe various RAID types have markedly different strengths. Asystem with high bandwidth may not perform as well in applicationsthat require lots of I/O. By the same token, some may farebetter in terms of fault tolerance but may sacrifice performance.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882PACKAGE DEALINGS: PCMCIA cards and ICsBy:Terry CostlowOver the past couple of years, the PCMCIA standard has emergedas a driving factor for the board-fabrication industry. Thevolumes are supposed to be high, providing a heady incentive.And on the technology side, if a company can produce the thin,fine-line boards needed for PCMCIA cards, making similar substratesfor larger systems should be easy.So far, progress has been spotty on both fronts. PCMCIA cardsaren't really turning out to be as large a market as many expected.And board makers haven't been able to crank out boards nearlyas neatly as most would like. But that doesn't mean that thestrategy doesn't remain sound.Now, there are some signs that PCMCIA cards might be the driverfor IC packaging too. The small size of the cards, both inarea and height, is likely to make many designers and manufacturerslook seriously at unpackaged ICs. Putting a couple of barechips on a large circuit board can have a major impact on thecost of the board substrate, since the whole board must beable to support the fine lines needed for the entire board.But since two or three bare chips will cover a fair portionof a PCMCIA card, the extra density isn't wasted. If the portablecards do spark a move to bare chips, it would be a welcomesign for the U.S. market, which hasn't used nearly as manybare chips as many system houses in the Pacific Rim.One question arises, though. If PCMCIA cards aren't providingenough volume to prompt comparatively small board houses topull out the stops to build their PCMCIA capabilities, howwill they create much excitement for large IC producers?That answer comes from who's well known in the packaging worldfor creating and chairing several technical sessions and workshopsat trade shows and industry meetings, Jack Balde. The presidentof Interconnection Decision Consulting (Flemington, N.J.) feelsthat while the PCMCIA standard was created for computers, thetelecommunications industry will provide the volumes that willget the attention of CEOs.As the world shifts to fiber optics, telecommunications providersare going to need line cards to convert fiber-optic transmissionsinto the electronic signals that will go into each home oroffice phone. And if you're like me, trying to remember thatmy area code will soon change to 847, you know there are farmore phones than computers.Balde, and many others, feel that the PCMCIA card may turn outto be the form factor for line cards, which are moving outof the central office to basements and boxes on neighborhoodcorners. Even if telecom providers diverge a bit from PCMCIA,the packaging issues will be the same.For board producers, the issues will be mainly to provide substratesthat are thin, have fine lines and don't cost too much. That'snothing new.On the IC side, things will change significantly, regardlessof whether you're supplying chips or mounting them on a board.Some people feel chip-scale packages will become popular, sincethey have only the tiniest package. Others say flip chips willemerge, since they have the smallest footprint of any chip.Wire bonding certainly has a chance to become the electricalconnection between chips and boards.Other techniques, such as one that uses flexible circuits tocreate plated circuitry that can be attached to boards, mayalso emerge. Each has some solid pluses, as well as negativesthat create openings for the others. It's likely that manyvendors will standardize around PCMCIA form factors, but noton any packaging issues.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Board density seen risingBy:Terry CostlowNew Orleans - Packaging is becoming a major aspect of systemdesign, with both ICs and circuit boards growing in importance,according to presentations at the Technology Marketing ResearchCouncil (TMRC) meeting here last month.The TMRC meetings explored both the changes predicted for packagingand the two forces that will drive them: semiconductor advancesand business concerns. The TMRC was created several years agoby the Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging ElectronicCircuits (IPC; Northbrook, Ill.), which wanted to augment itstechnical efforts by monitoring the business climate.One major change throughout the electronics industry is thespirit of cooperation, which has prompted the creation of severalconsortia and initiatives. One of them, the National ElectronicManufacturing Initiative (NEMI), is continuing to create plansand road maps that help the consortium in its efforts to makethe U.S. electronics manufacturing environment competitiveeven in consumer markets. The manufacturing system plan focuseson four areas that concern packaging engineers: flip chips,substrates, board assembly and final assembly.Dramatic changesIn its presentation, NEMI predicted that circuit boards willundergo dramatic changes in the next four years. This year,the average board will have about 4,000 I/Os, with packagedparts using 0.38-mm pitches. There will be about 110 componentsin a square inch. In 1998, those figures climb to 7,000 I/Osper board with packaged-die spacing declining to a 0.25 mmpitch.When the new decade dawns, the number of I/Os will actuallydecline, slipping to 6,000 contacts. But they'll have far higherdensity. Packaged parts will have 0.15-mm spacing, and therewill be 275 components per square inch. The number of baredice on a board will increase to 400 parts, double the numberused today.Road mapping is not the only job at NEMI. It has created technicalworking groups that attempt to address the concerns found whenthe road map committee looked at what's needed and what's available.Next month, all technical working group chairs will meet tofigure out how to proceed. In March, NEMI working groups willkick off their programs.Other observers also detailed the safe prediction that smallerchip packages will lead to higher-density circuit boards. HewlettPackard Co. and IBM Corp. predicted that chip-scale packages,which put only a tiny amount of epoxy or other encapsulantaround the chip, will be a key factor in that trend. Chip-scalepackages are only 13 percent the size of plastic quad flatpacks, and flip chips are even smaller. That foretells twochanges: Signal traces will have to get smaller and the sizeof the board will shrink.Relaxed rulesBut while chip-scale packaging and ball-grid arrays, anotherhot technology, will shrink board size, it won't always meanthat board density will increase. Designers will be able torelax design rules and lower board layer counts if they followsome design rules.One is to use BGAs that have no more than four rows of contacts.If there are more, it becomes difficult to get signal linesto the inner rows, which are smaller and have fewer contactpoints. Just using BGAs can have a payoff. Since BGAs can supporthigher lead counts, designers can use larger chips insteadof using two or three devices packaged in peripheral-lead casings.Another is to turn to multichip modules, particularly thosewith laminate substrates. Using MCM-L technology lets designersput all the high-density routing on a module, thereby usingcoarser lines on the circuit board, according to HP.Regardless of what packaging prognosticators plan, they mustbase their predictions on changes in the semiconductor industry.Dataquest addressed that concern, forecasting continued steadygrowth in semiconductor consumption. Currently, the industryis shifting from 32- to 64-bit processors, with DRAM technologyadvancing from 16 to 64 Mbits. Over the next four years, gatecounts will rise from 300,000 to 1 million. Nothing in thatprognostication counters the need for higher-density boardsand chip packages.All the technical moves in the board industry are based on businessand economic concerns, of course. According to an analysisby Morton Electronic Materials, business couldn't get muchbetter. Over a three-month period that ended last October,circuit-board bookings had risen 142 percent. Shipments werealso booming, at 122 percent.Most board houses are full, and lead times are extending. Ina positive note for vendors, prices have firmed up. All thesepositives add up to an increase in capital spending. Nevertheless,there are always some warning signs that need to be monitored,according to Morton. Component shortages have cropped up. Rawmaterials are also in short supply, which is sometimes pushingprices upward. A big factor to watch is whether growth in circuitboard bookings exceeds the increase in electronic equipment'sgrowth.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882IR receiver aimed at wireless marketMerrimack, N.H. - Unitrode Corp. has entered the infrared marketwith the release of an Infrared Data Association (IrDA)- compliantreceiver, the UCC5340.The BiCMOS micropower receiver is the first of Unitrode's IRAir Light series.

And this shortageis no more pressing than in the software arena.Hiring needs also extend to application engineers and digitalsystem-level design engineers. The explanation is simple. Forleading consumer-electronics companies, such as Philips, Matsushitaand Zenith, designing a DVD system goes far beyond buildinga simple player that plays back a 120-mm-diameter optical disk.They envision DVD, with 4.7 Gbytes of storage per side, asa vehicle to drive versatile, digital convergence among theirentire product lines. Examples would include a combo box withDVD and a digital satellite decoder, DVD with the next-generationhigh-performance videogame player, DVD with a digital VCR,DVD built into a smart TV, and DVD with Internet access. Indeed,DVD-based digital products can come in nearly infinite combinationsand variations, industry executives said.Considering a cross section of all the emerging digital consumerproducts, ranging from DVD to digital TV, "we really need anawful lot of software engineers," said Bruce DeVore, vice presidentof human resources at Philips Consumer Electronics (Knoxville,Tenn.)"We are looking for lots of applications and embedded-softwareengineers," he said. Also in demand are hardware digital designpeople, especially those with experience in ASIC and digitalsystem-level designs.Double hiringThe Knoxville-based company, which recruited about 75 engineersin 1994 doubled that hiring number in '95, "in order to meet[our engineering department's] demand for research and designingof new digital-application products," DeVore said.Philips is recruiting engineers with up to two years of professionalexperience with EE degrees, senior engineers with three tofive years of experience, and engineering director-level peoplewith five to 10 years. The jobs will be located in Knoxville.Philips Semiconductors (Sunnyvale, Calif.), a silicon arm ofthe Dutch giant, is also adding people, seeking experiencedhands in multimedia and communications.In multimedia, "we need those with design experience in ICs,microcontrollers or DSPs," said a Philips Semiconductor spokesman."We are also looking for software engineers who can write Windowsdevice drivers."Engineers who can add value to high-speed wired communications,such as ATM and Fast Ethernet, are also in demand, while thosewith RF design and analog expertise are needed, he added.Driven by the company's priority on "interactive [products]"and "DVD," Matsushita Electric is also adding a big chunk ofapplications-software engineers, as well as marketing and technicalsupport people with an engineering degree, said Bill Schupp,vice president of human resources at Matsushita.A substantial number of jobs are expected to be created as Matsushitalaunches a company called Panasonic Interactive Media Co. innorthern California this year.Based on the exclusive rights Matsushita recently gained fromthe 3DO Co. to use 3DO's 64-bit M2 technology for next-generationconsumer and commercial products, the Japanese giant now alsohas rights to sublicense the 64-bit technology to both hardwarecompanies and software developers. Panasonic Interactive MediaCo. will develop games software "that matches the technologyleap from 32-bit to 64-bit," Schupp said.People neededThough details of the new company's business plans are stillin development and won't become available until the secondweek of February, Schupp said, "we will certainly be in needof many software developers and hardware sales engineers,"to promote the new interactive platform.DVD is also another important business focus for Matsushitathis year. While the technical specifications and copyrightissues are being ironed out in Japan, the job opportunitiesfor DVD-related application engineers and service groups tosupport the new system "is wide open in the United States,"said Schupp.Zenith Electronics (Glenview, Ill.), now officially a part ofKorean giant L.G. Electronics, continues to emphasize consumerelectronics and network-system products. Accordingly, Zenithplans to hire 30 or more engineers this year."Software engineers are our high priority," noted a Zenith spokesman.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Web gets friendlier to 3-DBy:Brian SantoSan Francisco - The drive toward fully interactive, networked3-D modeling took several steps forward last month.

They wonder how many Hollywood studioswill feel comfortable with the quality of digitally encodedmaterial.MPEG-decoder-chip vendor C-Cube Microsystems Inc. is one ofthe companies trying to do something about that. It's workingon real-time MPEG-2 encoding silicon for DVD systems. DavidTaylor, director of broadcast marketing at C-Cube, said thecompany will privately demonstrate its silicon's variable-bitrate encoding and overall MPEG-2 video/audio and AC-3 encodingcapabilities at a hotel suite here during the Consumer ElectronicsShow.C-Cube also plans to incorporate such features as "branching"in its encoding chip set, Taylor said. The DVD technical specificationallows scene skipping, or branching, as a parental lockoutfunction; by embedding flags in a digital stream, a DVD playercan be made to skip over certain sectors on a disk.The rub in implementing the branching function is that the encodermust devise a way to make a seamless transition between theexit and re-entry points. "The technical spec is there," Taylorsaid, "but practical implementations are still being workedon."C-Cube hopes to announce microcode for VBR-based MPEG-2 DVDencoding before midyear. Addition of branching and other featureswill likely follow several months later, Taylor said.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882RAID-certification program completedBy:Terry CostlowWichita, Kan. - Hoping to make it easier for users to pick redundantarrays of independent disks, the RAID Advisory Board has completeda certification program that includes a standard performancecomparison level as well as a functional test. Symbios Logiclast week became the first to pass the functional test.Some RAID vendors believe that the two aspects of the test willhelp expand the market significantly. The performance testwill provide an aggregate speed figure that can compare generalperformance levels, much like SPECmarks in the workstationindustry. The functional test, which is the portion Symbioshas completed, will certify that data is not lost or alteredwhen drives in the array fail."This gives users a UL-like label," said Ron Englebrecht, directorfor OEM RAID products at Symbios, which was formerly a partof NCR. "It's been a bit of a black eye for the industry thatsometimes a combination of events will cause loss or alterationof data. This provides an unbiased third-party guarantee thatthe system works under adverse conditions."Split decisionHowever, the industry is split on the value of the tests. JoeMolina, chairman of the RAID Advisory Board (RAB), said, "Mostof our members who provide RAID products agree that certificationis the most important program undertaken by RAB. There aremyriad tests in the functional portion; it takes at least aweek to run."But others think that the tests will not have much impact inthe market."What they're trying to do is admirable, but we don't thinkthat this general test provides customers assurance that they'regetting what they want, that the product delivers what it promises,"said Tex Schenkkan, marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard'sStorage Systems Division (Boise, Idaho). "That's really drivenby the vendor's own quality and acceptance programs. If you'rea small outfit, this might be something you can do to givecustomers assurance that you're not just one of 175 RAID vendors."The large number of vendors means that users might need someassistance in determining whether the RAID system deliverswhat they expect. Though the performance data is likely tobe the most visible aspect of the tests, the functional portionis equally important, observers said.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882IEC eyes consensus on EDA standardsBy:Richard GoeringWashington - In an attempt to come to an international consensuson EDA standards, the International Electrotechnical Committee(IEC) held a series of meetings here last month, involvingU.S., Japanese and European standards organizations. The meetingshelped to raise awareness about international standards effortsand to identify unnecessary duplication.The meetings were sponsored by IEC technical committee 93 (TC93),which develops and approves international design-automationstandards. "This is the first time, to my knowledge, that thetechnical committee has held such an open forum," said JeanLeBrun, TC93 chairman and a design manager at CSF Thomson.Not 'from scratch'LeBrun noted that standards organizations and EDA users werepresent from the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Finland,Denmark and the United Kingdom. "We don't really want to developstandards from scratch," LeBrun said. "We'd rather establishworking relationships with recognized organizations like theIEEE."Among those included in the meetings were representatives ofthe CAD Framework Initiative (CFI), Electronic Industries Association(EIA) EDIF effort, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa),PDES and Sematech. The EDA industry standards road map underdevelopment by CFI, Sematech and the Electronic Design AutomationCompanies (EDAC) is of major interest to the IEC, LeBrun said.Patti Rusher, a representative of the EIA's EDIF effort, said,"We wanted to introduce the EDA road map, which was basicallydone in the U.S., and get feedback to go to the next step.Issues raised included duplicated standards, such as EDIF andAP210."Randy Harr, program manager at Arpa, said, "The U.S. governmentis fully behind the IEC EDA standards forum meeting. We havebeen urging, through funding direction and contact, the variousEDA standards activities to work more closely together. TheIEC meeting is a way to make sure the international standardsbodies are in concert with these efforts."In addition to a day-long open forum, working-group meetingswere held throughout the week. IEC TC93 working groups addresssuch areas as interoperability, hardware description languages,interchange formats, pc-board layout and conformance of applicationsto IEC EDA standards. New working groups are anticipated toaddress libraries and test.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Cover Feature: Socket suppliers target emerging high-density world of balland land-grid arraysBy:Glenda DermanAs two new package types-ball-grid arrays and land-grid arraysbegin moving into volume production, socket suppliers are scramblingto provide production, test and burn-in sockets for ICs packagedin these high-density designs. Besides being reasonably priced,production sockets must have very low inductances, no planarityproblems, reliable performance and, preferably, surface-mountformats.The availability of sockets for the popular microprocessorsis especially important, because the nature of tariffs makessocketing desirable. Microprocessors can then be inserted asneeded into the sockets of assemblies manufactured offshore.Sockets also aid in flexible manufacturing and in computerupgrade strategies.Moreover, packages such as land-grid arrays (LGAs) are designedto be used with production sockets. The speedy new MIPS R10000processor from MIPS Technologies Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.),an LGA with 599 pads and a 200-MHz core operating speed, isone of them.Cinch Connector Division (Elk Grove Village, Ill.) is manufacturingsuch sockets around its patented CIN:APSE contact technology.Because it provides low inductance and minimal signal-pathlength, CIN:APSE is said to be an enabling technology for highspeed LGA production-socket applications.These solderless SMT sockets are compression-mounted and boltedto the printed-circuit board. They feature inductance of lessthan l nH, signal-edge rates in the range of 300 to 400 ps,signal-path length of approximately 28 mm and contact resistanceof less than 20 milliohms. The sockets, which measure 56 mmon a side, house packages that are typically used in high-endworkstations.With an eye to standardization, Motorola Inc. and IBM Corp.are developing a joint specification for surface-mount, productionBGA sockets for all PowerPC processors in 1.27-mm grid BGApackages. These small, lightweight sockets attach to the pcboard in the same footprint that the BGA itself would use.Zero-insertion-force (ZIF) socket contacts are preferred, butnot required. The specifications detail stringent technicalrequirements and establish pricing levels at under $5 in volume.They also include requirements for surface mountability andheat-sink attachment. Most BGA production sockets assist withheat dissipation because of thermal-management issues withmicroprocessors. Mototorola is working on some final detailsof the standard covering requirements for mechanical vibrationfor shipping, operating stability over temperature and duringthermal-power cycling, and moisture and humidity sensitivity.Though all the socket designs Motorola has reviewed for PowerPCsin BGA and LGA packages feature low-inductance and high-speedcapabilities, engineers report not having seen a true productionworthy ball-grid-array socket that meets all the specifiedrequirements. The hitch seems to lie in the ability to maintaina good electrical contact over time in all types of applications,particularly because of oxide buildup on solder balls. Motorolaexpects to have a socket solution early in 1996.BGA and LGA sockets for other devices are just beginning toappear on the market. For example, Augat Inc.'s InterconnectionProducts Division (Attleboro Falls, Mass.) recently introducedPad Array Interface production sockets from 200 to 800 I/Osfor BGA and LGA packages. The beryllium-copper contact systemoperates like a pogo stick and has a nominal force of 120 grams.Reliable interfaceThe socket contact tip ensures a reliable interface by engagingthe balls or pads of the package without damaging them; theuse of standoffs within the socket also helps. These socketshave been used with custom ASICs and custom multichip modules,and Augat says they have just been accepted by two workstationmanufacturers as the standard interconnect for their CPU packages.The operating temperature range is -55C to 105C; the inductancevalue is 4 nH. Sockets are availabile in 12 to 16 weeks at7 to 12 cents per contact.Aries Electronics Inc. (Frenchtown, N.J.) offers a BGA productionsocket called ZIF BallNest, a lidded, surface-mount model witha four-fingered, beryllium-copper compression-contact system.Contacts are compressed from above and the lid functions asan actuator. The redundant, four-point contacts engage thesides of the solder balls and perform a wiping action withoutaffecting the ball bottoms.The socket housing of ZIF BallNest is bolted to the pc board.A flap at the base of the contact presses against it to providethe pressure connection. Inductances are less than l nH andcapacitance between contacts is 1 pF. Sockets are availablein 225 I/O on a 1.27-mm grid for applications with the PowerPCpackage, or on a 1.5-mm grid for other uses. Availability isfour to six weeks and cost is 5 to 10 cents per contact, dependingon volume.A family of low-profile, ZIF, surface-mount production BGA socketsis being developed by Methode Electronics Inc. (Chicago). Thefirst of this family-a 1.27-mm grid, 25 x 25-matrix socketfor ceramic BGAs-will have a maximum of 625 I/Os. The socketwhich measures 39.4 x 36.8 mm and are 2.3 mm high-have U-shapedberyllium-copper contacts plated in tin/lead.It has the same footprint on the pc board as the BGA, becausethe package is placed on a plastic carrier that gets insertedinto the socket only after the socket has been soldered tothe board. Thus, no external hold-downs are required. Clearanceholes underneath each of the socket pins enable visual inspectionof solder joints.ZIF actuation is achieved with a screwdriver. Socket inductanceis less than 5 nH. Sockets for ceramic BGAs will be availablein the first quarter of 1996, with versions for plastic BGAsfollowing in the second quarter. Pricing in low volume willbe 5 cents per contact.Testing hasslesHigh-speed digital and RF designers as well as test engineersare facing limitations with standard sockets for device characterizationand product testing. Some of the problems encountered duringtest include ground bounce, crosstalk, supply decoupling anddistortion and glitches that derive from high-lead inductance,as well as mutual inductance and capacitance of packages andsockets.Engineering test sockets must be robust. They perform comprehensiveelectrical test and verification of devices for functionalityand dc parametrics at elevated temperatures and at speed. Socketcompatibility with automated handlers is important, and sois eliminating inductance by means of socket design.To weed out potential device failures, burn-in sockets-usedmainly with semiconductors-must handle chips while they arepower-cycled over time at elevated temperatures. Many burnin sockets are required, and keeping costs down is key. Burnin sockets designed for use with BGAs at elevated temperaturesface special challenges. Solder balls tend to soften duringburn-in and then deform, often leaving residues on the socketcontacts, which could necessitate cleaning after each use.Then too, compatibility of solder balls with test and burnin temperatures, and test and burn-in socket contact designs,should be monitored.To meet these needs, Yamaichi Electronics USA Inc. (San Jose,Calif.) offers the NP 195 series of burn-in sockets for LGAsin an open-top format, in I/O counts ranging from 80 to 260.Measuring 56 x 57 x 25 mm high, these sockets are made to withstandtemperatures of-55C to 170C. Special singular contacts are CAM-actuated toprovide ZIF operation as well as a wiping action on the LGApads. The 1.27-mm contact grid is available in configurationsof 14 x 14 up to 25 x 25 rows.Yamaichi's open-top, 225 I/O burn-in socket for BGAs, the IC264 Series, can withstand temperatures of -40C to 150C. Usedin automated assembly applications, the ZIF-actuated socketmeasures 75 x 62 x 27 mm. A clamping mechanism provides forcefor the compression connection between the solder balls ofthe BGA package and the crown-shaped socket contacts. The latterengage both sides of the solder balls without causing deformation.Target: SRAMs, DRAMsYamaichi also offers burn-in sockets for 119-I/O BGAs for staticand dynamic RAMs: the NP 276 Series. Those sockets have anopen top and a different style of ZIF, CAM-actuated contacts.Shaped like a tuning fork, the contact clasps the top hemisphereof the solder ball from either side and breaks through theoxide layer to provide a reliable connection.The 1.27-mm-pitch, 17 x 17-row sockets measure 33.2 x 26.4 mmand stand 16.8 mm tall. The series also includes sockets for380-I/O BGAs in a 20 x 20-row format measuring 49.4 x 49.4x 19.1 mm. The sockets can be depopulated down to 250 I/O.Availability is six weeks ARO.High-performance test sockets for BGAs and LGAs recently introducedby Condel Technology (Cupertino, Calif.) are based on a highdensity, conductive elastomer-interposer design. The heat-resistantelastomer interposer-the method of connecting the balls orpads of the package within the socket and the pc board-contains40-micron gold-plated wires inserted at a 60 angle and spacedat 0.1 mm. As the connection is compressed, the wires rotateand slide against the mating contact surfaces, resulting ina self-cleaning action. Though l-mm interconnect length isstandard, 0.5 mm is available. It is said to be the shortestinterconnect length in socketing technology.Condel test sockets are aimed at two applications: testing highspeed RF-type devices at 900 MHz and above, and testing highdensity ASIC devices at speed. They are designed to pass veryhigh-frequency signals with very low intermodulation distortionand minimum crosstalk, characteristics necessary in testinghigh-speed RF devices. In addition, low common lead inductanceis minimized to prevent ground bounce, an important issue whentesting high-density ASICs in BGAs and LGAs.Sockets are available in matrices of 25, 27 and 32 mm square,either open or lidded. The conductive elastomer with its matrixof 40-micron wires will accept balls and pads with pitchesas small as 0.1 mm. The Comdel sockets operate at bandwidthsgreater than 15 GHz and offer low lead inductances-just 0.35nH at 1 GHz. Their temperature range is -55C to 155C, contactresistance is 22 milliohms and the life cycle exceeds 50,000insertions.Cost per socket is $2,000, and availability is one to two weeks.The conductive-elastomer interface can be replaced at a nominalcost. Also available from Comdel is a test socket for the TesseramBGA 188-I/O, 0.5-mm-pitch package. The cost is $1,900 perunit.A new test-socket family that accommodates area-array packagesand is designed for use with automated equipment is being manufacturedby PrimeYield Systems Inc. (St. Paul, Minn.). Called the MicroHPC, these sockets have a contactor body made of glass-filledpolymer. Sockets are open lidded to accommodate automated equipment.The Micro-HPC's contact elements are gold- and nickel-platedbrass. The insertion force required is 1.5 ounces per contact.The PrimeYield sockets attach to the the tester board with asurface-mount connection consisting of a matrix of 40-microngold conductors on 100-micron centers. This connection ensuresinductance of less than l nH for testing reliability. Temperatureparameters are -55C to 165C, and socket life is 1 million insertions.Cost of these semicustom sockets is $2,000 to $3,000 per unit,and availability is eight weeks.Cinch Connector Division makes test and burn-in sockets forMotorola PowerPC microprocessors in BGAs based on its CIN:APSEtechnology. Among Cinch's offerings are 256-I/O test socketsfor the PowerPC 603 and 604, as well as 304-I/O test socketsfor the MPC-105.CIN:APSE's low-inductance compression interface ensures no deformationof the solder ball. The sockets withstand temperatures up to125C; inductance is under 5 nH. Availability is six to eightweeks, and sockets are priced at $600 each.Also addressing test and burn-in is Plastronics (Irving, Texas),which has just introduced a line of open-top, ZIF test andburn-in sockets for ball-grid arrays. Price of the standardsockets is about 50 cents per contact and availability is oneto two weeks.Elsewhere, 3M Corp. will introduce a vertical-loading, opentop, ZIF BGA socket for test and burn-in in the first halfof 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882PCI-based data-acquisition board provides 16-bit A/D resolutionand Plug & PlayMarlboro, Mass. - A PCI-based data-acquisition board (PCI-EZ)developed by Data Translation lets engineers and scientiststake full advantage of the performance benefits of the PCIbus, including data-transfer speed, auto-configuration andprocessor-independence.

But lithium is coming up fast.Lithium's numerous advantages include high energy density andhigh cell voltage-both more than twice that of nickel-basedsystems-as well as light weight, fast recharging and environmentalsafety. Lithium batteries also have excellent shelf life, witha self-discharge rate of 1 percent to 2 percent per year (comparedwith 10 percent for conventional cells); hermetic construction;and a broad operating-temperature range.Because lithium is a newer technology in terms of commercialuse, it is still relatively pricey and is perceived as unstablein certain forms. But those negatives are fading with increasedacceptance. On the pricing score, a direct comparison betweennickel- and lithium-based systems is inaccurate because lithium's2-to-1 edge in operating voltage means that only half the numberof cells is required to power a particular application. Thedecrease in primary voltage for many systems to 3.3 V from5 V also favors lithium, because its output is between 3 and3.65 V per cell. By comparison, NiCd, NiMH, alkaline and zincair range from 1.2 to 1.5 V per cell. And to handle the secondknock on lithium-instability-companies have created chemistriesor safeguards to compensate.Tadiran Electronic Industries Inc. (Port Washington, N.Y.) considerslithium technology so important that it skipped an intermediatestage of NiMH development and moved immediately to lithiummetal. In fact, some companies believe that NiMH is an interimtechnology and that NiCd will ultimately lose out because ofenvironmental constraints.Though they're still playing catch-up, lithium-based batteriesare already widely used, and some applications are in an evolutionaryphase. Depending on the chemistry and product type, the batteriesare found in systems ranging from smoke detectors to F-14 fighters.Lithium is used in primary (non-rechargeable) as well as secondary(rechargeable) batteries. BlueStar Battery Systems Corp. (Jarretsville,Md.) offers two primary battery technologies-lithium sulfurdioxide (lithium SO2) and lithium manganese dioxide (lithiumMnO2) for military use in communications equipment, night-visiongoggles, chemical-agent monitors and the global positioningsatellite (GPS) systems. The batteries are said to operatedown to -40C and to offer immediate energy output even after10 years of inactivity.Ultralife Batteries Inc. (Montvale, N.J.). has developed a flatprofile prismatic system, dubbed the Thin Cell, that can beas thin as 0.5 mm. With a high ratio of active material topackaging, Thin Cell's capacity exceeds a claimed 200 mAh/cm3of material. It is light and has a flat discharge profile andlong shelf life. After 10 years in storage, the batteries,packaged in foil-plastic laminates pouches, reportedly retain80 percent of their initial capacity.One attribute of lithium batteries is that they can be usedin high-temperature applications. A lithium thionyl chloridemodel from Battery Engineering Inc. (Hyde Park, Mass.) thatis used mainly in oil and gas drilling operates at -55C to+200C and is said to have one of the highest energy densitiesof its kind.A manufacturer that specializes in lithium, Electrochem Industries(Clarence, N.Y.), also has products for such demanding applicationsas drilling equipment. Its PMX150 series lithium sulfuryl chlorideprimary battery has spirally wound construction and is typicallyused in downhole and high-temperature work. It is designedfor immediate power on demand or for intermittent operation.Tadiran's AA lithium thionyl chloride primary battery, whichwas selected for the battery-powered thermal instrumentationpackets in the space shuttle, handles a rated temperature rangeof -55C to +85C. But the units are claimed to have withstood+100C for extended periods during encapsulation.Many manufacturers have created batteries for special applicationsby changing their chemistry or introducing additives. As casein point is a lithium thionyl chloride technology that PowerConversion Inc. (Elmwood Park, N.J.) has dubbed PowerStart.It uses additives that modify the lithium protective surfaceand that prevent voltage delay.Conventional lithium batteries can exhibit voltage delay becausethey have a protective passivation layer on the lithium surface.Though the layer enhances shelf life, it blocks lithium iontransfer. That may cause a significant voltage drop upon theapplication of a pulse, accompanied by a slow recovery to thenominal operating voltage.With PowerStart, a lattice surface structure is formed that,while maintaining its protective function, does not significantlyblock the reaction sites. The pulse thus can be delivered withminimal voltage drop and rapid recovery. Power Conversion employsthe technology in its Eternalcell, which is used in applicationssuch as smart vending machines, home security systems and medicaldevices-requiring moderate power with varying pulse for whichan immediate response is desired.For commercial rechargeable lithium systems, lithium-ion technologyis most prominent. Sony Corp. (Park Ridge, N.J.) is consideredthe pioneer for its development of batteries for its camcorders.It is currently the largest manufacturer of lithium ion batteries,with about a 70 percent worldwide market share. Most of itsproducts are proprietary; besides camcorders, the cells gointo Walkman-type devices and laptop computers.Banning the boomInitially, lithium faced some recharging problems. Overchargingcaused explosions; the result is an airline ban against rechargeablelithium batteries with more than 5 grams of lithium-D. Suchcells must be shipped as special cargo.But industry solved that problem with innovative techniquessuch as development of lithium ion (no lithium metal) and asolid cathode. Ultralife Batteries has developed a lithiumion solid-polymer rechargeable battery that is safer than liquidlithium-ion technology. It reportedly provides design flexibility,costs less and is environmentally friendly. It can be workedinto flat-profile prismatic shapes with thin foil housings,customized to virtually any size and stacked in efficient,multicell configurations.Tadiran has taken a different approach to the issue of lithiummetal safety. The company has developed an electrochemicalsystem for its In-Charge rechargeable AA-size cylindrical cellsthat prevents hazardous events during electrical-abuse conditions.The innovation combines the battery's integral electrochemicalfail-safe mechanism with a built-in safety vent to provideultimate protection. Together, they deactivate the cell incase of abuses. The volumetric efficiency of Tadiran's lithiummetal technology exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries, accordingto Sol Jacobs, vice president of sales and marketing.One application in which lithium-ion rechargeables are replacingnickel cadmium chemistry is computer backup. Maxell Corp. ofAmerica (Fair Lawn, N.J.) has designed a coin-type MnO2 secondarybattery for CMOS-RAM backup in computers, calculators and faxand phone applications.Zinc air risesSony, Sanyo Energy (USA) Corp. (San Diego) and Toshiba AmericaInformation Systems (Irvine, Calif.) dominate the portablesmarket for lithium-ion batteries. Toshiba's top-of-the-lineTecra 700 series uses lithium ion with MaxTime Power Managementfor up to 5 hours of battery life. As demand increases forlonger battery hours and higher energy density in portableapplications, lithium technology is becoming more mainline.Even as lithium pushes into the mainstream, however, it mustface competitors in the battle to dominate the future. Zincair, which runs much longer than any other rechargeable chemistry,is gaining slow and steady acceptance.One manufacturer, AER Energy Resources Inc. (Smyrna, Ga.) hasbeen endorsed by two high-profile users of its auxiliary zincair cells: Toshiba and Hewlett-Packard Co. The AER Energy PowerProruns several models of Toshiba notebooks for up to 15 hourson a single charge, and the AER Energy PowerSlice LX runs theHP Omnibook 6000 series for up to 12 hours on a charge.Toshiba's battery options underscore the fact that, at leastin the short term, other chemistries are expected to coexistwith lithium as alternative technology. Toshiba, a leader inportable computers, offers optional battery packs in lithium,zinc air, NiMH and NiCd. Its Tecra 700 series comes with lithiumand MaxTime power management, which lets the user customizethe computer's power management to achieve maximum batterylife.Traditional chemistries are also making some headway, with newversions offerings higher densities. A breakthrough NiMH batteryfrom Panasonic Industrial Co. (Secaucus, N.J.) boasts 300 Whliter, which is claimed to be the highest available energydensity for a small secondary battery. The cell's high-levelvolumetric efficiency is usually found only in lithium metalbatteries.Designated the Super300 for its high energy density, the producthas a cylindrical cell shape that is suited for various typesof electronic equipment.On another front, Plainview Batteries Inc. (Plainview, N.Y.)has announced a plastic-cased prismatic NiMH cell-the PH 600that provides 600 mAh at 1.22 V/cell. It is encased in a strong,rigid, glassified polyimide plastic housing and is totallyinsulated except for the small, button-like contacts, bothlocated at the same end of the battery. The battery is targetedfor use in notebook computers, personal communication devicesand personal digital assistants.Despite such advances, however, lithium technology clearly hasthe momentum. As it matures, and as its prices decline andits market acceptance intensifies, lithium is expected to becomea dominant technology-though coexisting, to be sure, with NiMH,zinc-air and alkaline alternatives.Mohan Mankikar is president of Micro-Tech Consultants (SantaRosa, Calif.), a market-research and consulting firm that providesstandard multiclient studies and custom consulting in powersupplies.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Power Sources: Company ContactsAER Energy Resources Inc.1500 Wilson Way, Suite 250Smyrna, Ga. 30082(404) 433-2127Reader Service No. 579Battery Engineering Inc.1636 Hyde Park Ave.Hyde Park, Mass. 02106(617) 361-5733Reader Service No. 580BlueStar Battery Systems Corp.1704 Farmshire CourtJarretsville, Md. 21084(800) 542-3557Reader Service No. 582Duracell Inc.Berkshire Industrial ParkBethel, Conn. 06801(203) 796-4000Reader Service No. 583Electrochem IndustriesDivision of Wilson Greatbatch Ltd.10,000 Wehrle DriveClarence, N.Y. 14031(716) 759-6901Reader Service No. 584Energizer Power SystemsP.O.

Today's engineers must completemore projects in a shorter time and, thus, have less time tomeet with suppliers.That trend creates an opportunity for catalog distributors togive engineers faster access to a wealth of product informationthrough improved catalogs. The catalogs often contain not onlyproduct numbers, pricing and specifications but also the dimensionsand technical data that engineers require daily. The NewarkElectronics catalog, for example, contains more than 22,000technical drawings, in addition to pricing and specificationsfor more than 120,000 items from 290 major manufacturers.As the electronics market continues to grow and expand intoall areas of commerce and industry, the number of componentsand associated items has grown to monumental proportions. Thereare literally hundreds of manufacturers offering millions ofproducts. Because engineers do not have time to research allthe new products, they rely on catalog distributors to ensuretheir access to the best products for their particular projects.Accelerated production schedules also dictate that engineersspecify readily available products. Engineers do not have timeto go back and respecify individual components because theones they originally selected are out of stock. Catalog distributorsmust thus ensure that every featured product is stocked. Thedistributor may also stock additional products beyond thoseshown in the catalog.Engineers are not the only group finding time is in short supply.As manufacturers' sales representatives respond to engineeringcustomers from large accounts who demand more product research,technical support and value-added services, they have lesstime to spend on second- and third-tier accounts. As a result,engineers from smaller accounts have increasingly turned tocatalog distributors to meet their needs.Such customers often have the same needs as their larger counterparts,including requirements for such services as blanket orders,technical support, credit-card orders, dedicated inventory,not-in-catalog orders and more.Another trend reshaping today's electronics industry is vendorreduction. As more companies reduce their purchasing coststhrough vendor-reduction programs, broadline catalog distributorsare being asked to serve as electronic-components integratedsuppliers, from which customers can get one-stop shopping service.Catalog distributors must also continue to improve the way theycommunicate with both engineers and manufacturers. Today, forexample, most of Newark's purchases are being transmitted electronically.We are on-line with most of our largest suppliers for informationranging from pricing to technical data. And the growth of theInternet has the potential to revolutionize the way we alldo business.If there is one constant in the industry, it is change. Thosedistributors that respond to change proactively, rather thanreactively, will survive and prosper. Those that do not, willnot.Robert Ralston is vice president of Newark Electronics.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Packaging & Interconnections: Socket vendors get into PentiumPro actBy:Glenda DermanIntel's next-generation processor, the PentiumPro, has attractedthe attention of no fewer than a half-dozen vendors of sockets.Formerly known as the P6, the processor comes in a 2.46 x 2.66inch, 387-pin ceramic pin-grid array (PGA) with two cavitiesto accommodate separate die: one for the CPU and one for cache.A gold-plated, copper-tungsten heat spreader is attached tothe package.Intel specifies a "Socket 8" type unit for the PentiumPro, alow-insertion-contact socket of the sort used in products thattypically are not intended for microprocessor upgradability,such as file servers. For applications requiring upgradability,Intel requires the use of a zero-insertion-force (ZIF) version.AMP Inc. is among the socket vendors looking for a chunk ofthis market. The Harrisburg, Pa., company's single-level ZIFsocket on a 24 x 26 grid is available in limited quantities.Inductance on this low-profile socket averages 3 nH per contact,and resistance typically runs 10 to 12 milliohms per contact(20 milliohms maximum)Robinson Nugent (New Albany, Ind.) has added a single-level,through-hole ZIF version to its Socket 8 product line thatmeets Intel qualification requirements for the PentiumPro.Integral heat-sink tabs can be used with heat sinks from multiplevendors, and the insulator material, of high-temperature plastic,is appropriate for all soldering processes. Cost is under $7.75per unit for quantities of 50,000. Sockets will be availableon Jan. 1, and lead time will be four weeks.Project Resources Inc. (Wareham, Mass.) has added to its lineof Pentium-ready sockets a new Socket 8 type for the PentiumPro.The ZIF, interstitial-style PGA production socket comes withberyllium-copper or phosphorous-bronze contacts with gold platingsin a variety of thicknesses, and nickel underplating. The insulatorwill withstand vapor-phase soldering, the company said.The socket measures 67.2 x 82 mm and stands 7.9 mm high. Contactresistance is 15 milliohms maximum, current rating is 1 A maximumand inductance is 2 nH at l MHz. The socket is priced under$10 apiece in quantities of 500 units, and delivery is stockto four weeks.Meanwhile, Mill-Max Manufacturing Corp. (Oyster Bay, N.Y.) isoffering an LIF PGA production socket with a cutaway to permitextraction-tool access to the PentiumPro. Users insert theextraction tool-a simple pry bar that Mill-Max sells for 25cents each-between the socket insulator and the processor togain access without putting stress on the board or neighboringcomponents. Mill-Max uses a machined shell contact with a berylliumcopper spring for durability and ease of insertion.The Mill-Max LIF Socket 8 is an open-frame model that measures86 x 69 mm,and 4.6 mm high. Its nominal controlled impedanceis 50 ohms, and inductance is 1.9 nH. Tabs on the insulatorallow a fan sink to clip directly to the socket for heat dissipation.Typically too large to be handled by automated pick-and-placeequipment, these sockets are usually manually attached to boards.The sockets are priced at $8 per unit in quantity and are availableimmediately.Another LIF socket for the PentiumPro-from McKenzie Technology,a Berg Electronics company (Fremont, Calif.)-uses low-forcecontacts as well as an injection-molded socket body to producea low profile. McKenzie also offers an extraction tool that'sdesigned to prevent damage to the PGA during its removal. Theultralow-force socket has 10 microinches of gold in the contactarea. It costs $8.91 apiece in quantities of 10,000 units;lead time is two weeks. The extraction tool sells for $250each and is available from stock.Finally, a ZIF socket for the PentiumPro will join the LIF versionsavailable from Precicontact Inc. (Trevose, Pa.) by the endof January. The cost is expected to be about $8 in volume.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC ENGINEERING TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996  Issue 882Packaging & Interconnections: Company ContactsAMP Inc.P.O.

The deal, for an undisclosed sum, brings together two of thelargest U.S. arcade developers; the TWI division has found recentcoin-op success with "Primal Rage," "Area 51" and "T-MEK," whileWilliams Entertainment is known for its popular "Mortal Kombat"series, "NBA Jam," "Terminator 2" and "Killer Instinct."  It alsoadds another chapter to the ownership history of Time WarnerInteractive, which began as Atari Corp. before splitting off intoAtari Games Corp. a few years later.  It was then called TimeWarner Interactive and now reverts back to the Atari Games Corp.name.     Time Warner has been looking to reduce its large debt formonths, and last October the media giant shuffled its Burbank,Calif.-based Time Warner Interactive unit and WarnerActive underthe iNSCAPE umbrella, a joint venture between Michael Nash, HBO andWarner Music Group.     The Burbank office focused on creating CD-ROM games andInternet properties, while the much larger Milpitas divisiondeveloped arcade titles which it leveraged for home video gamesystems.  In 1995, it released five coin-op titles and 30 CD-ROMgames.     Reports first circulated that the Atari Games division was onthe block last December, with Acclaim Entertainment Inc. listed asa possible bidder.  But WMS returns Atari Games to its roots in thecoin-op world, and the deal is expected to close within two months. While strategy is being formulated, both companies have foundsuccess by translating hit arcade titles to home gaming platforms. Williams formerly had a licensing deal with Acclaim to port itstitles to the home, but now develops the versions in-house anddistributes through GT Interactive.  Atari Games recently launchedmultiple versions of Primal Rage, and is set to release homeversions of T-MEK this spring.     There is no word whether WMS will move the 300-person AtariGames Corp. out of the Silicon Valley or if layoffs are planned,but WMS officials said growing its coin-op business was a mainmotivator behind the purchase.  WMS reported revenues of $385million last year and income of $19 million.

Blank said the company has been through some"interesting shifts in the last three years," when it begancorporate life as a game console developer.     Rocket Science was founded in July 1993 (EGN, Feb. 19, p. 5),and was positioned as a great technology and graphics company. That was a time when the "hype of multimedia and Hollywood meetingin Silicon Valley was at its zenith," Blank said.  The reality was,however, that "the company was not a multimedia company, but anentertainment company in a hits-driven business."     In addition, while the company was founded on spectaculartechnology, "that did not default into great games," Blank said. Compounding the overall problem, according to Blank, "was a poorchoice of platforms to develop for."  The result was that RocketScience "produced weak games, with abysmal game play."     The irony was that Rocket Science had hired great talent fromHollywood effects and graphics communities, but their componentskill sets did not translate well into a game company environment.     Blank said that Rocket Science went through a period ofre-evaluation, and put together a 12-step program for reviving thecompany.  Rocket Science then committed to making majorrepositioning and structural changes.  Blank said the company is"now in the process of sitting and executing, and executing veryhard."  He quipped that employees of Rocket Science all wearbuttons around their work spaces that reflect the company's newoperating philosophy:  "It's the Game, Stupid."     Rocket Science also initiated an intense prototype processthat takes place before any art is submitted.  Blank said thatfunding the repositioning plan was made complicated by the factthat "the game console market has  collapsed dramatically over thepast two years."  The problem for Rocket Science and other gamedevelopers is that fixing companies takes time and money.  But,according to Blank, "multimedia is no longer a play for venturecapitalists.  Its an entertainment business."     That means that Rocket Science had to "reposition the companywhere the money is."  Blank said that the "money in the business isnow riding on three waves of platforms:  consoles, PCs and theInternet."     Despite the company's market travails, Blank said this is hissixth start-up, four of which have gone public, an option thatcould be in the cards for Rocket Science.  The company's Firewalker3D tool (developed in conjunction with Silicon Graphics Inc.;story, p. 4) is now coming to market, and dynamics of the Internetappear to offer game developers a strong vehicle for maximizing thevalue of established game titles.  Blank believes that RocketScience finally realized that what the company had to deliver waswhat the market was asking for.  The market always rules, accordingto Blank.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC GAMING NEWS via NewsNetMarch 18, 1996MAXIS SUPPORT BY PHONE IS AROUND THE CLOCK     It's 4:30 a.m. and SimCity's citizens are about to burn downthe courthouse because the command needed to lower taxes won'twork.  This sounds like a job for SimCity publisher Maxis and its24-hour support line.     Were it one year ago, they would not have been able to callthe number.  Digital Robespierres and Dantons would have burned thecity to the ground because Maxis' support number was responsiveonly Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.     Maxis realized that 12 support employees working 12 hours aday, five days a week simply was not enough, but the company couldnot afford to have support staff on duty around the clock. Originally, Maxis combined its technical support and customerservice departments, and even brought in temporary help, but thatstill was not enough.     Enter IntelliSystems.  Intelli-Systems breezed into thesupport center at Walnut Park, Calif., from Reno; it's an automaticInteractive Expert System designed to answer and solve mosttroubleshooting calls coming into a support center.     Maxis' finances ought to show how successful automation hasbeen:  savings since the installation in December 1994 andSeptember 1995 was close to $58,000.     The IntelliSystem program contains its knowledge in acentralized base that customers can access via telephone, fax,local access network or modem.  It can answer most calls becausethe majority of questions result from problems frequentlyencountered.     What makes IntelliSystem especially convenient is that callerscan ring up, get the answer to a problem, save the call with theprogram, hang up, try the solution and then call back.     Maxis Customer Support Manager Roger Johnsen said that acaller still can choose between a human or computer during normalhours.     "If I have a choice, I want the customer to speak to a supportrepresentative," Johnsen said.  "IntelliSystem provides anexcellent backup for peak periods.  Amazingly enough, people willopt for automation when they have the choice."     Other companies that use IntelliSystem include DigitalEquipment Corp., Adobe Systems and Virgin Interactive.

Thestudio began working with Rocket Science Games (see story, p. 2) onthe technology approximately one year ago, and their firstcommercial game from the alliance, "Ganymede," is expected to debutin December for the Sony PlayStation, and in the first quarter of1997 for personal computers.     "As a company committed to creatively pushing the envelope, weneeded a powerful authoring environment that allows us to focus oncompelling content and head-spinning game play," said Steve Blank,co-founder, chief executive officer and president of RocketScience.  Argonaut Technologies Ltd. joined in the party, too, whenit announced March 4 Silicon Studio had licensed its BRenderthree-dimensional rendering software and would integrate it intothe FireWalker products.     Sega Enterprises Ltd., Time Warner Interactive, SegaSoft andMediaX/Toonsmiths for the Grolier Interactive product "Surf andDestroy," will participate in the FireWalker Alpha Test Program.     FireWalker allows title designers to "drag and drop" anelement directly into the title and position elements in sceneswithout programming.  The software also supports dynamic access oftitle elements over the World Wide Web for authoring and playback. The complete system is expected to cost approximately $1,000 for asingle-seat license with no royalty fees.     Silicon Graphics also said March 4 that its line of workstations will run game programming tools for developing titles forvideo game consoles.  Sega's development tools division, CrossProducts Ltd., and Sony's game authoring division, Psygnosis Ltd.,said they would use Silicon's tools for the Sega Saturn and SonyPlayStation, respectively.

While every company thinks its future is interactive gaming,the questions of when and how publishers go about getting thereremain points of discussion.     Panelists were Johnny Wilson, Computer Gaming World; WilliamSimpson, The Dreamers' Guild; Neil Harris, vice president formarketing at Simultronics Corp. (Gemstone 3); Daniel Goldman, TotalEntertainment Network; Brian Moriarity, MPath; and Sheryl Gotto,Kesmai Corp.     Some of the issues discussed during the session included theevolution of economic models (free, pay for turn, pay for time andflat-rate pricing tiers), taking a game online or directly to theWeb, the various development models (for example, underwritten byan online service for an advance paid against royalties) and whatthe technology model allows publishers to provide online today. The audience was mostly game developers and online servicerepresentatives.What's Available     The presentation began with an overview of what actually isavailable today online.  Those types of games are mostly free fordownloading by electronic mail, and have no real business modelattached because there are no revenues generated.  There are,however, also "play for turn" games, whereby charges vary from alow of about $2 per turn to as high as $10 per turn.  According tothe speakers, those types of games will benefit from CyberCash andDigiCash services because the transactions are relatively small.     The consensus, however, was that the real money to be made isfound in the "pay for time," or real-time telecommunicationsconnections genre.  And those types of services will come tofruition over providers such as The Total Entertainment Network andMpath's network.     Kesmai Corp. representative Sheryl Gotto said her company doesnot produce any games that don't have an online capability.  "Allof Kesmai's games are developed from the network out," she said. The company's titles include "AirWarrior BattleTech" and "TheRealms Of Kesmai."     Gotto described the design characteristics in wide areanetwork (WAN) games vs. their boxed counterparts.  "If CD-ROMs arelike movies, then online behaves more like a soap opera because thecontent has to constantly evolve," she said.  Kesmai always hasused a "pay per second" model, but is going to flat-rate pricing. She said that it was an "interesting dilemma for a service that isresource-intensive."  It's a double-edged sword because "flat-ratepricing tiers attract more people, but the costs to provision arehigher because of telecom charges."  She went on to suggest that"multiplayer games are going to become a dominant part of theindustry," and that any provider "can't forget about themaintenance aspect of the game."     She cautioned that "once the game is released, that's just thebeginning."No Burn-Out     Daniel Goldman, chairman and president of San Francisco-basedTotal Entertainment Network, said that "multiplayer gaming is a lotmore compelling because players don't burn out on it because theuser base is constantly changing, as opposed to a single playerplaying a PC [personal computer] or game box."  He also said thatcustomer service is one of the biggest costs, but it's also anecessity because "so much of a network's success is going to bebased on word of mouth."  Goldman also said that competition is notthe only element that attracted players to online, "it's alsocooperation and chat functions," he said.  One of the company'smajor design thrusts is to minimize the impact of latency on gamesand gaming.     William Simpson of The Dreamers' Guild said that his companyis working with Microsoft Network, where the company exclusivelyprovisions its "Skulls, Bones and Buccaneers," "Online Baseball,""PlanetNet" and "Warlords of the Apocalypse" titles.  Simpson alsosaid that the "nature of the conduit is a major issue."     He noted that "unpredictability of the latency on the Web andits duration" are key issues.Never Alone?     Game designer Brian Moriarity of Mpath said that people likethe Web "because it satisfies the need not to be alone.  But todayit is a lonely experience."  He predicted, however, that "soon theWeb will begin to notice you."  And when that happens, the "Webwill become conversational, and therefore interactive."  Moriaritysaid that there are two real uses for the Web:     1.  Conversation.     2.  Interactive, multiplayer games.     He predicted that some day online games "will challenge, andeventually eclipse single-player games."  But what is necessary isan adequate network, sufficient users, and sufficient processingpower.  He said that what developers have been waiting for is achance to build the games, and an opportunity to find the pokerpartners to fund  these projects.     What will change the dynamic for online publishers, he said,is the "first big online hit."  In the not-too-distant future, anonline game "will become so popular that the network will bethreatened with collapse because of intense user interest."     Moriarity maintains that all publishers then will scramble toduplicate it.  He further said that that big online hit probablywill reach beyond the enthusiast segments.  For example, millionsof people liked Trivial Pursuit and the Rubick's Cube.  He said hebelieves that the game will have to be "simple to play, butdifficult to solve in totality."Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC GAMING NEWS via NewsNetMarch 18, 199610 Ways to Lose     Neil Harris, vice president of marketing for Simultronics,closed out the spirited session by listing the Top 10 Rules forLosing Money Online:     10.  Use repurposed content from another medium.     9.  Don't use investors or partners.     8.  Use PCs as servers.     7.  Do exclusive deals with distribution sources and networks.     6.  Focus on the newest technology.     5.  Ship it and then forget about it.     4.  Automate everything (no systems operators or livetechnical support).     3.  Focus on games with definite beginnings and endings.     2.  Flat-rate pricing.     1.  Don't provide users with communications capabilities.     While there was disagreement among the panelists about theimpact of online distribution on retail and distribution, everybodyagreed that a major component of those boxed assets will bedigital.  Moriarity said that "everything that is produced shouldbe designed to be downloaded, because there is a chance totranscend CD-ROM and packaging."  He also said that "theconvenience and economics of online distribution are irresistible."     That implies a profound social contract with customers. Suppliers will be handling customers directly, not throughintermediaries.  They will have to respect privacy and anonymity,treat adults like adults, and give parents the tools they need tomake informed decisions for their children.     Beyond that, the panelists said, the most productive thingsuppliers of online games can do is get out of the way and let thecustomer play.  Customers will be attracted to games that offer thehighest level of presence, with suppliers keeping low profiles.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC GAMING NEWS via NewsNetMarch 18, 1996SPECTRUM ANNOUNCES E3 LINE-UP     Spectrum HoloByte Inc. announced its product lineup for thisyear's Electronic Entertainment Expo, which will take place May16-18 in Los Angeles.

Anna Eshoo (D-CA) introduced the Online Parental ControlAct of 1996 (OPCA) March 14 to put the onus of child access to sexand violence on the Internet in the hands of parents and guardiansinstead of the federal government.     The OPCA would replace the term "indecency" standard of the1934 Telecommunications Act with "harmful to minors."  It alsowould establish a definition for that phrase.  In addition, theOPCA would:     *    Maintain the Communications Act of 1934's legal defensesagainst liability for people who choose to give parents technologythat blocks or restricts access to online materials deemed obsceneor harmful to minors and restricts access to such materials throughadult access codes or credit card numbers.     *    Add two new defenses:  the use of labeling or segregatingsystems to restrict access to online materials, such as systemsdeveloped using the standards designed by the Platform for InternetContent Selection project (PICS) and the use of other systems thatserve the same function of the other defenses if they are asreasonable, effective and appropriate as blocking, adult accesscode and labeling technologies.     *    Protect providers or users of interactive computerservices, information content providers and access softwareproviders from civil or criminal liability under state law formaking available to minors materials that are indecent or harmfulto minors if they take actions to qualify for the defensesmentioned above.     "I'd rather have Mom and Dad monitoring their children'sonline viewing habits than the government," Eshoo said, echoing aview shared by many in the online industry.

DOS; $50     Ten years after Tom Cruise's I'm-too-sexy-for-my-cockpit coolmade women swoon and men dream of downing Libyan aircraft, SpectrumHolobyte Inc. has released a "Top Gun" CD-ROM game that a spokesmansaid is not so much a flight simulator as it is an "action flyinggame."  But the action doesn't come into play until long after theplayer has mastered the flight controls.     Three reasons to leave this mostly uninteresting game on theshelf:     1)   Windows 95 Installation - If installed for play in MS-DOSmode, it reboots the computer before and after game play.  Ifinstalled for play in a DOS window in Windows 95, the video andaudio can be "choppy."  Annoying on both counts.     2)   Testosterone Level - Too high in some respects, such asthe co-pilot's adolescent sense of humor, and too low in others,such as the speed of action (e.g., far too much time is spentwaiting for takeoff).     3)   Music - A cover of Kenny Loggins' "Danger Zone."

"Civilization II" is the long-awaited update of its popularworld-building game.     Much has been improved since "Civ I."  The new interface isexcellent for managing complex data, and there are myriadcustomizable features, including the gender of the player (a nicePC - politically correct, mind you - touch).  Players familiar witholder versions may be shocked by the new hexagonal mapping. Annoyingly, there still is no option to quit to a main menu.  Setupis relatively trouble-free, although users should opt for the"maximum" hard disk requirements.     This game is not for the give-em-hell "Doom" crowd.  Itrequires patience and has a steep learning curve - and if theplayer learns the tricks of making friends and enemies,"Civilization II" will require more decisions than any reasonabledespot can handle.  But it is accessible enough for novices tolearn during play - with help from the manual, of course, whichreads like a good history textbook.  Like the original, this gameis addictive.

Windows 3.1, 95; $39.95     There's only one way to sum it up:  This is the Pied Piper ofHamelin Town, mysteriously moved to the Old West.  Rats, led byMephisto, a monstrous puppet that will scare off its intendedaudience rather than simply revolt them, spread across the goldrush town of Midas Valley in numbers that could rival Nosferatu'shorde.     Not surprisingly, a mysterious, dandified flautist appears outof nowhere with intentions to con, but ends up a hero.  It's notoriginal, but what fun is here is in the fact that your kids willget a kick out of using the mouse and you will think, "Geez, it'spretty neat what they put on computers nowadays!"     The role of the piper is played by White Mighty Morphin PowerRanger Jason David Frank, who will make the little girls pant andthe little boys gag.

Learn to love thegraphics, though.  First, because they're great, second becauseplayers see the same thing repeatedly.  However, trigger-happygamers will be pleased by "The Hive."  It's the player's job toshoot first, don't bother asking questions, shoot some more.     The plot requires a user to protect the galaxy from the evilMob, which plans to cause a major setback (to put it mildly) formankind by using genetically engineered creatures to create anultrafatal toxin.  While one or two plots or plans may come to mindas a means to counter the Mobster, "Hive" developers would have theplayer solve the problems by cremating everything in sight, andthen some.     One of the first titles to be created for the Windows 95operating system, "The Hive" does makes the most of it.  However,Trimark Interactive parent Trimark Holdings said in January that it"took a significant reserve" for the "Hive," which is part of thereason it reported its first quarterly loss in history.  Althoughthe company initially shipped more than 120,000 units of the game,retail sales were negatively affected "by the dramaticallysmaller-than-projected installed user base of the operatingsystem," according to the company.  SMBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC GAMING NEWS via NewsNetMarch 18, 1996SPYCRAFT:  The Great Game     Published by Activision     DOS, Windows 95; $49.95     It's tempting to dismiss any game that boasts a former CIAdirector and former KGB major general on the development team, but"Spycraft" manages to weave together an entertaining tale ofinternational intrigue through techno-puzzles and the occasionalgunfight.     A players begins the game as a CIA operative put in charge ofa mounting crisis:  an assassin has targeted the U.S. president onthe eve of his historic trip to Russia to sign a total nucleardisarmament treaty.  The action shuttles between CIA headquartersin Langley, Md., and sites around Moscow, as the player hunts downthe assassin from clues left around his previous attack on aRussian presidential candidate and the murder of a top CIAoperative in the United States.     Two of the best features of this title are the acting and theinterface.  Clever video shots and simple directorial touchesactually make this game seem like a TV movie at times, which is anaccomplishment for this industry.  The PDA interface, a common toolamong interactive movies, lets the player catch on video and audioe-mail messages, check the news, search through the archives ofvarious government agencies and even link to the Internet for clues(although, only on the Windows 95 version).

DOS, Mac; $35     For every annoying item that plagues "Angel Devoid" as aninteractive movie there is something equally good that shinesthrough to make this a promising game - but in the end you can'tbuild half a glider and expect it to fly.  In this case, Mindscapehas created a first-person sci-fi mystery with many of the samefeatures that made "Under a Killing Moon" from Access Software botha success and a failure.     "Angel Devoid" borrows liberally from cult classic"Bladerunner" to set the dark and seedy mood of this not-so-brightfuture.  Beginning the game as Jake Hard, a disgruntled cop on thecyberbeat, the player swaps identities (and faces) witharch-terrorist Angel Devoid after being on the losing end of ahigh-speed chase.  The rest of the game involves finding the realAngel Devoid while sidestepping the legions of cops and crooks thatare out for blood.     While the story is a cut above the usual cheesy scripts,navigating the multiple lines of play and various endings is atiring process, even with the helpful hints from Jake's PDA. Whereas "Under a Killing Moon" packed its scenes with many possibleinteractions, "Angel Devoid" ends up as an interactive story inwhich the action unfolds around the character instead of thecharacter really participating in events.

"AT&T's services such as Interchange ... and the ImagiNationNetwork are being spun off in favor of services such as WorldNet,"said Jonathan Erb, vice president of sales and marketing atImagiNation.  "Like most telecommunications companies, theyrealized that content is not something that they are necessarilygood at."     ImagiNation currently is looking for partners or investors tohelp it continue its business.  AT&T may stay on as a minorityinvestor, according to Erb.  "I wouldn't be surprised if they didremain a part of IN, it's a good learning ground."  Merrill Lynchhas been hired by AT&T to help package the network for alliancesand investment.     "The divestiture is a good opportunity for IN.  We can gobeyond relying on AT&T to help us acquire customers.  We can go topotential partners and offer them quick-to-market games," said Erb. He pointed out that, although the major commercial online servicesdo quite well at acquiring new members, "there's a pretty shallowoffering of high-quality games," such as tournaments that bringgamers back to the site repeatedly.  Although no deals have beenmade, Erb said, "MCI, Microsoft, AOL [America Online Inc.] andInternet service providers are all good examples of companies thatwould be good to work with."5 Years of Gaming Experience     ImagiNation Network offers five years of online gamingexperience, quite the veteran in this emerging market.  Inaddition, within the next few months it plans to launch CyberPark,a three-dimensional virtual reality environment withhigh-resolution graphics, animated characters and entertainment andinformation content.       "CyberPark, without a doubt, takes into account all of ourstrengths over the last five years," said Erb.  In addition,ImagiNation Network visitors spend, on average, one hour using theservice per visit, making it attractive for advertisers.     Concurrently, the network plans on releasing enhanced versionsof games now on the network and new additions.  "We now have cardand board games, role-playing games and action sports, but we'rebroadening the array and upgrading," said Erb.  Look for bigger,better, faster versions of football and baseball games, as well asnewcomers "Metal Storm" and "Bass Fishing."     AT&T bought the network from Sierra On-Line Inc. about 15months ago, although it had invested in the project earlier thanthat.  Five years ago, Sierra must have dusted off its crystal balland seen that, one day, a boxed game would have the same appeal tosome as a boxed lunch, while an online environment could offer asmorgasbord of entertainment.     Sierra is in the process of being acquired by CUCInternational Inc.     While the ImagiNation Network had hoped to run barefoot in theCyber Park, without a care in its three-dimensional virtual world,the online gaming network finds itself lacing up those wingtips,hitting the pavement and seeking business deals.  When itssurrogate parent, Ma Bell, recently put the service up foradoption, INN went home to its birth parent, Sierra On-Line, to getsome guidance to help it fend for itself in the real world.     As a result, INN announced March 13 it has signed licensingagreements with Sierra, making the network more attractive forpotential buyers.  INN's plan is to fatten up its 3-D environment,code-named Cyber Park, scheduled to debut this summer.     Cyber Park now will include Sierra's latest CD-ROM games inmultiplayer online versions including "Front Page Sports:  BaseballOnline," "Mission Force:  Cyberstorm," "The Incredible Machine 3,""Trophy Bass" and "Red Baron II."  "NTN Trivia" also will be partof CyberPark's lineup, as well as spades, hearts, backgammon,cribbage, gin, poker and bridge.  The company said it is innegotiations with other developers for additional entertainment,educational and information content and programming.     Cyber Park will premiere with more than 40 sites andbuildings, card and board games, as well as its own virtual moneysystem.

The number of e-mail users worldwide jumped from 71.73 millionat the end of the third quarter of 1995 to 90.96 million at the endof the year, a gain of 21 percent in that short amount of time.  Ayear ago, the worldwide e-mail census counted 52.2 millionmailboxes, suggesting an annual growth rate of 74 percent for theyear.     There are now 47.3 million local area network (LAN)e-mailboxes worldwide, up from 25.2 million a year ago.  There were29.7 million host-based mailboxes at the end of 1995, up from 19.9million at the end of 1994.  And there are just under 14 millionpublic e-mail subscriptions worldwide, up from 7 million a yearago.     As for the American share, EMMS estimates that roughly 68percent of the mailboxes are located within the United States. About 60 percent of the host mailboxes, 70 percent of the LANmailboxes and 80 percent of the public mailboxes are located withinthe United States, EMMS estimates.  That totals about 62.1 millione-mailboxes within the United States at year's end, and about 28.9million in other countries.     More than half of all e-mail users are now on LANs, the firsttime that threshold has been crossed.  About 52 percent of all theworld's e-mail users are on LANs, up from 48 percent at the end ofthe third quarter.  There were 47.3 million LAN e-mail usersworldwide at year's end, up from 34.4 million at the end ofSeptember.     Interestingly, the share of e-mail users on the publicmessaging networks also is rising.  At the end of 1994, about 13.6percent of the mailboxes were on public network services.  At theend of 1995, about 15.3 percent were on the public networks.Host Category Has Smaller Market Share     Obviously, the segment with a decreasing share of the marketis the host category.  This segment isn't contracting, but neitheris it growing as fast as the other two segments.  So the 4.5million unit gain in host mailboxes since the third quartertranslates to a 2.5 percent decline in market share (falling from35.2 percent to 32.7 percent).     Worldwide, the No. 1 messaging vendor continues to be IBMCorp.  Between its domination of the LAN segment and its 1995acquisition of Lotus Development Corp., and its continuing inertialmotion with the OfficeVision product family, IBM controls about25.5 percent of the private mailboxes worldwide.  That share isdown marginally from the end of the third quarter and a year ago,but is still far out in front of either Microsoft Corp. or DigitalEquipment Corp., the other contenders running in the money.     Interestingly, Microsoft Mail and cc:Mail once again are tiedfor the lead within the LAN category, as they were in the secondquarter of 1995.  cc:Mail was ahead a year ago.  MS Mail took thelead in the first quarter.  cc:Mail regained the lead in the thirdquarter.     What makes this dogfight significant is that Microsoft soldoff its Macintosh server-based MS Mail product line to StarNineCorp., now part of Quarterdeck Corp.  That resulted in its fallingwell behind cc:Mail in the tally three months ago.  But it has madeup the lost ground in the interim.     What makes this dogfight less significant is that bothcompanies are releasing new messaging product families.  Microsoftalready has Windows 95 and its Exchange Inbox on the market.  Itthereby has made e-mail, fax and Internet access a basic part ofthe operating system.     Lotus has delivered Notes Release 4, its big new messagingserver architecture.  And Microsoft expects to deliver ExchangeServer to the market in a matter of months (between one and 48months).  So while the installed bases of cc:Mail and MS Mail willprovide the companies with a ready list of upgrade prospects, theirrevenue and therefore their ultimate success will not depend ontheir respective mailbox client counts.  Messaging clients - atleast the basic inbox/outbox/address book package - essentiallyhave joined Web browsers and image viewers on the freeware pile.     The host messaging totals are up for three reasons.  First,Digital Equipment representatives insist they have 7 million usersof All-In-1 and MailWorks worldwide, not the 5 million reported inprevious EMMS reports.  So EMMS revised that figure to matchtheirs.  Likewise, Wang Laboratories Inc. complained of a750,000-user undercount, and Hewlett-Packard Co. reported an actualsales gain of 2 million mailboxes for OpenMail and OpenDesk.  Theend result of these and other readjustments is a jump of 4.5million mailboxes, to 29.7 million host mailboxes worldwide at theyear's conclusion.Public E-Mail Subscriptions Climb     The number of public e-mail subscriptions counted by EMMScontinues to climb.  America Online Inc. (AOL) widened its lead to4.5 million customers - almost a third of all public e-mail users. Amazingly, AOL has tripled its size since a year ago.  CompuServeInc., the former leader, added 1.5 million users during the yearbut grew only 59 percent while doing so.     It's a sign of how fast this segment is exploding that oneeven could consider 59 percent annual growth to be disappointing. By the way, AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy Services Co. together nowcontrol 72.4 percent of the customer base (but not the revenue). Add in newcomer Microsoft Network (MSN), and the Big 4 have 76.7percent of the world's public mailboxes.  And with AOL launchingacross Europe, MSN launching all over, and CompuServe alreadyworldwide, their global share is bound to increase in 1996.Others More Elusive     Further down the list of carriers, however, growth of any kindwas somewhat elusive.  Most of the traditional business-orientedpublic messaging carriers remained even, although some of theInternet access providers such as NetCom Online CommunicationServices Inc. reported huge gains.  As the chart on p. 4 shows,though, only nine carriers can claim more than 1 percent of theworld's e-mail subscriptions.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MAIL & MESSAGING SYSTEMS via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996GENERAL ELECTRIC TAKING INTERNET CONTRACT BIDS     Seeking to streamline its operations, General Electric Co.launched the GE Trading Process Network (TPN) Jan. 2 to letsuppliers bid for GE contracts over the Internet.  TPN primarilywill use electronic mail to solicit bids from outside contractors,and GE hopes to conduct about $1 billion in transactions over thenetwork this year.     This would quadruple the amount of online business-to-businesstransactions GE already handles through a private electronic datainterchange (EDI) network run by subsidiary GE Information Services(GEIS), which was roughly $250 million last year, according to acompany spokesman.  GE will distribute the TPN software tosuppliers that will be able to receive information from the WorldWide Web and submit bids for projects through e-mail.     The GEIS unit has been promoting this brand of electroniccommerce for online trading between companies as part of theInternational Business Exchange (IBEX) project, officially launchedlast September with AT&T Corp., Dun & Bradstreet Corp., the GlobalBusiness Alliance, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Chase ManhattanBank and other partners.  IBEX is promoting an electronicmail-based service for companies to solicit and bid on contractsonline.     IBEX has sold over 1,000 units of its software front-end sofar, but the company is hoping for more rapid growth after AT&T,Dun & Bradstreet and Simon & Schuster Inc. increase their marketingand sales efforts this month.  Also, IBEX plans to solidify itsrelationship with Microsoft Corp. soon so the service can beoffered to small businesses via the Microsoft Network by the end ofthe first quarter.     While GEIS is involved in this effort, its parent companyopted for a proprietary solution instead of IBEX for handling itsin-house suppliers.  According to a GEIS spokesman, the companystill is evaluating its relationship with IBEX, and is not surewhat role GE will play with IBEX in the future.     GEIS also announced a partnership last week with X-ChangeSoftware Inc. to expand GE's "Bid Board" service used forelectronic commerce transactions with the federal government.  TheBid Board lets companies access and respond to federal and stategovernment Requests for Quotes (RFQs), but the GE service has beenlimited to select military and civilian agencies.     GE plans to incorporate X-Change's X-Bid software, which isdesigned to collect RFQs from the Federal Acquisition ComputerNetwork, into Big Board to expand the number of agencies accessiblethrough the service.  X-Bid will interface with the differentagencies and automatically format a bid to fit within theirsystems' parameters.  The X-Bid system is based on EDI standards.

Rather than fight the move in German courts, or take time todevise a way to localize the news group blackout to selected areas,CompuServe simply stopped carrying the 200 titles on its servers. It thereby ends up with the enviable position of looking like avictim to the anti-censorship forces, and looking like a goodInternet citizen to parents, educators and others who might seesome value in the removal of alleged pornography from the Internet.     At first, the online service claimed it acted in response toan order from German authorities who had identified the news groupsas illegal under the country's law.  After a public outcry, Germanofficials appeared to backpedal by insisting they did not providethe online service with a list of targets, and CompuServe officialslater admitted they acted without any specific order from theauthorities.     The upshot of the verbal skirmish was that CompuServesubscribers worldwide, not just those in Germany, were affected bythe action, but by the end of last week the online service wastrying to find a way to restrict access only to its Germancustomers.  CompuServe spokeswoman Daphne Kent would not speculateas to when, or even if, access would be restored but said thecompany is "always concerned" that blocking access to informationcould cost it customers.  Kent said no other online service wassimilarly restricted and said "we were likely targeted because ofour size."     Although smaller than its chief competitor, America OnlineInc., CompuServe has the greatest overseas presence of any consumeronline service.  In Germany it claims 100,000 members.  The numberis insignificant, however, in comparison to the more than 1.8million individuals who use the Internet in Germany and whoseaccess to the same news groups is harder to restrict, dependingupon their method of access.     Kent said CompuServe is "looking at several options," amongthem implementing a system that would restrict access to newsgroups by region of the world and a "software solution" customizedto abide by each country's laws.Was This an Accident?     Observers note that even before the Germans providedCompuServe with an official excuse to censor, the carrier refusedto list the titles of many of the more risque (alt.) news groups inits index.  Users who knew the exact names of those unlisted groupsstill could subscribe, although all access is now cut off.     Across most of the media coverage of the CompuServe action,the spin put on the news was that governments were censoring theInternet.  It's happened in Singapore, Canada, Germany, and soonmay happen in the United States.  Internet users screamed theirrage in some undiplomatic postings, calling for boycotts ofeverything from CompuServe to German beer.     One question remains:  Suppose CompuServe had concluded thatbeing known as the family channel is desirable and profitable? Perhaps CompuServe, as it fends off AOL, Europe Online, theMicrosoft Network and other services in Germany, Britain andFrance, has discovered that parents are concerned about what theirkids are reading?  By cutting access to many of those XXX newsgroups that parents fear, CompuServe has made worldwide, mainstreamnews.  Does anyone believe this was an accident?     AOL, which recently launched a German online service withGerman publisher Bertelsmann AG that relies heavily onInternet-based content, has yet to encounter any similardifficulties.  AOL spokeswoman Pam McGraw said the company isinvestigating the CompuServe issue, but has yet to receive anynotification from the German authorities.     "To the best of our knowledge, we have not received anyrequests from the German government," she said.     However, McGraw added, AOL offers users the ability to blockaccess to news groups, which may be its saving grace.  AlthoughCompuServe's Internet division offers Internet access software withthe ability to block access to adult content, the company'sflagship online service does not offer the same capability.     CompuServe can be reached at (614) 538-4632.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MAIL & MESSAGING SYSTEMS via NewsNetJanuary 22, 199614TH ANNUAL READERS POLL BALLOTING IS UNDER WAY     As it has done every year since 1982, EMMS again is scanningthe world of electronic messaging, looking for the best of the yeargone by.     Once again, we're asking readers to vote for what they thinkwas the best messaging hardware, software, service and company ofthe year, as well as the most important messaging event of 1995.     It was extremely difficult to trim the list of nominees ineach category to 20 candidates.  Therefore, as always has been thecase, additional write-in votes are welcome and encouraged.     The voting was scheduled to begin over the weekend of Jan.19-21.  Everyone who has voted at least once since 1991 should havereceived a ballot in his or her mailbox.  People who voted but whodidn't receive a ballot by today should contact EMMS to find outwhy.  Most likely, some minor change in the voter's user name orhost name prevented EMMS from making a successful delivery.     People who haven't voted previously are welcome to do so. There are several options available.  Included in this issue is awritten ballot, which readers may complete and mail or fax back toEMMS.  Users who prefer an electronic ballot can send a request tothe mailbox earnum@attmail.com.  They automatically will receive aballot by return e-mail.     In addition, EMMS is posting a copy of this ballot to severalUsenet News Groups, including:          comp.dcom.fax          comp.dcom.modems          comp.groupware.groupwise          comp.mail.misc          comp.os.magic-cap          comp.os.ms-windows.apps.winsock.mail          comp.os.msdos.mail-news          comp.protocols.iso.x400          comp.protocols.iso.x400.gateway     It also will become available for down-loading from the EMMSpublisher's home page on the World Wide Web, at the addresshttp://brp.com.     As mentioned, the voting already has begun.  It is scheduledto conclude Saturday, Feb. 10, 1996, which allows readers aboutthree weeks to vote.  Ballots will be counted in the days thatfollow, and the results will be announced in four weeks, in theFeb. 19, 1996, issue of EMMS.Open to All E-Mail, Fax Users     As in past years, voting is open to all e-mail and fax users. Multiple votes from different people in the same company routinelyare received and counted.  Voters are encouraged to pass alongblank copies of the ballot to their friends and co-workers, to postcopies of the ballot on their internal bulletin boards, and tootherwise involve additional people in the process.     Multiple votes from the same person, however, are discouraged. Two good ways around that rule, however, are to register fivedifferent screen names on America Online Inc., and to vote fromeach one.     Alternatively, users can send e-mail ballots to EMMS via theirNetscape Navigator browsers, which allow users to change theirreturn addresses at will.  EMMS, however, uses a special tabulationalgorithm when multiple votes from the same source are discovered.     In years past, the number of voters has tended to surpass 450,involving people in more than a dozen countries.  It is hoped thatthe count this year will surpass those tallies.     Voting takes place in five categories:  Messaging Hardware ofthe Year, Messaging Software of the Year, Messaging Service of theYear, Messaging Company of the Year and Messaging Event of theYear.  Winners receive a certificate commemorating their receipt ofan "EMMSy Award," suitable for mounting.     This year, the hardware category is again dominated by modemsand fax machines.  There are, however, several personalcommunicators, scanners and voice mail systems on the list as well.     The software category is as usual the most competitive of thefive.  Only a small fraction of the total number of notablemessaging software products released in 1995 would fit on the list. They range from operating systems such as Windows 95 tomail-enabled applications such as Decisive Survey.  This categorymore than any other is a dependable source of write-in votes.     The messaging service category contains a diverse mix of voicemail services, wireless and satellite messaging carriers,Internet-related networks, and specialized offerings of the majoronline services.     The list of nominees in the messaging company categoryreflects the cross-section of nominees in the other categories. These are the companies that in some way made a name for themselvesduring the year - some through their arrival, others through theirreturn, and still others through their continued ability todominate their market niches.     And finally, the messaging event category contains a motleylist of trade shows, mergers, demos, lawsuits and productannouncements that helped shape the messaging industry in 1995.     Undoubtedly, there are products, services, companies andevents that didn't make it onto the list of nominees.  For thatreason, EMMS will list all of the top write-in vote-getters in theFeb. 19 issue, alongside the eventual winners.  On occasion, infact, a write-in nominee actually has won an award.     In addition to the list of winners and other top vote-getters,EMMS will publish a roster of all voters who check off the "Yes"box where it says "Please list me as a voter."  It's our way ofrecognizing the people who make this Readers Poll possible.  It'salso a way for readers to get their names immortalized in a varietyof online databases, news clipping services and other services thatcurrently carry electronic copies of EMMS.     Let the voting begin, and good luck to all the nominees.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MAIL & MESSAGING SYSTEMS via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996EMMS Stock Index Year in Review; EMMS STOCK INDEX UP 33% FOR THEYEAR     Despite the huge hit that computer and telecommunicationsstocks have taken in recent weeks, the EMMS index of 58 stocks wasup 33 percent for the year gone by.     The stocks fell 2.9 percent in the final month of 1995, theirthird monthly decline for the year and their biggest loss sinceNovember 1994.     Two stocks - General Magic Inc. and UUNET Technologies Inc. -began trading publicly for the first time during 1995 and thereforeare not included in the annual comparisons.  Companies such asLotus Development Corp., which were acquired by larger companiesduring the year, were subtracted from the annual comparisons.     In addition, because of acquisitions made during 1995,companies such as Netscape Communications Corp., Symantec Inc. andQuarterdeck Corp. shortly will join the EMMS index, as will severalother companies that completed initial public offerings in thelatter part of the year.  Finally, after decades of domination byvery large public companies (IBM Corp., Digital Equipment Corp.,MCI Communications Corp. and AT&T Corp. among them) and very smallprivate companies, a cluster of medium-sized messaging companies isnow listed on the stock exchanges.     Among the 58 stocks now included in the EMMS index, and thefive to 10 candidates for future inclusion, are a good number ofcompanies that make most or all of their sales in the messagingarena.  In fact, some of the Internet-related new issues of 1995were among the hottest stocks on the market - or they were fortheir first few weeks of trading, at least.Slow Compared to Others Indices     Compared to the major stock indices, the EMMS index actuallywas a little slow during 1995.  While the EMMS index was up 33percent, the NASDAQ Composite Index was up 40 percent.  TheStandard & Poor's 500 Index was up 34 percent, and the Dow JonesIndustrial Average was up 33 percent during the year.     However, EMMS dug up statistics for 1994 as well, anddiscovered something intriguing.  Compared to prices two years ago,the EMMS index is up almost 56 percent, while the NASDAQ is up 35percent, the S&P 500 up 32 percent, and the Dow up 36 percent.     In the accompanying chart on p. 13, the progress of the fourindices is compared, by setting each to equal 100 in December 1993. As the chart shows, each index took its dips during 1994, actuallydeclining in price for months at a time.     The EMMS index spent only three months of the last 24 belowits December 1993 price - May through July 1994.  It underwent analmost uninterrupted climb from November 1994 to November 1995 -peaking at a total 60.6 percent ahead of its 1993 close.     The Dow, meanwhile, set new highs in December, as did the S&P500.  The NASDAQ peaked in November, but none of the major indicesis as far ahead of its 1993 closing prices as the EMMS index.     The 56 stocks that traded for the entire year are listed indescending order in the chart to the right.  Of those on the list,43 were up while 13 were down.  Microlog Corp. posted the largestpercentage gain in 1995 - plus 641 percent - while Retix posted thelargest percentage decline -  minus 47 percent.  Eight stocks morethan doubled their per-share prices during the year.     U.S. Robotics Inc. posted the largest dollar gain per share -$66.13 - but percentagewise that represents only a quadrupling ofits price.  Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc.'s $26.25 gain was good fora 176 percent leap, while Microsoft's $26.62-per-share gain wasgood for only a 44 percent increase.     The Canadian carrier MPACT Immedia Inc., while up animpressive 273 percent for the year, was up by that percentage onlybecause its price was so low a year ago.  MPACT Immedia gained$3.25 a share to close the year at $4.44 per share.Items of Interest     *    The Federal Communications Commission gave its approvalto the Phoenix global alliance between Sprint Corp., DeutscheTelekom and France Telecom.

In the past few years there has been much progress in thedevelopment of products and services that automate virtuallyevery aspect of trade and transportation.  Because trade nowtakes place in a truly global marketplace, the competition hasbecome much more fierce.  Thus, companies are turning toautomation as a vehicle through which to attain a competitiveedge.  Today, executives of companies as large as IBM and assmall as the family-owned customs brokers, are focusing on waysto leverage strategic benefits that come from computerizing tradedata.     Every other week ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS willreport on the trends and developments that are changing the wayproducts are bought sold and moved.  Phillips Publishing isuniquely positioned to bring you this information because itsexperienced team of editors has been providing hard-hitting,analytical coverage of the competitive communications strategiesfor more than a decade.  Tim Shorrock, who has been reporting oninternational trade, transportation and the Pacific Rim for 10years, will continue as editor.  Now here's the news:Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJune 12, 1990NYNEX BUYS LAMARIAN SYSTEMS     Nynex Corp. took a major step toward its goal of becoming aglobal provider of business software and professional services bybuying Lamarian Systems Inc., the Greenbelt, Md., management andsystems consulting firm that specializes in transportation andinternational trade.  Under the terms of the acquisition,Lamarian will continue to operate independently as a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of Nynex International, which represents Nynex fromoffices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Geneva, London and New York.Strategic Alliances with PTTs     As one of the regional spinoffs of AT&T, Nynex is prohibitedfrom manufacturing equipment, providing interstate orinternational telephone services and selling informationservices.  But it can provide telecommunications gateways andvalue-added services, such as consulting or software.  To thisend, the company has established a string of what it calls"strategic alliances" with PTTs (postal, telephone and telegraphagencies) around the world.  In Europe, Nynex provides telephonenetwork management services to British Telecom and FranceTelecom; computer software to the British financial servicesindustry; and high-speed data and facsimile transmissions betweenScandinavia and the United States.     In Asia, the company has formed consulting relationshipswith PTTs in Japan, Australia, Singapore, the People's Republicof China and Taiwan.     Last year, Nynex signed a broad marketing and technicalagreement with Data Communications Corp. of South Korea (Dacom),a state-owned company that provides the gateway for all of thatcountry's EDI communications.     Nynex has also been scouring world markets for potentialacquisitions and, like several other Baby Bells, is deeplyinvolved in the cellular telephone industry in Europe.  "They'vegot money coming out of their ears," said a software vendorfamiliar with the company.     Overall, Nynex views its business mission as improvingtelecommunications services for its large multinationalcustomers.  The Lamarian acquisition "fits very nicely" into thatstrategy "because of the international nature of trade andtransportation," said Susan Simon, director of strategy assurancefor Nynex International, which is headquartered in White Plains,N.Y.  "We're really excited about the deal."Lamarian: Projects in Australia, Agreements with GEIS     For Lamarian, the link with Nynex will provide financialresources, technology and sales expertise as well as a presencein more than 70 countries.  Nynex also offers a sophisticatedlaboratory that can bring additional technology to the company."This is what we've been looking for for a long time--a worldwidereach," said Harry Latimer, president of the company, in aninterview with ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS.     Lamarian develops and markets software for governmentagencies and companies involved in international trade andtransportation.  It has extensive experience in the port andocean shipping industries and was the prime contractor for theU.S. Customs Service's Automated Commercial System.  Latimer hasa background in the trucking and rail industries, where he servedas MIS director for several leading carriers.     In recent years, Lamarian has staked out a strong positionin international transport services.  Among its current projects:      An EDI system for the Port of Melbourne, Australia.     Lamarian is also conducting a business needs analysis for     Tradegate, the Australian national port system.  This     summer, Latimer will be joining a tour of Australia with the     companies participating in Tradegate to market the concept     to other ports.  "Australia is a natural target for     expansion."      A contract with Columbus Lines, the West German steamship     line with offices in Hamburg and Newark, N.J., to develop an     EDI customer interface system for its U.S. customers that     will later be expanded into Australia, Germany and South     America.      Software development and information consulting for Racers,     the community information system for the ports of San     Francisco and Oakland, Calif.  Now in pilot stage, the     Racers system will include what Latimer calls a "simple EDI     mailbox" that will allow a user to convert a message into     EDI or facsimile and transmit electronically to another     party.  The system will also include an expert system that     will allow users to translate from one message to another.      An agreement with General Electric Information Services     (GEIS) to provide an electronic link with the U.S. Customs     Service's Automated Manifest System.  Using Lamarian's Ocean     Going Management System, forwarders, carriers and shippers     will be able to transmit manifest data to Customs via the     GEIS network, speeding up the process for cargo clearance.     All the information on the system will be in EDI format,     which will allow users to channel the data to home offices     and other parties.  Latimer said Lamarian is also working on     a tariff and booking interface for the system.     The non-exclusive remarketing alliance with GEIS willcontinue, despite the acquisition by Nynex.  "We think [the GEISagreement] is a very positive relationship and will bringadditional market coverage," said Nynex's Simon when asked ifGEIS might be viewed as a potential competitor in the interna-tional trade field.  Lamarian and GEIS were meeting last week toformulate their plans, according to Latimer.     Nynex and Lamarian will be announcing plans for othersoftware services and capabilities in a month.  "Our plan is towork together to grow Lamarian and make them stronger, bigger andbetter," said Simon.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJune 12, 1990THE SLOW PACE OF AUTOMATION  IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE     There was a sober undercurrent to the International Trade     and Computerization Show sponsored by the NCITD-     International TradeFacilitation Council in New York earlier this month.  Despitetremendous advances in computer and software technology and theobvious and pressing need for automation, it was clear that acomprehensive information system for handling the demands ofinternational transportation and logistics is still a long wayoff.     The difficulties facing the industry were underscored on theopening day of the conference, when the Federal MaritimeCommission (FMC), citing technical problems, cancelled a sessionon the FMC's long-awaited computerized database for ocean tariffrates (see p. 8).  They were also evident in many of theconference sessions devoted to EDI and automation, where speakersconsistently focused on the gap between what they want and theinformation products and services currently available on themarket.     Another sign of the complexities of international tradeautomation was the number of companies that didn't show up.Infonet Network Services, which 6 months ago announced a masterplan to develop a global EDI system for transport, was nowhere tobe seen.  AT&T and British Telecom, which are also aiming at theglobal logistics market, were absent as well.  The London-basedExport Network, which is reportedly having trouble lining upcustomers for its forwarder-shipper network (now months behindschedule) didn't send a representative, a strange move for acompany that has spent thousands of dollars to build a U.S.customer base.Some Signs of Optimism     To be sure, there were signs of optimism at the meeting.The U.S. Customs Service announced that it was seeking fundsto build an automated system for exports in cooperation with theCommerce Department.  Several firms displayed new, innovativeautomation packages for exports.  Financial services for trade,for so long the missing ingredient at these shows, finallyappeared to be making some progress.     And in a keynote speech, Lynn Fritz, president and soleshareholder of Fritz & Co., said the U.S. forwarding industry was"remarkably well-postured" to dominate the world market for tradeservices in a similar manner that American insurance andaccounting firms have dominated in their sectors.     But Fritz also issued a warning to firms that don't keep upwith customer demands for automation:  "Companies that don'tdeliver the goods...will suffer the modest pains of extinction,"he said.     In short, the NCITD show gave the appearance of an industrythat is treading water and waiting for something to happen.Participants and speakers identified 3 key problem areas:     The general lack of interest in EDI among small and mediumcompanies.  Currently, nearly half of the companies on theFortune 500 are using, or planning to use, EDI.  Even if theremaining 50 percent and the next tier of suppliers and customersbecomes EDI-capable in the 1990s as expected, that will stillleave thousands of companies hooked on paper.  "The vast majorityof shippers are not automated, and that's a big issue," said PanoAnthos, vice president of Syntra Ltd., a New York software housespecializing in international trade.     The continued use by the largest shippers--particularlymultinational corporations--of proprietary communications systemsand networks.  In several workshops it was noted that major U.S.firms doing business in Europe, including Ford Motor Co. and IBM,are not only using but expanding the private communicationsnetworks they use for international transactions.  "One reasonEDI is moving very, very slowly is because people are operatingin a proprietary environment," said Tony Barone, vice presidentof Randy International, a New York air freight forwarder that hasbeen using EDI for international communications for over a year."That makes it difficult to benefit if you're using EDI."     The frustrations of booking cargo electronically.  "Theproblem is, every [carrier] is different," said Duncan Alexander,director of export services for Johnson & Johnson Internationaland chairman of the NCITD's computerization committee.  "It'sjust not worth the trouble to go into each carrier's PC system."Hank Ulrich, president of H.B. Ulrich & Associates Inc., a"systems solutions" firm that works with Johnson & Johnson,complained that the major ocean carriers "have been talking EDIfor many years, but there's always something they can't do."  Fewcan offer the capabilities to accept electronic booking noticesor bills of lading, he noted.  Another serious drawback: theinability of most carriers to provide electronic confirmation ofdelivery.  "We have people who do nothing but call the airlines"to see if a shipment has arrived, said Barone.One Big Database?     To resolve these problems, some shipping executives haveproposed a "one-stop" data bank that would allow them to makebookings and receive confirmation statements on steamship lines(as well as air cargo carriers) using EDI.     In an interview, Johnson & Johnson's Alexander said heenvisions a "generic system" similar to the Sabre passengerreservation system that travel agents use to find available seatsand book flights.  "We'd like to have one telephone number tobook cargo in standard formats with every line," he said.     But past efforts in that direction have failed commercially.At the same time, carriers have balked at the "one-stop" ideabecause they believe a generic reservation system would exposeconfidential information.  "The problem is, carriers fear thattheir customer list would be made public," said R.T. Crowley, aformer steamship executive who now heads his own transportationconsulting firm, C.W. Consultants.  "That's one of the thingsthat will hold booking close to the lines."     Crowley suggested 2 alternatives: centralized bookingsystems operated by shipping conferences (an idea being pursuedby the Atlantic Conference); and a mailbox system operated by thevalue-added networks that would allow shippers to dial acarrier's mailbox and transmit shipping data.     But Alexander said the concept of a common database forshippers shouldn't be dismissed.  "Banks move billions of dollarsevery day by wire," he said.  "They've handled theconfidentiality problem.  If there can be a global market infinance and security trading, why not in transportation?"(NCITD, 350 Broadway, Suite 205, New York, NY 10013, 212/ 925-1400).Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJune 12, 1990     *Editor's Note: The next issue of ELECTRONIC TRADE &     *Editor's Note: The next issue of ELECTRONIC TRADE &TRANSPORT NEWS will report on the new products and servicesdisplayed at the NCITD meeting.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJune 12, 1990IBM LOGISTICS STRATEGY STILL A MYSTERY AFTER NCITD SESSION     IBM raised more questions than it answered at a May 31     presentation before the NCITD computerization committee.     The session, which focused on IBM's work to assist shippersand carriers in the integrated logistics and information systemsareas, sparked intense speculation, particularly among shippersand software vendors.  Would there be a major productannouncement?  Was the company going to disclose its list ofsoftware partnerships for trade and transport?Speculation prompted by IBM     These questions were prompted by IBM itself, which hasexpressed strong interest in the logistics industry.  Last year,executives from IBM's International Trade Solutions Group inBoulder, Colo., told us that it was developing products for theinternational trade market (see "IBM Readies 'Total Solution' forInternational Trade," COMPUTERS IN TRADE & TRANSPORT, October1989).     At the same time, other divisions of IBM have been active indeveloping data systems for the trucking and rail industry.  LastJanuary, IBM announced a joint venture with Motorola Inc. tomarket a nationwide network that will allow companies to providemobile workers with direct access to computer databases throughhand-held terminals built by Motorola and a radio network builtby IBM.                   According to John Pemberton, an IBManalyst with the Gartner Group, the company is also working on 2major projects in the mobile satellite/data communications area:an onboard PC that will be compatible with satellite-basedsystems for the trucking industry, built by such vendors asGeostar and Qualcomm; and an international mobile network forcompanies with large field operations, such as food franchisesand oil and gas companies.     On the carrier side, IBM is reportedly developing automatedcommunications dispatch systems for Consolidated Freightways,Roadway Inc. and J.B. Hunt--3 of the largest motor carriers inthe United States.  IBM is also working closely with Sea-LandService Inc. on automatic equipment identification systems forocean shipping and on Automatic Train Control Systems with CSXTransportation Inc.     "I'm getting some very strong indications there are somemajor things going on with IBM" in the logistics area, saidPemberton.Framework for Logistics     But NCITD members looking for an integrated automationsystem geared to the needs of shippers were disappointed.Instead, the group was presented with a pitch for IBM's latestproduct offerings in office technology and services, centeredaround IBM's Systems Application Architecture (SAA), a vehiclefor systems integration being marketed aggressively in the U.S.business community.     IBM, said David R. Livingstone, industry administrator forIBM's transportation industry marketing division based inSouthbury, Conn., is ready to "support the emergence of a generalframework for integrated logistics" and "end-to-end freightmovement."  To do that, "We now have all the products in place tocreate one single image of the enterprise...All the pieces arehere."  In areas where information gaps exist, Livingstone said,IBM is ready to work with customers on such new technologies asautomatic equipment identification, barcode scanning and high-performance databases.  Some examples:      For strategic planners, IBM will "put in your shoptomorrow" an Executive Information System based on the "OfficeVision" component of SAA that will allow executives to planmarketing, pricing, routing and scheduling of cargo.  The systemcan also be augmented by artificial intelligence (expert systems)for short-term forecasting and other functions.      In the air cargo industry, where all the players use paperand telephone and there is "no tactical, strategic or real-timedata for rapid delivery," IBM will provide a "simple relationaldatabase" that could be integrated with automatic equipmentidentification and radio-frequency barcoding to track containers.A similar framework is possible for ocean shipping.      To build that "single image" framework, IBM has available awide range of products, including EDI translation software andlocal area networks that will provide a "common user view from PCto mainframe."  IBM will even provide a mouse-driven graphicinterface that "resembles a video game" and requires "noknowledge of computers."      For companies that want to improve their control over theflow of paper, IBM has developed image processing software thatautomatically queues a document to the next person in the chainand allows a supervisor to prioritize documents and monitoremployees.  The software can be linked to a telephone switchingsystem that routes customer calls to a designated employee andsimultaneously recalls the image of the customer's document on acomputer screen.  Image-processing technology, said Livingstone,has many uses in transportation, including customer servicedepartments, inter-line cargo scheduling and exchanges of databetween freight forwarders and carriers.Internal IBM Strategies Unclear     In an interview, Livingstone said IBM's transportationstrategy was "reasonably well-integrated with other IBM groups."But it became clear during the presentation that the transportand international trade groups were not entirely in synch.     At one point, software executive Pano Anthos said that IBM'sintegrated approach would be "difficult to justify to seniormanagement" because there is no single depository for the carrierdata needed for a strategic analysis.  "Even the IBM network ismostly proprietary," he said.  "It would be helpful if acorporation selling a technology would be a leader in using thattechnology."     That prompted someone to ask if IBM's international tradesolutions group was using EDI standards.  The answer: no, thegroup uses internal standards.  In that case, what are your plansfor standards?  In international purchasing "we are moving in theareas of standards and will support the emergence" of Edifact,responded John Gates, a top executive with the group.     That apparent double-standard angered some participants."IBM has a lot of nerve talking about the carriers not connectingwhen the VANs have no interconnection abilities themselves," saidone executive.  Other participants said the presentation focusedtoo heavily on domestic carrier operations and questioned thewisdom of promoting image-processing technology at a time whenthe shipping community is trying to expand the use of EDI.     But the most scathing comment came from a systemsintegration specialist, who said the entire program was"inappropriate."  "This was only something IBM could have done,"he said.  "It really shows the clout of Big Blue...Do you thinkthat an Ordernet or a Kleinschmidt could have asked for an hourand a half on the NCITD agenda?  No way."Analyst View     Pemberton--who did not attend the session--said IBM'semphasis on systems architecture has important implications forthe logistics industry.  "We believe IBM is trying to extend theSAA architecture framework from the office out to fieldoperations," he said.  "That's maximum capture [of data].  DEC[Digital Equipment Corp.] and the other vendors aren't evenwatching the ball game on this one."     IBM's "end-game," he said, "isn't the dispatcher looking forsome better gadget to monitor something.  It's the informationsystem itself."  If IBM is successful in building a system thatcan integrate office communications, EDI and mobile satellitetechnology with the SAA platform, he said, "they're in fatcity...That's where they sell mainframes, AS-400s and everythingelse."Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJune 12, 1990CUSTOMS SEEKING FUNDS FOR EXPORT SYSTEM     The U.S. Customs Service has asked the Bush administration     to provide $40 million to allow Customs and the Census     Bureau to capture export data.  The proposed system, said     Samuel Banks, assistantcommissioner for commercial operations, would provide a tool forCustoms to communicate with customs agencies in other countriesand would simplify the classification of goods under theharmonized system.  "This is a major undertaking," he toldELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS.  "But we can't do it without acommitment" from the administration.     "As a unit volume, exports have increased substantiallysince the fourth quarter of 1982, to over 10 million per year,"Banks told the NCITD.  "We should have learned by now that wecan't always depend on other countries to tell us which of ourproducts have crossed their borders.  If we make this initiativework, the benefits will be immediate and substantial."Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJune 12, 1990FMC AUTOMATED TARIFF SYSTEM UNDER REVIEW     The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) abruptly cancelled ascheduled speech to the NCITD about the FMC's proposed system forautomating ocean freight rates May 30.  In a letter to the group,FMC Commissioner Rob Quartel said the speaker, James Warner,stayed in Washington because the FMC is "reviewing a number ofelements related to the development of the automated tarifffiling and information system (ATFI)."     The incident left many NCITD members wondering if there weredeeper political or technical problems with the system, which wasdesigned to computerize access to the thousands of ocean freightrates maintained by the FMC.  "There should have been arepresentative here to talk to people," said R.T. Crowley, atransportation consultant.  "This approach only caused rumors andspeculation."Problems with Contractor     Last summer, the FMC awarded contracts for the ATFI systemto Planning Research Corp. (PRC), a Virginia consulting firm, andDXI Inc., a Pittsburgh software vendor.  According to a sourceclose to the FMC, the agency has become "very dissatisfied withwhat PRC has done."  The source said the FMC is backing away fromits plans to build a large database for freight rates andstudying an "approach more like U.S. Customs" in which steamshiplines prepare and transmit shipping data directly to the agency.     Tariff filing is just one aspect of ATFI that's beingstudied, said Quartel, who spoke to ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORTNEWS last week to "end any uncertainty" about the automationproject.  Quartel, who chairs the FMC automation committee, saidthat while the FMC "doesn't know precisely where we are" onfiling, "our goal is to make it as easy as possible" for bothsmall and large carriers.  The FMC is also looking at how thefiling system will affect the agency's internal operations, andhas asked the contractors to survey other data products on themarket.Major Shift     In a significant shift from earlier plans, Quartel said hehad asked the contractors to change the interface technology onthe user side from dumb terminals to PCs.  The testing phase, hesaid, showed that the system "was not as user-friendly as wewould have liked it to have been."    Quartel said he is concerned that "the private sector ismoving faster and more innovatively than we might be, so I wantedto make sure we were on the right track from that standpoint."     "As a global issue," he continued, "we have to be verycognizant of moves towards the ending of paper...Ultimately,we've got to find a way to carry this electronically from thecreation of a contract between shipper and carrier all the waydown to the bill of lading and Customs.  Our goal is not to getin the way of that."     The FMC will issue a report on ATFI in several weeks andwill be asking for comments from ocean carriers and shippingconferences at that time, Quartel said.Back to Headline List WT03-B32-14IA059-000323-B023-47http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec103.html 205.156.212.5 19970114220755 text/html 40087HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 22:05:54 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:30 GMTContent-length: 39900Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec103.html Sample Issue Copyright FRANKLYNN PETERSON'S CPA COMPUTER REPORT via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES PLAN NOW FOR '96 (971 words) THE QUEST FOR A PROFITABLE CLIENT WRITE-UP (747 words) Comparison chart: Write-up Software for COMPARISON OF MAJOR WRITE-UP PROGRAMS This chart does not fit into the format required here.

We tied Motorola's new PowerSeries 28.8 Data/Fax Modem into thesubscriber database kept by Commence. It pulls asubscriber's record onscreen as wepick up the phone!Buzzwords to ignore in '96P6 PCs? No way! Even the most eager vendors can'tyet buy a model that works. YourP5 (Pentium) PCs won't become obsolete in '96.Another sure thing: When the nextchip's advertised, mark my word: it won't becalled a Sexium.Data warehousing? CPAs aren't the only onesdreaming of being able to list all thescattered company data in one virtual warehousethat lets any user access it oncommand. There's been progress-but don't expect astandard technology to be ready in'96.Internet commerce? Watch it stall in '96 as buyersget bored surfing the rubbish that'llglut the ether. (Example: one university's sellingads aimed at accountants surfing theiraccounting department's site.) Who'll make moneyon the Net?Computer hardware and software vendors, who'll cutreal-time tech support costs byside-tracking users to online support stations;vendors of products with nerd appeal, such as net-linked multiplayer games;overseas vendors of products that people can't (orwon't) buy face-to-face-so long asthey're delivered in plain wrappers. Congress willlearn that they can't pass lawsbanning international Internet commerce.Information extractors? Don't fall for this year'sreplacement for last decade's promise ofexpert systems. As your firm's shower of onlinedownload turns into a deluge, lots ofnew products will claim, in ads, to perform fast,intelligent information extraction.Prediction: Your brain won't always be faster, butit's far less likely to throw out thewheat with the chaff.Call for input: If your firm uses groupware ortelecommutes, please phone or fax yourcomments to 800-260-1120 for an upcoming report.Back to Headline List CopyrightFRANKLYNN PETERSON'S CPA COMPUTER REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996THE QUEST FOR A PROFITABLE CLIENT WRITE-UPINTROEver since CPAs started losing write-up businessto clients who think they can be theirown accountants using programs like One-Write Plusand Quicken, we've beenencouraging write-up software vendors to give usammunition to fight back. When I metwith a number of them in 1994, they agreed thatheftier write-up software could helpCPAs give clients management information theycan't get from low-end accountingsoftware.We're still waiting. All that's happened is thatone vendor I met with-Peachtree-dumpedits write-up program.The biggest hope for write-up's future is Windows,which can provide easy, effortlessdata swapping between compliant programs. Knowingthat, subscribers have beenphoning to ask about the Windows write-ups. Ourverdict: Sorry. First-generationWindows write-ups show promise, nothing more.So Rigotti & Assoc. of Taylor, MI, sticks withBusinessWorks (see review on p. 9). CPAMark Rigotti explains,  "It's medium-end, so onceyou get to know it well and become aqualified installer, you've opened up a practicein consulting."And some CPAs are moving back to write-upprograms. Reasons: For simple repetitivedata entry and reporting, they're faster. Andthree of them import client-enteredbookkeeping data in a flash-if they're teamed withthe same vendor's client program.CPAs dream of do-all write-upMcKee & Empsall of Malone, NY, still uses CreativeSolutions' Write-Up Solution II.CPA Bill Empsall calls it "a 1987-vintage product,hopelessly behind the times." Hisdream: "A trial balance and write-up program allin one with workpapers, ratios,indexing, analytical review-and a financialstatement report writer which uses drag-and-drop to build publication-quality financialstatements."Empsall says, "ATB for Windows, despite itsproblems, comes close in concept."Lacking: "An industry-standard database that areport writer can access." He adds,"Why is it necessary to have to learn two or moreprograms to service one client?"In concept, the AICPA's ATB Write-Up should bejust what the doctor ordered. Instead,it's just ATB audit with two extras: after-the-fact payroll processing and ability tocollect, format and print a limited range offinancial statements. Big pluses: It doesflexibly calculate company performance ratios. Andit's so similar to ATB, it's a faststudy for ATB users.Write-ups with client editionsThree write-ups-from Cold River, CreativeSolutions and SCS/Compute-havecompanion bookkeeping software that you can sellor recommend to small clients. Thepackages are set up to encourage your clients todo just data entry and turn to you foradjustments, monthly closings and financialanalysis.Cold River's Veritask for Windows has almostnothing new but its name. It's oldAccounting by Design, which Peachtree bought,named Crystal, renamed PeachtreeWriteup for Windows-and sold. Cold River plans toupdate it next year. Yet even withno overhaul in seven years, it holds its ownagainst costlier competitors.Its manual and clear screens guide you throughmoving data (via Windows links andimport/export) to and from nearly all vendors' taxand accounting programs. Warning: Ittakes several hours to set up the first customtransfer and an hour or two for eachsubsequent set-up. But once set up, each to/fromtemplate can be reused instantly.It imports client data with nearly no set-up timefrom Peachtree, Solomon III, GreatPlains (but not Dynamics) and some ComputerAssociates programs.CPA Walter F. Malcolm of Agawan, MA, describesSCS/Compute's Datawrite clientadd-on as "like QuickBooks with no GL so theintegrated AR, AP, Checkbook andPayroll can't post." Malcolm likes it because"with Datawrite holding the GL, there's nomuss, no fuss, no data input for the accountant."Bridging the CPA-client gapIf smaller clients insist on using QuickBooks orQuicken, Quick Write-Up II could beyour salvation. It imports Intuit's data into ACE,ACCPAC Plus, ATB, DacEasy,M*A*S 90, Veritask, Platinum, Write-Up SolutionII-or in comma-, space- or tab-delimited ASCII for none-of-the-aboves. Tip: Ifyour favorite in-house client write-up isnot listed, tell vendor Don Schuster. He sayshe'll try to add what you own to his exportlist.The utility is so adept, it took me a minute toinstall, 20 seconds to point it to Quickenfiles and tell it to move them into ATB, then 30seconds to decide whether it shouldinclude voided checks, omit zero'd subaccounts,etc. In less than two minutes more, ayear of Quicken data had been exported flawlesslyto ATB.Back to Headline List CopyrightFRANKLYNN PETERSON'S CPA COMPUTER REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996COMPARISON OF MAJOR WRITE-UP PROGRAMSThis chart does not fit into the format requiredhere.

With my last attempt to buy jeans still fresh in mymind--I must have tried on 100 pairs only to leave the storeempty-handed--I seized the opportunity to vent: "If you'reno longer shaped like an 18-year-old, it's impossible to finda pair of jeans that fit." He smiled and reassured me thatLevi Strauss has a solution up its sleeve (or cuff, as thecase may be). The company is experimenting with jeans tailoredprecisely to the customer's body shape, for a small extra fee.I haven't visited the Manhattan store that offers the serviceyet, but I will. It's no wonder Levi's jeans have been so popularfor nearly 150 years: The company understands--and reacts to-its customers' needs.Keeping the mass-market customer satisfied doesn't come quiteas naturally to the leading computer companies, many of whichare still getting used to the idea of becoming household names.Their marketing efforts have long focused on businesspeople,engineers and scientists, whose needs are much more specialized-and predictable--than the consumer at large. That helps explainwhy most computers look alike; gray or beige boxes with gianthard drives suited the traditional buyer just fine--isn't thatwhat consumers want, too? Truth is, there's no telling what"consumers" want, because there is no monolithic "consumer"community.But several companies are beginning to take their thinking beyondthe traditional box--literally and figuratively.  Computerindustry stalwarts including Oracle, Sun, Compaq and Apple havebegun talking in earnest about a new $500 consumer appliance,essentially a limited-function computer.  This machine wouldforgo the "more, more, more" philosophy of memory, storage andsoftware, instead housing just enough technology to perform thespecific functions a customer needs, such as accessing theInternet and perhaps downloading programs--needed to, say, edittext--from the global computer network temporarily.While it's doubtful these projects will be lightning bolts thatmake computers as common in American homes as TVs, they doshow a healthy desire among manufacturers to design productsfor different types of computer users. As it is, many of ususe only a fraction of the power and sophisticated capabilitiesof our home computers. Of course, some people want a Ferrariengine, even if they rarely drive over 65 mph; today's PCssuit them just fine. But for people who shy away from computers,an inexpensive, easy-to-use device could be the place to start.Indeed, in an industry that traditionally craves "bigger, better,faster," it's instructive that in our cover story, the ConsumerLab on printers (page 181), our jury's top nods often wentnot to the models whose print quality floored them, but tothose that offered high quality and a price that didn't gothrough the roof. Sometimes, less is more.Other companies are rethinking computer style Gear + Gadgets).Their new machines, with sleek angles and innovative shapes, lookmore like furniture than office machines and recall a fundamentalprinciple of design:  Form follows function.  Before long, forinstance, we could see PCs built into some new kitchens, fittingwith the decor of the microwave, oven and dishwasher.  Either atouch screen will offer a menu of options, or, better yet, we'lluse voice-recognition software to request a recipe while pullingthe ingredients out of the refrigerator.  (To see how twofamilies have redesigned their kitchens to accommodate today'sPCs, turn to page 174.)Will $500 PCs be a step toward making home computers as ubiquitousas toasters? I doubt that day will come as quickly as PC makerswould like; historically, people are slow to embrace change-consider that automated teller machines were introduced 20years ago, yet less than half the U.S. population uses themtoday.That's the same reason I think the media is jumping way aheadof the public when it comes to cyberspace. Some breathlessreports would have us believe Americans' TVs will soon be buriedin cobwebs, abandoned as we race off to surf the Web, engagein electronic chats and shop at our PCs. Novelty always makesfor an exciting story, but there are still far more peoplewho've never gone on-line than those who log on regularly.As usual, however, a kernel of truth lies under the hype. Newresearch from FIND/SVP and Grunwald Associates shows that nearlytwo-thirds of children in U.S. homes with PCs watch less TVbecause they're using computers; the figure rises to nearlythree-fourths in homes with multimedia computers. For a newgeneration, going on-line is becoming routine; many youngsters-and adults--are creating home pages on the World Wide Web.Perhaps the most exciting thing about the Web is that it's theultimate customizable medium--anyone can shape it to his orher own needs. It's similar to the lesson I believe companieswill need to learn in order to succeed in home computing: Onesize rarely fits all, and a custom fit is a welcome additionin any marketplace.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Letters: From 'phobe to WordphileI was delighted to see the way you summed up my story in yourNovember 1995 issue ("Computerphobe Contest Winners: AtlantaBrave," page 166).

How canI do this?A: Building custom desktops in Windows 95 is a snap. First,design a rough desktop that would work for all the membersof your household who use the PC. Shuffle the icons arounduntil you find a basic arrangement that seems logical. Then,make sure all your programs are listed on the Start menu. Ifany programs are missing, use a Windows 95 file-managementtool--either My Computer or Explorer--to drag the icons forthe missing applications onto the Start button.Now, open the Windows 95 Control Panel and double-click on thePasswords icon; you'll see two options at the top of the nextwindow. The first tells Windows 95 to use the same desktopeach time the computer starts up (this is the setting thatis currently active on your PC). The second tells the systemthat more than one person will use the PC, and that Windows95 should present each with a different desktop. Switch tothe second option.Two check boxes will appear in the lower half of this window.The first, "Include desktop icons and Network Neighborhoodcontents in user settings," tells Windows 95 to keep trackof the different desktop icon arrangements for you and, say,your kids; if you're connected to a network, it will do thesame for your network icons. This check box will already beselected, since you chose the multiuser option. The secondcheck box, "Include Start menu and Program groups in user settings,"instructs Windows 95 to show specified menu items and programgroups for each user; select this as well, and then click onOK. At this point, you'll be asked if you'd like to restartyour computer. Click on Yes.When the system reboots, a log-on window will appear as soonas Windows 95 finishes loading. Type your name, and enter thepassword you'd like to use. Windows 95 will ask you to confirmyour password by typing it a second time. When your passwordis accepted, the basic desktop you set up earlier will appearon the screen. You can now arrange its elements any way youlike, and the only way anyone will be able to use this desktop-or rearrange it--is to enter your name and password at thelog-on prompt.To set up a custom desktop for your kids, restart your PC, entera new name in the log-on window (for example, your child'sname, or a generic ID like "Kids"), supply and confirm a password,and you'll return to the default desktop, which you (or thedesignated user, once you pass along the name and passwordyou entered) can now modify. To see what some custom desktopsetup screens look like, see "A Visual Guide to Windows 95Shortcuts," which you'll find after page 306 in the November1995 issue of HomePC.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: This logo's got to goBy:Sean FultonQ: I've got a graphic I'd like to substitute for the Windowslogo that appears when I boot up my computer. Will Windows3.1 let me swap my preferred image for the standard logo?A: You bet. To do so, you'll need graphics software that canwork with .rle files, which are compressed graphic files. (Onepopular program that fits the bill is HiJaak Pro from InsetSystems.)First, look in your Windows system directory (C:\windows\system)and locate the vgalogo.rle file, which contains the Windowslogo that you want to replace. Rename this file as, say, oldlogo.rle,and save it, just in case you change your mind later and decideto put it back as a startup graphic.Next, use your graphics program to open the file you want touse for your personal logo and save it in the C:\windows\systemdirectory as vgalogo.rle. This puts your new graphic in theright place--but now you'll have to update win.com, the Windows3.1 program file, to make it aware of your new image.Open Windows' Main program group and double-click on the WindowsSetup icon. Pull down the Options menu and choose "Change systemsettings." When the settings window opens, note the name ofyour current video driver--you'll need to know it to finishthis setup.Your next step will be to change the video driver's specificationtemporarily. Click on the down-arrow button next to the videodriver and choose VGA from the list. This will change Windows'video driver to VGA, but, more important, it will force win.comto re-read the vgalogo.rle file you've just modified.Click on the OK button, and you'll be prompted to restart Windows-but don't do that yet. Instead, click on the Continue button,and follow the steps outlined above to put your video-driversetting back to what it was before.When the setting is restored, you can exit Windows and restartyour computer. When you do, the graphic you chose should bethere to welcome you back to Windows--it'll greet you at eachstartup until you decide to change it again.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: Going to pieces over file fragmentsBy:Sean FultonQ: I've been told that I should fix the file clusters on myhard disk so the disk isn't fragmented. When I run the DOSDefrag utility, it tells me I've got lost clusters, but itdoesn't help me solve the problem. What's wrong--and what canI do to fix it?A: DOS stores files in sets, known as clusters, or file allocationunits, which are fixed blocks of space on your computer's harddisk. A single file can take up many individual allocationunits, and DOS tracks them with directory structures and anindex called a file allocation table (FAT)Each time you work at your PC, files are created and deleted,and existing files may change size. Your computer won't necessarilystore a particular file in consecutive units of disk spaceas changes occur; instead, it chops up the file into fragmentsit places into various clusters across your hard disk.When you instruct your computer to open a file stored in piecesscattered all over your hard disk, your operating system hasto comb a lot of disk space to retrieve all the parts, whichslows system response. You can improve your PC's performanceby "defragging" the disk--in other words, rearranging the fragmenteddata on the hard disk so that it's again contained in contiguousunits. To run DOS's Defrag utility, simply type defrag at theDOS prompt.However, when a file isn't saved properly--for example, if yourPC's power is cut off while you're saving a file--the units,or clusters, to which the file's pieces are assigned won'tbe linked to the name of the file; they're considered "lost."The file's information isn't gone--it's still on your harddisk--but the operating system can no longer associate thoseclusters with a particular file. For the defragging procedureto be effective, you must first eliminate any lost clusterson your hard disk--otherwise the Defrag utility has to workaround them.To do this, use the ScanDisk utility (in DOS 6.2 and later versions;type scandisk at the DOS prompt) or the Chkdsk utility (inearlier versions of DOS; type chkdsk at the prompt). If theutility finds any lost clusters, you'll be given the optionto convert them into files for further inspection or deletethem. Check your DOS documentation to determine the best answerfor your situation.To keep your hard disk in peak condition, you should defragit every week or so. However, be sure to run ScanDisk or Chkdskfirst to make the process as effective as possible--and tobe sure your PC performs as efficiently as it can.These steps work for Windows 3.1 and DOS, but not for Windows95; the new system has a different defragging utility.

Can I connect my modemto my PC's speakers so that I'll know when someone finallypicks up at the other end?A: Most modems incorporate a speaker that allows you to heardial tones, busy signals or connection signals as the deviceattempts to link up with another computer. But this speakercuts off as soon as the connection's made, which means youneed a separate device to use your computer as a speakerphone.To hear what's going on over the phone line, you'll want a telephonycard--a single device that typically combines a sound cardand modem. These cards, which cost about $250, include connectorsfor speakers, a microphone and a telephone line; most are soldwith software that will give your computer more-advanced featuressuch as a speakerphone, voicemail capability, and even callerID, if it's available in your area.If your PC is already equipped for multimedia, it's a good ideato have your local computer dealer install the telephony card.This device will replace your existing modem and sound card,so you may need some extra hardware if your CD-ROM drive isconnected to the sound card; installation could be a bit ofa juggling act.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: CD? Can I make mine E?By:Sean FultonQ: I recently added a second hard drive to my PC, which runsWindows 3.1. The new drive is labeled C, and my old hard driveis now D; how do I label my CD-ROM drive E?A: Editing your PC's autoexec.bat file will do the trick; youcan use Windows' Notepad program in the Accessories programgroup to get to it.Before you start, though, it's essential to make a backup copyof your current autoexec.bat file. Once you've done that, locatethe line that reads C:\MSCDEX.EXE / /L:D. This is Microsoft's CD-ROM driver; one of its jobs isto tell the operating system how to refer to your CD-ROM drive.In our example above, and indicate variables that will differ depending on how your systemis set up. But don't worry about those; the /L: at the endis your focus.If it reads /L:D, as in our example, it's telling the driver torefer to your CD-ROM drive as drive D, which is common.  Tochange it to drive E, just replace the D with an E, so that theline reads C:\\MSCDEX.EXE //L:E.

My friend says that DX2 chips can'tbe upgraded to Pentium class. Is that true?A: Don't necessarily believe everything that your friends tellyou. If your PC's motherboard has a ZIF socket--and nearlyall DX2 computers do (check with the manufacturer if you'renot sure)--you can buy an Intel Pentium OverDrive processorthat will boost your 486 to Pentium-like speeds. Mind you,you won't get the blindingly fast performance that a top-ofthe-line P100, P120 or P133 chip delivers, but it will be quickerthan what you have now. A Pentium OverDrive processor willboost a 50-MHz DX2 PC to about 63 MHz, slightly faster thanthe slowest Pentium machines; a 66-MHz DX2 can be jolted to83 MHz. (For a complete look at the difference an OverDriveprocessor will make in a particular system, see Gear + Gadgets,November 1995.)Before you purchase an OverDrive chip, check with your PC maker'stechnical-support department or call Intel (800-538-3373) toconfirm that you'll be buying the correct processor for yoursystem, and to find out if you'll need to upgrade your computer'sBIOS (basic input-output system) in conjunction with the chipupgrade.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: When bad graphics happen to good PCsBy:Sean FultonQ: I have a 486/66 SLC2 PC with 8 megabytes of memory. WhenI play action games like Descent, the graphics are slow andchoppy. Can you suggest a way to improve the quality of thescreen images?A: There could be several causes of your problem. First, checkyour documentation or call your video card manufacturer tobe sure you have the latest video drivers for your card.If that's not the difficulty, your computer may be loading unnecessaryprograms when it starts up, eating into the memory availablefor your games. For instance, many DOS games have built-indisk-caching technology, which saves frequently used data inmemory rather than forcing the system to go to the hard diskconstantly to retrieve that data. In this case, DOS disk-cachingdrivers such as SmartDrive, which normally improve performance,just get in the way.For the best image quality, you should run your DOS games froma clean boot disk that doesn't load all your PC's drivers.One way to do this is to boot off a floppy you've set up asa game boot disk (see "Memory Not Included" in the December1994 issue of HomePC). Or, if you're using DOS 6.0 or a laterrelease, you can simply press the F8 key when "Starting MSDOS..." is displayed during your PC's startup routine. Thisinstructs DOS to ask for confirmation of the startup driversas they load (just hit "Y" for yes if you want DOS to loadeach particular driver). Be sure that you load your memorymanagers (himem.sys and emm386.exe), as well as your mousedriver (mouse. com or mouse.sys) if you need to use the mouseto play your game.If the game requires sound or CD-ROM support, such step-by-steploading of drivers can get tricky, since you may not know offhandexactly which drivers you'll need. In that case, I'd recommendyou check your game's documentation for tips on making a bootdisk.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: Lost in DoubleSpace?By:Sean FultonQ: I have a 386SX 25-MHz computer with an 85-MB hard drive thatI'm using with DoubleSpace. Can I install Windows 95 withoutremoving DoubleSpace?A: Disk compression utilities, including DoubleSpace, DriveSpaceand Stacker version 2.0 or later, won't stop you from installingWindows 95--but it may not be worth the trouble.If you decide to try it, first make sure you have at least 1.5megabytes (MB) of free space on your primary hard drive. Ifyou plan to use a permanent swap file--which boosts performanceby letting your PC use a portion of your hard drive as extramemory--make it at least 8 MB. Check your Windows documentationto learn how to set up a swap file on your computer, or howto adjust the size of the one you already have.Even with a swap file, though, your setup is going to pose someproblems for Windows 95. For example, to load the operatingsystem, you'll need at least 40 MB of free hard-drive space(more if you're not upgrading from an earlier version of Windows,or if you want to use programs written specifically for Windows95), and at least 8 MB of RAM for Windows 95 to run efficiently.You may also have a hard time finding Windows 95 device driversfor the older video and other peripheral cards you probablyhave in your computer.My advice? Skip the upgrade; you're better off putting the moneyyou save toward the purchase of a new PC with Windows 95 preinstalled.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: I need directory assistanceBy:Sean FultonQ: I created a directory called QTW11 -D on my Windows 3.1 PC,and now I want to delete it. But no matter what I do, I justcan't make it go away. Help!A: You're having trouble deleting the directory because theDOS command that removes directories, rmdir, can't handle namesthat have spaces in them; rmdir regards a space as the endof the directory name. You're going to have to do some fancyfootwork to get it to recognize the name of the directory youcite.To convince rmdir that the space is just another character,you have to use a special three-digit code as a stand-in forthe space within the directory name. Go to the DOS prompt andtype: rmdir qtw11, then hold down the Alt key and press 255on your numeric keypad. When you release the Alt key, you'llsee a space on the command line. Type the rest of the directoryname, -D, hit Return, and DOS will delete the offending directoryfrom your hard drive.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: Do you have a question for Dr. PC?By:Sean FultonDo you have a question for Dr. PC?

Here arefive hints to help.By:Phillip RobinsonImagine three people sitting side-by-side in front of computers.On the right is Bob, who's content with his Macintosh. Sure,he knows there's much more software available for PCs thanfor his Mac, but when he bought a new modem and scanner, hesimply clicked twice on the Install icon, and they were upand running in no time.On the left is Debbie; her PC runs Windows 3.1. She loves allthe new software she can buy, but new hardware's another story.She knows replacing her 14.4-Kbps modem with a 28.8 model wouldmake surfing the Internet twice as much fun, and a faster graphicscard would let her see the 3-D animation in the latest games,yet Debbie just can't forget how hard it was to install hersound card. She spent hours moving DIP switches, setting upjumpers, running configuration programs, fiddling with memorymanagement utilities, guessing what IRQs, I/O addresses andDMA channels were...and then, after all that, it still doesn'twork right some of the time.In the middle sits Kim. She's excited about her new PC, whichshe bought with Windows 95 installed. She can run most of thesame Windows programs Debbie enjoys, plus all the new softwarethat's designed just for Windows 95. Kim isn't worried abouthooking up her printer and monitor to the PC, or adding anynew hardware she wants to buy in the future; after all, Windows95 has Plug-and-Play. When she wants to install hardware, allshe has to do is plug in the device, click on the Add New Hardwareicon, and Windows 95 will automatically find it, set it upso it won't conflict with other devices, and install any filesshe needs to get it up and running.Just like a Mac.But Kim might be in for a surprise. Even with her new computerand Windows 95, she won't necessarily be able to install hardwareautomatically.Apple has been working for more than 10 years with a fairlysmall group of manufacturers that design hardware for the Mac;as a result, it's been relatively easy for the company to enforceits standards for its machine. Microsoft, which introducedPlug-and-Play support in Windows 95 less than six months ago,has been working with chip-maker Intel and PC hardware manufacturersto develop Plug-and-Play standards for only about two years.Then, consider that there are far more peripheral devices availablefor the PC than for the Mac, and that these devices come frommany different manufacturers, all of which work independentlyof Microsoft--the phrase "trying to herd cats" comes to mind.It will take years before all PC manufacturers conform to theWindows 95 standards.For now, when Kim--or any other Windows 95 customer--uses Plugand-Play, the PC may find and set up some peripherals justfine, set up other devices for mediocre performance, and notrecognize a few others at all. That's why some technology analystsrefer to Plug-and-Play as "Plug-and-Pray."Even so, most PC users will have an easier time installing hardwarewith Windows 95 than they ever did before. But if you use thenew operating system and your CD-ROM drive is running at halfthe speed you expected, or your monitor isn't displaying imagesat the high resolution you thought you paid for, or your soundcard isn't working at all, prayer probably won't make the devicerun more efficiently; the following five hints will.Make sure you have a Plug-and-Play BIOS.To make the most of Plug-and-Play, you may need to upgrade yourcomputer's basic input/output system (BIOS). Stored on a ROM(read-only memory) chip, BIOS software starts your PC, loadsthe operating system and then hands control of the PC overto it. The BIOS also contains the instructions that activateall your peripheral devices. A Plug-and-Play BIOS helps yourPC understand what hardware is plugged in, and it works withWindows 95 to coordinate the setup of those devices.If you bought a new PC from a major manufacturer during thisholiday season, odds are it will have a Plug-and-Play BIOS.If you bought a PC earlier in 1995, chances are good that it,too, has this type of BIOS.But if you bought your PC in 1994 or earlier, it's likely yourcomputer doesn't have a Plug-and-Play BIOS. If you're not sure,call the manufacturer's technical-support line. Or, on manyPCs, you can press F1 (or another key or keys; check your manual)while your computer is booting up to see its setup screen,which displays the BIOS version your PC uses, as well as otherinformation about your computer.If you don't have a Plug-and-Play BIOS, or if you suspect theremight be a newer version that simplifies hardware installationfor Windows 95, call your PC manufacturer to explore the possibilityof upgrading your ROM chip. (If your PC is very old, you maynot have the option to upgrade to a Plug-and-Play BIOS, thoughyou'll probably be able to run Windows 95.)Some PCs use a "flash ROM BIOS," a special kind of ROM chipthat lets you update the BIOS software without replacing thechip. Again, check with your PC manufacturer. If you have aflash ROM BIOS, you can get an update on disk from the manufacturer,or perhaps download it from an on-line service.If you don't have a Plug-and-Play BIOS and can't upgrade toone, you can still reap some of the benefits of Plug-and-Play.For instance, in many cases Windows 95 sets up peripheralssuch as a sound card, CD-ROM drive or printer automatically.On the downside, it may not recognize start-up devices suchas a hard drive, floppy drive or keyboard controller. You'llhave to set these up yourself, which requires the answers tosome technical questions from the hardware manual or the manufacturer.If you're buying a new PC, ask if its BIOS supports Plug-andPlay, and don't take "No" for an answer. Better still, thereply should be, "Yes, it's an ESCD Plug-and-Play BIOS." Thatmeans the BIOS creates an Extended System Configuration Datalist of any tricky changes you may have had to make manuallyto set up devices that Plug-and-Play couldn't handle on itsown. This list is stored on the BIOS chip, which retains theinformation when you turn off the PC, or even through a majorsystem crash.Buy Plug-and-Play peripherals.Windows 95 will try to install any peripheral you add, but itworks best with hardware that's designed to support Plug-andPlay; such devices identify themselves to Windows 95 and tellit what they need to run properly. Unfortunately, many of theperipherals in stores now--and most of those you probably ownalready--were not designed for Plug-and-Play.How do you know if a device supports Plug-and-Play when you'reshopping for new hardware? There's no independent testing servicefor Plug-and-Play compatibility, so the only way to be sureis to look on the peripheral's box for Microsoft's seal ofapproval: "Designed for Microsoft Windows 95." A manufacturermay claim that its product is "Plug-and-Play compatible," butbe skeptical, because such a claim without Microsoft's labellikely signals two things: The manufacturer believes the productis easy to set up, and it declined to pay Microsoft a fee totest it to make sure. Before you go shopping for hardware,ask for a list of products approved by Microsoft from its customerservice department (800-426-9400), its forum on CompuServe(Go MSL) or its World Wide Web site (http://www.microsoft.com)Get the latest drivers.Drivers are programs that help your peripherals and computerunderstand each other. They're like translators at the U.N.-without them, no communication occurs.Windows 95 includes drivers for the most popular peripherals.Drivers written specifically for particular devices obviouslydeliver the best possible performance for those models, becausethey adapt to and implement the devices' most sophisticatedand advanced features.Some drivers will work with a number of different peripherals.For example, Windows 95 includes drivers for the popular HewlettPackard ink jet printers; these drivers will work with mostink jets from other manufacturers, too, because they followstandards set by Hewlett-Packard. Similarly, most modems canpretend to be a Hayes modem, and most sound cards can use driversdesigned for the Creative Labs Sound Blaster.Windows 95 tries to assign a specific driver to each device.If it can't find one, it looks for a compatible generic driver.If it can't find even that, it will tell you so and ask fora disk with a suitable driver. (Most new peripherals are soldwith a floppy disk that contains such a driver.)If the disk includes a 32-bit Windows 95 driver, use it (checkthe manual or call the manufacturer to find out)--it will probablygive you even better performace than the generic drives thatare built into Windows 95. If one of your older devices hasjust a 16-bit DOS or Windows 3.1 driver, you're better offusing Windows 95's generic 32-bit drivers if you can; if thosedon't work, your only choice may be to use the 16-bit driveryou've got on the disk.If you're installing an older peripheral device, call the manufacturerto get the latest version of the driver. The company will sendit to you on disk, or tell you how to download it from an online bulletin board. Again, a specific 32-bit Windows 95 driveris best, but if you must use an older 16-bit Windows 3.1 driver,make sure it's the latest version. A new driver for your devicemost likely will have fewer bugs and work better with othernew hardware and software.Ask the Wizard.When you have the latest drivers, you're off to see the Wizard-a Windows 95 feature designed to help you through peripheralinstallation. Plug in the device, then click on the Windows95 Start button, highlight the Settings options, click on theControl Panel, then double-click on Add New Hardware to bringup the Add New Hardware Wizard. Click on the Next button, thenclick on Next again to instruct Windows 95 to find your device.If the Wizard finds your peripheral, it will try to installthe appropriate driver.If Windows 95 can't find your hardware, it will ask you to clickon Next to install the device manually. When you do so, you'llsee a list of hardware types: CD-ROM controllers, display adapters,video and game controllers, and so on. Click on the type ofdevice you're trying to install, then click on Next.For most types of devices, you'll see a list of manufacturers.Click on the one that made your device; then click on the particularmodel. If the manufacturer and model aren't listed, it meansWindows 95 doesn't include a specific driver for that device.You now have two choices: You can choose a compatible or genericdriver (look in the device's manual or call the manufacturerto see which of Windows 95's built-in drivers you should use),or you can install a new driver supplied by the device's manufacturer.To install the driver, click on Browse, locate the driver onyour floppy disk or CD-ROM, and then click on OK. Windows 95will copy the driver to your hard drive and add its name toits Registry file of drivers. The Wizard will also add a lineabout the driver to the autoexec.bat and config.sys files ifit's a 16-bit DOS driver. If Windows 95 doesn't find the driveron your floppy disk or CD-ROM, run the Windows 3.1 Installprogram, which you should find on the floppy or CD-ROM. Then,restart Windows 95 and return to the Add New Hardware Wizard.The driver should now be on your hard drive.If you're installing a device that isn't made for Plug-and-Play,you may see a message that tells you the device conflicts withhardware already in your PC. This is the toughest nut to crack.It means some other peripheral has already laid claim to aresource--an I/O port or memory address--that the device you'retrying to install needs for itself. The more devices you havethat aren't made for Plug-and-Play, the greater the chanceof such conflicts.Do a little troubleshooting.To see which device conflicts with the one you're trying toinstall, go back to the Control Panel, double-click on theSystem icon to bring up the System Properties window, thenclick on the Device Manager tab. You'll see a generic listof all the hardware hooked up to your PC. A "+" next to a devicemeans you can click on it to see its model name and manufacturer.An X through a device icon means it's been disabled. A circledexclamation point through a device icon indicates a problem.Double-click on any device icon that has an X or an exclamationpoint to get some details about the nature of the conflictbetween this device and the one you're trying to install. Underthe General tab, you'll see the type, manufacturer and versionof the device. You can also read about its status, includingany problems. Under the Driver tab, you can see the versionand location of any driver the device uses. Under the Resourcestab, you'll see the resources the device is using: I/O ports,memory addresses, interrupts (signals to the processor to stopdoing other work and turn to this device) and so on.If you know your way around a PC, you can assign the memoryaddresses and other resources each non-Plug-and-Play deviceshould use. But remember, if you make the wrong choices, yourdevice may not work, or you may even risk freezing your computer;in most cases, your best bet is to call the device's manufacturerfor technical support.To find a complete list of the resources your devices are using,click on the Computer icon at the top of the Device Managerlist and then click on the Properties button. If you want helpin assigning resources, double-click on the Start button, clickon Help, then double-click on Troubleshooting. Here, you canclick and double-click your way through a variety of suggestionson what to look for, and get some guidance concerning resourceassignments.Once the device is installed, make sure it's working at peaklevels. Go to the Control Panel and double-click on the iconfor the device (if you can't find it there, you may find itunder the System icon). Then click on the Properties buttonto see if the device is set for maximum performance. It probablywill be, but sometimes a generic driver assignment or anotherglitch can affect the setting. In that case, you can adjustmany of the settings simply by clicking on them. (For tipson how to do this, see Nuts + Bolts on page 215.)If you heed the five points above, you'll help Windows 95 recognizeand install hardware, whether or not it's designed for Plugand-Play.

After living overseas for two years, Lisa de Araujodeveloped a lingering fascination for all things Italian. ZoliNazaari-Uebele collects Barbie dolls and desperately wantsto fit one with a Pan Am stewardess outfit. Seven-year-oldEmma Bowen, who has a delightful English accent, hopes to visitLegoland in Denmark again next summer.I've never met any of these folks, yet I feel I know them well.They've all told me about their hobbies, shared some of theirsecrets, shown me family photos and even spoken to me. How?Jenny, Andy, Lisa and the others all have "home pages" on theWorld Wide Web, the multimedia section of the Internet youcan navigate with the click of a mouse button. All you needis a Web connection through a commercial on-line service oran Internet service provider, and Web browser software.Think of a home page as a cross between an autobiography anda billboard. It's the front door to the information you postthat dwells on the Internet. Once visitors enter, they'll seewhatever information you choose to share with them--perhapssomething about you, your family, your occupation or your hobbies.You can include photographs, sound, even home movies. You canalso highlight certain words--called hyperlinks, or links,for short--to provide instant one-click access to other pagesyou've created, or to pages you like that were designed byother people.IN THE BEGINNINGUntil 1994, most home pages were created by computer enthusiastsand college students with lots of time on their hands. Somepages were witty, many were informative--but most were aboutas engrossing as watching mold grow on stale bread. One guyposted a list of all the musical tapes in his collection; anotherfilled his page with a roster of all the computer classes offeredat his university--and one desperate soul posted a photo ofhis toenail clippings. Many pages looked like ransom notes,overflowing with randomly chosen type sizes and styles, andgaudy colors.But as new software made Internet access easier, more peoplebegan discovering the Web--a fact that didn't escape the noticeof corporations and advertising agencies, which soon beganexploring, too. Slick promotional sites and virtual storesbegan popping up in short order, featuring glitzy pages withsharp photos, sounds and videos. After seeing the possibilities,more individuals began investing the time to create enticinghome pages. Today, you can find everything on the Web fromthe daily news to health tips to video clips of windsurfersto a self-published book titled 54 Ways You Can Help the Homeless(for a small sampling of the variety of home pages on the Web,see the examples beginning at left)Equally important to the boom in personal home pages is thatthey've grown increasingly easy to produce. It no longer requiresa computer-science degree to create a home page using HyperTextMarkup Language (HTML), the standard format for writing Webpages; a little time, a dash of creativity and the right softwarewill do just fine. Take it from me: I know nothing about programmingor design, yet in about seven hours, I created my first sixlinked pages on the Web.My main page is called Cyber Ace, the name of the back-pagecolumn I write for HomePC. On my Web pages, I created hyperlinksto an autobiographical page, a page describing the Cyber Acecolumn, a page featuring a photo of my family's kittens andtwo pages describing my experiments with HTML code. There arealso nine links to other Web sites that are related to my lifein some way.My pages won't win any design awards, but I'm proud of them.There's no better way to entertain, inform or introduce yourselfto a worldwide audience at this price; just follow the stepsbelow, which outline the way I set up my own home page, andyou, too, can get entangled in the joys of the World Wide Web.LOOK FOR INSPIRATIONBefore starting your home page, look at what others have doneby clicking around existing home pages. Jot down notes on thestyles you like and the addresses (called Uniform ResourceLocators, or URLs) of attractive pages so you can go back laterfor a closer look. Don't be shy about borrowing good ideasyou see on the Web--in cyberspace, imitation is the sincerestform of flattery.While there's no "right" way to design a home page, it's a verygood idea to include a few common elements: a title, a messageexplaining what the page is about, brief biographical informationand a photo, a main topic, links to other Web pages and a wayfor visitors to comment. If you have more than one page, it'sgood form to put a link at the bottom of each page that willtake a visitor back to your home page with a single click.MAKE A PLANOnce you've toured Web sites, sketch out a basic layout foryour page on paper. What's the title? What's the first thingyou want visitors to see? Then what? Should you include a tableof contents? How will you link your pages? Do you want to includephotos and color graphics?CHOOSE YOUR TOOLSThere are two easy ways to build the content of your page. Youcan use a word-processing program with an add-on HTML converter,which lets you compose your page in English and then, withthe click of a button, convert everything to HTML code. Or,you can use an HTML editor, which lets you enter the properHTML coding--called tags--using a pull-down menu or keyboardshortcuts. (For a sampling of software options, see the boxbelow.)I chose an HTML editor, because it let me preview my work asI went along. Also, it let me learn a little about HTML; Ipicked up what HTML tags do pretty quickly, which let me typein new tags--say, to align words by a photo--that may not yetbe included in the conversion programs. To create my pages,I used a program for the Macintosh called BBEdit, which isavailable for free on the Web. I picked up additional tipsfrom some Web sitesand a few books.BREAKING THE CODEOnce you begin, you'll notice that virtually every HTML commandbegins and ends with a tag inside the "less than" and "greaterthan" symbols:  < >.  The only difference between the startingand ending command is the addition of a slash (/) to the latter.For example, every page on the Web begins with the tag  andends with  .  (Commands within the symbols are usuallywritten in capital letters.)  These tags tell a Web browser howyour page should look when viewed on a screen.Two commands you'll see frequently are , which breaks typeover two lines, and  , which breaks type over two lines andadds a line space in between.  You don't need an end tag aftereither of these commands.NAME YOUR PAGEPick a title for your home page; it will appear in the title barat the top of your Web browser.  To name my page Cyber Ace, Ityped this:  Cyber Ace It helps readers know what they're looking at if you place agraphical heading or title in large type across the top ofyour page; most often, it's the same as the title of your page.Basic HTML lets you use six text-heading levels--the type sizedecreases as you go from level 1 to level 6. Just as a largernewspaper headline generally flags a more important story,larger headings typically signal the major sections of yourhome page. A good rule of thumb is to put your main headingin H1, then use smaller sizes for subsequent headings.For my page, I spread the headline over two lines, making thesecond line a bit smaller than the first.  I used a pull-downmenu in the software to create the HTML tags for the headingsizes.  In HTML code, it looks like this:  The CyberAce "Your On-Line Tour Guide"  After applying the HTML code, I found it helpful to check outwhat it looked like through my Web browser, just to make sure itdelivered what I had in mind.  After every few lines, I saved thedocument and looked at it using the Preview command.  Aftergiving my headlines the once-over, it seemed to me they'd lookbetter centered on the page, so I added a center tag before andafter the text.  And since HomePC holds the trademark to the nameCyber Ace and the logo illustration, I consulted one of myguidebooks and found that I needed to type "(r)" immediatelyafter the word "Ace" to get the symbol to appear.  Putting it alltogether, here's how the headline looked in HTML:  The CyberAce(r) "Your On-Line Tour Guide" CREATE HYPERLINKSIf you have a large home page, you may want to create a tableof contents on top with hyperlinks to the sections visitorswill find below. You can also link to other Web pages you'vecreated or any other Web page you like.Don't go overboard when you designate hyperlinks from your homepage. Some people make virtually every word on their page alink, which is offputting to visitors. Similarly, designateonly a few words as a link, rather than a whole sentence--itworks just as well from the reader's perspective, and it'seasier on the eyes.For my first attempt, I put a direct link to my e-mail address.There are many ways to do this, but I selected a command known as"mailto" because it calls up a preaddressed form visitors can useto send me e-mail.  To link to my e-mail address, I created anHTML reference to it using a command known as HREF, then"anchored" the whole thing using the  and  commands.Trust me, it's less complicated than it sounds.  Here's what itlooks like:  Send questions and comments to:  The Cyber AceWhen viewed through a browser, it shows up as "Send questionsand comments to The Cyber Ace"; the last three words are highlightedin blue. A click on these words calls up a mail form addressedto eckhouse@cerf.net.Next, I added links to the HomePC home page and the Cyber Acecolumn within HomePC's site:  DecemberWhen a visitor clicks on the blue underlined word "December,"they'll jump to my column.USE HOT BUTTONSYou can also use a graphic as a hyperlink--called a hot button.A click on the image whisks a visitor to another Web page.For instance, on my autobiographical page, I added the CyberAce graphic as a link; clicking on it calls up my Cyber Acehome page. To do this, I created an "image tag" for the graphicby typing in the location of the artwork in relation to theHTML document on my server. It looks like this:This image tag must be included inside the opening and closingparts of an anchor tag, along with a reference that tellsvisitors where they'll go when they click on the link.  The imageof the Ace on my page takes visitors to the page namedcyberace.html.  I could align the words explaining this tovisitors with the top, middle or bottom of the graphic.  I wantedthe words centered, so I added the command "ALIGN=middle" to thefollowing line of code:   Return to the Cyber Ace pageADD SOME COLORA page without artwork won't draw much attention from visitors,so add some icons or color graphics, or scan in your own drawingsor photos. Most of the images you see on the Web are storedin the GIF or JPEG format. The software included with mosthome scanners and graphics programs gives you the option tostore images in one of these formats.Note just how much disk space each image you include demandsfrom your computer. On a Web page, the more large files, photosand graphics you use, the longer it takes your page to comeinto view on a visitor's screen--and the higher the risk readerswill grow impatient and move on. If you post a large photo,store it on a Web page by itself and link to it from your homepage. Next to the link, let viewers know how large the fileis to give them an idea of how long it will take to appearon their screens. This helps them decide whether it's goingto be worth the wait.For artwork to spice up your page, stop at the HTML GoodiesPage (http://www.cs. bgsu.edu/~jburns/gifs.html), where youcan stock up on icons, buttons, arrows and other graphics.You can also pick up GIF files of colorful textured and patternedbackgrounds at The Background Sampler (http://home.mcom. comhome/bg/backgrounds.html). I replaced the standard gray backgroundon my home page with a tan texture by storing a GIF file onmy hard drive and writing an HTML command calling for it justunder the title command of my Cyber Ace page:WATCH FOR TYPOSIf you're adding a background graphic, be sure to type the filename exactly as it's stored. I typed the file name in lowercasewhen it was written in capital letters, and it took me 10 minutesof trial and error to figure out why the background wasn'tshowing up on my page. I also discovered the hard way thatmany Web servers can't recognize certain characters in filenames, such as exclamation points, ampersands and spaces.STORE FILES WISELYIt's a good idea to store all your files--say, a few Web pagesor one home page and several graphics--in one folder on yourcomputer; this makes it easier to organize your files for aWeb server, a computer set up to send pages to other computers'browsers on request. Give your graphics the proper designation,such as a .gif or .jpg file-name extension.Also, if you have more than one file, you need to give the mainhome page--the intended starting point for visitors--a designatedfile name or extension, which will depend on the Web serveryou're using. For example, you may need to mark the main homepage as .default.html, .home.htm or .index.htm. This lets theWeb server know which page to dish up first when a browserasks for your file.USE A CHEAT SHEETIf you don't know the HTML code for a particular style, justcopy it from someone else's home page. Every page on the Webcontains the construction blueprint of HTML codes that wereused to create it. Simply go to the View pull-down menu onyour browser and click on Source.ADD A TEXT-ONLY OPTIONNot everyone on the Web has a browser that can view graphics,and some people turn off the graphics in order to speed uptheir flights around the Web. Also, many HTML commands workonly with the popular Netscape Navigator browser; people usingother browsers might not be able to see images on your page.It makes sense, therefore, to offer visitors a text-only version.It took me just a few seconds per page to delete the graphicalcommands.DISCOVER NEW TRICKSThere's a lot more to HTML, if you're interested. I learnedhow to make words blink, add pull-down menus and install adevice to count the visitors to my pages. I posted sampleson my practice page--drop by and view the code at http://techweb.cmp.comhpc/jeckhous/ experimental.html.FIND A WEB SERVERAfter you create your home pages, you'll need to post them ona Web server. If you wish, you can set up your own Web serverat home, but it's much easier to buy space on someone else's.Most Internet service providers rent space, as do some of thecommercial on-line services. You can find a list of Internetservice providers on the Web at http://thelist.com/.The fees for storing Web pages vary, so shop around. Expectto pay no less than $25 a month for about 5 megabytes of diskspace--ample room for several pages. Check to see if there'sa charge each time you change your pages. Most likely, you'lluse the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) feature of your browserto upload pages to your Internet service provider.When your Web pages are complete and stored on a Web server,your welcome mat is out and you're ready to invite the worldinto your cyberspace home. Let friends know about it throughe-mail, postings in on-line discussion groups and any otherway that comes to mind. Speaking of which, drop by my completedpage (http://techweb.cmp. com/hpc/jeckhous/cyberace.html) andlet me know what you think.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Designing a home page: Personal PageantryBy:John EckhouseVALLEY OF THE DOLLShttp://deepthought.armory.com/~zenugirl/barbie.htmlZoli Nazaari-Uebele says doll collecting is a fun, challengingactivity for adults.

Focus in on discs withstriking photos that liven up birthday cards, fliers, reportsand more in a flash.By:Tony RobertsA picture is worth a thousand words, folks say, so imagine howeloquent you'd be if you had hundreds of professional photographsat your fingertips. You could jazz up your music newsletterwith the image of a saxophone, give your sales presentationa boost by adding a slide of the space shuttle blasting off,even add sparkle to your screen saver with dazzling shots ofa fireworks display.Like clip art and display fonts, color photos add flash to yournewsletters, reports or presentations. And now that photo collectionsare available on CD-ROM, it's easy to find just the right picture;a single disc can hold more than 1,000 images. If you wantto add spice to your cooking newsletter, choose a gallery withphotos on a single theme, such as fruits and vegetables. Theimages in a disc of general photos, meanwhile, can come inhandy for everything from birthday cards to business fliers.Many CD-ROM photos can be imported directly into your desktoppublishing, graphics or presentation program, but others requirespecial software before you can use their images. (For tipson how to make sure the collection you choose is compatiblewith your software and hardware, as well as your needs, see"Formats in Focus" on page 138.)Most photo CD collections are royalty-free, which means youdon't have to pay an additional fee to use an image from thedisc in any document or item you create for personal use. Yourchild can go wild putting shots of lions in his or her schoolreport on nature, and you can use the photos in greeting cards,newsletters and, in many cases, advertising, promotional materialsand business presentations--although some collections restrictthe number of pieces you can print using any single image.You may even be able to use them in commercial products, suchas calendars or T-shirts, but you'll have to get permissionfirst. Other restrictions might also apply, so when you'reworking on a project that could run afoul of your license agreement-say, a print ad or a World Wide Web site--do some researchto be sure it's fair use.Remember, the images included in any CD-ROM collection reflectthe skill and artistry of the photographers involved; qualityvaries. On the following pages, you'll see some of the CD-ROMcolor-photo libraries we feel are sure to make you smile.First exposuresThe variety of pictures--2,500 images spanning 88 categories,including Agriculture, Fashion, Health Care, Occupations, Nature,Religion, Sports and Transportation--and a price that's hardto beat make PC Paintbrush PhotoLibrary a good way to startyour digital photo collection.

Here's what you need to know to besure a collection will work for you.* RESOLUTION: All photo images are bit-mapped--that is, they'rescanned and broken up into tiny pixels (dots), which are storedas digital information; the more pixels per inch, the higherthe resolution. If two photos are the same size, an image with1,024 by 768 pixels will contain more detail than one with640 by 480 pixels. Reducing an image packs more pixels in onesquare inch and boosts the resolution.* COLOR DEPTH: This refers to the number of distinct colorsan image can contain. Each pixel is made up of bits of data.A pixel that has 24 bits can be displayed in any of more than16 million colors, while an 8-bit pixel is limited to one of256 colors. Higher resolutions and greater color depths produceimages of better quality. But if your graphics card supportsa maximum of 256 colors, that's your limit, even if you'reworking with a 24-bit color image.* FORMAT: If you plan to print your documents professionally,your best bet is the Photo CD format, which uses 24-bit colorand provides five versions of the same image, ranging in sizefrom 128 by 192 pixels to 2,048 by 3,072 pixels; the lattercan be enlarged to the size of a magazine cover and still retainits sharpness. To open and store Photo CD images in a formatthat your word-processing, desktop-publishing or presentationprogram can use, you'll probably need image-manipulation software,such as Adobe Photoshop. You also need at least 16 megabytesof RAM to work with these images effectively.Some collections store high-resolution, 24-bit images in TIFFformat, which can be used directly with many Windows or Macintoshprograms that let you import images, or in PICT format foruse with Mac programs. The JPEG format, which supports 8- and24-bit color, works with both PC and Mac software; these filesare compressed to save hard drive space, and you may need specialsoftware to work with the data.For most home- and small-business projects--newsletters, fliers,reports, overhead transparencies and so forth--that will beoutput to a 300-by-300- or 600-by-600-dpi color ink jet printer,low-resolution (640-by-480, for example), 8-bit image fileswill do the trick. You can also use these photos for on-screenpresentations, or take them to a commercial service bureauthat can turn them into color slides. These images--which canbe stored in TIFF and PICT formats, and the BMP format forWindows--contain less data, so you need only 8 MB of RAM toopen and manipulate them. --T.R.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Empowering Tools--Assistive technology gives the disabled communityequal access to computing's benefits.By:Lynne S. DumasEleven years ago, a diving accident left Mary-Kay Webster aquadriplegic. It was a tragic event, but it didn't stop herfrom striving to lead an independent, productive life. Today,with the help of a laptop computer she controls by manipulatinga trackball (she retains limited wrist movement), Mary-Kayis an accountant for a local business, the Chesapeake PackagingCompany, working primarily from her Richmond, Va., home."One of the greatest frustrations since my accident has beenthat I can do just one thing at a time," she says. "But withmy computer, I can do three things at once--I can transmita report while I write a letter and work on a spreadsheet."This kind of perseverance with the help of technology is a familiarstory to Joseph Nagler, who runs the Center for Research inArts and Medicine at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicinein New York. "Home computers are tremendously empowering,"Nagler observes. "They promote inclusion and level life's playingfield by helping remove the barriers and stigma that oftenaccompany a disability."To reap these benefits, many people with disabilities rely onspecial hardware and software, or "assistive technology." Usingthese tools, individuals living with a variety of physicalchallenges, from arthritis to blindness, can command a PC morecomfortably--or, in some cases, use one when it previouslyhad seemed impossible.Jay Leventhal, a 37-year-old New Yorker, has been blind sincechildhood. From his early years into adulthood, Jay used materialsprinted in braille--not the most hospitable system for a writerwho wants to edit or update his work. Then, 10 years ago, Jaygot a PC equipped with a screen reader; this device works inconjunction with a speech synthesizer to recite the text that'son his computer screen, making it easier for him to read, writeand edit.These days, Jay, who works at the American Foundation for theBlind's Technology Center, is particularly pleased with theopportunities on-line connections present. He uses e-mail tocorrespond with friends around the world, something that wasdifficult or impossible before. "With e-mail and my screenreading program, my friends no longer have to worry about writingin a format I can read," Jay says. "And although there aren'tany daily newspapers in braille, now I can connect to CompuServeand keep informed with Associated Press news reports."As Mary-Kay, Jay and others with disabilities have learned,hardware, software and special computer gear can be a tremendoushelp in day-to-day living and in achieving personal goals.Below, you'll find a thumbnail guide to specialized computerproducts that can help you or someone you know.  Some solutions,such as wrist rests, are easy to use and inexpensive; others areelaborate and pricey.  Before picking a particular technology orproduct, consult a doctor, physical therapist or disabilitiesexpert to make sure it's the most appropriate choice.  For peoplein need who can't afford the more expensive products, equipmentdonations or grant programs sponsored by government, corporate,community and religious groups may be an option.  The Internetand commercial on-line services are also a gold mine of productinformation, inspiration and support for people with physicaldisabilities page 164)Each description that follows includes approximate costs, butbear in mind that prices vary widely. Since few computer storesstock these specialized products, we include the names of afew manufacturers in each category.MOTOR IMPAIRMENTSMotor problems range from minor restrictions on movement tocomplete paralysis. Accordingly, the assistive-technology solutionscover a wide range of conditions.* Wrist and arm supportProper support for wrists--and sometimes arms--can help easemovement problems at the computer, such as the wrist and handsoreness that occasionally accompanies a mild case of carpaltunnel syndrome or some forms of arthritis. Wrist rests andarmrests, available for use with either a keyboard or a mouse,will help maintain proper positioning.Prices: $10 to $25 for a wrist rest; rests for the entire lowerarm cost about $125 apiece.Manufacturers: Bucky Products, (800) 692-8259, (206) 545-8790;DeRoyal/LMB, (800) 541-3992, (615) 938-7828.* KeyboardsSpecial keyboards can help computer users with various disabilities.Options range from split models designed to make typing easieron hands and wrists (available at many computer stores) tospecialized alternate keyboards, which can assist people withmore severe movement problems.--Miniature keyboardsThe keys on these models are set very close together, whichallows people with a limited range of motion to use them withoutstraining.Prices: $400 to $1,500.Manufacturers: InTouch Systems, (800) 332-6244, (914) 354-7431;TASH, (800) 463-5685, (905) 686-4129.--Programmable keyboardsUsing a combination of special hardware and software, theseproducts let users customize the position, size and functionof individual keys. For instance, someone with a motor impairmentcan buy a board that has a few large keys preprogrammed toperform special functions. Instead of having to type "Hello,my name is Mary," for example, Mary could assign a key to thatphrase, which would appear on the screen whenever she pressedthat button.Prices: Range from $250 to $1,700, depending on the level ofsophistication and customization.Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;IntelliTools, (800) 899-6687, (415) 382-5959.--On-screen keyboardsThese are not keyboards in the traditional sense; rather, theyare software programs that display a standard or modified keyboardon the computer screen. Users can control this on-screen keyboardwith a mouse, touch screen or electronic pointing device.Prices: $100 to $1,200.Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;Words+, (800) 869-8521, (805) 266-8500.* Alternative data-input devicesSometimes, people who can't use a keyboard or mouse can substitutecomputer peripherals that let them control the computer witha nod of the head, the touch of an elbow or even the soundof their voice.--Wands or pointersThe simplest alternative input devices--typically held in thehand or mouth, or strapped to the head--are used to strikea regular or alternative keyboard.Prices: $20 to $120.Manufacturers: Extensions for Independence, (619) 423-1748;North Coast Medical, (800) 821-9319, (408) 283-1900.--Electronic pointersPeople with certain motor impairments may find it easier touse one of these devices--sometimes in the form of a stickerthat can be worn on the forehead, finger or foot. Electronicpointers allow the user to move the cursor on the screen andissue commands through ultrasound or an infrared beam. Forinstance, instead of striking keys or clicking a mouse, theindividual might manipulate the pointer to choose from sequentiallyhighlighted on-screen choices. These high-tech pointers workwith special hardware or software that interprets pointer commandsand gives users extensive control of their computers.Prices: $1,000 to $2,000.Manufacturers: Ability Research, (612) 939-0121; Madenta, (800)661-8406, (403) 450-8926.--SwitchesVarious parts of the body--for example, the elbow, foot or head-can control switches to issue computer commands and enterdata. Users can control almost any standard program by employinga switch that's linked to special software and a device thattranslates the switch's commands into information the computeris able to process.Prices: $30 to $100; any special interface devices and softwarewill cost a few hundred dollars more.Manufacturers: AbleNet, (800) 322-0956, (612) 379-0956; Toysfor Special Children, (800) 832-8697, (914) 478-0960.--TrackballsEssentially computer mice turned upside down, these data-inputdevices use a movable ball atop a fixed base. (Many laptopcomputers have built-in trackballs.) Rotating the ball withthe fingers, chin or another part of the body moves the computer'scursor and lets some users select from on-screen menus morecomfortably than a switch or pointer allows.Prices: $100 to $175; trackballs designed for people with particulardisabilities can cost $400 or more.Manufacturers: Kensington, (800) 535-4242, (415) 572-9675; Pennyand Giles, (800) 554-0220, (508) 226-3008.--Touch screensEither attached to or built into a computer monitor, touch screensfor home use are similar to those used in airport informationkiosks and on automated teller machines. By touching the screenover a particular option--say, to call up a menu item--theuser can see the desired information. In the home, touch screensare often used along with special software, such as on-screenkeyboards.Prices: $200 to $2,000; touch-screen overlays generally costless than complete monitors.Manufacturers: Edmark, (800) 426-0856, (206) 556-8400; MicroTouchSystems, (800) 642-7686, (508) 659-9000.--Voice-recognition systemsPeople with severe motor impairments can control computers withthese systems, which combine hardware and software that allowthe user to tell the computer what functions to carry out-just say "close file" or "print," for example, and the machinecomplies.Some voice-recognition systems handle only a limited numberof preset basic commands. If these are too bare-bones, moreadvanced dictation systems may be the answer; these productsrecognize an extensive vocabulary of spoken words, allowingusers to perform any number of tasks, such as dictating a letter.Prices: $400 to $1,000.Manufacturers: Apple Disabilities Solutions Group, (800) 6007808, (408) 996-1010; Dragon Systems, (800) 825-5897, (617)965-5200.--Word-prediction softwareTypically used in conjunction with a word- processing program,these packages cut down on the number of keystrokes or otherphysical motions required to feed information to the computer.Using a keyboard or alternative input device to specify thefirst few letters of a word, the software presents an on-screenlist of choices to complete the thought. For example, the lettersB-E might bring up "bell," "better," "best" and "because."Choose the right word and the software drops it into the documenton the screen.Prices: $250 to $700.Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;Words+, (800) 869-8521, (805) 266-8500.HEARING IMPAIRMENTSComputers set up with "auditory alerts"--such as beeps or bongs-to relay information pose problems for users with hearingimpairments. There are a couple of easy ways to address thisproblem.If you or someone you know uses a Macintosh, adjust the SpeakerVolume setting (you'll find it in the Sound control panel)to zero; then, instead of making a sound, the computer willflash a visual cue. PC users who are running Windows 95 canmake a similar adjustment. (For more on Windows 95's featuresfor disabled users, see page 160.) For other PC operating systems,add-in utilities are available to change auditory alerts tovisual cues. These packages generally cost around $20 fromvendors such as Microsystems Software, (800) 828-2600, (508)879-9000.SPEECH IMPAIRMENTSFor almost as long as PCs have been in use, people who can'tspeak have employed them to communicate more easily, typingtheir thoughts at the keyboard. But even with assistive technology,one of the biggest frustrations in nonverbal communicationis the inability to express a thought quickly. Consider this When most of us speak, we deliver our thoughts at a rate somewherebetween 120 and 180 words per minute. How many of us can typeanywhere near that fast? On top of that challenge, speech impairmentscan be associated with a range of motor difficulties, suchas paralysis.Some of the products mentioned above, such as word-predictionsoftware, can help speed communication for people with speechand/or motor impairments. And when necessary, computer systemssuch as the products mentioned below can literally speak forthese individuals.* Speech SynthesizersSeveral products for people with severe speech impairments workin conjunction with a speech or voice synthesizer that enablesthe computer to "talk." Speech synthesizers are built intoall recent Macintosh models; PC users can buy an internal deviceor an external synthesizer that plugs into their computer.Prices: $100 to $400, but advanced models with output that moreclosely resembles a human voice can cost as much as $2,500.Manufacturers: American Printing House for the Blind, (800)287-4204, (502) 895-2405; Echo Speech, (800) 377-3246, (805)684-4593.* Conversation softwareUsed primarily with portable computers equipped with a speechsynthesizer, these programs let people with severe vocal impairments"speak," whether they're at home or out on the road with anotebook. As a result, it's easier for nonspeaking individualsto participate in social conversations; they can initiate dialogues,answer queries and make jokes with the tap of a key. For instance,by clicking on a screen icon or choosing a menu option, a usercan command a computer-synthesized voice to say "Hi, how areyou?" Some programs allow the user to type in more extensiveinformation--for example, an account of how he or she spentthe weekend--and store the anecdotes until the user is readyto play the speech back for a friend.Prices: $100 to $500.Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;Microsystems Software, (800) 828-2600, (508) 879-9000.* Talking word processorsCombining a word-processing program and a voice synthesizer,these programs repeat text aloud after it's been entered intothe computer.Prices: $100 to $500.Manufacturers: IntelliTools, (800) 899-6687, (415) 382-5959;Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682.VISUAL IMPAIRMENTSIn addition to the talking word processors, voice-recognitionsystems and speech synthesizers mentioned earlier, the followingtechnologies can help people with partial or total vision losstake advantage of the best that computers have to offer.* Screen-enlargement programsThese programs may prove helpful for people with diminishedvision by magnifying computer-screen text and graphics to makeit easier to read. Individuals simply run this software inconjunction with a word processor, spreadsheet or other softwareprogram. Be aware, though, that even when used with a largescreen monitor, essential information can be pushed off theviewing area when the text is enlarged. Before selecting ascreen-enlargement program, it's a good idea to check withthe manufacturer or seek the advice of someone familiar withthe program who knows how it works with specific software packages.Prices: $250 to $500.Manufacturers: Ai Squared, (802) 362-3612; Microsystems Software(800) 828-2600, (508) 879-9000.* Screen readersLike Jay Leventhal at the American Foundation for the Blind,people who are visually impaired can benefit from softwarethat works with a speech synthesizer to read aloud whatever'son the screen (including menu options, as well as words andnumbers)Prices: $150 to $500.Manufacturers: Berkeley Access, (510) 883-6280; MicrosystemsSoftware (800) 828-2600, (508) 879-9000.* Braille devicesRefreshable braille computer displays translate what's on thePC screen into the printed language used by visually impairedor blind readers. These displays are called "refreshable" becausethe braille characters--formed by small, rounded pins--changeto display each line of on-screen text. Another option is abraille printer.Prices: $5,000 to $12,000 for braille computer displays; $2,000to $6,000 for braille printers.Manufacturers: American Thermoform, (800) 331-3676, (213) 7239021; TeleSensory, (800) 286-8484, (415) 960-0920.Lynne S.

Even though their center-hall colonial is a roomy3,000 square feet, Nina, a full-time homemaker, knew she'dbe spending a good part of her day in the kitchen, so she andDavid decided to remodel the room and create a multipurpose"family" center. As part of that plan, the couple felt it wouldbe the perfect spot for the family computer."We could have put the PC in one of the children's rooms, orin our den or basement playroom," Nina explains, "but it mademore sense to us to place it in the kitchen, where it's soeasy for all of us to spend time together."The Spiegelmans--like the Johns, who are profiled on the nextpage--hit on an old idea that's gaining new popularity amongfamilies remodeling their homes: using the kitchen as a magnetfor family activities, the room to which everyone in the housegravitates after going their various ways each day.A 20-BY-30-FOOT KNOCKOUTTo remodel their kitchen, Nina and David annexed the adjoiningbreakfast room and back porch to create a roomy 20-by-30-footspace. The multimedia PC and printer sit on a built-in desknext to the wall oven. A cushioned bench forms an L with thedesk, providing a cozy corner with comfortable seating; thecabinets underneath store software, board games, toys and sportsequipment. The large windows in front and to the right of thePC reveal a lovely view of the garden and the woods beyond.The house's traditional style dictated the choice for the kitchencabinets--a warm champagne finish on maple. Both the desk andthe built-in seating are made from matching, stock kitchencabinets; brass hardware and Laura Ashley fabrics completethe mood."One of the best things about having the PC in the kitchen,"says Nina, "is that opportunities pop up for all of us to learnnew computer skills from each other." Nina, formerly in magazinead sales, and David, a TV executive, use the PC for personalcorrespondence and to manage household finances. Their sons,Sam, 6, and Ben, 31/2, play with educational software. Lookingahead to their school years, Nina foresees that "keeping thePC in the kitchen will be really convenient when the kids needboth the computer and my help to do their homework."AN IDEA TAKES ROOT ON THE FARMSharlette and Bill John hail from Missouri farm families. Andthough they've chosen other careers--Sharlette has a real-estatebusiness, and Bill oversees their rental properties and worksin insurance--they still love the farmer's way of life. Forproof, witness their commitment to one of its venerable traditions making the kitchen the hub of family experience."When I was a kid," Bill recalls, "the kitchen was the onlyroom we heated, so we did everything there. We took visitorsto the kitchen, not the parlor. I wanted that for our home.We had the space to put the computer elsewhere in the house,but we wanted it to be where everything happens."When they redid the 450-square-foot kitchen in their spacious4,000-square-foot home tucked into a rural area near KansasCity, Mo., Sharlette and Bill chose a contemporary decor, eventhough the house, built in 1860, has a charming, old-fashionedfeel. "It's the only modern room in the house," Sharlette notes,"but we like its clean, crisp look." She modeled the computercenter--an 8-by-8-foot built-in unit with attractive roundedcorners--after a style she saw in a magazine.The computer center is finished in the same white laminate asthe kitchen cabinets. The PC and printer sit on a desktop;three shelves above the desk hold software, books, family photosand knickknacks.

And it seems that one family memberor another is always using the computer. Sharlette often bringswork home from her office, and she lists her properties onthe Internet. Bill uses the PC to track their rentals. Andthey both turn to the computer at tax time. John and Christistake their claim to the computer to do their schoolwork andplay games."In most families," says Bill, "the computer is in one room,the TV in another, and the kitchen is for preparing meals;everyone comes home and goes off to a separate place. In ourhouse, we come home and gather in the kitchen. And that's whatworks for us."Ellen Frankel is president of ECPM, an editorial consultingfirm in New York specializing in home design.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Documentary evidence: rating 13 printers' valueBy:Sean FultonWhen you need a new printer, the signs are clear--too bad youcan't say the same for your documents. It may be that yourold ink jet wearily spits out a smudged copy of the resumeyou've spent hours formatting. Perhaps it dawns on you whenyou see your daughter's face after the colorful drawing shecouldn't wait to show you rolls out in black and white on yourmonochrome laser printer. Or, the last straw may come whenyou're out of aspirin and the rat-a-tat-tat of your crankyold dot matrix churning out a 30-page report sets your templesthrobbing.Knowing you need a new printer is easy; knowing which new printerto buy is trickier. The good news--and part of the reason shoppingfor a printer gets so confusing--is that these days, more andmore machines deliver high-quality output for a fraction ofthe price you would have paid just a year or two ago.Whether you're looking for a monochrome laser model that deliversclean pages of text in a jiffy, or an ink jet that adds brilliantcolor to greeting cards, children's homework assignments, businesshandouts and other projects, you'll find plenty of contenders,often priced at less than $500. Even if you need special capabilities-say, a laser printer that supports the PostScript languagefor heavy-duty graphics output--you still may walk away fromthe store having paid less than $1,000.When you start comparing printers, you'll run headlong intodizzying specifications: resolution, speed, installed memoryand other potentially confusing terms. Each of these featuresmakes a real difference and deserves your attention, but thereare some things the numbers just won't tell you. For instance,while it's nice to know that the printer you've got your eyeon feeds 20 envelopes at a time through the machine automatically,that doesn't mean the unit handles the task well. Some printerfeeders will take your Number 10s, chew them up and spit themout.The most reliable way to learn how a printer performs is tosee it in action--and not just in the prepared demos you oftenget when you visit stores. That's why we invited 12 peoplewith varying degrees of computer experience to try an arrayof leading printers in our Consumer Lab as if they had boughtthem for their own use, and asked them to tell us how satisfiedthey were with each unit's performance under real-life conditions.The 13 products our testers examined--including monochrome lasersand color ink jets for PC and Macintosh systems--come fromseven of the top names in the printer business. (We chose notto include monochrome ink jets, as the reasons for buying one-essentially a matter of price--are disappearing: Printer makerstoday offer color ink jets for as little as $20 more than themonochrome models.)Most of these companies sell more than one model in each categorywe tested, so we asked them to send us the one product in theline they believe offers the best value for home use. HewlettPackard sent different printers for the Macintosh and PC tests,even though the laser and ink jet models the company designatedfor Mac users will work with a PC as well.UNDERSTANDING THE LINGOA printer sure would come in handy to generate a cheat sheetdefining the terms you'll see as you do your research and shopping.Resolution is perhaps the most common characteristic you'llread about--and potentially the most confusing.Essentially, resolution tells you how fine an image the printercan generate. Both ink jet and laser printers produce textand graphics by placing a series of dots on paper; printerresolution measures how many dots the machine can fit in asquare inch, horizontally by vertically. The more dots perinch (dpi), the higher the resolution--and the sharper theimage.Almost all the printers we tested also include some sort of"resolution enhancement" technology intended to help smoothjagged edges on text and line art. How well does it work? Youreyes are really the best judge; as a general rule, be skepticalof any claims that such a feature actually increases the printer'sresolution.The issue of resolution can get even more complicated with certainvariables. For instance, some color ink jet printers may supportenhanced resolution for printing in black and white, but notin color. Or, some laser printers may be able to give you 600dpi (shorthand for 600-by-600-dpi) resolution for PostScriptoutput, but not for documents that need to be translated intothe unit's built-in PCL (Printer Control Language) code, whichmany PC users rely on for outputting everyday work.And consider this: It's theoretically possible for a laser printerwith 300-dpi resolution to produce sharper images than someink jets with 600-dpi resolution. An ink jet printer worksby blowing its tiny dots of ink through little "jets" mountedon a printhead; during printing, some "spraying" typicallywill occur, taking a toll on the image's sharpness. In contrast,a laser printer (or a printer that uses LED technology, suchas the Okidata OL-810e, which our testers reviewed) works alongthe same lines as an office copier--a rotating drum picks uptoner, and then "melts" it onto the paper.Clearly, resolution comparisons get complicated. If it all seemstoo confusing, here's a simple rule of thumb that may help Without minimizing the importance of understanding and inquiringabout resolution issues, seeing is believing--in a nutshell,if the results don't show up on the page, the numbers on thebox really don't mean a thing.Beyond resolution, if you're shopping around for a color inkjet printer, you should also familiarize yourself with colorcorrection and color-enhancement technology. Basically, thesefeatures enable the printer's software to analyze the imageit's printing and massage it--for example, it might adjustthe tones and shades of the colors on the page automatically-so that the printout looks its best. All the color printersour testers reviewed make these adjustments to some degree;not surprisingly, some printers implement the feature moresuccessfully than others. In the category of self-correction,HP's ColorSmart technology won consistent praise from our testers.Color ink jet buyers should also know the difference between"true" and "composite" black. Generally speaking, for a colorink jet printer, you're better off with a model that supportstrue black for your color images, although it may cost more.Composite black is produced by mixing the cyan, yellow andmagenta inks contained in a printer's tricolor cartridge, andit tends to look greenish or gray on the page.DON'T FORGET THE MEMORYIt's also important to consider how much random access memory(RAM) your printer needs. Laser printers process an entirepage's worth of data internally before they put it on paper,and so they typically require more memory than do ink jet printers,which print out pages character by character.In the past, if you had insufficient memory installed for yourlaser printer, you'd risk seeing error messages when you'dtry to print a full page that contained complex graphics, orother complicated jobs. Printer makers have devised a way aroundthis problem for most types of documents home users print.The solution, called memory compression, effectively doublesthe amount of memory your laser printer has at its disposal.Some manufacturers, such as Panasonic with its KX-P6100, haveelected to strip their laser printers to a bare minimum ofRAM and let your PC handle much of the image-processing work.Typically, to use such printers (often called Windows or GDI,for Graphical Device Interface, printers), you'll need a Windowsbased PC with a 386 or faster microprocessor and no less than4 MB of RAM; the more RAM and the beefier the CPU in your PC,the better the performance you should see in your print jobs.One advantage of a GDI model is that it may save you some money,since you don't have to add in the cost of 1 megabyte (MB)or more of installed memory. Die-hard DOS users may be lessinterested in some of the printers that use this technology;depending on the model, printing from DOS applications isn'talways smooth.Another point to remember about printer performance is thatthe manufacturer's maximum rated speed specifications won'tnecessarily be the last word on what a printer can actuallydo. The performance you see at home depends on a number offactors, such as the kind of document you're printing (a pageof text will print faster than a page of graph-ics, for instance), whether you're printing in "best quality"or in "draft" mode, and even whether you're working in blackand white or in color. In the latter case, the difference canbe dramatic; a color ink jet that prints as many as four monochromepages per minute (ppm) may manage only 0.6 ppm in color. Onceagain, always trust your own impressions rather than the manufacturer'sclaims.THE EYES HAVE IT?With personal experience so crucial to a buying decision, howcan you be sure your experience at the store accurately representswhat you'll see at home? For starters, check that the printeris outputting sample documents sent from a PC. Many in-storeprinter demos hook up an interface box to the printer; youpress a button and the printer outputs a few sample pages.While this will give you some idea of the machine's print quality,you won't be able to tell how fast the printer operates whenconnected to a real computer, or whether the printer's softwareis effective and easy to use. It's important to know, for example,if the software alerts you with an on-screen message that theprinter's out of paper or there's any other sort of problem;all the products in this review do so.Before making a final decision between a color ink jet and amonochrome laser printer, consider some of the costs that willarise after your purchase. For instance, most laser printershandle high-volume use better than color ink jet printers do.Typically, you'll spend about twoto two-and-a-half cents per page (excluding paper) for laseroutput, but a page from a color ink jet--even if the printeruses only black ink--can cost from three to four-and-a-halfcents. And a page of color output can send your budget reeling-anywhere from 11 to 27 cents per page, depending on the amountof color on the page.Meanwhile, laser printers offer an attractive combination ofhigh-speed and high-quality output that makes them the printersof choice in homes or home offices where color printing isn'ta necessity. While some of today's ink jets process black-andwhite output at a rate of 4 ppm, laser technology lets a typicalhome model send out as many as 8 ppm. (If you're wonderingwhat it would take to combine the best of both worlds and buya color laser for home, the answer these days is at least $2,000-many color lasers will cost more than that.)As for your electric bill, most ink jets--even in full operation-aren't going to add much to your monthly tab, but lasers canconsume a surprising amount of electricity. To help conservemoney and energy, many laser and ink jet printers (includingall the models our testers looked at) adhere to federal EnergyStar guidelines for reduced power consumption. When not inuse, they shift into a "sleep" or "idle" mode that uses significantlyless electricity than the machines burn up in full operation.(For more information on Energy Star computer equipment, see"15 PC Sleepers" in the April 1995 issue of HomePC.) The BrotherHL-630 and Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS printers don't even includeon/off switches, since they power down automatically.HOW THE TESTS WERE RUNSix of our testers looked at the nine PC printers in our lab,while six others worked with the four Macintosh products.We armed the testers with a series of files to beprinted--including documents that combined text, photographs andline illustrations.  We asked them to check the "smudge" factorfor ink jet printers, feed envelopes through all the machines inbulk, clock how quickly the printers handled their various tasks,and perform several other tests that simulate the way people athome use their printers.  Our testers spent up to six evenings inthe lab; the PC models were connected to AST Advantage Pro P100systems with 8 MB of RAM; the Macintosh units were hooked up toPerforma 5215CDs, also equipped with 8 MB of RAM.When the testers reported back to us, we asked them to gradeeach model's performance according to various criteria, includingthe printer's documentation, ease of installation, design,noise control, performance, overall value and overall quality.We also asked them to grade the quality of text and graphics(such as line art) reproduction, and color/grayscale quality,which covers how well the printer simulates the tones and gradationsin images such as photos.In the PC laser printer category, the Panasonic KX-P6100 tooktop honors, providing exceptional output at a competitive price.Among the PC color ink jet models, the OkiJet 2010--the firstink jet printer Okidata has delivered to the market--took topgrades; the unit just edged out the category's top guns, includingHP's DeskJet 660C.For the Macintosh, the Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS squeaked byHP's LaserJet 5MP. Similarly, Apple's Color StyleWriter 2400pulled in just ahead of the HP DeskJet 850C. In both cases,however, the grades were extremely close.Before our testers began to examine each printer, we urged themto trust what they saw, and their reactions--the same advicewe've given you. But first, take the additional opportunityto look through their eyes. The reviews that begin on page200 should help give you a clearer picture of how to frameyour search.Technical and research assistance for this lab was providedby Anne Clifford, Abdul Farooqi, Patrick Gaynor, Barbara Hamill,Judy Hogan, Paul Malmquist, Mel Odemis and Sun Ying Tam.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Making the grade: how the printers stack upBy:Sean FultonMONOCHROME LASERS (PC)Manufacturer: PanasonicModel: KX-P6100Color/grayscale quality: B+Design: A-Documentation: A-Ease of installation: A-Graphics quality: B+Noise control: AOverall quality: A-Overall value: A-Performance: A-Text quality: A-Overall grade: A- (3.74)Manufacturer: OkidataModel: OL-810eColor/grayscale quality: B+Design: B+Documentation: BEase of installation: BGraphics quality: B+Noise control: BOverall quality: B+Overall value: BPerformance: B+Text quality: AOverall grade: B+ (3.41)Manufacturer: Hewlett-PackardModel: LaserJet 5LColor/grayscale quality: BDesign: A-Documentation: A-Ease of installation: A-Graphics quality: BNoise control: AOverall quality: BOverall value: B-Performance: BText quality: A-Overall grade: B+ (3.39)Manufacturer: EpsonModel: Action Laser 1400Color/grayscale quality: B+Design: B+Documentation: BEase of installation: B+Graphics quality: BNoise control: AOverall quality: BOverall value: B-Performance: BText quality: AOverall grade: B+ (3.38)Manufacturer: BrotherModel: HL-630Color/grayscale quality: C+Design: BDocumentation: BEase of installation: BGraphics quality: C+Noise control: B+Overall quality: B-Overall value: BPerformance: C+Text quality: BOverall grade: B (2.90)MONOCHROME LASERS (MACINTOSH)Manufacturer: AppleModel: LaserWriter 4/600 PSColor/grayscale quality: B-Design: A-Documentation: A-Ease of installation: A-Graphics quality: BNoise control: A-Overall quality: B+Overall value: B-Performance: B+Text quality: AOverall grade: B+ (3.44)Manufacturer: Hewlett-PackardModel: LaserJet 5MPColor/grayscale quality: BDesign: B+Documentation: B+Ease of installation: BGraphics quality: BNoise control: A-Overall quality: A-Overall value: CPerformance: A-Text quality: AOverall grade: B+ (3.42)COLOR INK JETS (PC)Manufacturer: OkidataModel: OkiJet 2010Color/grayscale quality: A-Design: B+Documentation: BEase of installation: B+Graphics quality: A-Noise control: BOverall quality: BOverall value: BPerformance: BText quality: B+Overall grade: B+ (3.43)Manufacturer: Hewlett-PackardModel: DeskJet 660CColor/grayscale quality: B+Design: B+Documentation: BEase of installation: BGraphics quality: B+Noise control: BOverall quality: BOverall value: BPerformance: BText quality: B+Overall grade: B (3.31)Manufacturer: CanonModel: BJC-4100Color/grayscale quality: B-Design: B+Documentation: BEase of installation: BGraphics quality: C+Noise control: B+Overall quality: BOverall value: B-Performance: BText quality: BOverall grade: B (3.03)Manufacturer: EpsonModel: Stylus Color IIsColor/grayscale quality: C+Design: CDocumentation: CEase of installation: C+Graphics quality: CNoise control: BOverall quality: D+Overall value: DPerformance: D+Text quality: COverall grade: C (2.13)COLOR INK JETS (MACINTOSH)Manufacturer: AppleModel: Color StyleWriter 2400Color/grayscale quality: B-Design: A-Documentation: AEase of installation: AGraphics quality: BNoise control: B+Overall quality: BOverall value: B-Performance: B+Text quality: BOverall grade: B+ (3.38)Manufacturer: Hewlett-PackardModel: DeskJet 850CColor/grayscale quality: B+Design: B+Documentation: B+Ease of installation: BGraphics quality: B+Noise control: BOverall quality: B+Overall value: B-Performance: BText quality: B+Overall grade: B (3.34)Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Vital statistics: prices, specifications and ongoing costsBy:Sean FultonMONOCHROME LASERS (PC)Manufacturer: PanasonicModel: KX-P6100List/estimated retail price: $499/$399Resolution (in dots per inch): 300 x 300Resolution-enhancement technology: YesMaximum rated speed (in pages per minute): 6Standard RAM: 256 KBMaximum paper capacity: Letter: 100Maximum paper capacity: Legal: 100Maximum paper capacity: Envelopes: 10Maximum paper capacity: Transparency film: 30True black (for color ink jets): --Toner/ink replacement costs: $29.95;

Just returnyour used-up toner cartridges to your printer manufactureror an independent recycler rather than toss them into the trash.Printer makers such as Apple, Canon and Lexmark encourage youto send back the empty toner cartridges from their laser printersby paying the shipping costs. For instance, when you buy anew toner cartridge from Canon, you'll find a postage-paidUPS return label in the box to send your old cartridge to Canon'srecycling plant. Apple's new toner cartridges include a couponthat entitles you to a $5 rebate if you return your old, emptycartridge to the company.Printer makers aren't the only outfits recycling toner cartridges-independent companies such as Nashua (800-333-3439), in Nashua,N.H., pay up to $15 for many brands of used toner cartridges.Nashua remanufactures the cartridges, then resells them forApple, HP and other printers through authorized dealers.Buying a remanufactured cartridge can save you money--from 30to 50 percent of what you'd pay for a brand-new cartridge.Apple also sells remanufactured cartridges directly: The $76Apple SX Toner Cartridge fits the Apple LaserWriter II seriesas well as other devices using the SX engine made by Canon;it's about $30 cheaper than buying a new Apple toner cartridgefor such printers.If you buy a toner cartridge that isn't brand-new, ask if it'sremanufactured, rather than simply recharged or reconditioned.Unlike recharged and reconditioned products, a remanufacturedcartridge is thoroughly cleaned, and all its worn parts arereplaced for better performance and print quality. --JenniferZainoBack to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Meet January's testersBy:Sean FultonAlan Gleicher, 48, is a teacher.

Its overall excellence, coupled withan attractive estimated retail price of $399, landed it a loftyoverall grade of A-In terms of rated specs, this 6-page-per-minute model wasn'tthe fastest laser printer that testers saw, but they consideredits speed to be more than adequate. They awarded the unit anear-perfect A- for performance.The group also praised the KX-P6100 for being easy to set upand use. In particular, the testers were surprised at how wellthe model printed envelopes, a task that trips up many printers.Finally, our testers were impressed by the look of the printeritself, and particularly its conservative use of space.

The OL-810ecarries a $799 estimated retail price, which testers adamantlydeclared too high, even if the 8-page-per-minute machine wasthe fastest-rated PC laser printer they saw.Our group cited several areas that needed improvement beforeOkidata could justify the high price in their eyes. For instance,the OL-810e took the lowest grade of the five PC laser printerswe tested for its noise control (B). And several testers complainedabout cryptic on-screen error messages they received. The unitalso received a B for its documentation, which put it barelyabove the bottom of that category. "You'd have to read thewhole thing to know how to do anything," complained ThomasDeRosa.On the other hand, the unit shared first place with the EpsonAction Laser 1400 for its clear, crisp text, while it receiveda solid B+ for both its graphics and grayscale quality.

Our testersrated its LaserJet 5L third best among the five PC laser printersthey tried, awarding it a B+. In numerical terms, though, itsgrade was just a hair ahead of the Epson Action Laser 1400and a mere whisper shy of the Okidata OL-810e's score.The HP brand name has become almost synonymous with printers;consider that last year, at least three testers in our ConsumerLab who had problems getting the LaserJet 4L up and runningstill gave it extremely high grades. This year, our testersfaced no such contradictions when they gave the HP LaserJet5L the highest marks in the PC laser group for ease of installationand documentation (both A-)Overall quality was a different story; the HP printer's B inthis area was the next-to-lowest score in the category, largelyon the basis of testers' complaints that its construction seemedsomewhat flimsy.In the key print-quality categories, the LaserJet 5L scoredan impressive A- from our testers for its text output, butreceived only B's for its graphics and grayscale reproduction.In the final analysis, this model did well, but not well enoughto push it ahead of the Panasonic or Okidata models, even withthe weight of the HP name behind it. The LaserJet 5L may notbe a perfect choice, but it's certainly not a bad one, either.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Epson Action Laser 1400By:Sean Fulton B+HIGHEST GRADE: Noise control, text quality: ALOWEST GRADE: Overall value: B-SPECS: PC laser, 600 x 600 dpi, 4 ppmGOOD NEWS:* Excellent text and grayscale quality* Prints envelopes wellBAD NEWS:* Difficult to set upDon't let the fourth-place ranking of the Epson Action Laser1400 fool you; a few points here or there, and it could justas easily have finished in second place, ahead of the OkidataOL-810e.

(The same was true even of the slightlyless expensive 4-ppm Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5L, which alsoscored a B- for overall value.)Several testers said they were baffled at how the Action Laser1400 could handle the tricky job of printing envelopes withease, then complicate something as simple as installing a tonercartridge. "Unlike with the other printers, I wasn't sure howto line up the cartridge," said Thomas DeRosa. The documentationwasn't much help; the Epson model tied with the Brother HL630 PC laser printer for last place in this category (B)Many testers said if they saw the Action Laser 1400 on sale,they'd consider buying it; otherwise, they were hard-pressedto justify the price.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Brother HL-630By:Sean Fulton BHIGHEST GRADE: Noise control: B+LOWEST GRADE: Graphics quality, grayscale quality, performance C+SPECS: PC laser, 300 x 300 dpi, 6 ppmGOOD NEWS:* Generous paper capacity* Low priceBAD NEWS:* It's noisy* Unexceptional print qualityWhile the Brother HL-630 came in last among the five PC laserswe tested, it still managed to muster a very respectable Bgrade.Testers found its printouts acceptable, but not exceptional;the unit received the lowest scores in print quality for thePC laser printer group. "This is a good printer, but it's justnot the highest quality you can get," declared Thomas DeRosa.All the testers liked the model's paper capacity--it holds 200sheets, more than almost every other PC laser printer in ourtests. On the downside, the HL-630 claims a large amount ofphysical space compared with its peers.Although the B+ our testers awarded the HL-630 for noise controlwas actually its best grade, they complained that the printerwas particularly noisy in comparison to the other models inthis group, largely due to the fan inside. All but one otherPC laser printer received higher scores for their ability tokeep the peace and quiet.Even so, with the right price--it's slightly less than $400retail--several testers said that they would consider buyingit.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PSBy:Sean Fulton #1B+HIGHEST GRADE: Text quality: ALOWEST GRADE: Grayscale quality: B-SPECS: Mac laser, 600 x 600 dpi, 4 ppmGOOD NEWS:* High-quality print* Rugged designBAD NEWS:* Slower than the HP LaserJet 5MPThe two Macintosh-compatible laser printers in our tests wererelatively close in our jury's eyes, with the Apple LaserWriter4/600 PS nosing out the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5MP in theend. Ultimately, testers considered the lower-priced Appleunit to be a greater overall value, even if they were disappointedby its slower (4-page-per-minute) print speed."This would be even better if it were faster," said Bill Egan,"but I would recommend it because of its overall quality."Our testers gave the nod to the LaserWriter 4/600 PS over theLaserJet 5MP for documentation, ease of installation and design-although, while praising its classic, compact styling andruggedness, they complained that having a power-cord connectorbehind a door at the back of the unit impedes access. Testersalso wished this model would have supported automatic envelopefeeding; instead, they had to hand-feed their envelopes intothe unit one at a time.Even though the 4/600 PS falls a little short of the 5MP interms of some features and expansion abilities, testers ultimatelydecided that if the money were coming out of their pockets,they'd choose the 4/600 PS. This model, which, like the 5MP,supports PostScript printing, seemed to strike the right balancebetween price and capabilities to satisfy our Mac testers'needs.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5MPBy:Sean Fulton B+HIGHEST GRADE: Text quality: ALOWEST GRADE: Overall value: CSPECS: Mac laser, 600 x 600 dpi, 6 ppmGOOD NEWS:* Great grayscale output* Fast performanceBAD NEWS:* Costs more than the Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PSIn our testers' eyes, the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5MP offerssuperior speed, enhanced grayscale output and better overallperformance than the Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS. Nevertheless,those features were not enough to let them swallow the 5MP'sestimated retail price of $1,000 compared with the Apple printer's$900 estimated cost. That translated into a grade of C forthe LaserJet 5MP in overall value--and a narrow second-placefinish.Our testers were a little confused when they didn't see a powerswitch, yet the unit failed to wake up when they hooked itto a Mac. The problem? They simply missed the on/off switch,which is contoured into the side of the unit and difficultto find.Testers liked the text quality of both the 5MP and the 4/600PS, with the A grade achieved by the HP unit just a fractionof a point ahead of the A earned by the Apple device. But thegroup seemed most impressed with the 5MP's ability to reproducehigh-quality images such as photographs; its B grade in thegrayscale category easily outstripped the Apple unit's B-The 5MP also includes such flashy features as an infrared portfor wireless printing. While certain Mac users surely willwelcome such extras, eliminating a few of them to knock a fewmore dollars off the price might well have saved the day forthis printer with our more value-conscious testers.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Okidata OkiJet 2010By:Sean Fulton #1B+HIGHEST GRADE: Color/grayscale quality: A-LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: BSPECS: PC color ink jet, 600 x 300 dpi, 3 ppm (B&W), 0.5 ppm(color)GOOD NEWS:* High-quality output* Attractive priceBAD NEWS:* It's noisyWhen you're hot, you're hot--and Okidata was definitely sizzlingin our lab.

Testers lavishedpraise on this model, giving it top marks in almost every areawe asked them to score.When it came to performance, the unit earned a B, good enoughfor a first-place tie with the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 660C.But even if it had taken twice as long to generate printouts,our testers said the output would have been worth the wait."I was very surprised when I saw the color quality," said AlanGleicher. The unit scored an A- for the quality of both itscolor/grayscale and graphics output; text quality was onlyslightly lower, at a B+. Testers were particularly pleasedthat they could get crisp black output and vibrant colors withoutlosing too much green: The unit retails for less than $400.Equally pleasing, "the OkiJet's software installation was easiestof them all," said Bill Anthony; our testers awarded it thebest grade in that category (B+). The one quibble was noisecontrol, where this model came in third.In addition to superior output, our testers liked the OkiJet'ssolid feel; they all said it seemed built to last.

"HP had the best documentation,"declared Ellen McLaughlin. "I consider myself a novice, andthis was good for me."Testers praised the model's dexterity; it churned out high-qualityoutput for both color and monochrome print jobs, and receivedstraight B+'s in all text, graphics and color/grayscale categories,finishing second only to the OkiJet 2010. Like its Mac counterpart,the DeskJet 660C uses HP's ColorSmart technology, a systemthat adjusts the color balance on printouts to ensure it looksas sharp as can be.Our testers did cite a couple of drawbacks, though. For instance,they awarded the DeskJet 660C the lowest grade for noise controlamong the color ink jets (B); the printer lets out a mechanical"whirring" sound each time a piece of paper travels throughits print mechanism. It also had problems printing envelopes;some testers grumbled that the envelopes came out wrinkledor smudged.Despite these complaints, the DeskJet 660C (which is sold forMacs as the DeskWriter 660C) proved to be a high flyer.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Canon BJC-4100By:Sean Fulton BHIGHEST GRADE: Noise control: B+LOWEST GRADE: Graphics quality: C+SPECS: PC color ink jet, 360 x 360 dpi, 4 ppm (B&W), 0.8 ppm(color)GOOD NEWS* Attractive design* Large buttons for easy useBAD NEWS* Printouts have a faded lookCanon includes a variety of home-oriented software--from theCrayola Art program for kids, to Pattern Maker, a cross-stitchapplication that prints colored stitching patterns onto fabric-with the BJC-4100, which is nice.

Images were often blurry, and black print generallyappeared to be washed out. About the best Bill Anthony couldsay was that "the text quality was readable--not crisp or clear,but at least it printed."While other ink jet printers our testers examined were slower,the Epson model still wasn't fast enough to outrun complaintsabout its print quality.

They also favored the Appleunit's compact design to the DeskJet's layout, and preferredthe Apple printer's noise control and performance. Finally,the scales tipped in favor of the Color StyleWriter 2400 onthe question of overall value: It's about $200 less at retailthan the DeskJet 850.But if you value printout quality more than price, bear in mindthat our testers much preferred the HP unit's output. "TheStyleWriter worked well, but the quality of its printouts isn'tas good as the Hewlett-Packard's," declared Adrienne Klein.For our testers, the lower price tag, sleek design and easeof use seemed good enough reasons to recommend the Color StyleWriter,but they wouldn't ignore the DeskJet 850C, either.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 850CBy:Sean Fulton BHIGHEST GRADE: Graphics quality, color/grayscale quality: B+LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: B-SPECS: Mac color ink jet, 600 x 600 dpi (B&W), 300 x 300 dpi(color), 6 ppm (B&W), 2 ppm (color)GOOD NEWS:* High-quality output* Vibrant colorsBAD NEWS:* Big cabinet* Poor documentationEven though our testers thought the Apple Color StyleWriter2400 was the better overall value, they were nearly bowledover by the printouts the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 850C produced.The unit racked up impressive B+ grades in all categories concernedwith output quality.

"I thought the manual was poorly written," saidTheresa Tocci. "It didn't clarify the driver installation forme." While the DeskJet 850C's scores in all three areas weren'tbad, they just weren't as good as the Apple model's.Another drawback was the DeskJet 850C's estimated retail price,about $200 higher than that of the Color StyleWriter 2400.But as the saying goes, you get what you pay for--and in thiscase, you'll get demonstrably high-quality color printouts.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Nuts + Bolts--Step-By-Step Tips: Filling in Windows 95's installation gapsBy:Sean FultonIf you've decided to upgrade to Windows 95, odds are you werelured by its promise to make your PC perform as well as itpossibly can. But simply installing the new operating systemdoesn't ensure maximum returns; to set up your PC to run atfull speed and peak efficiency, you'll need to tinker withsome of Windows 95's default settings.During installation, Windows 95 makes a series of educated guessesabout your hardware setup. The process is designed to ensuresmooth installation on just about any PC, which means it errson the side of caution--often at the expense of system performance.The 30-minute tune-up described here will adjust your settingsto the ones best suited for your computer.Another result of Windows 95's cautious approach is that itseldom replaces your DOS CD-ROM and sound-card drivers duringinstallation. Picking the correct drivers is tricky; the installationprogram sticks with the tried-and-true DOS drivers--which arenot the most efficient--rather than risk installing the wrongones for your particular peripherals, which might disable them.So, in addition to taking the steps outlined here, you shouldcontact the manufacturers of your PC, CD-ROM drive and soundcard to get faster, 32-bit Windows 95 drivers and upgrade instructions.Before you begin, be sure...*Windows 95 is installed on your computer.*You have documentation handy for your PC, as well as for DOSand Windows 95; it'll help you determine which drivers arenow installed.STEP 1: Click on Windows 95's Start button, highlight Settings,then click on Control Panel. Double-click on the System icon;this opens a window that contains basic information about yourPC's setup. Click on the Performance tab.STEP 2: The Performance panel displays information about yourcomputer's resources, including its memory (note the number;you'll need it in step 4). Click on the File System button;this lets you set up the operating system for fast file access.STEP 3: If you're using a desktop PC, make sure the "Typicalrole of this machine" area is set to "Desktop computer." Ifyou've got a notebook PC, click on the down arrow and choose"Mobile or docking system." Make sure the slider switch labeled"Read-ahead optimization" is on Full; this will boost yourcomputer's performance by setting it to anticipate what datafrom your hard drive it will read next. When these settingsare correct, click on the tab marked CD-ROM at the top of thewindow.STEP 4: "Supplemental cache size" specifies how much of yourPC's memory is set aside as a CD-ROM cache. If you've got lessthan 8 megabytes of RAM, Microsoft recommends a 64-kilobytecache; move the cache slider to the far left, and indicate"No read-ahead" in the "Optimize access pattern for" area.If you have 8 to 12 MB of RAM, move the slider to the fifthindicator point to get a 626-KB cache, and indicate "Doublespeed drives." (It's possible to create a larger cache, butit won't increase your speed.)If you have more than 12 MB of RAM, indicate your actual CDROM drive type, and move the slider to the far right. Clickon OK to return to the System Properties window.STEP 5: Click on the Graphics button at the bottom of the SystemProperties window. A new window appears, which lets you specifyyour PC's video-card settings. Drag the "Hardware acceleration"slider to Full, which tells your computer to run video as fastas your video card allows. Click on the OK button in this window,then on the Close button in the main System Properties window.If you changed any settings, you'll be asked if you want torestart the PC. Click on Yes.STEP 6: Open the Control Panel again, as in step 1. This time,double-click on the Printers icon. Click once on your printer,then click on File and select Properties from the pull-downmenu. Click once on the tab marked Details, then on the SpoolSettings button.STEP 7: If it isn't active already, turn on the option labeled"Spool print jobs..."; this means you can get back to workquickly when you print, rather than tie up your system untilthe entire document prints out. Unless you're short of harddrive space, choose the option labeled "Start printing afterlast page is spooled," which gets you back to your other programsfaster after a print command. If you choose "Start printingafter first page is spooled," as shown here, you'll use lessdrive space, but you'll sacrifice some system speed. Save yoursettings by clicking on OK.STEP 8: Go back to the Windows 95 Start menu, select Programs,then Accessories, and choose the WordPad text-editing programfrom the bottom of the list. Select Open from the pull-downFile menu and look at the config.sys file's contents, whichincludes your DOS device drivers. Locate the drivers with functionsthat are duplicated in Windows 95, such as the power managementdriver power.exe shown above. (If you're not sure what's what,check your PC, DOS or Windows 95 documentation, or call Microsoftat 206-635-7000.)STEP 9: Instruct Windows 95 to ignore references to unnecessaryDOS drivers by typing REM at the beginning of the lines forthose drivers; this tells the operating system to treat theline as a "remark," not an instruction--in other words, toignore it. If you have new, 32-bit CD-ROM drivers from yourPC or CD-ROM drive manufacturer, you can do the same with thelines for DOS CD-ROM drivers, such as aspi2dos.sys and aspicd.sys,which are shown in the screen for step 8. When you've finishedediting this file, choose Save from the pull-down File menu.STEP 10: Now, open your PC's autoexec.bat file using WordPad.Once again, you'll be looking for DOS drivers you can removebecause they've been replaced by 32-bit Windows 95 drivers.You'll also want to remove the DOS smartdrv.exe utility; Windows95 doesn't need it.

Yet theclipping intrigued him; the idea of getting together on a regularbasis with other people to learn about investing and builda strong financial portfolio sounded like one worth exploring.Gerlach mailed away a request for more information to the NationalAssociation of Investors Corp. (NAIC), a not-for-profit organizationfor investment clubs mentioned in the article. While waitingfor the packet to arrive, Gerlach decided to bone up a littleon his own."I had been subscribing to CompuServe for years, mainly forentertainment," Gerlach says. "But I figured there must besome investing information there." Sure enough, he found NAICon-line, with much of the information he had just mailed awayfor available to download to his PC on the spot. He receivedstock-selection tutorials, demonstration versions of stockscreening software (which helps pinpoint stocks to buy basedon the criteria most important to you, such as a company'sannual dividends or earnings data), and sample partnershipagreements for investment club members. He began posting questionson the forum's message board, and investment club veteransquickly chimed in with advice.Armed with the information he'd gathered on-line, Gerlach and14 friends formed the Blue Chip Posse investment club, withGerlach as president. At monthly meetings, members contributebetween $20 and $100 to be invested in new stocks as a group;they also reinvest the dividends they earn from some companiesin more stock, or apply those dividends to cash reserves forfuture investment. Starting from scratch, the Posse has nurtureda portfolio worth $15,000 in 18 months.There are nearly 17,000 investment clubs in the United Statestoday, giving people who couldn't ordinarily afford to playthe stock market alone a chance to get involved; by poolingcash, club members can more easily meet the costs of tradesand commissions. The clubs also provide an excellent way forcurious newcomers to learn the ropes.Commercial on-line services and the Internet are proving tobe invaluable assets for investment clubs, delivering everythingfrom tips on forming a club to resources for buying stocksat rock-bottom commissions. You don't even have to be in aninvestment club to make use of much of this information--ifyou'd rather invest on your own, you'll still be able to usemany of these on-line services for, say, screening stocks orresearching companies.Investment clubs accumulate wealth through long-term investing.The average club begins to outperform the market only afterabout eight years; every dollar a club invests generally doublesin about seven years--if it survives that long. Some 40 percentof new clubs dissolve within two years, and that's a losingproposition for their members. "The liquidation value of mostclubs is often less than the capital contributions of its membersduring the first year or two," Gerlach warns.PICKING THE RIGHT PARTNERSBecause of the high dropout rate and the risks involved, makesure the people you link up with for your investment club sharea long-term perspective on investing, and that you feel youcan trust them to do the investment research necessary to makethe club a success.One way to find prospective members for a new club is to posta note in CompuServe's NAIC forum (Go NAIC), or in the investmentclub folder in America Online's Motley Fool area (Keyword:Motley). Motley Fool has the best-maintained investment messageboards you'll find in cyberspace. When you post your call forpartners, specify that you're looking for people (usually inyour geographic region) who are committed to long-term investments,and don't shy away from probing respondents for informationabout themselves. People who have a track record of maintainingcommitments to organizations will likely make better membersthan lone wolves who claim to know a lot about investing.Not every investment club holds face-to-face meetings. For instance,Gerlach--who has become an enthusiastic investor--is also presidentof the Pioneer Online Investment Club (POLIC). Members hailfrom all over the United States and as far away as Japan. Theclub conducts its business electronically, using its own messageboards in the NAIC forum on CompuServe.To join POLIC, simply participate in the club's discussionsabout its portfolio and its hunt for stocks for a couple ofmonths, then request membership. If you're on America Onlineor Prodigy, you can set up your own POLIC-style club usingyour service's investment message boards.Along with its CompuServe site, NAIC maintains a site on theInternet's World Wide Web (http:// www.better-investing.org)where visitors can also see investment club advice, sampleclub bylaws and model partnership agreements. If you're interestedin launching a club, you can download the documents and amendthem to suit your group's needs.Be sure that all club members sign copies of a partnership agreementbefore any money changes hands. Such agreements are legallybinding structures that allow tax liability on the club portfolio'sdividends and capital gains to be passed along to its members.Once your club--whether it's an on-line venture or a more traditionalface-to-face association--is up and running, you'll have toagree on an investment style; the two broadest styles are "growth"and "value." Growth investors tend to favor companies witha history of increased earnings year after year; investorswill pay a premium for this seemingly predictable ability toincrease earnings. Value stocks tend to trade for less moneythan growth stocks because their earnings are unpredictable;their fortunes are usually more closely tied to the generalbusiness cycle. A recession, for example, probably won't affectwhether or not people buy breakfast cereal, but it's certainlylikely to dim the fortunes of companies in the auto industry.To get information on various investment styles as well as backgroundon the top stocks within those styles, clubs may subscribeto stock-monitoring services such as Value Line or Standard& Poor's, consult with a retail broker who subscribes to ValueLine (and pay retail commissions), or leg it down to the publiclibrary to do research.Investment club members who maintain accounts on America Online,CompuServe and Prodigy have another option: access to useful,low-cost electronic resources. For instance, Prodigy's $9.95monthly fee gives investment club members the opportunity touse Stock Hunter (Jump: Stock Hunter), which has an excellentlibrary of articles on eight popular investment styles. Includedare explanations of Dodd/Graham, the granddaddy of value investingstyles, which was developed by two finance professors in the1930s, and One Up on Wall Street, a growth-oriented style developedby the legendary Fidelity Magellan fund manager, Peter Lynch.Download these explanations and your club will be off to agreat start at defining its niche. Stock Hunter also lets youscreen for top stocks in each category and download the listingsfor a $1.95 surcharge.An even deeper array of investment resources--without surcharges-is available on America Online. Both the Fool's School inthe Motley Fool area, and Investing Basics in the AmericanAssociation of Individual Investors area (Keyword: AAII) arefull of articles that will help club members find their bearings.Consider AAII's common-sense article, "Avoiding Common InvestmentMistakes," required reading. AAII also lets you screen stocksbased on four investing styles, such as companies with lowstock prices relative to earnings. (For more information onstock screening, see Financial Adviser, February 1995.)GETTING THE SCOOPWhile stock screening can give you an up-to-the-minute snapshotof a company's earnings history, it won't tell you all youneed to know about its prospects. Are there reasons to thinkthe company may stumble--or take off--in the future? Does itface any potentially crippling litigation? Are there any naturalbarriers to newer, hungrier competitors entering its market?All publicly traded companies discuss questions like these inreports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Many of these reports, called 10Qs and 10Ks, are availablefor review in the EDGAR archives on the Internet(http://www.sec.govedgarhp. htm). About 4,000 companies file electronically today,but by the end of 1996, all publicly traded companies willbe required to do so. Club members can find these reports onthe Internet or in Disclosure's Edgar Plus section on AmericaOnline (Keyword: Disclosure)Once AOL members have begun to form a judgment about a company'sprospects, they can click over to First Call (Keyword: FirstCall) to see what the pros think. First Call maintains a databaseof Wall Street analysts' projections of various company earningsfor the coming years. Meanwhile, Motley Fool's stock messageboards track which companies are generating better- or worsethan-expected quarterly earnings--a big factor in short-termprice swings.SPEND LESS, MAKE MORE?Clubs typically invest relatively small sums--$500 to $1,000-monthly, but full-service brokers and even many well-knowndiscount brokers charge a minimum $40 commission on each trade;shop around, or else your new club could wind up paying asmuch as 10 percent of its monthly investment in commissions.Until recently, almost all deep-discount brokers on-line imposedfairly hefty minimum-balance requirements. But the PC FinancialNetwork on both Prodigy (Jump: PCFN) and America Online (Keyword PCFN) have recently introduced a special deal for investmentclubs. PCFN offers a 40 percent discount in addition to thenormal discount rate, bringing the minimum trade down to avery competitive $24. There is no minimum-balance requirement.It's even possible to buy selected stocks with no commissionsand reinvest the cash dividends in still more stock at no charge.The NAIC forum on CompuServe offers a direct-purchase and dividendreinvestment option on 138 stocks for $5. The AAII on AOL alsomaintains a list of companies that allow direct purchase.America Online, CompuServe and Prodigy all let you monitor stocks,track quotes and view cumulative values on a 15-minute delayedbasis; this means that during market hours, the prices yousee reflect the prices your stocks traded at 15 minutes ago,which isn't a significant time lapse for long-term investors.But that's about as far as the commercial on-line servicesgo in terms of portfolio management.On the Internet, Howe Barnes' Net Investor (http://pawws.com How_phtml/top.shtml) will set up specific investment clubaccounts that allow members to receive company research andbreaking news, as well as view portfolio values on a 15-minutedelayed basis. Howe Barnes also provides more sophisticatedportfolio accounting than the commercial services offer. Forexample, if your club receives a stock dividend and then reinvestsit, you must raise the "cost basis" in the stock or you'llpay more taxes than you should when you eventually sell itoff. The company will track such items for you, and will evenconsolidate the accounting for clubs with more than one portfolio.Howe Barnes requires a $10,000 minimum deposit to use the service,and its minimum commission is $35.NAIC also offers two attractive investment club accounting packages Dragonware Investment Club Accountant ($169, or $209 for nonmembersof NAIC) and NAIC Club Accountant ($159, or $199 for nonmembers),both for DOS, Windows or Macintosh. These programs supplementmore generic portfolio-accounting services and software programsby helping you with accounting tasks specific to clubs, suchas tracking the pro rata tax liabilities from capital gainsand losses for members who contribute different amounts monthly.With so many on-line resources at their disposal, members ofinvestment clubs--and even individuals--can now get a leg upon Wall Street, reducing the risk of going broke before youcan get to the broker.Wayne Harris is a Tallahassee, Fla.-based financial writer.You can send him e-mail at wharris@ polaris.net.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Working At Home--Tools For Getting The Job Done: Perfect pitch: How PCs make biz presentations singBy:Lynn GinsburgPicture this: You're about to address the representatives ofa large corporation who will decide whether they can trustyour home business with their company's travel services contract.A huge boost to your income rides on your ability to make yourcase, not to mention all the good that landing a "name" accountwill do for your business's prestige. It's a situation thatwould unnerve anyone, but you're cool as can be, because you'vegot a secret weapon--a killer computer-based business presentation.This dealmaker organizes your data, insights and argumentsinto a cohesive, entertaining whole, complete with colorfulgraphics--and even lively multimedia effects--to deliver yourmessage loud and clear.How did you manage to put together such a snazzy productionon a budget? The twist in this plot is that it's the handiworkof some inexpensive software and a home computer, which makeit possible to express your most creative ideas in a razzledazzle display.Presentation software is tailor-made for people who don't havethe luxury of hiring a graphics designer to create businesspresentations. These programs have added many features in recentyears, and they now let you do everything from easily alteringthe order in which your data is presented to sending your finishedwork to potential clients by e-mail.Below, we take a look at six of the most popular presentationprograms, which range in price from $99 to about $350. In thisgroup, you'll find products that are suitable for first-timeusers and old hands alike. At one end of the spectrum is ASAPfor Windows, which is very easy to use, but not very flexible.At the other end is Astound for Windows and the Macintosh-it lets you add high-quality multimedia effects to your presentation,but it's more complicated to use.Other programs--Freelance Graphics 96 for Windows 95, HarvardGraphics for Windows 95, Novell Presentations for Windows,and PowerPoint for both Windows 95 and the Mac--fall betweenthe two extremes. (At press time, Novell was actively lookingfor a buyer to take over and support Presentations, among otherproducts.) These well-known standards offer an array of options-some of which may confuse the uninitiated--as well as basicmultimedia support for computer-projected screen shows.We did not look at one popular program, Adobe Persuasion, becauseit's due for a major update in early 1996; nor did we reviewthe very advanced multimedia authoring tools, such as Directorand Authorware, which can be used to create presentations,but are fairly difficult to master and beyond the needs ofmost home business owners.In trying to decide which presentation package is right foryou, consider the kind of information you must communicatein your work, as well as the number of PC demos, slide showsor flip charts you put together each year. For instance, ifyou typically make only a couple of presentations a year, youmay be better off with a presentation program that's a cinchto learn and use than one that's more powerful and takes longerto master each time.ASAP: THE OPENING ACTSIf your primary goal is creating a suitable presentation quickly,and you don't want to customize the design--rearranging elementson the screen, selecting your own fonts and so on--ASAP ismade to order. Using ASAP, in just 30 minutes I created a presentationthat summed up a client's proposed move to a new site. Theend result was attractive, well organized and professionallooking--the colors were coordinated, the various fonts workedtogether, and the spacing and proportions for each slide (which,when strung together in a screen show or printed for use asa handout or flip chart, form your presentation) were wellbalanced.ASAP's limited menu choices mean limited confusion. Rather thantrying to choose from numerous options, you simply select fromfour main steps for assembling your presentation: writing theoutline, then choosing a slide layout, background and colorscheme.Using a blank outline, you can create the text for each slide.To help you figure out what to say, the program offers a fewlimited samples of prewritten presentations, including an outlinefor a company overview, which you can edit to suit your needs.ASAP next lets you choose from thumbnail sketches of slidelayout options, such as bulleted lists, two-column spreadsand pyramid charts. What you see is literally what you get-there's no tinkering with layouts in ASAP.The choices for your slides' backgrounds, comparable to thecanvas of your presentation, are also presented as thumbnailpicklists--for example, you'll see templates that include aworld map background, which could be a nice backdrop for aninternational business pitch, and a muted "Wall Street" template,a sound choice to impress a conservative client.If you don't need to sweat intricate design details or specialeffects, and you have no desire to negotiate customizationoptions to jazz things up, you'll like ASAP. Use it to createworkmanlike, effective presentations in a jiffy.FOUR SEASONED PERFORMERSFreelance Graphics, Harvard Graphics, PowerPoint and Presentationsall provide a much wider range of options and flexibility thanASAP, but for the most part each does an excellent job of guidingyou through the main steps at hand. The programs jump in atthe opening screen with wizards, coaches and other helpersthat stay with you as you build your presentation. Unlike ASAP,however, once these helpers have taken you through the basics,you can further customize your work, altering the design asyou choose and fiddling with the way data is presented.Presentations uses easy-to-follow graphics to explain at thestart that each slide in your project will include three layers the background, the layout and the slide. You can designatecolors, shapes or clip art as part of the background for everyslide. The layout determines how your titles, subtitles, textand so on are arranged on a page. Finally, the master slidecontains both layers, and is the overall template that ensuresa consistent design for each slide in your show; you can choosea master slide design by sorting through an extensive galleryof thumbnail images.Like Presentations, the other programs contain many easy- touse design options, including lots of backgrounds, layout templatesand clip art.After the basics are in place, all of these programs offer aslew of customization options. For example, you may want tomake some of your text stand out; in PowerPoint, you coulduse the Text Anchor command, which lets you see how your textlooks when placed inside a graphical object--say, inside arectangle. Or, in Harvard Graphics, you could size up the optionsfor a table of data--anything from changing the look of yourcolumn headings to determining exactly how you'd like yourgrid lines to appear.Harvard Graphics and PowerPoint also offer some specializeddesign assistance featuring common-sense advice. For example,Harvard Graphics' CheckDesign measures your slides againstcertain design guidelines, pointing out, for instance, thatyou've chosen a text size that clashes with your template,or that you put too many elements on one side of a slide. InPowerPoint, the AutoClipArt feature compares your text to keywordsin its clip-art database, then presents a list of appropriateimages to use in your slides.While all these features contribute to a great-looking presentation,it won't matter much unless you have something compelling tosay. Presentations' Show Expert feature does an especiallygood job helping you organize your thoughts logically, andbuild to a summary conclusion. I used Show Expert to constructa presentation for a client that would demonstrate how my marketingefforts had improved his business, and thus secure more marketingfunds for the future.With that goal in mind, I contemplated the Show Expert's outlinechoices: Did I want to persuade, inform or teach? Definitelypersuade. I was then asked to assess my audience: doubting,positive, negative or neutral? My client has an open mind,so I chose neutral. With that click, the program created anentire outline for me, with slide-by-slide suggestions of howto build my argument, such as describing the marketing challenges,the benefits of my solutions and how much revenue my work hadbrought in for the client. When the Show Expert was done, Isimply swapped in the facts for my situation and added my owndesign elements. Freelance Graphics, Harvard Graphics and PowerPointoffer comparable outline assistance.All four of these programs include multimedia options. For example,they all support basic transition effects--much like the slowfades, dissolves or wipes you see on TV--that can be used betweenany two slides in a computer presentation. You can also addpre-existing audio, video and animation objects (such as aline climbing a chart to indicate rising sales) to your presentations.PowerPoint even lets you build simple animations on your own.Frankly, it's hard to choose a best-of-breed among these fourfor a PC user, although the Windows 95 releases of FreelanceGraphics, PowerPoint and Harvard Graphics are a notch abovePresentations for Windows 3.1 in their automation and multimediaoptions. However, a Windows 95 version of Presentations dueto be released soon is expected to even the score on both counts,while building on the solid ground rules that the current versionuses to get your presentation off the ground. If you alreadyown an office suite that some of these programs are a partof--such as Lotus SmartSuite, Microsoft Office or Perfect Office-you may not need to look any further. At the same time, HarvardGraphics fans won't be disappointed in this latest versionof the software, either.ASTOUND: A MULTIMEDIA STARIf you want to move beyond multimedia basics to introduce someshowmanship, Astound is just the ticket; it strikes a solidcompromise between ease of use and control over program options.Astound starts with a good selection of predesigned presentationsfor a variety of situations, covering topics such as companyprofiles and new product introductions.If you're presenting complicated information in a play to gainnew business or launch a product, you may appreciate Astound'sability to turn a presentation into an interactive event, allowingthe viewer to click through the data at his or her own pace.Letting your client take a sort of self-guided tour can increasethe odds that he or she will retain more of the material youpresent. You're also more likely to hold that viewer's attentionif you let the person select lively elements that Astound provides,such as sound, video or animation, as part of your "show."All of Astound's templates include predesigned animation andother multimedia elements, which are more sophisticated thanany of the other presentation programs discussed above. Astound'stemplates are constructed around multimedia elements; animations,music and videos are part of the standard design in much thesame way the other programs rely on type styles and clip artas integral parts of their templates.With Astound, you can preview an excellent assortment of transitioneffects. While high-quality animations are also highlightsin Astound's gallery of predesigned multimedia clips, you cancreate your own animated segments, too, making objects moveacross a path with detailed, but easily defined, controls.When you have a combination of animation, transitions and othermultimedia effects in a slide, you can use the program's Timelineto set one effect to finish before another begins, and controlthe order in which the effects appear.An impressive presentation can go a long way toward vaultingyou ahead of the pack for that all-important business deal.With your ideas arranged into an informative, convincing andattractive presentation, odds are you'll be called back foran encore.Lynn Ginsburg has written for Rolling Stone, Windows Magazine,NetGuide and many other publications.

But something prompted her to go for the unknown, andshe chose the PC. After a few classes at a community collegenear her Vero Beach, Fla., home, she began exploring AmericaOnline. Before she knew it, she recalls, "I was hooked."One year later, Barbara, 68, is a regular in a bridge-discussiongroup, fires off e-mail to friends and relatives constantly,and sets up private chat-room sessions with far-flung familymembers. "Getting involved with computers is the most excitingthing I've done in ages," Barbara says.In fact, she spends so much time on-line that her husband occasionallyregrets having been such an accommodating Santa last year."Some days he wishes he had given me the bracelet," Barbaraadmits, "but I'm glad he didn't."Barbara's part of an enthusiastic community of seniors usingcomputers. According to Odyssey, a San Francisco-based researchfirm, one in 10 Americans over age 60 owns a PC; more thanhalf of those computers are equipped with modems, and abouta quarter of seniors with a PC use an on-line service.It's no wonder--there's a rich array of experiences on-linetargeted toward older people, be it information on volunteeropportunities, the latest on the Medicare debate or simplyan opportunity to communicate with others. For instance, BenTitow, a 70-year-old widower in Tempe, Ariz., enjoys the chatrooms. "I'm looking for interesting conversation and friendship,"he says. "If more comes from it, fine." He doesn't hide hisage when he socializes on-line, but he doesn't make a pointof it, either--Ben's AOL member profile coyly states that he'sof the same vintage as Paul Newman."Seniors go on-line for exactly the same reason anyone elsedoes," says Jim Hursey, 65, a retired production systems managerin Columbus, Ohio. "It's an interesting hobby, a chance tomeet like-minded people and a convenient source of information."Of course, seniors have varied interests, which makes all ofcyberspace fair game, but the commercial on-line services-and America Online in particular--offer lots of senior-specificactivity. The Internet, too, features a growing number of sitesfor older people, including one Jim helped found, CyberSeniorReview. (To find some of the top on-line offerings servingthe senior community, see the box below.)Some of the most comprehensive on-line areas for older peoplecome from San Francisco-based SeniorNet, a nonprofit groupserving people age 55 and older who are interested in usingcomputers to "increase their personal knowledge, enhance theirtalents and share their wisdom." The organization has 20 LearningCenters, located on university campuses around the nation,offering introductory and advanced computer classes to seniorsfor free or a nominal charge.The group's on-line presence includes SeniorNet forums on AOL,The Microsoft Network and the World Wide Web. "The idea fromthe beginning," says SeniorNet founder and president Mary Furlong,"was to create an electronic community for older people, andprovide them with access to resources and a place to sharetheir knowledge and ideas."SeniorNet's Web site (http:// www.seniornet.com/) emphasizesinformation and links to other resources; on the commercialservices, its forums stress the companionship many seniorsseek on-line. The AOL version (Keyword: Senior) gets the mosttraffic of the SeniorNet areas, so we'll focus on it in thedescriptions below. The Microsoft Network forum, like the fledglingon-line service, is less than six months old (look for theSeniorNet listing in the People to People section)The SeniorNet message boards on AOL cover a broad range of topics.Arts & Leisure is the most popular destination; discussionthreads focus on some of seniors' favorite activities, includingmusic, film, literature, hobbies, politics, education and philosophy.You'll also find plenty of postings (more than 5,000 as of arecent visit) in SeniorNet's Generation to Generation messageboard on AOL, which encourages communication between the youngand old in cyberspace. For instance, the Grandparents & Storytellingfolder recently featured discussion of a clever idea: seniorsusing tape recorders to share stories--true tales, originalfiction, readings of cherished classics--with the younger set.Other hot spots include the Community Center live chat area,and Showcase & Exchange, a shared library of files createdby SeniorNet members, including everything from holiday recipesand tips for holding a garage sale to lists of congressionale-mail addresses and any number of other pet projects.Given SeniorNet's focus on technology, it's only logical thatSeniorNet Online provides terrific information for "newbies" The Getting Into Computers message board is always busy, andthe Computer Tools library in the Showcase & Exchange areais brimming with sounds, clip art and utilities for visitorsto download.But if many older surfers make SeniorNet Online their firststop for basic computer tips, most keep coming back even afterthey've acquired some expertise."People go on-line for information, but they stay on-line forthe relationships they form," says SeniorNet's Furlong, whois the co-author, with Steve Lipson, of Young@Heart: Computingfor Seniors (Osborne/McGraw-Hill)Furlong knows of six couples who got married after meeting onSeniorNet. The virtual community on SeniorNet has come togetherin other ways as well. For instance, Furlong recalls that allLos Angeles-area SeniorNet members were accounted for within24 hours of 1994's major earthquake. And one local woman, movedby the dangerous rescue work undertaken by visiting Marinesafter the quake, got the names and home phone numbers of themilitary personnel working in the area, used SeniorNet Onlineto contact members who lived near the Marines' relatives, andasked them to call the Marines' families and reassure themabout their loved ones' safety.The American Association of Retired Persons sponsors areas onAOL (Keyword: AARP) and Prodigy (Jump: AARP). AARP Online,as it's known on both services, contains a tremendous amountof information on issues crucial for the senior community.The content on the two AARP offerings is similar, but the AOLforum is easier to navigate.Both AARP areas include libraries with information about theorganization, as well as articles and AARP position paperson topics such as senior-related legislation, the emotionalside of aging and the logistics of living on a fixed income.The information is thoroughly researched, well written andcomprehensive. If you need answers to any question pertainingto life as an older person in the United States, you'll probablyfind them in AARP Online.Perhaps because the AARP is so well known--and its activismregarding government programs such as Social Security and Medicarehas stirred some controversy in recent years--AARP Online'smessage boards tend to attract a larger number of younger participantsthan SeniorNet does. As a result, more heated debates ensue,particularly in the Entitlements folders. But there's stillplenty of camaraderie here, especially in the folders labeledJoin In/Introduce Yourself and In Search Of; in the latter,seniors can try to locate former classmates, army buddies,and other friends with whom they've lost touch over the years.Like other successful cybervenues, the most popular on-lineforums for older people reflect a genuine sense of community.Many seniors--especially those putting down roots in retirementhomes or communities--seem to treasure the new link they gainthrough cyberspace to family, friends, and people located allaround the world whom they're meeting for the first time. TheBaltimore-based Senior Campus Living network provides one particularlyinnovative example. The project, which currently includes threeMaryland retirement complexes (with more planned for otherU.S. cities in the next few years), offers residents computertraining and access to the Internet from a central facility.Margaret Williams, 77, lives in the Charlestown Retirement Communityin Cantonville, Md., one of the first centers in the SeniorCampus network. She was extremely wary when she signed up forher first computer training session, nervously telling herinstructor, "I'm not sure what I'm getting myself into here."But by the end of her session, she marched over and gave hima "high-five."

For viewers suffering withdrawalfrom their daily courtroom fix, the game offers a fine substitute-even if, these days, it's hard for fictional trials to competefor drama with real life.In this torrid tale, prominent art agent Zachary Barnes hasbeen shot dead; his business partner, artist James Tobin, hasbeen charged with the murder. You play as the San Franciscoprosecutor assigned to the case; you've got just a handfulof witnesses, and their stories don't all match. Ruby Garcia,Tobin's live-in girlfriend, recently had a brief affair withBarnes; Tobin could have killed Barnes because he was jealous.But then there's the recent theft at the Tobin Gallery to consider;both Tobin and Barnes stood to reap a substantial insurancepayoff. Could that figure in the case? Barnes' wife allegesthat Tobin masterminded the robbery, with his personal assistant,Simon Lee, doing the dirty work.It's your job to sift through everything Garcia, Lee and Mrs.Barnes say, then present a case to the jury. But after thecourtroom battles of 1995, it doesn't take a legal eagle toknow that jury decisions are unpredictable, so you must planyour courtroom strategy carefully. Do you argue a motive ofsexual jealousy, art theft cover-up or both? Tobin's defenseattorney is sharp; she'll jump on every weak statement or pieceof misplaced evidence. You have to play your witnesses justright, ensuring they reveal only the information you need,and do it as artfully as possible.Our verdict? A thumbs-up--with extenuating circumstances. Thegame's innovative use of video makes for splendid graphics,but there's not enough gameplay to keep you glued to your screen.It takes just a couple of hours to interview all the witnessesand bring the case to trial the first time. If you play again(if, say, the jury votes to acquit, or Tobin's attorney getsall charges dropped), you can call the witnesses in a differentorder, or take a slightly different tack when you questionthem. But while you may uncover new evidence, by and largeyou'll be working with the same basic material each time youplay.Nevertheless, even inexperienced gamers will be able to uncover-and enjoy--In the 1st Degree's secrets. The story is timelyand challenging, and it may give you a new appreciation ofour legal system--or at least something to do when you're notwatching Court TV.$50 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Broderbund Software,(800) 521-6263, (415) 382-4600.

Endorfun is at once enchanting, uplifting,frustrating and addictive. With its barrage of positive "subliminal"messages, this New Age puzzle game will raise your spiritsas you maneuver its colored cube across an ever-changing board.I am at peace. Or at least you start out that way; learningthe basics takes only a few minutes. Simply move your cursorwith the keyboard or mouse to roll a colored cube on a gridso that it lands face up on a square of the same color. Eachtime you make a match, a colored square elsewhere on the gridlights up, and you must repeat the task.I can do anything. But it's not as easy as it sounds. You canlearn how to roll the cube in a particular pattern to changeits color to suit your needs, but other colored squares popup to block your path, so you have to work fast and mastera variety of cube movements.Abundance is my true state of being. With 42 games containingat least seven levels each, Endorfun offers an almost unendingarray of challenges within three types of gameplay: In Longevity,you must keep your cube moving as long as possible withoutgetting trapped by colored squares on the grid; in Quickening,a timed game, you must complete levels as quickly as possible;in Abundance, you get points for every level you complete.The puzzles and levels get progressively harder as you play.I am the master of my life. Still, you have no control overthe reward for winning each game: another message of happinessand love. Some people no doubt will consider these words aboutas inspiring as a Stuart Smalley affirmation on Saturday NightLive. But the least Endorfun can do is offer positive feedbackafter coaxing you to spend so many hours under its spell.$29.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Time WarnerInteractive, (800)482-3766, (818) 295-6500.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: The shape of things to come (wave after wave after wave)By:Julie Cohen ZoopPuzzle2 1/2 starsZoop, an addictive puzzle that challenges you to think strategicallyand act fast, offers five freaked-out forms ready to fire:blue boomerangs, green "peanut M&Ms," purple beakers, bluetriangles and red chicken legs.The playing field is shaped like a plus sign; each branch containsfour columns or rows that slowly fill up with a random assortmentof shapes. A square sits in the center, containing one shapeyou use to shoot at the advancing columns or rows. Hit a shapethat matches the one you're firing with, and you eliminateit from the grid, along with any matching forms that are directlybehind it. Hit a different shape, and your shooter changesto match the one you just hit. The trick is to eliminate thelongest columns or rows first; if the shapes reach the centersquare, the game ends with a bang.Take one look at Zoop's dynamic design and it'll come as nosurprise to learn that the game was developed by Viacom NewMedia, a division of the company that owns MTV. But just likemany music videos, the fun wears thin a little too soon. Themost significant difference between levels is their background;even with occasional bonus forms appearing, each of the 99rounds feels remarkably similar to all the ones before it.Yet Zoop has one advantage that makes it stand out from thecrowd: It uses less than 3 megabytes of hard-drive space, shipson two floppy disks and runs under Windows 3.1. (Oddly, it'sreally a DOS game that happens to run under Windows--as opposedto most Windows games, which can't run under DOS.

InSimIsle, you can succeed by working with that balance, or destroyingit.The program lets you choose one of 25 islands, each with itsown mission: Create a tourist haven that maintains a low pollutionrate but brings high incomes to the locals, for instance, orbuild up a lumber-exportation business. If you choose the islandthat looks suspiciously like North America, your mission willbe to make gobs of money regardless of world opinion, pollutionor the happiness of the island's native people.You have 24 agents in your employ; send them to the villagesto create a work force, or to the mines and logging sites toharness each island's resources. But you'll have to tackleseveral tasks at once: For example, building a wildlife preserverequires having a fenced-in area, but who's going to put upthe fence? That requires unskilled labor--so you must fillyour labor pool before you can move ahead toward your largergoal.Despite its politically correct setting, the game maintainsa balanced range of choices.

Timing is everything;once you start a bonus sequence, you may have only 30 secondsto hit the next target.As you meet your pinball challenges, you can work toward yourultimate goal: building the starship. When you've done allyou can at a given table, you select your bonus: an extra ball,a Continue (like winning a free game at the arcade), a newtable or a piece of the starship. The tricky part is figuringout which bonus will bring you closer to the finale. If, forexample, you choose a Continue, you'll get to play a new gamewhen you're done with the last game in the program. True, you'llstart over with no points, but you get to keep all the piecesof the starship you're already building. Alternatively, ifyou've earned a few Continues, an extra ball might help youat the table you're playing.Besides the smooth 3-D action, the game gives you explodingbulldozers, a unique flying missile glider that carries yourball to a convenient point on the flippers, multi-ball playand three sets of flippers per table.

Along the way, you'llacquire various essential objects and tools. Look in everylocker you can--you'll find a variety of ammo and amenitiesto help you overcome the Morphs. Bouncing mines ricochet offthe walls to find targets, while bullets can accomplish anythingfrom piercing armor to determining where the enemy is.Fade To Black's polygon-rendered graphics have a blocky qualitythat many game developers accept as the trade-off for quick,smooth gameplay.

It takes 30 keys to go with the flow: The fourcursor keys let you run, turn left and right, and duck, butyou'll also have to master keystrokes for large and small steps,180-degree turns, loading your gun and so forth.If you liked the similarly staged Alone in the Dark 3 (see Funand Games, July 1995), you might come back to Black; if not,you'll probably just let it fade away.$59.95 (DOS CD-ROM) from Electronic Arts, (800) 245-4525, (415)571-7171.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Developers who can't play the corporate game hit the WebBy:Stuart GibbelWhat do lost cats, acne and Spam have in common?

It may be a moot point before long. A newtechnology standard developed by Intel, coupled with Malachi,an add-in board from En Technology, can link your TV to yourPC for lightning-fast downloads. The system lets a broadcastor cable station send digital data, such as interactive gamesand multimedia software, to your television at a rate nearly200 times that of a 9,600-bps modem. The TV can then transferthe files via standard RCA cable to your computer.According to Matt Cookson, an En Technology official, it's upto TV programmers to decide what content they want to send;whatever it is, it will be transmitted in tandem with regularlyscheduled TV shows (you can record the files on a standardVCR to retrieve later). Malachi has been tested in New Hampshireand Vermont, with users successfully receiving "the whole gamut,from pictures of TV stars to text files to software packages,"says Cookson.

Take six points on usBy:Julie CohenUltra 3-D Pinball demands sure aim and solid strategy to rackup big points. Here are six tips you can bank on.* Timing is everything. If you hit the flipper too early, theball will bounce right back to where it was before. Flippingtoo late sends the shot into the opposite bumper. To time yourshot perfectly, fire just as the ball meets the flipper.* Take advantage of the channel. When the ball rolls down thechannel alongside the flipper, raise the flipper to trap it.Once the ball comes to a stop at the "elbow," you can figureout your best shot, then lower the flipper to aim the balland set it in motion.* Play the angles. Once you've caught the ball, wait until itrolls down to the perfect spot on the flipper before you fire.Flip while the ball is near the top, and it will move vertically,toward the back of the table. The farther down on the flipperthe ball goes, the more the ball will veer to the oppositeside of the table when fired.* Throw a left, then a right. This rescue technique can getyou out of a jam. If it looks like the ball is rolling rightdown the middle of the table, try to get a piece of it withone flipper at a time. The key to this maneuver is to makesure you don't raise both simultaneously. In order to work,it's got to be a one-two punch.* Go for a pass. This one's tricky. The object is to flip theball from one flipper to the other, in order to get a betteraim at your target. It can be extremely helpful, but to usethis technique consistently well, your best bet is to practice,practice, practice.* Throw your weight around. Don't be afraid to "shake the table"if the ball looks like it's headed for one of the lanes thatwill take it out of play. After all, you can't flip the ballif you can't get to it. A tap or two on the space bar shoulddo the trick; more than that, and you're flirting with a tilt.--J.C.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Lifestyles + Learning--The PC Way: Where science and conscience collideBy:Charles BowenThe Day After TrinityHistory, science4 starsThe Trinity Site in New Mexico is the innocent-sounding nameof the spot where the first atomic bomb was tested in 1945.The Day After Trinity, a finely focused, beautifully craftedCD-ROM version of Jon Else's 1980 Oscar-nominated documentaryfilm of the same name, tells the story of J.

Poetry,music, photos, home movies, letters and diary entries cometogether in a compelling collage.The program also incorporates an extensive, searchable databaseof the names on the wall, augmented with information on thesoldiers' hometowns, birth dates and military ranks, as wellas the exact locations where you'll find the names on the monument.Another section describes how the wall came to be, beginningwith Vietnam veteran Jan Scruggs' inspiration after seeingthe movie The Deer Hunter, continuing through the design competition,and ending with the construction and dedication in 1982. Alongthe way, you'll hear comments from the winning designer, MayaLin, as well as surviving political and military leaders reflectingon the era.The disc's one serious flaw is its embarrassingly sparse sectioncalled About the War. Rather than teaching us, the sectionmerely demonstrates that the story of the Vietnam War is toolong and complex to be covered as an after-thought. For thatreason, this is not a very helpful disc for students in searchof the facts, figures and fissures surrounding Vietnam.

Butthe result hardly seemed a match made in heaven; hard driveswere rare, compact discs unheard of--and searching the massivetext required the patience of Job.Now, with Verse Search 6.0, mere mortals can tackle the taskwith ease. The software will rapidly search the Old and NewTestaments, pull out verses containing specified keywords,and link with relevant study manuals, maps, a biblical encyclopediaand personal notes. It took only a second for the program tolocate all 1,515 verses mentioning "children," then narrowthe list to the several dozen that also mention "teaching"or "training."

You can flag landmarkswith arrows, stoplights, pointing hands and labels such as"Turn left here." When you're done, print your map (for bestresults, use a color printer)On the downside, Compton's Street Guide lacks the search muscleof some competitors--for example, the program stops short oflocating specific street addresses.

Then he leaned over and kissed the monitor.This time out, our hero's off to the Cartown Zoo, where a varietyof baby animals have wandered off from their proper surroundings;the snake and the hippo are trapped in Arcticland, for instance,while the lion cub is stuck on a rock halfway up a waterfall.Players must steer Putt-Putt through the zoo to find the missinganimals and the gadgets he needs to rescue them--a shovel todig through an avalanche, for example, or lumber to fix a raft.It's up to the kids to figure out what tool to use in eachrescue mission; along the way, they can stop for a game ofhockey against a polar bear or snack on cotton candy.In the HomePC Kids' Lab, Putt-Putt's charms never fail to capturethe hearts of players above the age rating on the box (3 to8). Cara, 10, loved the game as much as her 6-year-old sister,Laura, did. Cara hoped that her reward for outscoring the bearat hockey would be something to use to help a baby snake offthe Arctic ice. Laura cheered for her sister and, like a goodNew York (if not hockey) fan, chanted "Let's Go Mets! Let'sGo Mets!" when she heard the organ in the arena. Alas, thehockey game was just for fun."I feel so bad," Cara lamented. "I'm here playing hockey withthis bear, and the poor little snake is freezing his burritosoff."Maybe it's the music or the excellent cartoon graphics. Maybeit's Putt-Putt's squeaky voice.

As employeesof Virtual Travel Inc., children traipse along a time lineand a map of Europe in an effort to return, say, a copy ofShakespeare's Othello, James Watt's steam engine or Beethoven'sFifth Symphony to their rightful era and location.When players visit a particular historical time, on-screen robotsmorph into characters decked out in period garb to brieflyintroduce them to the cultural, political, religious and artistictrends of the day. As children explore museums, laboratories,libraries, theaters and architectural sites in each location,they identify objects that may point their search in the rightdirection. For example, the items might identify composersand artists who lived in the same country or century as theobject kids are trying to place.The helpful robots put history in a livelier context than manyother educational games. But the on-screen clues are limitedto factoids; children can easily end up wandering the centuriesfor what seems like ages, collecting clues from numerous erasuntil they figure out where each of the four objects belongs.It helps a lot to keep a good encyclopedia handy."This game is cool. It's like, so...virtual," observed Alex,10, as the program whisked him off from the travel agency'sspace station to medieval Germany, where he heard a Gregorianchant in a cathedral.But by day's end, Alex had lost his enthusiasm for the disc,saying that after playing it for a while, the game just didn'tmeasure up to "the high quality of Carmen Sandiego."Parents will appreciate the game's educational efforts, andwith 120 items to place, the program has the potential formany hours of play.

Rather than just driving a tractor or connectinga fire hose, kids get briefings--sung to catchy tunes--aboutthe challenges that firefighters, farmers and constructionworkers face every day.When kids show up for work, they collect a time card and punchin at the Big Job Clubhouse, where they select one of the threeoccupations. They can view music videos about the job, playgames or sing songs that help teach them about their chosenprofession.

Butthose late-breaking links are just a hint of what's to comeas children's software merges with the information highway.Bill Gross, the founder of Knowledge Adventure (which publishesthe popular Bug Adventure and Jump*Start software), believes1996 "will be the year educational software stops being antisocial."In his view, the software of tomorrow will be designed notfor one or two players at a single keyboard, but for kids allaround the world connected by the Internet for collaborativeeducation.For instance, Knowledge Adventure aims to link its children'sreference discs to an on-line research service called HomeworkHelper. Children will be able to learn more about subjectscovered in the software by clicking on an icon that accessesHomework Helper automatically. Once connected, they can supplementthe software by reading up-to-date sources, including publicationsand transcripts of National Public Radio broadcasts, and bychatting with other kids using the service.Kids with Internet access playing Headbone Interactive's AlphaBonkFarm (see Kid Raves, May 1995) can jump from the game to Headbone'sWeb page to read Svelt Velma the Sow's daily horoscope.

We gave the 25tykes in the CMP Publications Child Care Center in Manhasset,N.Y., a chance to put them to the test.The keyboard king? Comfy, by a nose. Age-rated for childrenfrom 1 to 6 years old, the $129 Comfy (Windows 3.1, Macintoshdue in January) comes with one CD-ROM or floppy disk; otherprograms are available for $24-34 each. The keyboard's buttonsare marked with pictures instead of letters, which makes theComfy great for little ones.Vtech's $79.99 Sound Learning Keyboard (DOS), designed for children3 to 7, features raised letter keys in alphabetical order,a style suited for kids just learning to read.

A subsequent preliminary study at the University ofSouthern California showed that there is more to entertainmenttherapy than anyone suspected--and the results of the studyled to the formation of Starbright, a sister foundation developingentertaining computer programs to provide medical informationto children and relieve the anxieties and suffering of thosewith serious illnesses. The foundation has the backing of astar-studded lineup of supporters, including film directorSteven Spielberg.Starbright's chief project is a $60 million computer networklinking high-tech playrooms in eight pediatric hospitals acrossthe United States. Spielberg hopes one day to expand the networkaround the world, allowing patients to log on, choose an electronicpersona--or "avatar"--from more than 150 characters designedby his animators, and play together in a virtual world. Currently,kids can fly their avatars through the clouds, race down adrag strip or join one another to explore a cave. Or, theycan pop into a videoconference to see and talk with childrenin other hospitals.According to Spielberg, the inspiration for the network camefrom a young cancer patient who asked the director if he couldturn on the light in E.T.'s finger, so E.T. could reach outand touch the boy and return his life to normal. Of course,that request was beyond what E.T.--and Spielberg--could do.But with the network and other high-tech interventions, Spielbergsays, the diversion provided by fun and entertainment can helprelieve the pain felt by that child and others, and "take usa long way toward that dream."Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: In an age of Model T's, this PC's a CorvetteBy:Fred DavisAcer Aspire 2136Computer3 starsComputer design is no longer simply a question of motherboards,microchips and cables; consumers are beginning to look at PCsas home furnishings, and they expect to see a little visualstyle with their technical substance. The Acer Aspire 2136sets a terrific example for this new breed--its dramatic anglesform one of the sharpest-looking PCs around.The Aspire owes its singular good looks to a renowned high-techdesign firm in Sunnyvale, Calif., called frogdesign.  Instead ofa motley assemblage of boxy hardware and peripherals, the 2136carefully coordinates its pieces The case, monitor, keyboard andmouse come in slate gray or mossy green, unified by graceful,flowing, futuristic lines.Of course, the Aspire's design would mean little if its triumphswere merely aesthetic; happily, it's functional, too. For instance,holes in the monitor and case look cool--and keep the systemcool as well. The front panel of the PC case flips up to reveala handle; opening the case is simply a matter of grabbing thehandle and pulling it out.Inside, the Aspire holds a potent 100-MHz Pentium chip, 16 megabytesof RAM and a 1.2-gigabyte hard drive. The system includes aquad-speed CD-ROM drive, 16-bit sound card, and 28.8-Kbps modemwith fax, answering-machine and voicemail capabilities. Thekeyboard (which comes with a wrist rest) and mouse are bothcolor-coordinated and comfortable to use.We breezed through our installation and setup in roughly 10minutes, thanks to the system's color-coded cables and correspondingconnectors. The 2136 comes preloaded with Windows 95, and addsa nice selection of on-line communications, education and entertainmentsoftware to the mix.The one disappointment in the model we tested was its 14-inchmonitor (which adds $299 to the base price). The built-in speakersand integrated multimedia cable are nice touches, but the smallscreen delivered somewhat fuzzy images. The 15-inch versionsells for $399; that may seem a pretty penny for an extra inchof real estate, but it makes this stylish system a much moreattractive buy. $2,299 with 16 MB of RAM, 1.2-GB hard driveand quad-speed CD-ROM drive (monitor sold separately), fromAcer America, (800) 309-2237, (408) 432-6200.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: The perfect computer for Little Jack HornerBy:Fred DavisPackard Bell Multimedia Corner ComputerComputer3 1/2 starsTalk about cornering a market: The Packard Bell Multimedia CornerComputer is the first personal computer designed to fit snuglyinto the least intrusive part of a room.Packard Bell turned to frogdesign--the same firm that createdthe Acer Aspire (see above)--to give its systems a face-lift.Compared with the Aspire, the Corner Computer looks clunky,and its case doesn't open as easily. But the way the PC anglesneatly into the corner of a room or desk, letting you reclaimprecious living or work space, is a real innovation.While you'll find the model hanging out in corners, it isn'tloitering; this is one of Packard Bell's most powerful PCs.Its 100-MHz Pentium processor and top-notch components achievedsome of the best performance results we've seen yet from PackardBell, which has taken some heat in the past for selling systemswith below-average components. But in the Wintune 2.0 testswe ran--a set of benchmark performance comparisons--the CornerComputer's RAM, video and hard drive results were more impressivethan those of the Acer Aspire 2136.The unit we tested came with 16 megabytes of RAM, a 1.6-gigabytehard drive, a quad-speed CD-ROM drive, and a built-in TV tunerand FM radio. The MPEG video system was fast and responsive,and it delivers full-screen, full-motion playback from yourCD-ROMs. On the downside, the Corner Computer includes a 14.4Kbps modem--anything less than a 28.8-Kbps model on a PC aspowerful as this seems unnecessarily skimpy.$2,799 with 16 MB of RAM, 1.6-GB hard drive and quad-speed CDROM drive (monitor sold separately), from Packard Bell, (800)733-5858, (818) 865-1555.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: IBM passes screen test with flying colorsBy:Julie CohenIBM ThinkPad 365CDMultimedia notebook PC3 starsPortable-PC lovers' hearts may flutter when they see the rainbowof colors on the ThinkPad 365CD multimedia notebook's screen,but, ultimately, this system is more functional than it isfun.The 365CD has its share of snazzy features for the price: abuilt-in double-speed CD-ROM drive, built-in sound and an activematrix color screen. However, as with any notebook PC, portabilityrequires a few compromises: You'll need an external drive (includedin the base price) to use floppy disks, and there's only onespeaker.Of course, the big compromise comes in overall performance,which generally suffers compared with similarly equipped desktopmodels. The ThinkPad packs an Intel-compatible 75-MHz 486DX4chip, 8 megabytes of memory and a 540-MB hard drive, yet inWintune performance tests, it more closely resembled a 66-MHz486DX2 desktop PC.And yet, there is that screen. The active-matrix, 640-by-480display delivers colors as vivid as you could hope for. Andat 10.4 inches diagonally, you'll have plenty of room to enjoythem.IBM also lets you take your pick of operating systems--eitherWindows 3.11 and IBM's OS/2 Warp, or Windows 95 alone.The ThinkPad 365CD isn't perfect, but it is a complete, portablemultimedia PC; road warriors can count on it to deliver value-and color--if not the flash of a pricier notebook.$3,000 with 8 MB of RAM, 540-MB hard drive, built-in doublespeed CD-ROM drive and active-matrix display, from IBM, (800)426-2968, (914) 766-1900.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: 8X is fast--but CDs still need to catch upBy:Julie CohenDiamond Multimedia Kit 80008X multimedia upgrade kit2 1/2 starsThe Diamond Multimedia Kit 8000 comes with everything you needto turn your system into a screamer: a state-of-the-art 8XCD-ROM drive, 16-bit wavetable sound card and Yamaha YST-M53-watt speakers that deliver rich sound--all serving to enhancethe kit's stellar software selection, which includes favoritessuch as Myst and Star Wars Rebel Assault. It's a fine package-but it may still be racing a bit too far ahead of the technologicalcurve to justify its price.At this point, the benefits of the 8X CD-ROM drive haven't quitebeen realized. There's an advantage to using an 8X device,but the real boost in speed comes in file transfer, not fileaccess.The 1,200-kilobyte-per-second transfer rate dramatically speedsthe time it takes to transfer information from a CD-ROM toyour hard drive. On a Pentium-based Packard Bell Legend 814CDPC, for example, the Diamond CD-ROM drive transferred 125 MBof information in two minutes and 25 seconds; Packard Bell'squad-speed CD-ROM drive took three minutes and 38 seconds.But when we used the drive for research, we found no big differencein search performance. And most game software today is stilldesigned for double-speed drives.If the idea of installing a multimedia upgrade kit sends shiversdown your spine, the Diamond package may confirm your worstfears. Plugging in the hardware components is easy enough,but configuring the essential driver software took severalcalls to Diamond Multimedia's courteous technical-support department.Although the box says the kit complies with the Plug-and-Playstandard, we needed new drivers to install it under Windows95--and even then it took a close reading of a one-page addendumto the manual to finish the job. San Jose, Calif.-based DiamondMultimedia offers no toll-free support, so your long-distancecompany will determine what any similar problems will costyou.Should you spring for an 8X CD-ROM drive?

ZulichLexmark Color Jetprinter 1020Color ink jet printer2 starsLexmark International is one of the companies now making inexpensivecolor printing a reality. Unfortunately, the company's latestentry, the Color Jetprinter 1020, sacrifices a little too muchperformance for pizzazz.Lexmark packs this ink jet printer with alluring features suchas 600-by-300-dpi color resolution, a 100-page input tray,CorelDraw 3 on CD-ROM, and ColorFine 2, Lexmark's multifacetedWindows driver. Two ink cartridges, a black one for text anda cyan-magenta-yellow combination for color, are included withthe machine, as is a handy cartridge holder to keep the unusedink moist. And installation is a breeze: Just connect the printerto a PC, plug in the power cord, install the ink and the drivers,and start printing. Lexmark provides illustrated instructions,but you probably won't even need them. The printer driverscome on one disk; installation requires little more than typingsetup.In fact, the drivers may be the printer's standout feature.They give you control over many functions, including resolution,print quality, paper type, color use and image handling (anautomatic option helps if you'd rather not make all those decisions).A pop-up window displays print-job status and ink level. Ifyour PC has a sound card, you'll even get spoken warnings ifsomething's wrong. Try to print without paper or with the wrongink cartridge installed, for example, and the software tellsyou there's a problem; detailed, context-sensitive on-screenhelp will guide you as you make the necessary corrections.Unfortunately, these features are far more impressive than theprinter's performance. It outputs only about two text pagesper minute in automatic mode; that's too slow for our taste.The print speed picks up by only about 15 to 20 percent indraft mode, which appears to be primarily an ink-saving measure.Text quality on plain paper was fuzzy using the automatic mode,but it cleared up when we used heavier--and more expensive-cotton-bond paper. Color images fared better; we saw justthe slightest banding, and dither patterns (the small ink dotsthat make up the colors of a picture) were barely noticeable.The Jetprinter accepted all kinds of paper and envelopes withouta hitch, but the ink was prone to smearing when moist.The Color Jetprinter 1020 deserves high praise for its terrificdriver, and the price is nice. But if performance is the decidingfactor when you shop, its mediocre print quality and slow outputmay take too big a toll.$226 (Windows 3.1) from Lexmark International, (800) 358-5835,(606) 232-2000.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: Net telephones today?

It's a marvelous engineering feat, but theeffort it takes to get the necessary software to work may undermineits general--and practical--appeal.The Jabra-net plugs into your PC's sound card and provides excellentsound quality. Using it with the Jabra Ear Phone, which containsboth a speaker and a microphone in one extremely small, lightweightpiece, makes the Jabra-net far less annoying to use than atypical telephone headset. It's also a lot handier than usinga microphone and speakers for your phone calls.With a Sound Blaster-compatible sound card and TAPI-compatiblemodem (the Telephony Application Programmers Interface, a fairlynew standard, allows a modem to handle both voice and dataat the same time), you can use the Ear Phone and included PCPhone software to dial and answer your telephone directly fromyour computer. Or, you can make virtually free long-distancecalls around the world via VocalTec's Internet Phone software(to use it, you need an account with an Internet service provider)We received calls from Germany, Israel and Maryland throughthe Internet software; the sound quality was fine on the domesticcall, but voices broke up frequently during international conversations.In addition, it's a half-duplex system, which means it's moreakin to a walkie-talkie than a telephone--only one person cantalk at a time.And for all the comforts of its Ear Phone system, Jabra seemsto know far too little about the software it packs in the box,or the modems and sound cards that make the product work. Weran into vexing installation problems with both a new TAPImodem and the PC Phone software, but neither Jabra, the PCPhone technicians, nor the modem maker would take responsibilityfor solving all the difficulties we described over the (standard)telephone. After six hours of struggle and repeated calls forhelp, we were unable to get the PC Phone software to work undereither Windows 3.1 or Windows 95.It doesn't minimize Jabra's accomplishments to say its ambitiousproduct may need a little more seasoning before it's readyfor a wide audience.

But a $1,099 price tag and serious configurationsnags with SCSI drives make it unlikely the product will bewelcome in most homes anytime soon.The AdvanSys SCSI adapter card that ships with the SureStorefully complies with the Plug-and-Play standard. If your computerhas Windows 95 and an IDE hard drive, you probably won't facemajor conflicts. No such luck if your system has a SCSI harddrive: The SureStore doesn't work with all SCSI controllers,and installation can result in stubborn snags.The SureStore comes with two blank 650-megabyte CD-R discs ($16apiece), but it does not provide the rails that slide it intoa computer's drive bay, nor an MPC audio connector, which you'llneed if you want to hear sound. Both are essential.The SureStore's quad-speed disc-reading functions worked wellin our tests, with performance comparable to typical CD-ROMdrives. HP includes a utility that lets you play audio CDs,and Mag-ic Lantern software, which lets you view Kodak PhotoCDs.But recording to a CD isn't so straightforward. HP ships threeapplications that use the drive's capability: Alchemy Personalis a file-retrieval database that works with either your harddrive or a CD. Easy-CD is a simple file recorder for CD-R devices;it performs well as long as you're copying a relatively smallnumber of files from your hard drive to the SureStore--butif you're copying data from a CD-ROM to the device, you'llhave to copy the files onto your hard drive first.Finally, Easy-CD Audio will record any songs you select froma regular audio CD onto your hard drive, then copy them toa CD-R. But if you're thinking about pirating your favoritemusic CDs, think again: You'd have to convert the audio tracksinto .wav files, which won't run on an audio-only CD player.$1,099 (Windows 3.1) from Hewlett-Packard, (800) 810-0134, (415)857-1501.Back to Headline List CopyrightHOME PC via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3 No. 1Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: PC phone's a real conversation pieceBy:Julie CohenAT&T Computer Telephone 8130PC phone2 1/2 starsIf you want to use a PC as a phone center but don't need a systemas cutting-edge as the Jabra-net, consider AT&T's ComputerTelephone 8130, the first traditional style phone to connect to aPC.The 8130 looks like a standard business phone with a few extracords in the back--two connect to wall jacks, one hooks upto your computer's serial port, and one connects to an electricaloutlet. The two-line speakerphone sports an LCD showing thedate, time, and caller's name or telephone number (if you'vesubscribed to Caller ID). You can program up to 18 phone numbersin its memory and make conference calls, too.But what makes the phone special is its PC connection. Attachthe standard 9-pin serial cable, install AT&T's call-log software,and you've got a mechanized receptionist. Every time you placeor receive a call, the log will store the date, time, durationand phone number. Jot down conversation highlights with thenote-taking feature, and you have a handy record of the exchange.You can also sort the information at your computer by name,phone number or date.The software comes with a phone directory that lets you storeinformation on up to 5,000 contacts; you can dial any of theminstantly at the click of a button.This phone is purely a home product; it requires an analog phonejack and does not work with the digital phone systems commonin offices--say, one that requires you to dial 9 to accessan outside line.

"It was critical that we design somethingthat would fit in anywhere in the home." That meant more thanjust a smattering of color accents. The final product, theAcer Aspire 2136, expresses a personality in fresh shapes,bold colors and innovative proportions. The desktop version'smonitor and CPU fit together for an integrated look that sidestepslimits imposed by traditional all-in-one systems; the minitower version sports so many playful touches--from a roundedfront to cute little feet--it might remind you of a silly sealhamming it up to please a crowd at the aquarium.While Acer focused on presenting a friendly face to the outsideworld, Packard Bell wanted to reorganize its computer's internalcomponents to achieve revolutionary efficiency in its use ofspace. The Multimedia Corner Computer frees up valuable realestate on cluttered desktops. According to frogdesign projectleader Gadi Amit, the Packard Bell line was inspired by thefunctions of multimedia; frogdesign cleverly hit on a formthat calls to mind an amphitheater, with speakers and componentsbuilt around a cylindrical shape.Despite the seemingly radical new designs, Amit says his firmknows there are limits to what computer shoppers will acceptwhen it comes to high-tech fashion.

Badler, Contributing Editor     For all those in the imaging/workflow market who have beenpredicting the big shakeout in the industry, 1995 was the year inwhich they finally looked like prophets.  Acquisitions,consolidations and alliances were the order of the day,particularly since the big Association for Information and ImageManagement (AIIM) Show last April in San Francisco.  More than twodozen significant acquisitions, mergers or alliances were announcedand/or consummated in the last nine months of the year, and thoseon what looked like an accelerating schedule.     Wang's imaging and workflow agreement with Microsoft Corp. wasthe biggest event of the year.  By putting its image viewer andimage controls into Microsoft's Windows 95, Wang pulled off a coupthat eventually can make imaging a "commodity" product.  Thearrangement provides significant marketing advantages for Wang asits imaging products will be linked with Microsoft's operatingsystems.     The following were some (but not all) of the other majordevelopments of 1995 that will have effects on both vendors andusers into 1996 and beyond.The Merger/Acquisition Dance     *    Wang Laboratories Inc.'s acquisition of Sigma ImagingSystems.  This was another big plus for Wang, transferring thesuccessful Unisys/Sigma alliance to Wang and giving it access toSigma's solid installed base.  It gave Wang's enterprise imagingstrategy a big boost, at a relatively low cost.  At year-end, Wangannounced a planned acquisition of Avail Systems to addhierarchical storage management software capability.     *    FileNet's acquisition of Watermark Software Inc.  Thelatter retains its name and operates as a wholly owned subsidiary,but the deal is beneficial to both companies.  In 1996 Watermarkclients will have access to FileNet IMS repositories and FileNetclients will be able to migrate documents to the Watermark server. Not far down the line, the two companies will offer users access torepositories on both servers.     *    IBM Corp.'s acquisition of Lotus Development Corp.  Thiswas IBM's response to the Wang/Microsoft alliance.  IBM plans toleverage Lotus Notes with its own workflow and imaging strategy. It should strengthen IBM's position in enterprise imaging andworkflow.     *    Caere Corp.'s acquisitions, first of Calera RecognitionSystems Inc. and then of ViewStar Corp.  The former consolidatedtwo of the industry's leading optical character recognition (OCR)vendors and put Caere on the road to dominating the market, withhoped-for revenues of $100 million in the near future.  The latteracquisition helps Caere extend beyond the desktop market.  ViewStarcontinues under its own name, but by late 1996 look for Caereofferings to be more fully integrated into ViewStar products. Caere also bought 20 percent of ZyLab, a leader in full-textretrieval and indexing.  Combining full-text retrieval with OCRallows expanding Caere to provide a more complete solution.     *    Kofax Image Products' announced acquisition of LaserData. This expands Kofax's offerings by adding storage managementcomponents to complement its Ascent line of image capture andviewing software.     *    BancTec's acquisition of Recognition International.  Itwas driven by several factors:  a need for consolidation in theitem-remittance processing field where BancTec's competitors aregiants such as AT&T Global Information Systems, IBM Corp. andUnisys Corp., and a concomitant need to broaden its product lineand to expand its markets, domestically and internationally.     *    TMS Inc.'s acquisition of Sequoia Data Corp.  This deal,announced in October, will create a product and services providerwith more than $5 million in revenue as well as a record ofprofitable growth.     *    The merger of Excalibur Technologies Corp. and ConQuestSoftware, with Excalibur as the survivor.  The product lines of thetext retrieval and document management companies were retained butsales resources were pooled in some markets.     *    Cornerstone Imaging's acquisition of Pegasus DiskTechnologies.  Buying the producer of file and volume managementsoftware for CD-ROM, CD-R, WORM (write once, read many) andrewritable optical disk drives and jukeboxes advanced Cornerstone'sgoal of dominating imaging's peripheral technology markets.     *    The merger of ImageFast Software Systems and CompusearchSoftware into a new entity, Compusearch Software Systems, typifiedsome of the mergers of smaller software firms.Alliances as Well as Acquisitions     1995 also was a big year for alliances.  Instead of joining atthe hip, many organizations wanted to keep their own identities andstrategies but knew they needed assistance either to grow or tosurvive.  As already noted, the big development of the year wasWang/Microsoft.  Other significant alliances entered into during1995 were:     *    The Eastman Kodak Co., Wang Laboratories Inc. and Imagerydistribution and development agreement.  This enabled Kodak tore-enter the market by reselling Wang's image, workflow andcomputer output to laser disk (COLD) products.  At the same time,Wang  agreed to integrate Kodak's peripherals.  This strengthenedeveryone's distribution position.     *    FileNet and Novell Inc.'s distribution/developmentagreement that will result in three workflow products.  VisualWorkflo for NetWare, a shared database product that ties intoFileNet's workflow software, will be distributed later this year. Also to be available this year are Ensemble Discovery Edition, anelectronic mail-based document workflow, and Ensemble, ane-mail-based graphical workflow product.     *    Unisys' strategic partnership with Wang.  This gives eachadded distribution channels and plugs holes in existing product andsystems lineups.  Both companies come closer to each being asingle-source provider for its existing customers.  Unisys alsoentered into a Master Sales Agreement with IdentiTech Inc. thatwill help broaden its marketing base.     *    AT&T Global Information Systems' partnership with Fiservfor AT&T/GIS to market the software products offered by Fiserv'sImage Integration Business Unit.  This is part of AT&T/GIS' push tobecome a one-stop provider of imaging services.     *    Alpharel Inc.'s agreement with Control Data Systems Inc.for the latter to integrate Alpharel's line of document imaginginto solutions for Control Data customers worldwide.     *    Keyfile's alliance with Microsoft.  This will provideseamless integration of Keyfile's workflow technology into theMicrosoft Exchange Server.  That opens up markets for Keyfile itmight not have reached otherwise.     *    Action Technologies' agreements with PC DOCS, Saros andNovell Soft-Solutions to offer Action Workflow DocRoute.  Thisprovides customers of all four firms with advanced client/serverworkflow functionality by combining Action's client/server workflowcapabilities with complementary document managing offerings fromthe other vendors.     *    The integration of Informative Graphics' Myriad documentviewing software with Documentum's Enterprise client/serverDocument Management System (EDMS) typified product integrationactions taken by some of the independent software providers. Typical of market-expanding alliances was one entered into byRimage with MultiMedia Masters & Machinery (4M) of Switzerland. Under that agreement, Rimage will market 4M's CD-ROM productionsystems in North and South America while 4M continues to market onits own in Europe and Asia.What's Behind the Urge to Merge?     A major cause of the shakeout in the industry was theexistence of too many companies for the size of the imagingbusiness, which still has not achieved the soaring altitudesforecast for many years.  Not enough of the competitors were makingmoney.     Thus, in some instances the acquisitions resulted from thefinancial weaknesses of the players.  Despite having excellentproducts, they needed deep pockets to be able to grow and/or stayin business.  This was the case with ViewStar, which neededfinancing.  In some allied situations it was because founders orbackers of pioneering firms apparently decided it was time to"harvest" the fruits of their efforts.  That appeared to hold truewith Calera.  Before its acquisition by Caere, industry rumors hadCalera's venture capital backers impatiently waiting for a bigreturn.     Then there were situations in which cost savings were a majorconsideration.  The BancTec/Recognition International deal isexpected to result in cost savings of $25 million to $30 million. It also gave acquirer BancTec expanded international coverage.     Sometimes a merger occurred because a deal was too good toturn down.  FileNet's acquisition of Watermark sounded like one. The latter retained its identity and still got more than $60million.  And, of course, IBM's $3.3 billion offer for Lotus wasthe best example of a sweet deal.     But there also were other factors pushing consolidations. These included a drive for market share, sometimes in one segmentedmarket, sometimes across the board;  rapid migration of oldersystems to new platforms; the geometric acceleration of technologytypified by groupware's impact on workflow and its effects onindividual vendors; the glut of providers in some areas,particularly software.  Finally, a number of the consolidationslate in the year probably were reactions to the Wang/Microsoft andIBM/Lotus actions.The Meaning for Users     The various consolidations and alliances signal the rapidmaturing of the imaging/workflow marketplace.  For users, theeffect is positive.  Inevitably the multiplicity of vendors createsconfusion and caution.  The user sometimes wonders - with goodreason - how long a vendor will be around.  That raises questionsof technical follow-up and product obsolescence without an upwardmigration path.  Vendor viability and reliability is becoming moreand more critical.  The emergence of powerful industry leaders -fewer but still strong - is reassuring to users looking at futurepurchases and hoping to protect current and past investments.     Whether the urge to merge will result in decreased competition(because of fewer players) or increased competition (from strongersurvivors) is yet to be answered.  How that turns out will affectthe questions of pricing and user cost.  But stronger playersshould provide the base for faster development of improvedproducts.  The trick may be giving the user market time to absorband digest these continually upgraded products and systems whileearning a reasonable pay-back on investments in imaging/workflowsolutions.

Lamb, Associate Editor     There was a time when most corporations didn't have elaborateprivate telephone systems installed in their office buildings - butthey did have access to the public telephone system.  Thoseemployees with permission to use the company phone could callclients, call home, call anyone outside the office building who hada telephone.  But to contact someone inside the building requireda somewhat less technological means of communication.     But necessity - or convenience (it amounts to the same) - isthe mother of invention, so it was inevitable that sooner or latersomeone somewhere would come up with the brilliant idea to build aminiature Ma Bell in the cloak room and connect it to a bunch oftelephones throughout the building.  Voila!  A private telephonenetwork was born!     Something similar is happening to the Internet today.     Corporations that have had access to the public computernetwork have been using it to access and distribute publicdocuments and other information for several years now.  During thepast year and a half, however, Internet access has become anessential part of the corporate infrastructure, due largely to theexploding popularity of the World Wide Web, whose easy-to-use,graphical interface has thrust the art of information distributioninto the mass culture spotlight.  Everyone - from Eastman Kodak Co.(http://www.kodak.com) and ITR's publisher, BRP Publications Inc.(http://brp.com), all the way down to Uncle Bob(http://gagme.wwa.com/~boba/kidslinks.html) and the Geek of theWeek (http://csl04.cs.tamu. edu/ITR/geek.readme) - seems to have ahome page on the Web, and the sites are becoming increasinglysophisticated while remaining shamelessly simple to use.     But even more exciting:  The software used to view documentsover the Web is dirt cheap, and it doesn't matter what computerplatform you're using.     Sooner or later, it was inevitable that someone, somewherewould realize that a document coded with hypertext markup language(HTML) can be viewed with any Web browser regardless of itslocation - whether it was stored on a publicly accessible Webserver in Taiwan, on the hard drive in a desktop computer, or onany computer connected to a company's private local area network(LAN).  Why not, it eventually was asked, use this great newtechnology to improve internal corporate communication?  Voila!  An"Intranet" was born!Granddaddy of Web Embraces Intranet Concept     Netscape Communications Corp., the company that makes thegranddaddy of all Web browsers, the Netscape Navigator, alsoprovides server software, application development tools, securitysoftware and management systems for Internet documents, Web sitesand other such applications.  Despite the fact that all of itsproducts are designed for use on or with the (very public)Internet, the company itself for years has been using them in aprivate setting for internal communications.     But it wasn't until last spring that Netscape realized theremight be a market for such uses of its products and actually beganmarketing its Internet products as Intranet products - software andsystems that can be used on any transmission controlprotocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) network for privateapplications - and by then, many of its customers already had setup their own Web servers and deployed their own Intranets.  Today,more than 60 Fortune 100 companies are using Netscape products forIntranet applications, according to a company spokeswoman, andNetscape expects at least half of its sales to come from the"behind-the-firewall" Intranet sector in the near future, she said.     Last month, in fact, Netscape agreed to license its browser,Netscape Commerce Server, and its Netscape Communications Server toOpen Text Corp. of Waterloo, Ontario, for use in the latter's newLatitude Intranet System product suite.  Like its Internet sibling,Latitude enables users to build, maintain and access electronicdocuments and information using Internet technology (ITR, Oct. 9,p. 7).     "Intranets are the fastest-growing segment of the World WideWeb," said Open Text President Tom Jenkins when the agreement withNetscape was announced, "because they provide a convenient,low-cost, high-impact communications channel."  A ForresterResearch analyst, John Robb, added that Forrester's ComputingStrategy Service expects Intranets "to become a substantial marketbecause they allow decentralized access to distributed,business-critical information."Re-Marketing Internet Products     As corporations increasingly are discovering this, softwareand hardware developers are falling all over themselves trying tore-market their Internet products as Intranet "solutions."  In oneof the more dramatic examples of this, Attachmate Corp. - which hasdubbed itself "The Intranet Company" - a week ago announced that ithas completed its acquisition of The Wollongong Group Inc. Wollongong, whose name has been synonymous with TCP/IPinternetworking technology for more than 15 years, now operates asan Attachmate subsidiary - but is known as the Intranet ProductsGroup.     Attachmate's new "Intranet Products Group" plans to releasethree Windows-based products during the first calendar quarter ofthis year:  Emissary Workgroup, "for complete Internet/Intranet Webconferencing, browsing, publishing, searching, tracking anddocument management," according to the company's announcement;Emissary Host Publishing System; and Emissary Intranet/InternetServices, which will provide support and consulting services tocompanies building an Intranet or developing an Internet site.     Other companies, such as Quarterdeck Corp. and CuadraAssociates, also recently have released Web software - oddly,Quarterdeck's product is called "WebSTAR" and Cuadra's is called"STAR/Web."  Neither of these products is being touted primarily asan Internet product:  Both clearly are targeted to the Intranetsector.     Quarterdeck's WebSTAR for Windows 95/NT, formerly known asWebServer 32, is a turnkey, scalable Intranet server that is "alsopowerful enough" to run a public Web site, said Emerick Woods, vicepresident and general manager of Quarterdeck's InternetApplications unit.  Cuadra's STAR/Web is a common gateway interface(CGI) program that connects the Cuadra STAR information managementsoftware to standard commercial Web servers to enable employees toretrieve information from large corporate databases.  Much of thepress release announcing STAR/Web reads like an essay on howInternet technology is being used "for strictly private use on ...internal [corporate] networks for in-house communications andinformation storage and retrieval."     As 1995 was the year the Internet exploded onto the publicscene, 1996 is likely to be the year that all the technologydeveloped for the Internet will be repurposed and quietly make itsway into the private scene.

According to an annual listing published by IFI/Plenum Data Co.,Kodak received a total of 772 patents last year, down from 890 in1994, when the imaging company was ranked No. 8; the decline isattributable to Kodak's divestitures in 1994.     Dr. James W. Meyer, Kodak's chief technical officer, said theranking is "a tribute to the company's scientific and technicalstaff and a measure of the company's commitment to innovation andproduct leadership."  Kodak conducts its research and developmentactivities in Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdomand the United States.

Chairman Bill Gates has been known to be righton the money, and in his latest book, "The Road Ahead," his analogythat compares the Internet and multimedia feeding frenzy to theAmerican gold rush may be a harbinger of things to come.     Unfortunately, as a new study by International Data Corp.(IDC) notes, after the gold ran dry in the 1800s, ghost towns wereleft behind.  The research and consulting firm predicts that 1996will be a "year of disappointment" for investors and corporationsin the online marketplace, reflecting sluggish development of asignificant consumer base.  In addition, 20 percent of the Fortune500 companies that have commercial Web sites will close or stopmaintaining them, resulting in "ghost sites."     IDC also said the leading online information service providerssuch as CompuServe Inc., America Online Inc., Prodigy Services Co.and the Microsoft Network will realize more than 50 percent oftheir revenues from offering access to the World Wide Web by themiddle of 1997, and that two of the four services will struggle forsurvival.     "Though we predict the overall growth in online subscriberswill continue to be very strong, we expect 1996 will show a highturnover rate as users underwhelmed by the content on the Webcancel their subscriptions and turn on their TVs," said Frank Gens,senior vice president of research at IDC.  "Still, 1996 will be astrategic investment year for businesses that expect to compete inthe growing electronic marketplace, because during the next fiveyears, the number of wired (i.e., online) users will rise to morethan 200 million, and by 2010, it will exceed 1 billion."     Financial services companies, retailers and publishers willbail out in the initial "hangover" period, Gens said, leaving thedoor wide open for new leadership and the downfall of currentgiants.  However, IDC predicts Microsoft will have a great 1996,and its revenue will not be affected by potentially weaker holds onthe industry it may have with technology such as object linking andembedding (OLE) and Visual Basic.     Gens also forecasts that manufacturers of Internet appliances,which allow users to access online information, will slash pricesin half by the end of 1996.  "The game console crowd is alreadyslicing away at the pricing for simple Web surfing devices," hesaid.  "Within two years, Internet appliances will emerge asgiveaways - [from] less than $100 to free - by businesses that wantcustomers to access their online services."

The first two standards, one on prepress/imaging,and one on press, are now available. The finishing anddistribution skill standard will be available shortly.Forty industry representatives of graphic arts firms,associations, union, and education were members of the ProjectPolicy Committee that directed the project. Over 1,200industry practitioners from throughout the U.S. spent hundredsof hours developing and validating the standards.This Skills Standards Project was funded by the U.S.Department of Education (DOE). One half of the $516,127 grantwas received at the start of the project in 1992, while thebalance was funded by the DOE in March of 1994.The skill standards grants were originally launched by theBush Administration. The Clinton Administration then includedthe skill standards project as-a key part of its Goals 2000initiative act which was signed into law in March of 1994.The legislation includes provisions to establish a NationalSkill Standards Board to oversee the implementation ofvoluntary industry-based skill standards.Initially, the printing industry was only one of sevenindustries designated for a skills study of such magnitude,but since the GATF project began, funding has been madeavailable to fifteen additional industries by the DOE and theDepartment of Labor (DOL). Some of the other industriesinclude travel and tourism, computer-aided drafting,biotechnical sciences, health science and technology,electronics, retail trade, and metalworking.The skills standards are available for sale for $20 each, oryou may order all three standards for $49.

In conjunction withEastman Kodak Company, Tiffen's new digital division, TiffenDigital, is developing computer software that will digitallyreplicate the effects of its popular camera filters.  "It willbe offered as a component for digital compositing andretouching software used with Cineon digital filmworkstations," said CEO Steven Tiffen."This is another bridge linking motion picture film with themost advanced digital postproduction techniques," said MikeInchalik, Cineon Products General Manager. "The development ofthis software will enable cinematographers to digitally filterimages in postproduction, using a standard format andterminology they will find familiar and predictable."During the first phase of this development program, the newsoftware will emulate Tiffen's line of color filters. Duringphase two, digital software emulating the company's diffusion,(including ProMist and Soft FX), fog and contrast effectsfilters will be created."The challenge has been one of translation andtransformation," said Marty Ollstein, who heads TiffenDigital. "Film images and digital images represent color andother characteristics in fundamentally different ways. We'veanalyzed reams of information, and have generated algorithmsthat precisely replicate the effects of the Tiffen filters.""During postproduction, cinematographers will be able to say,'I'd like to warm up the skin tones with a tobacco filterwhile leaving the rest of the scene alone," said KodakApplication Specialist Carlo Hume. "During preproduction,tests can be shot clean, and then auditioned with an infinitevariety of filter combinations to determine a look. Filterscan be combined without losing stops on the set as well.""Tiffen and Kodak both have long histories in providinginnovative imaging technologies which serve the needs ofcinematographers," said Ollstein, a cinematographer anddirector himself. "This is a natural next step in theevolution of the marriage between film and digital imagingtechnologies."619/438-5250 619/438-5230Back to Headline List CopyrightIMAGING UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996KODAK UNVEILS NEW FORMAT FOR KEYKODE NUMBERS 65 MM FILMSKodak has modified the machine-readable edgeprint on all ofthe company's 65 mm camera and intermediate films. EastmanKeykode numbers are now encoded at 120 perforation intervalsinstead of 80."This will enable software developers to write efficient andaccurate programs for conforming the negative to video EditDecision Lists (EDL) in all four 65 mm formats," said RobertWoolman, General Manager of Worldwide marketing and VicePresident, Motion Picture and Television Imaging. "Producersof movie rides and other 65 mm movies can now take fulladvantage of non-linear video editing systems inpostproduction."Woolman explained that Kodak manufactures 65 mm film withKeykode numbers compatible with all frame lengths -- five,eight, 10 and 15 perforations - to accommodate the needs ofproducers who create movie rides and other content forspecial venue theaters. The five perforation 65 mm frame isgenerally used to produce theatrical features and films forthe Showscan process. The longer 65 mm frames are typicallyused to produce films in IMAX, lwerks and other large formatsfor theaters at theme parks, museums and other special venueattractions.Kodak introduced Eastman Keykode in 1989. Basically, it is amachine-readable barcode which replicates the human-readablekey numbers. The latter have been used by assistant editorsand negative cutters for decades to conform negative to theediting done on workprints. It is a tedious and time-consumingprocedure subject to occasional human error. With Keykodenumbers, the barcode data captured during telecine transferprovides a frame-accurate address for conforming cuts madeduring editing.Woolman explained that it is a complex procedure because filmfor projection is typically exposed at 24 frames per second,while the NTSC television system transmits and displays 30frames per second. The telecine transfer process accommodatesthis difference by converting every 24 film frames into 30video frames. The introduction of Keykode numbers required thedevelopment of computer software which tracks this differencein frame rate when EDLs are provided to negative cutters andassistant editors."Initially, we perceived Keykode numbers as an enabling toolwhich allowed television film producers to take full advantageof the breakthroughs occurring in electronic postproduction,"said Woolman. "Film programs could be transferred to video forpostproduction. Keykode numbers enabled producers to simplifythe process of cutting the negative to conform to videoediting. We said at the time that the evolution of thiscomputer- based technology would be driven by the needs of themarketplace."During the past several years, with the evolution ofnon-linear digital editing systems developed by Avid,Lightworks and other companies, many feature films andcommercials have been edited electronically using Keykodenumbers to simplify negative cutting. "Many feature filmproducers are now taking full advantage of the most advanceddigital editing technology," Woolman observed. "However,producers who choose to work in the largest film format,haven't had this option."Crest National Video Tape and Film Labs, in Los Angeles, tooka major step toward building a technology bridge for 65 mmfilm producers. The company modified a Rank-Cintel telecinefor high-quality transfer of 65 mm film to video for off-lineediting. They call this service Ultrascan HR. The modifiedtelecine is capable of scanning any 65 mm film and capturingKeykode data in the process.Jon Truckenmiller, vice president of engineering for Crest,said that Ultrascan HR can be used to transfer 337 feet of thelargest (15-perforations per frame) film per minute at 1,100lines of resolution. This enables them to make comparativelyhigh-resolution video dailies."We can now convert the telecine transfer to D-1 format andtransmit it directly to the postproduction facility," saidTruckenmiller "Avid has customized Media Composer digitalworkstations used at the Sony Studios postproduction facilityfor this purpose."Truckenmiller said, "This means that a producer working at aremote location -- say Africa or Australia -- can ship theirfilm overnight by air to a lab in Los Angeles. The lab cangenerally process the film by noon, and deliver the negativeto us. Chances are that we will be able to transfer the film,ship a video daily to the producer via satellite or airexpress, convert the video to D-1 format, and transmit thedata to the postproduction facility, all in that same day. Theeditor can be working on the film within 24 to 48 hours ofthe time it was shot halfway around the world."The missing link, Truckenmiller said, was the ability todevelop computer software for conforming 65 mm negative in the15-perf format, to a video edit decision list. He said the 80perforation interval on 65 mm camera film wasn't compatible."We needed a bar code interval which is evenly divisible byfive, eight, 10 and 15," he explained. "That would allowsoftware developers to create a program which is compatiblewith all four 65 mm formats. We calculated that Keykodenumbers printed every 120 perforations would be the bestsolution. We asked Kodak for their support." Kodak verifiedthis is a feasible solution, and they also providedinformation and sample footage for evaluation to more than 30producers, film labs, software developers and postproductionfacilities. Kodak also added a number of other enhancements,including making the human-readable key numbers larger andmore legible."These types of interactions in the engineering communityhappen everyday," Woolman said. "They are generallytransparent to filmmakers, yet, they can make a profoundimpact on the creative process. In this case, it is nowpossible to cut the time and costs required for thepostproduction of many types of special venue films producedon our largest format film. There are also obvious creativebenefits associated with electronic editing which are now moreavailable to large format producers. The bottom line is thatthis could make it more attractive to produce 65mm films."For more information, call 619/438-5250 or fax 619/438-5230.Back to Headline List CopyrightIMAGING UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996DOCUMENT IMAGING STREAMLINES CITY ADMINISTRATIONCathleen McKay, City Clerk of Ukiah, CA, recently released areport for a Senior Management project for St. Mary's Collegeof California, showing how electronic document management hasrevolutionized the way the city manages paper. In partialfulfillment of the requirements for her B.S. degree inManagement, McKay's project documents how Ukiah'snewly-installed electronic document imaging systemsignificantly benefits the administration and the taxpayer.Replacing the City's tedious, trouble-prone andtime-consuming manual system with a high-tech, cost and time-effective electronic solution, McKay has ushered in thefuture.Questys Text & Image Management System, developed by DecisionManagement Company, Inc. (DMC) of Laguna Hills, CA, was thesystem chosen to manage Ukiah's exhaustive records.  Becauseof its user-friendliness and sub-second full-text searchengine, the system is helping the City, along with dozens ofother cities, streamline their administrations.McKay's planned objective in implementing an electronic systemwas to achieve a 50% reduction in the time and space requiredto manage Ukiah's records. To her credit, McKay found a 72%reduction in actual records search, retrieval and copy time,and a 52% reduction of records in Ukiah's Central File Vault.In addition, the City Clerk was happy to report that staffproductivity went up, as costs went down-a record requestthat used to cost an average of $52.00 of staff time tosearch, retrieve and copy now costs the city a mere $1.02."It is clear this system will pay for itself within the firstyear of operation," said McKay of the nearly $50,000 system.In addition to the increased productivity and documentsecurity, McKay believes that the system will be a source tocreate revenue for the jurisdiction. Estimates show apotential net cash flow of $56, 557 over a 1.5 year period.With these favorable findings, McKay has applied for theInternational Institute of Municipal Clerks' High TechnologyAward. The City Clerk hopes to set an example for otherjurisdictions of an administration that is not only modem andhi-tech, but also economically and environmentally sound.For more information, call (310)399-0702.Back to Headline List CopyrightIMAGING UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996WORLD NEUROLOGICAL IMAGING SALES TO GROWAT 5% RATE, NEAR $3 BILLION BY 2001, LED BY MRILed by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and constrained bycost-control pressures, worldwide sales of neurologicaldiagnostic imaging systems wig grow from $2.09 billion in 1994to $2.94 billion by the year 2001 at a 5 percent compoundannual rate, projects a new study just released by Frost &Sullivan.MRI's revenue share will rise from 40 percent of the totalmarket in 1994 to 49 percent in 2001 while that of computedtomography (CT) dips from 31 to 25 percent and that of X-rayangiography from 27 to 21 percent in the same period,forecasts the report, WORLD NEUROLOGICAL DIAGNOSTIC IMAGINGMARKETS.Other, smaller segments include gamma camera imagingsystems, with 1.3 percent of 1994 market revenues, andneurosonography and positron emission tomography (PET), with0.6 of a percent each.While sophisticated techniques like MRI and spiral CT havesignificantly improved rates of successful primary diagnosis,the refusal of third-party insurers to reimburse many MRI andall PET procedures have often forced radiologists to chooseless costly imaging modalities.Budgeting pressures are causing the low end of the imagingmarket to grow faster than the high end, placing greateremphasis on developing neurological applications forultrasound, gamma cameras and x-ray angiography.

As in the past two years, we have used a less than scientificmethodology.  We have asked vendors to give us information ontheir sales, their customers, their number of employees, and theapplications they believe their products are being used for.  Wehave talked with selected companies that are using expert systemsand asked them what they used in 1989 and what they plan to do in1990.  We have checked notes that we took in conversations duringthe past year, called a few people to ask discreet questions, andchecked the various documents that try to estimate the size of themarket, report companies sales, etc.  Then we put all the datatogether and massaged it until it seemed to be more or lessconsistent. We don't believe that any specific number is correct,but we are confident that the overall picture is reasonablycorrect. (When we obtained more specific information aboutnumbers we used in the past, we usually found that we erred bybeing a little high.)     We are late with this issue in large part because manyvendors who were quick to cooperate in the past were veryreluctant to do so this year. This partly reflects the fact thatthe companies are increasingly dominated by marketing peoplerather than technical people.  And,  it partly reflects the factthat 1989 was a worse year for several vendors than they hadexpected.     We have promised anonymity to our sources  in the process ofgathering our data, so we will not discuss very many specificnumbers.  Instead, we will simply estimate the overall size ofeach niche, and the relative position we believe the major playersoccupy.The Expert System Market in 1989 and in 1990:  An Overview     Overall, we believe that the expert systems market enters1990 in the best shape its been in during the last three years.Broadly speaking, there are two aspects to the market.  There arethe companies that buy expert systems products and develop expertsystems to accomplish their corporate goals, and there are theexpert systems vendors: companies that sell hardware and softwareto help people develop expert systems.The Users     The companies that buy and use expert systems products havebeen steadily growing more confident during the last three years.They have purchased expert systems products; they have built a fewsystems; they have found that the technology works.  Their MISfolks have been skeptical (most still are), but as new productsthat work on mainframes have been introduced and as more peoplelearned about the practical details of expert systems development,the companies have systematically increased their commitment.     We currently estimate that the expert systems are being usedby the following industries in the following proportions:     Manufacturing                           34%     Defense and other governmental agencies 24%     Finance                                 18%     Other business and industry             11%     Education                                8%     Corporate R&D                            5%     Our sample is relatively small, and the confusion about howto classify certain applications is so great, that these numbersmust be considered only approximate. Even within categories thereare big differences. Computer manufacturers have been particularlyactive in expert systems development and we have included them inmanufacturing.  Within the financial industry, insurance companiesare very active, brokerage firms are active, and banks are stillonly mildly active. In both finance and manufacturing, we haveavoided trying to determine whether the expert systemsapplications were actually related to core business functions, orwere used for generic overhead functions. (An expert system usedto manage a chip fabrication production line would perform a corebusiness function; a system used by the same company to assistmanagers in analyzing personnel problems would perform anoverhead function.)     Industries that fall into the "other business and industrycategory that have a considerable interest in expert systemsinclude transportation, energy, and communications. There is alsoa rising interest among retailers.     In 1988, successful expert systems applications reached thepoint where anyone really interested could convince themselvesthat the technology worked and was here to stay.  There are nowseveral hundred working, mid-sized to large strategic applicationsand several thousand small to mid-sized systems that areaccomplishing more modest tasks (like help desks and equipmenttroubleshooting).  Nineteen eighty-nine saw the introduction ofthe first large multi-user expert system, a trend that willaccelerate rapidly in 1990 as systems developed in 1989 arefielded.     Nineteen eighty-nine was the year that companies began tostandardize on the tools they would use to integrate expertsystems technology throughout their organizations. It was also theyear that companies began to worry about systematic methodologiesthey could use to train their programmers to identify and developexpert systems.The Vendors     On the other hand, the ranks of expert systems tool vendorswere thinned in 1987 and 1988.  Several companies went out ofbusiness, while others realized their strategies were not workingand began re-sizing and re-coding in an effort to survive.  Thesewere the years that the Lisp vendors realized that only a very fewcompanies were going to want to buy their tools.     In 1989, mainframe tools triumphed.  Vendors that hadn'tthought you could run expert systems on mainframes suddenlydecided to develop a mainframe version, while the companies thathad focused on mainframes all along did very well.     From the perspective of both the users and the vendors whoare now correctly positioned, 1990 will be a good year.  Theramp-up for corporate-wide use of expert systems is justbeginning, however, and 1991 and 1992 promise to be even better.Who Sold What     We'll consider what happened in 1989 by first consideringwhat happened within various niches, and then we'll try to pull itall together.Hardware Companies     While Lisp machine, language, and most tool vendors wentthrough a tough time during the last three years, the majorhardware vendors who are selling equipment to the companies thatare actually using expert systems have been doing OK. Theconventional hardware vendors enjoyed significant hardware sales(which they attribute to expert systems) and they expect more inthe years ahead. Indeed, given how relatively slow hardware saleshave been in the last two years, conventional hardware vendorssuch as IBM, DEC, and Sun now see expert systems as one of themore promising ways to sell more hardware in the 90s.     We expect that the hardware being used primarily for expertsystems development and implementation is being sold by thefollowing vendors in roughly the following proportions:     Various PCs running MS-DOS (IBM and clone makers) 20%     Macintoshes (most equipped with TI or Symbolics    5%          Lisp chips)     PCs and Unix workstations running Unix            15%     DEC hardware running VMS                          15%     IBM mainframes running MVS                        15%     Lisp workstations from Symbolics and Texas        20%          Instruments     Other                                             10%     Some of the hardware being used may have already been inplace (e.g. the mainframes) but most companies have or will beacquiring new hardware as they continue to expand their expertsystems development efforts, and if present trends hold up, theyshould be acquiring them from the companies listed above.     The Lisp workstation figure looks high at 20%, we believemost of those workstations were purchased before 1989 and that theuse of Lisp workstations will decline steadily over the next twoto three years.     We think that some companies (including the military, NASA,and the aerospace companies that service them) will continue toacquire Lisp workstations for high-end applications, but wepredict that most of the companies using Lisp-based software willbegin running Lisp on a Lisp co-processor or on DEC hardware. (Themilitary will probably move toward Lisp-chips embedded in otherhardware.)     SUN sold about 60% of the Unix workstations being used forexpert systems development.  SUN claims that it derives about 5%of its revenues from the AI market and that AI is its secondlargest market in Europe.     In 1989 companies began deploying expert systems onmainframes so multiple users could access the systemssimultaneously.  We expect that multi-user applications willexpand rapidly in the next few years, and that the overall use ofmainframes will increase accordingly.     No companies reported applications running in OS/2, but weexpect that that is a result of our sample size.  In any case, webelieve this will change in the next few years as OS/2 begins toreplace DOS at more companies.Language Vendors     Some high-end users are working directly in Lisp on Lispmachines, on DEC hardware, on Unix workstations, and onMacintoshes equipped with Lisp co-processors.  In addition, anyonewho is using a Lisp-based expert systems building tool needs tohave Lisp resident on their hardware. A few people in the U.S. arestill experimenting with Prolog.  Thus, there is a continuingniche for symbolic l   guage vendors.     The dominant commercial vendor is Lucid, whose Lisp is onmost commercial platforms. (A new fast version of Lucid Lisp wasjust announced for DEC hardware, adding DEC to the alreadyimpressive list of hardware vendors supporting Lucid, includingIBM, Sun, HP, Apollo, and NCR.) In addition, KEE, the best sellingLisp tool, is written in Lucid.  Clearly, Lucid is going tosurvive.     Lisp  is used extensively in schools.  However, much of it isGold Hill's Golden Common Lisp.  So, Gold Hill can also survive byselling Lisp and tools to the university market. Franz Lisp,Quintus Prolog, and Arity Prolog are all still sellinginterpreters and compilers as well. None of these companies hasbecome as large as its founders had hoped, but they all seem tohave found some level at which they can survive.     Lisp will not go away.  It is a powerful and very flexiblelanguage that is just right for rapidly prototyping very large andcomplex systems. Several different companies in 1989 went out oftheir way to tell us that they expect to be doing more work inLisp in the future.  The latest versions of Lisp are much fasterand easier to manage than the versions of only a few years ago. Asmore and more students move from school, where they learned Lisp,into companies, Lisp will grow slowly and continue to occupy ahighly specialized niche. (The same is also true, to a much lesserdegree, of Prolog).Tool Vendors     The expert systems tool market changed quite a bit in 1989and some of the changes caught us off guard:Small PC/Mac Tool Vendors     We define small PC and Mac tools as tools that sell for from$100 to about $1000.     Many small PC vendors have disappeared in the last two years.Of those that remain, Paperback Software's VP-Expert occupies anoverwhelmingly dominant position.  VP-Expert has now sold some60,000 copies, which means it doubled its sales in 1989.  A largeportion of the VP-Expert sales went to schools, but VP-Expert isalso the most popular small PC tool in the corporate environment.     As we write this, the trial between Paperback Software andLotus over VP-Planners's alleged infringement of VP-Planner onLotus 1-2-3's interface is taking place. Assuming PaperbackSoftware survives this challenge and continues to improveVP-Expert, it should be able to hold on to the low end of theexpert systems tool market for the foreseeable future.     Information Builders' Level5 is clearly the secondbest-selling small PC tool, and it certainly sold several thousandunits.     We always have trouble classifying Level5.  The PC version ispriced as a small tool and it has about the same capabilities asmost of the small tools -- rules and backward chaining -- but itis associated with Focus and there are versions of the toolrunning on DEC machines and on IBM mainframes. In addition, Level5has features that facilitate its integration and assure easydatabase access. Where Paperback Software is really mass marketingVP-Expert, we expect that most of Information Builders' sales areto companies who acquire site licenses.     Other tools that companies are using to develop small systemsinclude 1st-Class, Exsys, KnolwedgePro from Knowledge Garden, andCrystal from Intelligent Environments.  TI's Personal ConsultantEasy is still being used, although it is less common now than ayear ago.     With the exception of VP-Expert, which is priced and sold asa mass-market commodity (and Level5, which we'll consider laterwhen we consider workstation and mainframe vendors), the othersmall tool vendors are either hurting or face the prospect of verymodest growth.     Figure 1 shows our estimates of the small PC tool sales in1987, 1988, and 1989 (see printed version of this issue, availablefrom Cutter Information Corp.; (800) 888-8939, (617) 648-8700).Last year we projected that small tool vendors would sell 70,000units in 1989. Obviously the small tool market has not grown asfast as we expected.     Paperback Software sold the great majority of units sold in1989.  The income the small tools market received was lower thanexpected both because fewer units were sold and because VP-Expertsells for only $249 (often discounted to much less).     We expect that Paperback Software, having the momentum ithas, will continue to sell well in 1990, but we anticipate thatthe overall market for small tools will be about the same in 1990as 1989.  Educational institutions and individuals who want toexperiment with expert systems account for most of the sales.These sales will continue, but they're probably not going toexperience much growth in the coming year.     Another factor that limited the growth of the market forsmall tools was the relative lack of Macintosh sales. HumanIntellect Systems' Instant Expert ($69) is probably the bestselling tool for the Macintosh.  Information Builders introduced aMac version of Level5 in 1989, but apparently there isn't much ofa market for expert systems tools among Mac users.     We expect that some of the smaller tool vendors will mergewith other companies during 1990.  Some of these tools wouldprovide the right vertical marketing company with a greatfoundation on which to develop a series of problem- orapplication-specific tools.  A training company could take one ofthese tools, modify its interface, and create a whole series ofhighly specific tools to help trainers (who are generally notprogrammers) develop manuals, small equipment repair aids, etc.     We keep expecting small, reasonably priced PC tools that arespecialized for specific applications (like manual development, orsmall help desks, etc.) to appear.  So far they haven't.  Thus,the people using the small PC tools are mostly "Lotus-literateprogrammers or students who are using the tools as a way to learnabout expert systems technology or are using them to develop smallapplications.     In our opinion, there are real opportunities for the smalltools that help non-programmers accomplish specific tasks. Thecurrent crop of tools, including VP-Expert, are still toodifficult to use to attract this audience.  Hence, as companiesstandardize, they will increasingly use tools they acquired undersite licenses, and the market for the various standalone, genericsmall PC tools will decrease.Mid-Sized, PC/Workstation Tool Vendors     We define these tools as products that run on PCs, Unixworkstations (i.e. SUN), or DEC hardware. These tools range inprice from $2,500 to $25,000, but most sell for between $5,000 and$8,000.     Last year we assumed that 4,500 mid-sized PC/workstationtools were sold in 1988.  We realize now that some of the units weincluded in that figure were, in fact, European sales.  We nowestimate that the total PC/workstation tools sold in the U.S. in1988 actually totalled some 3,500 units, and the sales incomegenerated by mid-sized tool sales was $23.5 million.     We projected that 1989 mid-sized tool sales would climb to7,000 units.  We now believe that, in fact, there were about 4,500mid-sized tools sold in 1989. We believe the vendors made about$30 million on such sales. Clearly the market didn't grow as fastas we projected.     What is much more interesting is who sold the most mid-sizedtools in 1989 -- Aion Corp.  We did not anticipate this, nor didthe managers to whom we talked in early 1989 about their plans forthe year. Apparently companies decided to standardize in 1989,and, having made that decision, they decided to buy PC tools thatwere compatible with the mainframe tools they intended to buy.Since many companies chose Aion's ADS for their mainframe tool in1989, they also chose to cut site licenses with Aion. Inconsidering who sold the most units, we only considereddevelopmental versions of tools.  Aion led in developmentalversions sold, but they also sold a phenomenal number of deliveryor runtime licenses, mostly in conjunction with site licenses.  Atelling bit of information:  the Texas Instruments instructors atTI's Information Systems Center, who formerly taught internalcourses on how to use Personal Consultant Plus, now teach TIershow to use the PC version of Aion's ADS.     Other important vendors selling in this market include NeuronData (Nexpert Object), AI Corp (KBMS), Software A&E (KES II),Inference Corp. (ART/IM), and Information Builders Inc. (Level5for the VAX).  AI Corp introduced a DOS version of KBMS inmid-1989.  We expect that the same logic (i.e. that companies thathave standardized on a mainframe tool will buy PC versions of thesame tool) will hold in 1990 and that companies choosing themainframe version of KBMS will also push KBMS PC sales up rapidly.Inference Corp.'s Unix workstation version of ART/IM enjoyedsignificant sales in 1989, presumably because companies who areconsidering using ART on the mainframe want to explore itspotential.     Information Builders Inc. didn't play a large role in themid-sized tool market in 1989, but it will probably play a largerrole in 1990. In mid-1990, Information Builders is set tointroduce their new tool, Level5 Object.  Unlike Level5, which isa backward-chaining simple rule tool, Level5 Object will be apowerful hybrid tool with high quality user and developergraphics. The PC version will to be priced at around $1,000. Ifthe tool is as good as the demos and sells for $1,000, it will seta new price/value standard for the industry and put both the smallPC vendors and most of the mid-sized tool vendors underconsiderable pressure.     In effect, the mid-sized/workstation niche, as an independentmarket niche, is disappearing (at least in the U.S.). Companiesclearly want to field expert systems on mainframes and they arecommitting to mainframe companies. Once committed, they are usingthe PC tools sold by those companies rather than buying mid-sizedtools from vendors specializing in selling tools for $5,000 to$8,000.     The exceptions, at the moment, are companies that want todevelop and field their applications on VAX hardware. We expectthat Nexpert Object may still be the best-selling mid-sized toolfor DEC hardware, but it must be getting some competition fromDEC's VAX Decision Expert and will soon get some more from DEC'sEpitool.  That's an important exception, of course, because DECequipment is being widely used in manufacturing --  the industrythat is buying most of the expert systems software at the moment.     AI Corp has just introduced a DEC version of KBMS and Aionhas committed to developing a DEC version in the future. Thus, atsome point in the near future, even those operating on DEChardware will have the option of buying tools that not only run ona DEC, but on an IBM as well.     Some new vendors entered the mid-sized market in 1989.  Themost interesting tool is probably Meta Knowledge's Kappa.  Still,given what we have just said, new vendors that start out on the PCand then try to add platforms until they finally get a mainframeversion are going to have a very hard time.     It's probably too late for any small to mid-sized company totry to introduce a new generic tool.  The market wantsintegration, and there are some good vendors in the market thatare offering exactly that. It will be very hard for a smallcompany to compete by offering a tool that just runs on a singleplatform when there are vendors that have tools running on PCs,Unix workstations, VAX machines, and IBM mainframes.     We expect that the mid-sized tool market will grow modestlyin 1989.  With the benefit of hindsight, we expect that most ofthe mid-sized sales will be to companies that have standardized ona mainframe tool and then buy PC or DEC versions of that tool touse in training and in the development of expert systems.Mainframe Tool Vendors     The mainframe vendors sold about 175 units and made $11million on tool sales in 1988.  We projected that they would sell400 units and make $25 million in 1989.  In fact, we believe theysold about 237 units and made about $22 million selling mainframetools.     We just described the sharp increase in market share thatAion achieved in the PC/workstation market. We expect that in 1990the PC versions of Level5 Object and KBMS will also enjoyconsiderable sales.  We had not anticipated this, although clearlywe should have.  Many companies have apparently decided to go withmainframe tools but, logically enough, they have begun byacquiring only one or a few mainframe versions of the tool, andthen have proceeded to acquire a large number of PC versions ofthe tool.  This strategy allows their developers to begin learningabout the technology and to create and test applications withoutforcing the company to spend the larger amounts of money requiredto make the tools available on the mainframe.     It seems that companies are committing to mainframe delivery,but are holding off on purchasing the software required for thatdelivery until it is needed. In other words, mainframe tool saleswill lag behind the sales of the PC versions of the mainframetools.     Accordingly, even though mainframe tool sales fell below whatwe expected this year, we believe the mainframe tool market is invery good shape.  We predict that mainframe tool sales will easilyreach 400 by the end of 1990, and will accelerate even fasterthereafter as companies develop the applications that require themainframe software for delivery.     Clearly, the dominant mainframe tool vendor in 1989 was Aion.Equally clear is the fact that almost everyone who is consideringbuying ADS is also considering KBMS.  The fierce competitionbetween these two companies will continue unabated through 1990and probably for several years thereafter.  (We will be reviewingAion's ADS and AI Corp's KBMS in the next issue of thenewsletter.)     Nineteen ninety will witness the introduction of InformationBuilders' Level5 Object and IBM's TIRS.  In addition, InferenceCorp. will probably play a larger role as a result of its recentdeal with Arthur Andersen Consulting (See Trends).     In 1989, we saw the triumph of the mainframe approach toexpert systems.  From now on, with the exception of relativelyspecialized vendors like Paperback Software, the Lisp vendors, thedomain-or problem-specific vendors, and perhaps one or two toolsthat are very effective on DEC VAX systems, any company that doesnot have a credible mainframe version of their product will not beable to play a significant role in the expert systems tool market.The competition in the mainframe market should be very fierce in1990.     IBM probably didn't make much money selling expert systemstools in 1989, but it was very active.  In addition to continuingto work on ESE and KnowedgeTool, they began selling IBM/KEE and,much more important, they announced their AD/Cycle with aknowledge-based systems component.  In the context of its AD/Cycleannouncement, IBM also announced that it will begin selling a newhybrid tool with impressive graphics, called TIRS.  We expect TIRSwill quickly replace all three of IBM's early offerings and becomethe first tool that IBM sells in any significant numbers. (ThatTIRS is limited to mainframes and OS/2 machines will limit itssales, but there are enough people who want to buy from IBM andhave been waiting for a credible tool, to guarantee that IBM willplay an increased role in the tool market in 1990.Lisp Tool Vendors     In 1988 the large Lisp vendors sold about 900 units and madeabout $20 million on tool sales.  We projected that they wouldsell 1100 units in 1989 and make about $23 million on tool sales.In fact, we believe that 970 Lisp-based tools were sold in 1989and that the vendors made about $22.5 million in the process.     Last year we considered IntelliCorp's KEE, Inference Corp.'sLisp version of ART, and Carnegie Group's Knowledge Craft in thiscategory.  We placed Gold Hill Computer's GoldWorks in themid-sized tool category and we placed Gensym's G2 in thedomain-specific category.  This year we have included bothGoldWorks and G2 in the Lisp category. We changed because wedecided that the fact that a tool is written in Lisp is much moreimportant to potential clients than the hardware or the size ofthe tool.  In addition to the vendors listed above, we consideredboth AIT's Mercury and DEC's Epitool as part of this market.Epitool has just been introduced in the U.S., but has significantsales in Europe.     Clearly IntelliCorp's KEE is still the best selling Lisp tooland almost everyone agrees that it defines the top of the entireexpert systems market in terms of features and functionality.Inference has switched most of its attention to selling the Cversion of ART and Carnegie Group is concentrating on consultingand on problem-specific tools.  AIT's Mercury (fast databaseaccess) and Gensym's G2 (real-time applications) are currentlyattracting buyers with specialized needs, and DEC's Epitool isabout to test the proposition that customers will buy a Lisp toolif the programming interface makes you think you are programmingin Pascal rather than Lisp.  We expect Lisp tool sales to declineto 900 units in 1990, and we expect the income vendors earn onLisp tool sales to decline accordingly.     There is a continuing rumor that IntelliCorp will introduce aC-based tool in 1990.  If they do introduce it within the firsthalf of 1990 and it is as successful as Inference Corp.'s Cversion of ART, we expect that overall Lisp tool sales may declinesignificantly, since, in effect, the last major Lisp tool vendorwill appear to be moving out of Lisp and will be refocusing itssales effort on the non-Lisp tool market.  That might mean a fewmore Lisp sales for some of the more specialized vendors, but itwill probably be the final blow to generic Lisp tools.  There willcontinue to be a small market for problem- orapplication-specific tools written in Lisp.  However, most of thepeople who want to work in Lisp will probably work in the languageitself.Problem- and Application-Specific Tool Vendors     There were a number of domain-specific tools introduced in1989.  Carnegie Group added Service Maintenance Planner, TextCategorization System, and Cost & Manufacturability Guide to theirearlier diagnostic specific tool, TestBench.  TI, which also sellsTestBench, added Line Balancer, Technicians Assistant, and avariety of airline planning and scheduling applications that itdeveloped in its Symbolic Spreadsheet product.  TI is eager totailor any of these applications to help solve any transportationcompany's needs. IntelliCorp introduced KLUE.  DEC announced XSAFEand started marketing AI WARE's CAD/Chem product. Syntelligencesold a copy of Syntel, its tool for developing financialapplications. These products range in price from a few hundred toone million dollars.     Last year we estimated that 100 problem- orapplication-specific tools had been sold and that the vendors hadmade some $3 million.  We projected the sale of 200 units in 1989and revenue of $6 million.  We believe that more than 200 unitswere sold, but we are very unsure of the money that vendors madein the process. For our summary calculations we take the veryunreliable figure of $6 million and project an equally unreliable$12 million for 1990.  In most cases, these sales blend intoconsulting and these figures have to be regarded as particularlysuspect.Application Vendors     The early vendors who tried to sell expert systems off theshelf failed to make a go of it (although Syntelligence is stilltrying).  At the moment, there are many small to mid-sized expertsystems applications being sold. Most are modest in size and verynarrowly defined.  We have not tried to estimate the number soldor the money being made in the process. Later this year we willpublish a catalogue of expert systems for sale.  We'll try to makea reasonable estimate of the market at that time.Consultants and Software Houses     Companies like Cimflex-Teknowledge and Carnegie Group havereally transformed themselves into software development shops thatspecialize in expert systems development.  IntelliCorp andInference Corp. will probably follow in the next couple of years.In addition, some of the small expert systems tool vendors aremaking most of their money from consulting and will probably beabsorbed by software development groups in the coming year.     Almost all of the expert systems tool vendors earn aconsiderable amount of their money from expert systems consulting(which we have tried not to count as a part of their toolrevenue).  TI, for example, is earning far more money sellingconsulting services than it is selling tools.  As a general rule,you can add 35% to 40% to the tool income of an expert systemsvendor to reflect the income that vendor is earning fromconsulting. (There are only a few significant exceptions -- NeuronData and Aion, for example.)     In addition, established software development groups aredoing lots of work in expert systems.  The largest is clearlyArthur Andersen Consulting (see Trends), followed probably byCoopers & Lybrand and Arthur D. Little.  In addition, most of theother major software development groups are doing at least alittle work in expert systems consulting.  There are likely anumber of groups doing specialized work for the military that wedon't know about.     We don't have any hard estimate of the money the conventionalsoftware houses made by doing expert systems consulting or byincorporating expert systems into their other work, but we assumethat, taken together, the figure must be over $20 million.The Total Size of the U.S. Expert Systems Market     Nineteen eighty-nine was a good year for users of expertsystems, but it was a confusing year for vendors. In retrospect,1989 was part of the transition that began in 1987. The transitionwas not simply away from Lisp-based tools, as some thought, buttoward tools that could be based on mainframes and hence besimultaneously delivered to multiple users.  The C-basedstandalone workstation tools had trouble this year just as theLisp-based tool vendors did in 1987 and 1988. The only expertsystems tool vendors who really look good right now are those thathave the same tools on all of the major platforms, including themainframe.     Aion and AI Corp are in the best position.  InformationBuilders Inc., Software A&E, Inference Corp. and Neuron Data areall still in the market, but each will be playing catch-up in 1990as they try to improve their tools capabilities and theirmainframe credentials to match the two leaders. We only expect acouple of them to really make it.     IBM and DEC are both limiting their tool offerings bylimiting the platforms on which their products will run, but IBMcould be a very serious contender in 1991 if TIRS turns out to beas nice as it looks and companies really begin to shift from DOSto OS/2 (TIRS doesn't run in DOS).     Last year we tried to put a dollar figure on the total expertsystems market and then on the total AI market.  This year wethought that there was too much information we didn't have, so wedecided to take a pass.     We have calculated the total income of tool vendors in 1989and projected it for 1990.  The numbers are presented in Table 1(see printed version of this issue, available from CutterInformation Corp.; (800) 888-8939, (617) 648-8700).     We expect that the best-positioned vendors will expand theirPC/workstation sales next year and begin to get the mainframesales that this year's sales have, in effect, set in motion.     If you really want information on the broader market and canafford to pay for it, you should buy Ovum Ltd.'s new report"Knowledge-based Systems: Markets, Suppliers and Products." ($995,$1035 outside North America) It arrived just as we were completingthis newsletter and we examined it closely to see how Ovum'sassumptions matched our own.  We have a few disagreements; wethink they overestimate the role of Symbolics and AI Corp anddon't give enough weight to Aion and IntelliCorp.  Moreover, theysay VP-Expert sales have faded, which is clearly wrong. (It's asif they gathered their information on the East Coast and didn'tspend enough time in Palo Alto). Ovum's figures are about twiceours; we expect they didn't take into account the discounts thevendors are offering and the effect of site licenses on income.Still, we know how hard it is to come up with reasonableinformation on the various parts of the AI market and this reportseems to us worth quite a bit of study if you are interested invendor income estimates.     In addition to a complete analysis of the U.S. market, theOvum report has the best analysis we've seen of the expert systemsmarket in Europe.

Before we begin to make predictions for 1990, let's take alook at what we predicted for 1989.     1. "Lisp machine vendors and Lisp-based generic tools willall but disappear in 1989.  Lisp-based problem- or domain-specifictools will do better, but..."     We said this last year and still predicted that some 1100Lisp-based generic tools would be sold. We estimate that about 979units were, in fact, sold.     Although Symbolics is showing a profit, it has switched itsenergy toward software and TI is maintaining a very low profilethese days.  We think we were right on this one.     2. "C, Mac, and mainframe tools will dominate the news in1989."     As noted above, nothing much happened on the Mac, but C andmainframe tools certainly dominated the news.  We'll take a mostlyright on this one.     3. "Several new problem- and domain-specific tools will beintroduced."     We were certainly right on this one.     4. "The hottest subject in 1989 will be object-orientedprogramming techniques.  All of the tool vendors are scrambling tointroduce or improve their capabilities.  Object-orientedtechniques make developing expert systems faster and easier.Rule-based tools provided most of us with an introduction toexpert systems, but hybrid tools are now rapidly becoming thestandard for expert systems work."     This was certainly correct.  ADS now has objects andInformation Builders' Level5 Object (formerly called Level5(Release2) is in beta testing and about to be released.  We talkedto several companies about standardization during 1989 and no onewas considering a tool that didn't have (or was about to have)objects.  Everyone now realizes that objects are necessary formany high-end applications.     In addition, the object-oriented conferences were very hot in1989. Many programmers who know little or nothing about expertsystems are rushing to learn about OOP.     5. "The Mac tools introduced in 1989 will be reallyimpressive and will raise the standard for what we expect for thesmall PC tools."     Human Intellect Systems Instant-Expert Plus (introduced in1988) remained the most interesting small tool on the Mac.Hyperpress' Intelligent Developer was interesting but needed morework. The same goes for Logic Programming Associates' (and QuintusComputer Systems) Flex. IBI's Level5 for the Mac is a veryprofessional tool, but not very exciting.  Paperback Softwarefailed to deliver its Mac tool, as did Gold Hill. Little's Cameo(in Hypercard) is interesting, but not commercially available.     The Mac is being used by Lisp programmers in conjunction witheither a TI or a Symbolics Lisp co-processor to run largerLisp-based tools like ART or KEE, but those are hardly small PCtools.     We missed on this one. So far, the Mac isn't playing a veryinteresting role in the world of small expert systems.     6. "Nexpert Object will dominate the workstation tool marketin 1989, but will probably start to face some real competitionfrom tools that have about the same capabilities and interface butcost closer to $800."     Nexpert Object no longer dominates the mid-sized workstationtool market, Aion does.  It hasn't gotten any $800 competitors,but it will when Level5 Object comes out at $1,000 in mid-1990.We were wrong on this one.     7. "The major marketing battle in 1989 will be fought betweenADS and KBMS. Aion will try to add object-oriented capabilitieswhile KBMS will concentrate on getting its tool to run as fast asADS-HPO."     We were right on here.  Aion did add objects and AI Corp didmanage to get KBMS to run a lot faster.  And they certainly didbattle in the offices of many companies that are trying to decidewhich tool to buy.     8. "The overall market will grow slowly as companies continueto try to sort out how to integrate expert systems techniques withtheir current practices."     We were right on this one.  Actually the market grew a littlefaster than we expected because companies began to standardize andseveral site licenses were sold, but we still think thisprediction accurately reflects the overall market in 1989.     9. "Consultants and vertical market VARs will do very well,since companies will turn to them both for assistance in trainingtheir own personnel and for developing high-value tailored expertsystems applications with high price tags."     We believe that we were right on this one, too.     10. "The research community will continue to show a lot ofinterest in neural nets, but there won't be very many commercialapplications."     Right again.     11. "Interest in and applications of natural language will bemore pronounced in 1989 than in previous years, driven primarilyby the introduction of KBMS with its Intellect interface."     There certainly was a growing interest in natural language in1989. Natural language vendors showed up in numbers at the AAAIconvention (IJCAI in Detroit) for the first time.     Most of the natural language activity was incorporated inexpert systems applications or focused on front ends fordatabases.  MCI International, for example, developed a systemthat scans incoming messages and sorts out time-critical moneyorders. They have sold the system to several banks.     Natural language hardly begins to rival the interest inexpert systems, nor is it worth the effort for most expert systemsapplications, but it is slowly and surely growing.  We'll take aright on this one too.     We admit that our 1989, predictions were pretty general andrather conservative, but we're still pleased to say that we got 8right, 1 mostly right and only 2 wrong.  Buoyed up by our successin 1989 we have decided to be more specific and less conservativein predicting what will happen in 1990.  We'll be really happy ifwe get 75% of our 1990 predictions right.What We Predict for 1990     1. 1990 will be a good year for people promoting expertsystems within corporations and for the few expert systems toolvendors who are positioned correctly.     In spite of tight money and continued confusion abouthardware, operating systems, and networking, corporations willinvest in expert systems because they are directly related tosolving hard, strategic problems; increasing productivity; andimproving quality; all key corporate concerns.     Fortune 500 companies will continue to standardize on toolsand buy site licenses, which will make the winning expert systemstool vendors stronger, while eliminating the less successfulvendors from the market.     Most corporate MIS groups are only beginning to be won overto expert systems, so 1990 won't see really large numbers ofsystems deployed or integrated in the way that DEC has.  Webelieve 1991 and 1992 will be even better years, as MIS peoplerealize just how many problems they can ameliorate or solve withexpert systems techniques.     In other words, the AI winter is over, the weaker vendorshave been weeded out or are dying, and the vendors who havesuccessful products are about to enjoy some prosperous years.  Thepeople within corporations who have been championing expertsystems are about to become respectable prophets, as MIS groupsslowly but surely realize that expert systems technology will bean important key to success throughout the 1990s.     2. The term "expert systems is about to disappear. By the endof 1990, almost everyone will be saying"knowledge-based systems(KBS). We certainly admit that "expert systems suggests the wrongthing; (it refers to a specific role that only a small minority ofthe systems ever played) and that "knowledge-based systems putsthe emphasis on the technology, where it belongs. (The only properalternative would be inference-based systems.)     "Expert systems has held on primarily because the media haveused the term in popular articles. As the hype around expertsystems dies down (and the popular computer press focuses on OOPand neural networks), corporate analysts and programmers willprefer to talk about the technology using a more accurate term.     We'll have a hard time adjusting; "expert systems just comestripping off our tongue, but we'll try. (We may even change thename of the newsletter.)     3. Throughout 1990, the main marketing news will continue tobe generated by Aion and AI Corp, although later in 1990, IBM'sTIRS will begin to give both companies some modest competition.     By the end of 1990, Aion will be the most successful expertsystems vendor, with sales topping $30 million.     4. Level5 Object will be very well received and willeffectively drop the price of a good, hybrid mid-sized tool to$1,000.     5. The Lisp-based hardware and tool vendors are still in fora rough time.     IntelliCorp will introduce a C version of KEE.  KEE willremain the best of the Lisp-based tools and the preferred choiceof high-end developers, but IntelliCorp will be forced to shrinksince it is still too large for its limited niche.  Symbolics willtry to shift from hardware to software, but they will have troubleand they too will probably also find themselves trying to shrinktheir overhead.     TI will increasingly focus on doing Lisp development in thecontext of highly targeted consulting.  They will focus onintroducing a SPARC II chip with Lisp-like capabilities and thenposition themselves in the Unix world.     Gold Hill will need to shrink some more and will probablyincreasingly focus on supplying Lisp software for universities.     The Lisp companies that survive will follow TI, Teknowledge,and Carnegie Group and become specialized software developmenthouses. They will de-emphasize software sales and focus on helpingclients develop strategic software applications.     One or more of them will be purchased by larger softwarehouses who want to add an expert systems capability to theirportfolio of consulting capabilities.     At least one major Japanese or European software house willenter the U.S. market by acquiring one of the Lisp vendors to geta foothold in sophisticated software development in the U.S.     The use of Lisp will continue to grow throughout the decade.The demand for Lisp-based products and consulting services during1990, however, will be less than the supply being offered by thevarious Lisp vendors.     6. DEC and IBM will both play a steadily increasing role inthe expert systems market.  They will both continue to benefitfrom the growth of expert systems-driven hardware purchases.     DEC will play a larger role in the short run by helpingmanufacturing companies develop an overall strategy for usingexpert systems and integrating them throughout the company.     IBM will play a greater role in the longer term by continuingto work on its tool offerings until it gets a winner -- probablyin the context of their AD/Cycle.     Both companies will continue to play a limited role in thetool market in 1990 because both companies are still trying to usetheir tools try to force companies to commit to their hardware.Most companies, however, will insist on buying tools that run onseveral different platforms, including mainframes, PCs (in DOS andlater in OS/2), VAX machines, and Unix workstations.     7. Neural network applications will increase and you willhear more about them as they get integrated into existing expertsystems building tools. Neural networks will still remain aresearch subject and not a commercial technology throughout 1990.     8. Object-oriented programming will continue to be a hottopic throughout 1990.  Many programmers who know nothing ofexpert systems will get excited about using C++, Object-orientedCASE tools and Object-oriented databases. (By the middle of thedecade, C++ will be the dominant OOP language and will begin toreplace C.)     Most of the OOP folks don't know much about expert systems.They stress rapid prototyping but don't understand inferencing orthe use of heuristic rules. In 1991 and 1992 there will be a realopportunity for expert systems people within corporations to helpthe OOP folks develop a methodology based on what they (the expertsystems people) have learned about developing object-basedprograms and managing rapid prototyping efforts.     By 1992 or 1993, the best of the OOP tools will incorporatesome inferencing and will be positioned as CASE tools. Some ofthem will probably be developed by the same vendors who are nowselling expert systems tools.     We regard OOP as a spin-off of AI, or at least a kindredtechnology, and will devote an increasing amount of attention toit as it matures.  We haven't tried to estimate the financial sizeof the OOP market in this issue, but we will take a crack at itlater in the year.     9. Problem- and application-specific tools will continue tobe introduced.  No one tool will have a large impact because eachwill be specialized for very specific niches, but they willcertainly create consulting opportunities for companies that willincreasingly consider themselves software consulting firms, asTexas Instruments' Knowledge Engineering Group has done.     10. While the early vendors of expert systems applicationswere unsuccessful, there is a growing number of vendors, mostlyselling expert systems that run on PCs (see the Trends article onAsk Dan) or applications that are highly specialized, such asDuPont's Packaging Advisor or Beckman's PepPro, that are doingquite well. The successful products all emphasize that theyperform a job well and de-emphasize the technology that underliesthe product.  No one wants to buy a tax program simply becauseit's an expert system -- they want to buy a tax program that'smore powerful, flexible, and easier to use than its rivals.     (We'll be publishing a catalogue, "Expert Systems for Sale,",1990.  We don't expect people to buy expert systems from acatalogue, but we want to show just how large and diverse thisspecific subset of expert systems applications has become.  Wehaven't tried to put any financial numbers on application sales inthis issue, but we'll come up with an estimate as we develop thecatalogue, and we predict that it will be a more impressive numberthan most will expect.)     11. The hot expert systems topic of 1990 will be a systematicmethodology.  There will still be some market for consultants andtrainers who want to talk about "What Expert Systems Are but themost successful consultants will be those who can help companiestrain conventional programmers to recognize opportunities, buildexpert systems, and integrate with existing corporate systems.     If someone develops a methodology that rests on a structuredapproach to developing hybrid systems (the successor to thetop-down structured programming systems based on data flowdiagrams), corporations will beat a path to their door.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTELLIGENT SOFTWARE STRATEGIES via NewsNetJanuary 1990Arthur Andersen Consulting and Inference Corp. Sign an Agreement     Just as we were going to press, we received an announcementthat Inference and Arthur Andersen Consulting have signed anagreement whereby Andersen will have access to Inference's expertsystems tools for use in its system integration business.  Theagreement also provides for Inference to assist Andersen inapplication development.  Inference estimates this agreement willproduce between $5 and $10 million in revenue over the next threeyears.     This agreement will go a long way to ensure that Inference isseen as a vendor who can supply tools that run on PCs, Unixmachines, VAX hardware, and on IBM mainframes.     It also lends support to our contention that conventionalsoftware consultants will want to acquire the consulting skillsthat are currently possessed by companies like Inference,IntelliCorp, and Carnegie Group.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTELLIGENT SOFTWARE STRATEGIES via NewsNetJanuary 1990Ask Dan, Now Andrew Tobia$' Tax Cut     For the last two years we have recommended Ask Dan, aPC-based expert systems application that helps individuals andsmall business prepare their taxes.  (We weren't alone in this --"Business Week" rated Ask Dan #1 for two years in a row, as well.)The important thing about this program is that it doesn't put alot of emphasis on being an expert system; it just does the jobbetter than the competing (non-expert) programs.  The interface isreally excellent -- it reproduces the IRS forms and allows you tofill out the forms, open windows to get advice, and eventually,print out your returns.     For those who are interested, Ask Dan in now beingdistributed as part of the Andrew Tobia$ series under the name TAXCUT.  If you have been using Ask Dan, Tax Cut will seem completelyfamiliar. If you use the Tobia$ Managing Your Money software, TaxCut will work with the data from that program.     Tax Cut is available from MECA Ventures, Inc. and isavailable in most software stores.

SIIPS is a client-server-based image system that supports NCR's7780 transport and is compatible with the widely-used Check ProcessingControl Software (CPCS) from IBM Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., andSuperMICR software from Computer Associates of Islandia, N.Y.       End users who have waited more than a year for SIIPS to bereleased look to the system as an alternative to image-based itemprocessing systems from IBM, Unisys Corp. of Blue Bell, Pa. andBancTec Inc. of Dallas.Better Way To Handle Checks     Newly renamed NCR (see story, p. 7) hopes SIIPS can takeadvantage of rising interest among large banks for imaging to boostproductivity, reduce labor costs, beef-up services and generate newfees, said Mike Visser, assistant vice president of item processingproducts at NCR.     Ed McHugh, director of payment systems at Unisys, estimates thatthe market for imaging in the top 250 U.S. banks could exceed $300million this year.      Some 70 percent of these banks already have at least one imageapplication in beta testing or live production, he added.  These rangefrom image proof-of-deposit (POD) to image-cash management to low-volume transports for niche work.     McHugh added that the number of imaging applications used by topbanks could rise as merged banks integrate their individual processingsystems to reduce costs and boost productivity.       In addition, NCR believes image systems, such as SIIPS, will drawinterest from banks trying to manage their growing check volumes. Despite the promise of electronic alternatives, check volume has grownby at least 2.3 percent annually since 1989, noted Jim Moore,president of Mentis Corp. in Durham, N.C.     "I can't imagine a competitive bank not having the beginnings ofan imaging strategy in place this year," said Geoff Emerson, generalmanager at IBM.Expect More SIIPS-like Products     NCR is confident it can tap into this growing interest in imagingand sell SIIPS to at least 20 of the top 250 U.S. banks this year,Visser said.       He admits that this will be a tall order since NCR facescompetition from IBM and Unisys, which have offered their own high-speed image check processing systems for several years.  But NCR plansto stress its system's scalability, low cost of ownership and hostsoftware compatibility, Visser explained.     "If the scope of SIIPS is to totally replace what goes on incheck processing right now, NCR will have its hands full with four orfive installations this year," an industry watcher told IPR.  "If thescope of SIIPS is only to replace proof departments, NCR could getseven or eight deals."     The source added that large banks will be reluctant to buy SIIPSthis year because NCR doesn't have a proven track record in high-speedimage processing.     In addition, NCR is counting on SIIPS to give the vendor momentumin large banks, noted Greg Schratwieser, president of InternationalConsulting Inc. in Fairfax, Va.  Some long-time users of NCRtechnology lost faith in the vendor because it took so long to developSIIPS, Schratwieser claimed.     Indeed, it was end users who urged NCR to develop SIIPS itself toensure the system has adequate maintenance, quality measures andsupport, Visser said.     SIIPS is the first product to be released by NCR since thecompany announced last year it was splitting from AT&T and creating anew Financial Industry Business Unit to focus on financial systems(IPR, Sept. 28,).     "SIIPS is the kind of product we will focus on after therestructuring," Visser explained.  "It's designed for one of ourtraditional business markets, but it leverages our company'stechnology and resources in new ways."        He added that SIIPS also is a "more complete" item processingsolution than any other product offered by NCR.  "Our business hasbeen built largely with solutions partners, who understand aparticular application area well and build their processing softwareon top of our 7780 transport," Visser said.A Completely Client-Server-based System     A key feature of SIIPS is its "completely client-server-based"architecture, which reduces the image system's upfront costs and makesit more affordable for banks with lower check processing volumes,Visser claimed.     Large-scale image check processing solutions from IBM and Unisyshave elements of a client-server system, such as personal computer-based keying workstations.  However, they still rely heavily on sometype of mainframe, Visser explained.  "We don't have a mainframeanywhere in our system," he added.     This client-server configuration reduces the equipment costsbuilt into the SIIPS system versus mainframe-based image checkprocessing systems, Visser said.  "We have seen examples whereequipment costs for SIIPS were between 30 percent and 50 percent lessthan equivalent systems from our competition," he said.     High-speed Balancing, Key-ahead Functions     Client-server technology also allows NCR to offer a scaled-downversion of SIIPS, which processes about 100,000 proof-of-deposit (POD)items, for less than $1.5 million -- roughly half the price of animage system from one of NCR's competitors, Visser estimated.  "Oursmallest configuration is a lot less expensive because our servers andtransports cost less," he said.     SIIPS also offers the benefit of compatibility with legacysystems, such as CPCS and SuperMICR software.  "SIIPS thinks it's areader-sorter, and it will do all the sorts that the host system wantsit to do," Visser explained.  This helps banks protect theirinvestments in existing IBM mainframe-based CPCS systems, explainedJohn Spencer, senior vice president at Frost National Bank of SanAntonio.  Frost currently uses several SIIPS applications.       SIPPS also includes a high-speed balancing feature thatidentifies and ranks probable causes of error in out-of-balancetransactions.       For instance, the system automatically sends items that itbelieves are miskeyed to a data-entry clerk for rekeying.  If thetransaction remains out-of-balance, the system sends another item forreentry or looks for other errors, such as deposit slip mistakes, lostdocuments or recognition errors.     Another useful feature is a key-ahead function built into thesystem's image display terminal.  Visser explained that two checkimages are displayed on the screen at a time, allowing operators tokey ahead as they would on a proof machine.  The function could helpin training new proof operators, he said.SIIPS in Live Production at Wachovia     SIIPS POD and image delivery applications already are in liveproduction in processing centers at Wachovia Corp. of Winston-Salem,N.C., National City of Cleveland, and Frost.  Additional sitescurrently are being rolled out.     Wachovia helped NCR develop the SIIPS POD application andinstalled the system at the bank's operations centers in Atlanta,Columbia, S.C., Raleigh, N.C., and Charlotte, N.C.  Wachovia processespeak volumes of more than 2 million unencoded items per day using thefour systems, with the Columbia center alone processing more than800,000 items per day, Visser said.     "We needed a solution that would coexist with our existingtechnology and one that wouldn't outgrow our needs in a couple years,"said Paul Boone, executive vice president of check operations at thebank.  Wachovia expects the SIIPS POD system to reduce the bank'slabor and maintenance costs, Boone said.      National City, which also worked with NCR as a developmentpartner, installed SIIPS POD alongside IBM's CPCS version 1.11 hostsoftware at its operations center in Columbus, Ohio.  The bank alsoplans to install SIIPS in its three other operations centers, startingin Cleveland.    Frost implemented multiple SIIPS applications, including CD-ROMimage delivery, image statements, and SIIPS POD, at its operationscenter in San Antonio.  The bank processes more than 300,000 unencodeditems per day.    Frost currently is installing SIIPS at its remote center inHouston.    Meantime, NCR is developing a pre-encoded capture application,interface software for the IBM 3890 reader-sorter, wholesale andretail remittance and lockbox applications, and recognition softwareupgrades based on technology from AT&T's Bell Labs.

For instance, having tellers separate work that includes addingmachine tapes from work that does not, can reduce the time requiredfor document preparation at the SIIPS POD site.  (Mike Visser, NCRCorp. 513/445-6646.) Back to Headline List CopyrightITEM PROCESSING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY LEADERS FOR 1996    *  Make imaging your top priority, suggests Don Avedon, presidentof Avedon Associates Inc., in Potomac, Md.  Corporate customers willbegin to expect imaging services as they hear about your competition'sofferings.  Consumers also increasingly will have firsthand knowledgeof imaging through home banking packages such as Microsoft Corp.'sWindows-based products, he says.    "As more people gain access to imaging ... processors will havean easier time getting consumers and senior management to accept thetechnology," Avedon said.  "It also will be easier for vendors to sellimaging systems to banks."    *  Consider adding image check processing, even if you're a bankwith less than $150 million in assests, says Tommy Green, president ofGreenway Corp. in Carrollton, Ga.  "More and more small banks areadding image systems as a result of falling software and hardwareprices and increasing pressure to keep up with nearby banks that offerimage-based services," Green explained.      As evidence, he points to People's State Bank of Groveland, Fla.,a $60 million asset-bank that recently inked a deal to implementGreenway's PrimeImage check processing system.  The bank processes anaverage 6,000 items per day.    Green speculated that smaller banks within a 50-mile radius maypartner to buy imaging systems.  For example, First Bank and Trust ofCarrnesville, Ga., and Bank of Toccoa of Toccoa, Ga., purchasedimaging equipment from Greenway but plan to process their checks atFirst Commerce Bank of Commerce, Ga.  "By not buying a check sorter,the banks save about $125,000," Green said.    *  Balance the benefits of individual image applications withyour long-term, enterprise-wide strategy, recommends Geoff Emerson,general manager, IBM Corp.  in Charlotte, N.C.  "Consider how all ofyour image applications fit together to ensure that your long-termstrategy stays on track," he said.    Emerson also suggested end users watch for "customer-facing"image applications with beefed-up functionality.  He explained thatvendors, such as IBM, will focus considerable attention this year ondeveloping and improving applications where customers know their bankis using image technology.    "More and more vendors will provide solutions that allow banksand processors to use image technology in new ways," Emerson said.    *  Get your feet wet with electronic check presentment (ECP), ifyou already haven't, suggests Steve Takahashi, group senior vicepresident for ABN-AMRO Services Company Inc., in Chicago.  Takahashibelieves more banks will develop ECP systems this year and begin toexchange items electronically to slash check fraud, boostproductivity, develop new return item products, and take advantage ofECP-related discounts offered by some Federal Reserve banks.      "Many banks have developed ECP systems, but they haven't gonelive," he noted.  The problem is, most banks only are set up to sendbut not receive ECP transmissions.  ABN-AMRO hopes to begin exchangingECP items early this year.    *  Educate operations employees in on-line communications andprepare your company for using the Internet to move large volumes ofpaper-based information, such as contracts and mortgages, Avedon says. "The information technology world eventually will be tied together bytelecommunications," he noted.  "But the typical document imagingperson knows very little about telecommunications."    Avedon recommended that processors purchase telecommunicationsmanuals for employees and include operations managers in meetingswhere telecommunications staff discuss long-term plans for networkupgrades.

Back to Headline List CopyrightITEM PROCESSING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996LOWER PRICES, MORE COMPETITION FORESEEN IN REMITTANCE MARKET    It's going to be a buyer's market this year for image-enabledremittance systems, predicts Bob Kirk, president of EnterpriseConsulting in Dallas.     "There are some significant sales to be made, but I don't thinkthis will be as big a year for image remittance vendors as the lasttwo years," Kirk said.  "Most of the large processors have purchasedimage remittance systems, and many will focus this year on maximizingbenefits from these new systems."    Kirk speculated that reduced demand from large processors forimage remittance systems could force vendors to complete up to twiceas many sales in order to make the same amount of money that they madelast year.      He added vendors will sell a "fair" number of retail lockboxsystems this year, but most of the buying activity will be in thewholesale lockbox market.     "This is going to be the year that many of the top 50 banksdecide to replace their existing systems because of their high laborand maintenance costs and limited ability to facilitate new, revenue-generating features such as CD-ROM delivery," Kirk explained.  Thesebanks will demand wholesale systems with better data entrycapabilities and beefed-up image production, he added.    "Nobody has introduced a full-scale imaging system for wholesalelockbox," Kirk noted, adding that most of the systems used by the top50 banks rely on technology that is nearly 10 years old.  A number ofthese banks already have hired consultants to develop wholesalelockbox imaging strategies.Mix and Match System Components    Kirk also predicted that a growing number of medium- and high-volume processors will purchase system components from several vendorsto get the best networks, servers, personal computers, transports andoperating systems.    "As the concept of open systems takes hold, users will realizethat they don't have to rely on one company to provide them a totalsolution," Kirk said.    Indeed, several vendors will introduce platform independentsoftware this year for remittance processing, predicted Steve McNair,president of FTP Consulting Services Inc. in Euless, Texas.  "Thevendors offering these systems will make the same base softwareavailable for all of the major hardware platforms in the market,"McNair explained.  "This will allow end users to mix and matchsoftware and hardware to get a best-of-both-worlds solution."    Similarly, NCR Corp. of Dayton, Ohio, is working with severalsoftware vendors to qualify their applications to run on NCR'splatform, noted Mike Visser, NCR's assistant vice president of itemprocessing products.  The company hopes to offer more products thatbetter suit its customers needs, he said.     Combining components from several vendors also helps usersimprove system functionality and control costs, Kirk noted.  "When youbuy a solution from one provider, your ability to control costs isseverely limited," he explained.Consider Small Scale Remittance Systems    Small-scale image remittance systems, which are designed forprocessors with volumes of up to 100,000 transactions per month, alsowill become more popular this year, McNair speculated.  These systemsgenerally are personal computer-based and feature image-enabledtransports with optical character recognition (OCR), intelligentcharacter recognition (ICR), courtesy amount recognition (CAR), front-and-back-audit trails, encoding and sort capabilities.    "Target markets for these systems will be low volume retailapplications such as rural water, gas and electric companies, andsmall insurance, mortgage and retail processors," McNair said.  Headded that small-scale image remittance systems offer significant costsavings versus conventional remittance products in terms of theirrelatively low price tag and reduced maintenance costs.

Back to Headline List CopyrightITEM PROCESSING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996VENDOR URGES BANKS TO START SMALL     Software Earnings Inc. of Memphis, Tenn., hopes to boost itsshare of the image market this year by convincing banks to "gather thelow-hanging fruit" before image-enabling their proof-of-deposit (POD)operations.     "Banks have been scared-off by image proof-of-deposit because itwould force them to change all of their documents and reengineer theirentire organization," says Larry Jones, director of image productsmarketing for Software Earnings.      "We're telling banks to get their feet wet with imaging byapplying it to applications like exceptions processing, which iscostly and accounts for just 2 percent of a typical bank's totalvolume," Jones said.  By gaining experience with image-exceptions,banks can get comfortable with the technology on a small scale, whilestill providing imaging to their customers, he says.     In addition, image-based exceptions processing offers banks ahigher marginal return on their investment than image-enabled POD andin-clearings.  The reason:  Compared to the cost of handling a check,exceptions items are up to 300 times more expensive, depending on thetype of exception, Jones explained.      "Vendors have been trying to create an attractive payback onimage-enabled POD for five years and it's still not there," he said.     "Processors have got MICR-based POD down to a science, whichmeans banks need to achieve high volumes before they'll see asignificant return on their imaging investment," Jones explained. Plus, image-exceptions systems cost about $500,000, while enterprise-wide, image item processing solutions cost up to $70 million perinstitution, he estimated.     ABN-AMRO Services Company Inc. of Chicago, which recently signeda deal with Software Earnings for multiple imaging applications (IPR,Oct. 26, p. 8), adds that the revenue potential of image-exceptions is"icing on the cake."      "The overall cost of the system is easily cost-justified by thesavings realized through reject repair, balance assist, and the returnitems interface," said Steve Takahashi, its group senior vicepresident of check operations.    By adding image-based exceptions processing, Takahashi hopes toreduce his bank's exceptions staff by 25 percent.

Back to Headline List CopyrightITEM PROCESSING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996TIPS TO BOOST DEMAND FOR IMAGE STATEMENT BINDERS    Hold after-hour receptions for key bank customers, such asmerchant accounts, to boost the number of customers that pick up theirimage statement binders, recommends Phillip Crane, director ofmarketing for Vulcan Binder and Cover in Vincent, Ala.      Serve refreshments, give customers a tour of your imagingoperations and have your marketing department speak on the benefits ofimage, Crane suggested.    More and more banks provide free binders as a customer servicewhen they make the transition to image statements.  Of the 200 banksthat Vulcan knows are adding imaging, only 12 have decided not tooffer binders to their customers.    Crane noted that getting customers to pick up their binders canhelp improve customer acceptance of imaging.  Here are other statementbinder tips:*  Hold a series of seminars, luncheons and visits with your merchantcustomers and their certified public accountants to give them theirbinders and to let them know what technology is available and how itcan be tailored to their needs, suggests Dean Tingey, senior vicepresident at First National Bank and Trust Co. in Asheboro, N.C.  Havebranch managers provide a contact at each business and help themarketing department make calls to set up the meetings.*  Have your binder supplier print your bank's name and slogan on theside of boxes containing image statement binders, Crane suggested. Stacking the boxes in a pyramid in each of your branches will drawattention to your bank's image statement roll out and help solve yourstorage crunch, he explained.  Tip:  Consider mailing binders tocustomers, such as the elderly, who may have trouble picking up theirbinders at their branch, Crane said.*  Show customers sample binders before implementing imaging, saysTheresa Lyons, customer service representative at Jeff Davis Bank  inJennings, La.  Display binders on customer service desks in yourbranch offices, along with posters touting imaging.  Also, havecustomer service representatives show the binders to new customers andto community organizations, Lyons recommended.    Another tip:  Send customers neon-colored, "statement-stuffers"with information about imaging and the available statement binders,Lyons suggested.  Customers are less likely to discard brightly-colored information before reading it.

Like teleconferences, PC conferences enable participants atdistant locations to engage in discussions through the displays ontheir personal computers.     However, PC conferences are less expensive than teleconferences,as they do not require large display screens.     The sources said domestic and foreign electronics makers haveentered the market in which sales of PC conference terminals areestimated at 3 million units in fiscal 1995.     Two U.S. electronics makers, PictureTel Corp. and Compac Corp.,teamed up last summer to enter Japan's PC conference market, whilethe world's largest semiconductor maker Intel Corp. will market a newsystem for PC conferences.     Japan's top PC maker NEC Corp. has introduced a new system in abid to dominate the market, the sources said.     Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the world's largest consumerelectronics maker, plans to introduce its own system featuring abuilt-in, multifunction camera.     They will be joined by other Japanese and U.S. competitors, suchas Japan's top mainframe computer maker Fujitsu Ltd. and AppleComputer Inc. of the United States, the sources said.Back to Headline List CopyrightJAPAN COMPUTER INDUSTRY SCAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996Powerful magnet for VCR motors, computer HDD developed+NAGOYA, Dec. 25 Kyodo     Aichi Steel Works Ltd. said Monday it has developed a newmagnet for use in videocassette recorder (VCR) motors and computerhard disk drives (HDD) that is capable of providing 70% more energythan that of the most powerful conventional magnet.     The new magnet, ''Magfine 17,'' is an anisotropic magnet madeof the magnetic powders of neodymium and plastic.  The new productprovides energy at 17 mega gauss-oersteds (mgo) compared with 10 mgoprovided by the most powerful conventional isotropic magnet, thecompany said.     The company will start marketing the product next month.     The new technology involves heating and consolidating themagnetic powders by taking advantage of the critical ''moment'' whenmelted plastic becomes liquid, an Aichi official said.     With the technology, Aichi Steel has succeeded in arranging theall particles of neodymium in the same direction, he said.     For the time being, the product will be integrated into VCRmotors to move the magnetic heads of a VCR and magnetic sensors, itsaid.     Expectations are high that the new magnet will be integratedinto the CD-ROMs and HDDs of notebook personal computers, he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightJAPAN COMPUTER INDUSTRY SCAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NEC develops new voice info system+TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo     NEC Corp. has developed a new voice information system thatuses flash memory microchips and can record up to four hours ofvoice data, a company official said Tuesday.     With the new system, voice data is compressed from 64 kilobitsper second to 16 kilobits and transformed into digital data, theofficial said.     The compressed data is recorded on a 32-megabit flash memorychip installed in ''Chip Whisper,'' a business card-size device newlydeveloped by NEC, the official said.     A flash memory chip, an electrically erasable programmableread-only memory, is able to record 30 minutes of voice data, hesaid.  Because they retain data even when the power is turned off,they are popular for portable products such as notebook personalcomputers.     NEC will preview Chip Whisper at a Tokyo art gallery in January,and visitors will be able to use the system to hear recordedexplanations about the works on display via an earphone.     Some galleries previously used frequency modulation (FM)broadcasting or dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, but theNEC system is more practical because it does not require broadcastingequipment and can convert data more easily than a DRAM system, theofficial said.     Chip Whisper can contain up to eight flash memory chips, whichwould allow for recording of up to four hours of voice data.  NEC isconsidering marketing the new system for such purposes as foreignlanguage learning, the official said.Back to Headline List CopyrightJAPAN COMPUTER INDUSTRY SCAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996Softbank to acquire U.S. publisher through bond issue+TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo     Japanese computer software wholesaler Softbank Corp. saidTuesday it will issue 70 billion yen worth of convertible bonds toraise funds for the acquisition of a U.S. publishing house.

The companies' spokesmen said separately that home videoequipment makers are in general examining such possibilities, but nospecific negotiations or developments have been made between the twocompanies.     The denial followed a report by the mass circulation dailyYomiuri Shimbun that the two firms have reached an agreement tostandardize specifications of their 64-bit video game machines bynext fall to effectively compete with the largest player Nintendo Co.     The daily reported that Matsushita has already supplied a newlydeveloped 64-bit machine to Sega for feasibility studies.     When the specifications are set, the companies plan to ask othervideo game manufacturers to adopt them, the daily said, adding thatusing the same specifications will help them reduce development costs.     About 10 manufacturers are currently competing in the field, andtheir products are essentially incompatible with each other.Back to Headline List CopyrightJAPAN COMPUTER INDUSTRY SCAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996Digital cameras making inroads into consumer mart+TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo     Digital still cameras, once reserved for professional use, arenow filtering into the consumer market on active personal computersales, but whether they can emerge as a strong ''new kid on theblock'' in the computer peripherals sector hinges on how far pricesdrop.     Casio Computer Co., primarily a digital watch and calculatormaker, made a splash in the digital still camera market in February,when it debuted a model priced at 65,000 yen, undercutting prices of100,000 yen or more for models offered mainly by conventional cameramakers.     ''The company had no intention to instigate price busting in thedigital camera market,'' says Koichi Nishizawa of Casio's publicrelations section.     The attractive pricing, and a built-in liquid crystal displaywhich serves as a viewfinder and monitor, however, earned the modelinstant popularity.     ''Monthly production has already hit 20,000 cameras and isexpected to reach 30,000 in early 1996, compared with the initialpace of 3,000,'' Nishizawa noted.     Casio expects the world market for digital cameras costingaround 100,000 yen or less to total just more than 300,000 cameras inthe year through March, of which 200,000 will be made by the company.     It forecasts total shipments to hit one million cameras in 1996,according to Nishizawa.     Digital cameras do not use conventional photosensitive film butcapture images with a charge-coupled device (CCD), which turns opticsignals into electronic ones, and store photos digitally on built-inflash memory chips or cards mounted with such chips.     The new gadget saves users the trouble of developing film, whileenabling them to readily transfer photographic data into personalcomputers (PCs) for monitoring, image processing, printouts andon-line transmissions.     The proliferation of PCs is essential for consumer-use digitalcameras to penetrate into the consumer market.  ''Some 90% of QV-10clients are using the product with computers,'' Nishizawa said.     Digital cameras, for instance, allow individual PC users toproduce custom-designed greeting cards with photos, compile databaseswith visual information and take in pictures more easily for Internethome pages than with conventional photo scanners.     Corporate users have also found value in the camera.  Insuranceagents are taking digital shots of accident sites for on-linetransmissions to the head office to evaluate payments, while housingand used-car dealers are compiling easy-to-edit digital catalogues.     Inspired by Casio's success, electrical appliance makers SanyoElectric Co. and Sharp Corp. are poised to separately tap the buddingconsumer-use digital camera market with promising growth potential.     Sanyo will begin supplying its products to a U.S. computerperipherals maker later this month under an original equipmentmanufacturing contract, while Sharp is studying the possibility oflaunching a consumer-use model, spokesmen for the companies said.     Casio's Nishizawa concedes concern over appliance makers'expected entry into the market, saying, ''The noncamera makers willlikely market digital cameras in much the same style as Casio has,thereby clashing head on with us.''     Among conventional camera makers, Chinon Industries Inc. expectsto put out a digital camera priced below 50,000 yen in February, aspokesman said.  The company currently sells a 140,000 yen modelequipped with a zoom lens and a close-up photography mode.     Most camera makers, though, seem to have reservations as yetabout offering models costing below 100,000 yen because they do notwant to compromise picture quality, says Yasuharu Hirose, head of theJapan Camera Industry Association's general management division.     The resolution of digital photos depends largely on the numberof CCD pixels, which totals 1.3 million to six million in modelscosting millions of yen and used primarily by the media, the printingindustry and professional photographers -- the initial digital camerausers.     Casio could lower the price of the QV-10 chiefly because itadopted a 250,000-pixel CCD, compared with 410,000-pixel CCDs used inrival 100,000 yen-plus models offered by Ricoh Co., Olympus OpticalCo., Kodak Japan Ltd. and other companies.     Faced with user complaints over the QV-10's picture quality,Casio will consider raising the number of pixels as it expands itsdigital camera line, Nishizawa said.  The company plans to offer asecond model in the spring, he added.     Camera makers are also cautious about low-end models becausethey could eat away at sales of traditional compact cameras, while''Casio and other noncamera makers have no product that directlycompetes with digital cameras,'' Hirose of the industry group said.     Proponents of low-priced models, however, argue that digital andtraditional cameras are two different products.     ''Low-priced digital cameras should not be compared withtraditional cameras,'' says Hiroshi Morozumi, supervisor of Chinon'smarketing and sales department.  ''Their picture quality in printpales even in comparison with that of disposable cameras.''     Casio shares that view.  ''Our digital camera is such a casualtool that you can take a visual note of a train schedule at thestation and erase it when you no longer need it,'' Nishizawa said.''But conventional cameras are more for appreciating picturesthemselves.''     The tide, however, seems to be turning toward low-priced modelsin the digital camera market.  Camera maker Nikon Corp., which hasconcentrated on digital models selling for 1 million to 1.4 millionyen, said it is considering releasing a consumer-use model sellingfor 100,000 yen or less.     ''Casio's model showed (consumer-use) digital cameras wouldn'tbudge at conventional prices,'' says Masaki Isogai, manager of theplanning section of Nikon's electronic imaging division.  ''The priceis a key problem for consumer-use models.''     With Japan's PC shipments estimated to have topped five millionin 1995, compared with 3.4 million in 1994, digital camera makersexpect their products to stand a good chance of appealing to abroader spectrum of PC users.     However, Chinon's Morozumi says, ''The price will have to comedown to 10% to 20% of computers themselves if digital cameras are tobe counted as a computer peripheral.''     It is not just the price, though, that companies have to beconcerned with.  ''Digital camera makers need to propose what fun theusers can have with the product by, for instance, offering the cameraand image-processing software as a package,'' he said.Back to Headline List WT03-B32-22IA059-000323-B024-97http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec92.html 205.156.212.5 19970114221527 text/html 5598HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 22:13:44 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:47:12 GMTContent-length: 5412Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec92.html Sample Issue Copyright JAPAN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SCAN via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Sony Pictures to enter video CD software market in March+ (118 words) Japanese electronics transplants overseas total 1,062+ (217 words) Foreign appliance makers to launch sales blitz: paper+ (284 words) CopyrightJAPAN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SCAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996Sony Pictures to enter video CD software market in March+TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo     Sony Pictures Entertainment (Japan) Inc. said Monday it willenter the market for video compact disk (CD) software March 21,introducing 10 movie titles.

Workers employed by the Japanese affiliates totaled 766,000,including about 7,000 dispatched from Japan, the association said.     It said 55 research and development affiliates were located inNorth America and 25 in Asia.Back to Headline List CopyrightJAPAN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SCAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996Foreign appliance makers to launch sales blitz: paper+TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo     Foreign consumer electronics makers are gearing up to boostsales in Japan, introducing lower-priced products in electricaldiscount stores throughout the country, a business daily reportedTuesday.     General Electric Co. (GE) of the United States will expand intothe western Japan market following its strong performance in easternJapan, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.     In June GE started selling refrigerators through Kojima Co., amajor Japanese home-appliance retail chain.  Brisk sales of 10,000refrigerators a month have prompted GE to consider advancing intowestern Japan, the daily said.     The company will shortly enter into a tie-up with Daiichi Corp.,Japan's third largest retailer of consumer electronics goods andbased in Hiroshima, according to the paper.     The consumer electronics titan plans to offer not onlyrefrigerators but microwave ovens and air conditioners as well inwestern Japan.     Whirlpool Corp., another major U.S. appliance maker, haslaunched sales of low-priced microwave ovens through Kato Denki Co.,a discount store operator based in Mito, Ibaraki Prefecture, thathandles consumer electronics.     South Korean appliance makers Samsung Electronics Co. and LGElectronics are poised to begin selling lower-priced, wide-screentelevision sets at large-scale retailers in suburban areas early nextyear, the daily said.     Samsung will put on sale 24-inch and 28-inch TVs that aregaining popularity in Japan, with its overall 1996consumer-electronics sales target for the Japanese marketplace at 21billion yen, a 50% surge from this year's figures.     Prices for the company's wide-screen TVs are likely to be setat around 100,000 yen, or 20 to 30% lower than similar domesticmodels.     Meanwhile, LG Electronics is in negotiation with domesticretailers for introduction of its 20-inch TVs in Japan, the papersaid.Back to Headline List WT03-B32-23IA059-000323-B024-116http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec43.html 205.156.212.5 19970114221536 text/html 2148HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 22:13:54 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:54 GMTContent-length: 1962Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec43.html Sample Issue Copyright JAPAN SEMICONDUCTOR SCAN via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES SEMICONDUCTOR TREND NEWS Electronics firms to jointly study chip-making equipment+ (203 words) CopyrightJAPAN SEMICONDUCTOR SCAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996Electronics firms to jointly study chip-making equipment+TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo     Japan's 10 major electronics makers will launch a joint studyon equipment to produce semiconductors for 12-inch wafers, abusiness daily reported Friday.     The 10 manufacturers, including NEC Corp., Toshiba Corp. andHitachi Ltd., will establish a company for the study with jointinvestment of 30 billion yen by the end of March, the Nihon KeizaiShimbun said.     It will be the first time in about 20 years that such companiescooperate with each other in a study of this kind, the paper said.     The new company will test semiconductor-manufacturing equipmentmade by each manufacturer and examine the most suitable manufacturingconditions for equipment to produce 12-inch wafers on a large scale,the paper said.     The new company will start operations at the end of 1996 andcomplete the joint study in four years, it said.     The 10 companies will produce such wafers individually followingthe results of the study, it said.     Semiconductor makers have so far been studying such equipmentindividually, but they decided to cooperate with each other to cutdown on study expenses, the paper said.     Twelve-inch diameter wafers are expected to replace 8-inch ones,currently standard in the microchip market, in the near future.Back to Headline List WT03-B32-24IA059-000323-B024-149http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec99.html 205.156.212.5 19970114221549 text/html 20484HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 22:14:04 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:47:16 GMTContent-length: 20297Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec99.html Sample Issue Copyright LAN PRODUCT NEWS via NewsNet January 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NEW RECORDS ESTABLISHED FOR PC LAN SERVERS (1039 words) NEW PRINTERS HAVE LAN CONNECTIVITY VIA OPTIONAL INTERFACE (638 words) SWITCH INTERCONNECTS MOST LAN-BASED E-MAIL SYSTEMS (1163 words) CopyrightLAN PRODUCT NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1996NEW RECORDS ESTABLISHED FOR PC LAN SERVERSDigital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft Corporation hasunveiled audited transaction benchmark results that establishnew records in the highly competitive market for database,application and PC LAN servers. The results furtherdemonstrate the companies' leadership in providing customersthe industry's most powerful, most cost-effective open serverplatforms.Breakthrough results of 3194.4 transactions per minute (tpmC)at $196/tpmC, based on the TPC-C(2) benchmark Revision 3.0,were achieved on the AlphaServer 2100 5/300 64-bit SMP systemrunning Microsoft Windows NT Server operating system V3.51 andMicrosoft SQL Server V6.5 client/server database managementsystem. No other Microsoft SQL Server platform from any systemvendor delivers such impressive results.The 3194.4 at $196/tpmC result is the industry's best price/performance using any system, any database, or any operatingsystem. In fact, no other system has ever come close tobreaking the less-than-$200/tpmC barrier.With a total system cost of $626,102, the AlphaServer 21005/300 delivers transaction performance and price/performancesuperior to any other system priced below $1 million -- 24%better throughput performance and $46/tpmC less than itsclosest competitor, the Intel-based Compaq ProLiant 5/133Model 2. It also provides better performance and price/performance than many systems costing much more than $1million (see charts below).The Digital/Microsoft combination even outperforms a TandemHimalaya K10000-16 system with 16 processors and costing $3.5million. And compared with competitive systems from IBM, HP,Sun, Bull, AT&T, and others, these results are far superior."These independent benchmark results again demonstrate thebreakthrough performance and affordability of the Alphaarchitecture," said Pauline Nist, Digital vice president ofthe Alpha Server Business Segment. "For customers, thisrepresents the industry's best value in high-performanceserver capabilities. It also further demonstrates theengineering achievements of our strategic alliance withMicrosoft."The TPC-C benchmark is the industry-standard test formeasuring database transaction processing performance andprice/performance. The $/tpmC result reflects the cost ofacquisition and ownership of the system over a five-yearperiod, including hardware and software maintenance, softwareupgrades, and extended warranties."Today's news is one more way Digital and Microsoft arebringing to customers computing solutions that offerunprecedented value and flexibility," said Rich Tong, generalmanager of the Business Systems Division at Microsoft."These TPC results demonstrate the power of the Microsoft SQLServer and Digital Alpha platform for transaction- andcompute-intensive business applications in heterogeneousenvironments."Heterogeneous Computing EnvironmentThe AlphaServer 2100 5/300 benchmark was conducted using threeCPUs and 2 gigabytes of memory. These results were achievedin a heterogeneous computing environment, using VisigenicsODBC client software for SCO UNIX running on Digital'sIntel-based Prioris PC systems."No longer must customers limit themselves to a singleoperating system to get interoperability, performance, andaffordability," said Nist. "With these results, Digital hasproved that one of the best ways to solve business problemscan include a heterogeneous environment.

With fast, reliable andcost-effective communication being essential to maintaining acompetitive edge in today's global marketplace, the inabilityto communicate with clients, vendors, distributors, and otheremployees can hinder growth and stifle profits.With increasing frequency, companies are finding that theyhave a mix of E-mail programs that don't communicate with eachother installed on PCs, Macintoshes, UNIX workstations andlegacy mainframes. When E-mail systems can't communicate witheach other, savings gained by effective communications cannotbe realized.At some point, senior management wakes up to the fact that inthe "paperless office", corporate-wide E-mail is essential.The task of integration is usually assigned to the corporateInformation Systems (IS) group who are faced with thechallenge of integrating the various existing departmentalE-mail systems.This is a complicated task that involves making systemsinteroperate, share directory information and documents acrossdifferent platforms.This does not mean, however, that a standardized,corporate-wide E-mail system needs to be purchased. Mailintegration technology is widely used to connect disparatesystems. The numerous benefits of integrating existing systemsmake the concept a sensible alternative.First, businesses preserve their initial investment. Thisinvestment is not limited to the cost of the original E-mailsystem packages, but includes the cost of servers needed torun the system and the training of users.These users often have limited computer experience and arereluctant to give up their favorite E-mail system afterspending hours getting accustomed to its features andcapabilities. By switching E-mail systems in an effort tostandardize, users are taken out of their friendly computerenvironment and placed into an unknown one.Mail integration software solves this problem by allowingusers to seamlessly communicate with a variety of other mailsystems in a "friendly" manner. The address and message is"switched" to make it appear as if users are communicatingwith a computer on their very same E-mail system!Second, mail integration can buy a company time to implementan enterprise-wide migration strategy to wean users off olderlegacy based mainframe systems and prepare them for astandard-based information system. Additional benefits dependon the particular features offered by the mail integrationsoftware they select.The technological demands of integration are extensive.Choosing a mail integrator requires a careful examination offeatures, benefits and reputation. Integration vendorsapproach the issue differently and the results differ. AlisaSystems has long been an industry leader in mail systemsintegration. They have a reputation for being the best in thebusiness according to high tech computer publications andother independent sources whose job it was to compareintegration systems.Alisa offers a complete mail integration package calledAlisaMail. AlisaMail is a full-featured E-mail switch thatinterconnects the most popular LAN-based electronic mailsystems. It provides seamless and transparent exchange ofelectronic messages, fully editable documents and binary filesbetween WordPerfect GroupWise, Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail,CE Software QuickMail, X.400, SMTP and Digital VMSmail,ALL-IN-1 and Message Router. This includes spread sheets, wordprocessing documents, graphic and binary files. Mostimportantly, AlisaMail is built on a relational database,Sybase, that makes the system extremely flexible. "The reallystrong point of the system is it's easy to customize howinformation is presented." said Don Cole, president of AlisaSystems.The OpenDirectory, Automatic Directory Synchronization andMessage Switch are the strengths of the system and separateAlisaMail from the competition.The OpenDirectory is implemented using a Sybase SQL relationaldatabase and can be used as a corporate directory service.OpenDirectory, a unique AlisaMail feature, eliminatescomplicated addressing schemes by maintaining a common addressbook synchronized with each mail system.This "master" directory can include an address book ofcustomers, employees and vendors that contains informationsuch as their title, organization, department name, E-mail andpostal address, telephone and FAX number, as well as aphotograph. The OpenDirectory provides a centralized addressbook for all the E-mail users in their company. It is accessedby either the user's E-mail client or an Alisa client/serverapplication called PeopleFinder.PeopleFinder supports quick and easy on-line searching of theAlisaMail Open Directory. Users may search specific fields inthe database such as Name, Title, Organization and Location.Available for Windows, Macintosh and DEC VMS, PeopleFinderallows users to browse the OpenDirectory and its contents todisplay information not accessable in the user's address book.Existing desktop client/server development tools andapplications can also be used to access the OpenDirectory.With Sybases's openserver technology you can even connect toother corporate databases.Auto Directory Synchronization works hand in hand with theOpenDirectory and is the key to mail systems integration.Without Auto Directory Synchronization, the Open Directorywould be useless. Open Directory creates and maintains amaster directory of all E-mail users in by requestingdirectory updates from each separate mail system. When changesare made in one E-mail system such as adding, modifying ordeleting an E-mail address, the information is thentransferred to the master directory and then used to updateall the other directories.In medium to large companies where there can be many changes,AlisaMail allows the updating to be performed automatically.The superior performance of our Auto Directory Synchronizationis made possible by the flexibility of the SQL database. "Inessence, AlisaMail makes each mail system's directory anaggregate of all the users. It represents the entirepopulation and there is no distinction in where these peoplelive." said Cole.AlisaMail utilizes a multi-port gateway which connects thedifferent E-mail systems to the AlisaMail Message Switch.The gateway and Message Switch act as a store-and-forwardmessage hub and also handle the conversion of message formatsas required by the E-mail systems. The Message Switchpreserves the functionality of each mail system because itstores the message in its unaltered format. The format of themessage is then converted only if the recipient mail systemrequires conversion. If the receiving mail system does notsupport all the functionality of the sender's, the MessageSwitch will preserve as much functionality as possible.Alisa Systems takes full responsibility for the success ofyour E-mail integration. Alisa Systems will conduct on-sitesurveys to determine your specific mail integration needs andprovide a customized solution. They will even installAlisaMail on site for you, train you and help you fine-tunethe system to maximize performance in your environment."There's lots of bits and places for information to be storedin a corporation and people need access to it," says Cole,"There is a technology out there that can help you run yourbusiness and save money."For more information, call Alisa Systems at (800)628-3274.Back to Headline List WT03-B32-25IA059-000323-B024-248http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec42.html 205.156.212.5 19970114221803 text/html 282811HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 22:14:17 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:54 GMTContent-length: 282623Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec42.html Sample Issue Copyright LAN TIMES via NewsNet January 8, 1996 Vol. 13, Is SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES HANDS-ON @INTERNET: LOOKING AHEAD AT THE INTERNET Predictions about the most important developmental issues for 1996 (1047 words) @INTERNET: `CHERRY-PICKED' INTERNET (324 words) LAN ANSWERS: DUPLEXED DUPLEXING QUESTIONS Plus, copy with hop counts and overflowing SYS: volumes (1596 words) LIEBING ON NETWARE: TIME-SAVING TIPS ASSIST USERS Using server console commands in NetWare 3.x and NetWare 4.x (935 words) NETWORK MANAGER FINDS EASY FIX FOR THE LITTLE TAPE THAT COULDN'T (322 words) CAREER FOCUS EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER: VIRTUAL REALITY-BASED LESSONS (565 words) IN THE TRENCHES GETTING AHEAD BY PLAYING ON THE JOB (517 words) TEST REPORT HOW WE SCORE (104 words) AVALAN DELIVERS 32-BIT VERSION OF REMOTELY POSSIBLE (897 words) XIRCOM OPENS THE DOORS Netaccess proves network access was never easier (880 words) TWO COMBO CARDS JOIN THE RACE Xircom, ActionTec Electronics deliver 28.8Kbps Ethernet/modem PC Cards (1089 words) NETSHIELD VS.

Perhaps I should begin by evaluating the predictions I made in 1995. Inlast January's column, ``The Constant of the Internet Is Change'' (Jan. 23,1995, Page 79) I speculated that the two key developments of the year wouldbe the defunding of the NSFnet backbone and the rollout of the MicrosoftNetwork (MSN).   My NSFnet thesis was that the shutdown would free the Internet from theconstraints known as ``appropriate use''--the policy that no commercialtraffic should use the taxpayer-funded NSF high-speed backbone--and therebyopen the Internet to general business uses. It's fair to say I was right onthis one. If anything, I underestimated the impact that removing theconstraints on business uses would have on the character of the Internet ingeneral and the World Wide Web in particular.   My other prediction was that Microsoft Corp.'s bundling of MSN withWindows 95 would put the company in position to successfully dictatestandards to the Internet, bypassing the Internet Society'sconsensus-oriented IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) process.   With Microsoft having voluntarily limited MSN subscriptions to 500,000users through the end of November 1995 and with the slow adoption ofWindows 95 by the corporate users Microsoft was counting on, I'd have tosay I blew it on this one. Although it's probably true that the perceivedthreat of MSN was a critical factor in motivating other online services,particularly America OnLine Inc. and CompuServe Inc., to roll out enhancedInternet services of their own--and in CompuServe's case, to radicallyrestructure its pricing--the effect of MSN on Microsoft's capability todictate standards was indiscernible. Much to my surprise, the standardsbully turned out to be Netscape Communications Corp., maker of the wildlysuccessful Netscape Navigator.   Netscape has come under intense criticism from the IETF community forbecoming ``the Microsoft of the World Wide Web'' because of its proprietaryextensions to existing and proposed HTML (HyperText Markup Language)standards (http://home.mcom.com/assist/nettes/htmltensionshtml).   You wouldn't know it from the widespread adoption of those veryextensions (how many Web sites have you seen that feature blinking text,background images, or variable-width horizontal rules?), but there's a fairamount of resentment on the part of old Internet types of what is viewed asNetscape's high-handed imposition of its proprietary HTML tags on thestandards promulgation process.   Unfortunately for the old guard, I think this trend will continue in1996. In fact, I think the mossbacks will lose this one by a knock- out.The newly released Navigator 2.0 (ftp://ftp1.netscape.com/netscape/)incorporates still newer, Netscape-proprietary tags, such as frames(http://home.mcom.com/assist/nettes/frames.html), that I think theWeb-building community will rush to adopt wholesale. The old IETFdecision-by-consensus mechanism is simply too slow and cumbersome for thewarp-speed evolution rate of the Web. I'm afraid that consensus will windup taking a permanent back seat to expediency on this and other Web-relatedissues. The major question is this: Besides Netscape, who else will get todrive?Microsoft is pitching Internet Explorer 2.0(http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ download/msie20.exe), which usesclient-side image maps in a proprietary fashion different from the Netscapemethod. Microsoft offers tags to create scrolling marquees and for playingand controlling embedded Audio-Video Interleave (AVI) movies(http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie20html.htm).   Unfortunately for Microsoft, I suspect that the attraction of marqueeswon't be strong enough to persuade Netscape's loyal user base to abandonthe greater flexibility of frames and plug-ins. As for AVIs, the charm ofanimation will, in many users' minds, be far outweighed by the cost in timeto download these often-huge files at the agonizing pace of 14.4Kbps.   This brings up another battle that's looming on the horizon in 1996: Thenumber of Web sites implementing Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java(http://java.sun.com) programming language applets vs. those offeringsimilar functionality via Microsoft's equally proprietary Blackbirdtechnology. Again, I think the road ahead for Bill Gates' gang is a rockyone. Netscape Navigator 2.0, which already owns an enormous share of theWeb browser marketplace, natively supports Java. Microsoft's Blackbird, onthe other hand, isn't even supported by its own Internet Explorer. By thetime Microsoft makes it onto the battlefield, the war will be over and Sunwill have won.Brilliant Browsers   Unless I miss my guess, one of the more important trends of 1996 will bethe integration of additional service functionality into the Web browseruser interface. As Marc Andreessen agreed in a LAN Times interview (``TheGreat Netscape,'' April 24, 1995, Cover), the role of the Web browser israpidly expanding to consolidate E-mail, ftp (File Transfer Protocol), newsreader, Internet Relay Chat, and other Internet services that used torequire separate applications. This should be good news for corporate LANenvironments, where that unified interface should reduce the complexity oftraining and help-desk support needed by the user community.   Finally, there's the rise of the corporate intranet. The twintechnologies of the Web and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)-basedSecure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions-enhanced Internet-standardE-mail deserve a place in the corporate LAN environment. One offers aneasy, inexpensive means of enterprisewide document publication. The otherpromises to free us from the tyranny of proprietary mail transports andfile-attachment schemes.   Are the prospects for a sub-$500 Internet access terminal turning intothe next big development in Internet technology? I think that, instead, theso-called ``3270-Jr.'' is more likely to be the next pen-based personaldigital assistant--an engineering driven solution in search of a problem.Illustration(s):Screen: The sheer momentum of Netscape is dashing the hopes of suchInternet contenders as Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.About the Author(s):Thom Stark is president of STARK REALITIES, an Internet business consultingfirm in the San Francisco Bay area.

I wonder, however, whether oneshould wait until the ``hype'' about best-of-breed Internet applicationshas died down a little bit. Then one could go for a product that seems tobe robust enough and incorporates at least 95 percent of the features thatusers need, such as substring searching, cross-posting to multiple groups,virtual terminals, key remapping, dial-up support for NDIS (network driverinterface specification), and rule-based filtering.   Could you recommend an approach to this selection minefield?Thom Stark responds:   Unfortunately, the hype surrounding computer applications of all kindsdoesn't look to fade away any time soon. In fact, that was kind of my point ... along with the fact that no single vendor has a best-of-breed solutionto offer across the board. Where news readers are concerned, I stand by myrecommendation of Forte Inc.'s Agent/Free Agent product. Most everyoneagrees that Qualcomm Inc.'s Eudora is the E-mail front end to use. AndNetscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator is clearly the best World WideWeb browser on the market.   The principal drawback to this ``cherry-picking'' approach is that youhave no centralized source of support other than your internal help desk.Unfortunately, the pick-and-choose approach is the right one, at themoment.   The real issue is that this market is evolving at a breathtaking rate.Applications developers of all sizes are climbing aboard the Internetbandwagon, so the competition will be heating up, not declining, for sometime to come. With competition there inevitably comes hype.   The best advice I can give you is to haunt USENET groups and ask foradvice from other users, look at the comparisons in trade magazines (buttake them with a barrel of salt), and ask companies for evaluation copiesof their software.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsLAN ANSWERS: DUPLEXED DUPLEXING QUESTIONSPlus, copy with hop counts and overflowing SYS: volumesBy:Al Berg   Welcome to 1996! Because January was named for the Roman god Janus, whoshowed true system fault tolerance by having not one, but two faces, itseems fitting to start off the new year with not one, but two duplexingquestions:   Q. Mark Meyer, a vice president with Suburban Air Freight Inc. in Omaha,Neb., writes: ``We run a Novell Inc. NetWare 3.12 network, and I have setup duplexed drives in the server. My problem is I cannot figure out how theduplexing is designed to work in the event of a drive malfunction.   ``Novell says to unmirror the drives and use the good one if one drivefails, but they do not say how to determine which drive is good or how torebuild the system. I would assume that there is a simple explanation onhow to use the duplexed drives when there is a problem, but I have notfound it. Any input you can provide on the problem or location of thisinformation would be appreciated.''   A. The reason Novell's documentation is terse on the subject ofprocedures for duplexing is that the process is mostly automatic. Here'show things are supposed to work: When you set up two drives in a duplexedconfiguration, all of the data written to drive A is also written to driveB. (You can set up duplexing to more than two drives for even more securityand fault tolerance, but I have never seen that configuration in thefield.)When LAN clients make disk-read requests, NetWare takes advantage of thetwo disk drives and uses both to satisfy those requests in the mostefficient manner, yielding a significant per-formance improvement overnon-duplexed drives.   When one drive in a duplexed pair fails, NetWare simply issues a coupleof error messages to the file-server console and system-error log andstarts operating in nonduplexed mode, using the remaining drive. Users willnot see any real difference in the operation of the LAN, except for a dropin performance on disk reads.   Here's where the element of danger arrives: It is extremely easy to missthe error message that tells you your server is flying on one engine. Ifthe message scrolls off the screen and you (like many system managers)don't periodically monitor your error log or use a server-monitoringproduct such as Frye Computer Systems Inc.'s NetWare Early Warning System,HiTecSoft Corp.'s ManageWare, or Network Computing Inc.'s LANAlert, you maynot know about the failed drive until it is too late--when your remainingdrive fails, and there is no backup. I can't count the number of sites Ihave responded to where I ran into this situation. The moral of the story:Keep an eye on the system-error log or install some software to do it foryou.   Assuming you know that drive B has failed, the fix is simple: Bring theserver down at a convenient time (if your drives are not hot-swappable),pop in a new drive, and create a NetWare partition on it. Then load theINSTALL.NLM and select Disk Options and then Mirroring. Look for thepartitions marked Not Mirrored in the list that appears. Pressing `Enter'on one of these partition listings will bring up a menu. Press `Insert' tochoose the other nonmirrored partition as the other half of the duplexedpair. The remirroring process will begin automatically, bringing the twodrives into sync. While the server is remirroring, performance will beslow, so it is a good idea to do this at night.   Some people get confused by the seemingly interchangeable use of theterms mirroring and duplexing in NetWare. Let's straighten this out onceand for all: The difference between mirroring and duplexing is simply thatwith duplexing, the disks in a mirrored pair are on separate controllers.Duplexing offers protection against a controller failure and improved readperformance.   Q. Our second duplexing question comes from Ed Villanueva, aself-described ``con- fused CNE'' at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J. Heasks: ``What is the proper way to set up disk duplexing? Should the twodisk controllers have the same interrupt and base memory locations, orshould they be different? Should I load the disk drivers twice?''   A. The answer to Ed's question points out the difference betweenserver-hardware settings and NetWare settings. The disk-controller cardsettings, such as interrupt numbers and memory base addresses, need to beunique to allow the server to differentiate between the two cards. In mostcases, putting two cards at the same interrupt or base memory address willlead to immediate problems, such as one or both cards not being seen by theoperating system.   Duplexing is done at the operating-system partition level. The membersof a duplexed pair of disks are identified by the ID numbers of the NetWarepartitions on them, not the settings of the disk controllers. You'll needto load the disk driver software for each controller card installed in yourserver (identified by the slot or card settings) to make the system see allof the drives.   If you want the inside scoop on mirroring and duplexing, including someimportant information on what to do when things don't go as planned, checkout Novell's October 1992 NetWare Application Notes (part number164-000031-010). On Page 1, you'll find a great article titled ``NetWare3.x Mirroring and Duplexing Tips and Tricks,'' which is recommended readingfor all system managers--even for you 4.1 people.   Q. To move on to a different subject, Sanjay Jain, of Cambridge, Mass.,E-mailed this question: ``When I type DISPLAY SERVERS at my file-serverconsole, it displays my server name with a hop count of 0. Sometimes I canalso find the server listed with a hop count of 1. What's going on? Whatare hops, and what do they measure?''   A. No, your server isn't having a psychotic break, Sanjay. The hop countshown in the DISPLAY SERVERS output tells you how many IPX routers a packetwould have to go through to get to each listed server. If a packet startsout at your server and simply returns to the server, it doesn't have totraverse any routers--thus the hop listing of 0. If your server shows a hopcount of 1 on the same screen, this indicates that the server is hosting aservice that advertises itself via the Service Advertising Protocol (SAP),such as a print server. If a packet is already in your server and needs toget to that service, it has to traverse the virtual LAN segment (actuallyyour server's bus) inside the server to get to there. The virtual LANsegment inside the server is identified by the Internal IPX network numberin your server's AUTOEXEC.NCF file.   OK, Novell, here's another plug for the Application Notes: The October1995 issue (part number 164-000047-010) includes an article titled ``UsingTRACK and Other Console Utilities in a Mixed NetWare Environment.'' Thisdocument has a lot of useful information on hops and DISPLAY SERVERS andhow to use these tools to see what is going on on your network.   By the way, the NetWare Application Notes are published monthly, andalthough they aren't cheap ($95 per year or $135 outside the UnitedStates), they contain lots of good information and should be on any serioussystem manager's bookshelf. You can get more information from Novell at(303) 297-2725 or (800) 377-4136.   Q. Finally, I received this note from Irving Weiss, a LAN administratorat Touro College in New York: ``Our backup NetWare 4.1 server's SYS: volumeran out of space and now refuses to mount. I could delete some files tomake room if only I could get the volume mounted. Do you have any ideas?''   A. NetWare 4.1 gets really cranky when the SYS: volume fills up. The NDS(NetWare Directory Services) database information is stored on SYS:, andDS.NLM requires some free disk space to do that voodoo that it does sowell. Because everything in 4.1 has some connection to NDS, the server willdo the electronic equivalent of assuming a fetal position and whimpering ifSYS: has no space.   Fortunately, there is a pretty simple solution to this problem. Grab anextra disk drive, install it in the server, bring the server up with the-ns option (don't try to execute STARTUP.NCF and AUTOEXEC.NCF), load thedisk driver and INSTALL.NLM from the DOS partition, and add the new drive'sspace to the SYS: volume. Then, down the server and bring it back up. Youshould now be able to delete some files.   When you want to remove that extra disk, you'll need to back upeverything on SYS:, destroy SYS:, and restore the data. I'd suggest makinga New Year's resolution to take a look at your disk configuration, Irving.We at NETLAN recommend that 4.1 servers be configured with a SYS: volumeand at least one volume for user data and programs. We also recommend thatthe two should be kept separate to avoid these types of problems.   Well, another year of LAN Answers has gotten off to an active start. Andif the new year brings new problems to your LAN, drop me a fax or anE-mail. nAbout the Author(s):Al Berg is a CNE and assistant director of technology at NETLAN Inc., a NewYork-based networking and integration company.

For the new year, I'd like to start on a newtopic--the server console commands for Novell Inc. NetWare 3.x and 4.x.I'll keep you posted on upcoming changes in Client32.   If you're like me, it's hard to instantly recall all of the commands youcan perform at the server console, especially if you don't use them veryoften. Although most people know the simple, everyday commands such as CLS,CONFIG, and DISPLAY SERVERS, there are more that are very useful. Thisarticle will show you the console commands for both NetWare 3.x and 4.x.I'll end the column with a tip on console shortcuts--creating .NCF batchfiles.NetWare 4.x's HELP Screen   With NetWare 4.x, using the console commands has become more accessible;you can type HELP `Enter' at the console prompt and see a list of all ofthe console commands you can perform at the server. The only consolecommands listed here that don't apply to NetWare 3.12 are Language, RestartServer, and Help.   In NetWare 4.x, you can also type HELP followed by a particular commandto see information that is specific to that command. For example, if youwanted to see the syntax of a command such as BIND, you would type HELPBIND `Enter' at the server console prompt. You would see a message similarto the following on the server screen:OFFICE: help bindBIND protocol [to] LAN-Driverboardme [driverrame-ter...][protocolrameter...]   This links a specific network board to a communications protocol.Packets received by a LAN adapter will be discarded unless it has beenbound to a protocol.   The LAN driver and protocol stack modules must be loaded before thiscommand can be used. For example:BIND ipx to ne3200 [slot=3,frame=Ethernet] net=12345678   As a reference point to begin looking at the console commands, the charton this page contains a list of the commands for both NetWare 3.x andNetWare 4.x. Those that are marked as NetWare 3.x have only been tested onNetWare 3.12; I gave up my 3.11 server a while back. I will discuss theseconsole commands one by one in future articles.   One of the stroke-saver tips that I've used over the years has been tocreate .NCF files that I use just like DOS batch files. The differences arethe extension name (.NCF instead of .BAT) and that these batch files arerun at the server console prompt. And it works the same for both NetWare3.x and NetWare 4.x OSes.   Batch files are great because they let you forget all the stickyparameters you most likely have to go and look up anyway. Let's say you arerunning NetWare 3.x, and you want to include a -P parameter when you wantto load the MON-ITOR utility to show the ProcessorUtilization option. To do this, go into the SYS:SYSTEM directory and createan M.NCF file with the following command:LOAD MONITOR -P   Once saved, all you have to do is type M `Enter' at the server consoleprompt, and the Monitor utility with the ProcessorUtilization option enabled will appear. You don't have to include -P forNetWare 4.x because the Processor Utilization option appearsautomatically.   An example for NetWare 4.x is using the /D option when loading theSERVMAN utility. The !H parameter displays all kinds of diagnostic SETparameters in the Server parameter option. So in this case, you would gointo the SYS:SYSTEM directory and create an S.NCF file with the followingcommand:LOAD SERVMAN !H   Then any time you need to use the diagnostic SET parameters, you wouldtype S `Enter' at the server console prompt. You can also use this methodto create large batch files for loading and unloading AppleTalk drivers,CD-ROM software, VREPAIR on NetWare 3.x servers, and so on.   The keys to creating batch files are to remember where you put the .NCFfiles and watch your filenames. The easiest place to put the .NCF files isin the SYS:SYSTEM directory because NetWare always searches that directoryfor .NCF files. You can, however, specify other search directories aswell.   For example, if you wanted to create a local directory, such asC:\NCFFILES, you can add the following line to the AUTOEXEC.NCF file:SEARCH ADD 2C:\NCFFILESA Batch of Help   With this searching capability in place, when you type in a command atthe server console prompt, NetWare will first search SYS:SYSTEM to executethe command and then go to the other directories marked as searchable. Justbe sure not to turn off access to DOS if you do this.   You must also remember to watch how you name your batch files. Forinstance, don't name batch files after console commands, such as UNLOAD.NCFor BIND.NCF. This can cause confusion, and your batch files may not work.   Next time, I'll explore console commands and see if I can turn up goodinformation with a tip or two along the way.Illustration(s):Table: NetWare 3.x, 4.x Console Commands (This table is not availableelectronically.

I went through theusual procedures: Remove old tape, place a new one in the tape drive, runthe backup program, then wait for it to complete.   After about 10 minutes I checked to see that all was well when I noticedthe backup software had not changed to the normal screen for running thebackup. It seemed to have simply stopped running.   I downed our three servers and the workstation running the backupsoftware and then rebooted them. There was no change in the symptoms.Thinking that perhaps some file or files in the backup software had becomecorrupted, I deleted and reinstalled the system. No difference.   I returned to work on Saturday, read the documentation, and then calledthe software maker's technical support. They suggested upgrading theIPX/NETX to IPXODI/NETX on the workstation running the backup software. Idownloaded the current files from Novell Inc. and did the upgrade. Still nodifference.   I ran a tape cleaner through the tape drive, and it ran fine. Then Irealized that when I put the backup tape in the tape drive and closed thedrive door, something didn't sound quite right. I pulled the tape out andlooked at it. It looked OK at first, but on closer inspection--lookingunder the tape label--the tape had jumped off one of the spools and was notable to turn properly.   The tape drive was not sending a tape-ready signal to the backupsoftware because of the messed-up tape.   My fix was simple: remove the labels from the other backup tapes and notput labels over the tape area of the tape spools. This allows inspection ofthe tapes for problems before I start the backup.About the Author(s):Rick Ingersoll is PC/LAN technician at the Kodiak Area Native Associationin Kodiak, Alaska.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsEXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER: VIRTUAL REALITY-BASED LESSONSBy:Thomas Kaneshige   Organizations find that trainees retain more material when the teachingenvironment is in virtual reality and not in a traditional classroom. Andalthough one might expect virtual reality (VR) applications to be in theunreachable realm of a multimillion-dollar flight simulator, today'slow-end VR software costs less than you might think. Plus, it is designedto run on standard desktop PCs.   Among those pioneering the effort are Motorola Inc. and Northern TelecomInc., which have traditionally invested heavily in classrooms and trainingcenters. The companies have recently begun migrating to desktop VR softwarethat simulates hands-on work experience. For instance, the computer screenmight show a 3-D schematic of a control station, piece of equipment, oroverview of a manufacturing line. Students would then interact with thevirtual objects while hearing the same sounds they would hear on realequipment.   Motorola and Northern Telecom found that their low-end VR trainingsoftware not only is cheaper and easier to deploy for geographicallydispersed students but, in general, also yields better results. Motorolatested VR in 1994 before implementing a pilot program. The test compared asample of people trained with VR with those trained in the classroom. Theresults showed VR students outperformed the others once they were placed onthe job.   Nina Adams, president of Adams Consulting Group in Western Springs,Ill., and an observer of Motorola's first-year pilot program, said theprogram illustrates the excitement VR can generate in people. ``What issignificant is that [after VR training] we took people into the room withreal manufacturing equipment and they were able to perform,'' said Adams.   Another advantage is the capability to portray working scenarios thatmay not currently exist or to simulate critical experiences withoutreal-life risks.   A customized VR training tool can be designed, produced, and implementedwithin four to six months--less if the customers know from the outsetexactly what they want. And the software does not require special graphicsboards or accelerator cards. Companies opting for VR training tools canalso eliminate costs such as air fare, hotel accommodations, andinstructors' fees--not to mention the cost of maintaining a trainingfacility.   ``Northern Telecom's findings show an average savings to customers of$3,800 per student per course,'' said Roger Frampton, director of worldwidecommunications for Superscape Inc., a vendor of VR software in Palo Alto,Calif. ``VR applications can run on all sorts of desktops or tower ornotebook PCs. That means even if you buy a standard PC to run the software,the hardware is yours to keep.''   But the high cost of VR--a customized VR application runs anywhere from$50,000 to $100,000--still makes it a big-budget commodity. Most ofSuperscape's customers are Fortune 500 companies. Analysts and users,though, agree that VR training software is teetering on the edge of massavailability.   According to Darrell Ferris, Northern Telecom's senior manager of VRapplications design, the migration of VR training tools from flightsimulators to the desktop opens up a whole new arena. ``Right now ourquestion is, What would be the virtual-reality applications? Look at HomeDepot--instead of having weekend workshops or selling books, why not sell acustomer a piece of VR training software? Why not put that stuff on theInternet? My team thinks the thing is going to explode. You just need tomap it out.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsGETTING AHEAD BY PLAYING ON THE JOBBy:David Loysen   When the small defense contractor I was working for won a bid to installa 220-node Novell Inc. NetWare LAN for the U.S. Army, I quickly grabbedcontrol. The chance to set up a whole network with no legacy data or userexpectations was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.   I was able to design almost everything the way I knew it should be done.We bought all of the hardware, rented a warehouse, and set up the network.After extensive testing with the Army's computer guys, we packed up thecompleted network and loaded it into a moving van.   One week later five other people and I were onsite, ready to set up thenetwork. There were 22 rooms on two floors; each room would get 10workstations. One additional office would serve as the wiring closet andserver room.   All this was in a 1940s concrete-walled building. Because I knew it wasgoing to be difficult to install the network cabling, I decided to put a12-port hub in each room. This way I could minimize the number of longcable pulls. All the network cable was going above the dropped ceiling andthen down the walls. It would be messy but fast to install--or so Ithought.   The space above the ceiling was a jungle of 50 years worth of electricalwiring, plumbing, and wire used to hold the suspended ceiling. We spent awhole day on just two rooms. At that rate, we would be throwing cable forthe next two weeks.   That night we all met in a bar to try to figure out how we were going tospeed things up. Despite our $150 bar tab, nobody had come up with a viablesolution to our cabling woes.   The next day, while driving onto the base, we were stopped as a caravanof jeeps and four-wheel-drive trucks crossed the road in front of us. Thissparked an idea.   I dropped everybody off and headed back into town. When I returned witha toy remote-control tank, two small flashlights, a spool of fishing line,and a supply of batteries, everybody thought I was nuts. And when I tapedthe flashlights to the top of the tank and tied the fishing line to it,they were sure I had lost it.   But when I slid aside a ceiling tile and drove the tank 100 feet alongthe top of the ceiling tiles to the next room and then pulled a cablethrough with the fishing line, they declared me a genius.   We went through three sets of batteries for our tank and managed tofinish the job early. I'm still not sure which felt better: winning a bonusfor completing the job under deadline or handing my boss an expense reportwith a receipt from Toys-R-Us on it. After I explained how well myimpromptu solution worked, he paid without hesitation.About the Author(s):David Loysen is now systems administrator at HNC Software Inc., a softwaredeveloper for the financial-services market in San Diego.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsHOW WE SCORE   We rate a product on a scale from Unacceptable to Excellent, based onthe following criteria:5 = Excellent      Far exceeds expectations4 = Good           Meets standard criteria and includes some specialfeatures3 = Satisfactory   Performs as expected2 = Poor           Falls short in essential areas1 = Unacceptable   Is seriously flawedWe multiply the weight by the product's score for each criterion, sum theresults, and divide by 1,000 to come up with a final score between 1 and 5.Products that earn a total score of 4.5 or higher receive our Best of Timesaward.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsAVALAN DELIVERS 32-BIT VERSION OF REMOTELY POSSIBLEBy:Brad Edwards   Remotely Possible/32 from Avalan Technology Inc. is a Microsoft Windows95 application--the 32 stands for 32-bit--that lets you control remote PCs,transfer files, and chat with other computers running Remotely Possible.With it, telecommuters can access network resources at the office,help-desk staff and network administrators can solve problems remotely, andteachers can share computers with their students.   Remotely Possible/32 works with its 16-bit counterpart, letting aWindows 95 computer control both Windows 95 and Windows 3.x machines. Inthe 16-bit version, however, modem, LAN, and TCP/IP protocols were soldseparately. Remotely Possible/32 will eventually include support formodems, IPX, NetBIOS, NetBEUI, and TCP/IP in one package. TCP/IP and modemsupport is currently offered, and Avalan will ship the LAN protocols toearly adopters when LAN support is available (scheduled for this month).   The company has also added several features to this version of RemotelyPossible, including the capability to control multiple machines from onemachine or control one machine from multiple machines. The product alsolets you control another machine, transfer files, and chat simultaneously.Pretty Safe   Like most remote-control programs, security is a very real concern withRemotely Possible/32. Basic security measures include a defineable accesslist of users and passwords for each computer. In addition, you can enableand disable specific features for each user, letting someone send files butnot receive them, for instance.   Remotely Possible/32 also includes a call-back feature, which cangreatly improve network security. After receiving a correct login name andpassword, the computer being accessed ``calls back'' the network address.This requires that the remote user be connecting from a specific computer.   Unfortunately, a few security features are missing. For one, RemotelyPossible/32 can't combine its access list with the one you can create inWindows 95 for sharing files and printers, and maintaining two lists is ahassle. And although information transmitted between PCs is compressed, itisn't encrypted. A snoop with a packet sniffer could eavesdrop on chatsessions and file transfers.Visual Tics   Remotely Possible/32 comes on a single floppy disk and loads via aWindows 95 setup program; installation doesn't get much easier than this.During setup, you must provide a unique license number for each machine youare installing Remotely Possible on. Thus, you will need a minimum of twolicenses, one for each side of a connection. After installation, you willwant to configure protocol and security options. The program is veryintuitive, and accomplishing this is easy. In fact, Avalan has done a nicejob with all aspects of the user interface.   When you're ready to use Remotely Possible, it scans the network foravailable hosts and lists the ones it finds. To connect, you simply clickon the appropriate host and supply a username and password. From the menu,you can select remote-control, chat, or file-transfer options.Taking Control   Controlling a remote machine is as easy as controlling your own. Bydefault, the remote screen appears full-screen on your desktop, but you canalso view it as a separate, smaller window. The file-transfer function nowsupports drag and drop and long filenames. If you want to transfer a filefrom your desktop to a remote machine, you simply drag it to thefile-transfer window. It would be even better, how-ever, if you could drag a file directly to the remote desktop.   We ran into a few display problems with Remotely Possible. Once, thefont in a remote DOS window suddenly became larger, causing words tooverlap. And screens weren't always repainted correctly. Fortunately, wefound these problems insignificant and expect many, if not all, of them tobe fixed by the time the LAN protocols are included.Save a Tree   Avalan's online help is terrific.

Harry Johnson   With the increasing number of telecommuters and mobile users, LANadministrators face a growing challenge in providing high-performanceremote-access links. Here to help, Xircom Inc.'s Netaccess Multiport ModemCard is scaleable, stable, and cost-effective. Netaccess comes with eitherfour or eight internal modems on a single full-length ISA expansion card,allowing it to work with both older, slower servers and new, high-endones.   The Netaccess card works with remote-access software so mobile users candial in as additional nodes on the network. Although access is slower thana direct link to the network, the 28.8Kbps transfer rate and V.42 datacompression provide surprisingly satisfactory performance. Because multipleconnections on the single board are tied directly to the bus, Netaccessdoes not experience performance losses caused by routing data throughserial-port bottlenecks.   And because the modems are already on the card, users need only phonelines and RJ-11 cables, eliminating the cost and potential problems ofexternal modems and cabling. If additional connections are desired, up toeight Netaccess cards can be used in the same system, providing up to 64access ports.Flip a Switch   Installation of Netaccess is about as simple as it gets. After selectinga mode of operation on the basis of the software to be used, you simplyturn a thumb-wheel switch to set port configuration and I/O addresses.   Xircom provides drivers for Asynchronous I/O (AIO) and NDIS (networkdriver interface specification) WAN applications and can also be configuredto operate in COM mode. AIO-compatible applications include Novell Inc.'sNetWare Connect and FUNK Software Inc.'s WanderLink; NDIS WAN programsinclude Microsoft Remote Access Service. Both the AIO and NDIS-WAN driversuse Xircom's proprietary Xircom Mobile API (XMAPI) architecture to increasedata throughput and decrease server overhead by bypassing the system'sserial ports.   A single four-port Netaccess board supports COM ports 1 through 4 or 5through 8. When multiple boards are used, up to 64 COM ports can besimulated on a single system. COM-port mode supports programs such as LotusNotes, Symantec Inc. Norton pcANYWHERE Access Server, and Citrix SystemsInc. WinView for Networks.   In addition to its applications support, Netaccess supports all standardasynchronous protocols. To minimize transmission errors, the Netaccess carduses V.42 and Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) Class 2 through 4error-correction methods. The card is capable of achieving data-compressionratios of up to 4-to-1 by its use of V.42bis and MNP5 compression.   Netaccess also includes good management tools. The AIO driver containsan SNMP MIB (Management Information Base) structure to facilitate networkmanagement of the device. Over 20 board parameters and 17 port parameterscan be reported by accessing the MIB structure via a NetWare SNMP agent.Network-management workstations running applications such asHewlett-Packard Co.'s HP OpenView or Novell's NMS (NetWare ManagementSystem) can also access the MIB, allowing the monitoring and control ofNetaccess cards in systems attached to the network.   On the downside, although access to the LAN is limited only by theapplications accessing Netaccess ports, phone communications are restrictedby the board. Analog transmissions are supported, but digital phone linksand PBX systems are not.   We tested the four-port Netaccess on a NetWare 4.1 server runningNetWare Connect Services 2.0. On both our test machines, one with a 33MHzIntel Corp. 486 and the other with a 90MHz Intel Pentium processor, errorcorrection and performance were consistent. After configuring the board andcopying the necessary driver to the server, we set up the system to loadthe Xircom drivers on bootup. The company recommends loading NetWareConnect after the Xircom driver, and in our testing we found this wasnecessary for proper operation, not just preferable.   After configuration, Netaccess ran very smoothly. Dialing in with theNetWare remote clients, we experienced stable performance and consistentlyhigh throughput, even when all four ports were being used simultaneously.   Although we experienced no problems, Xircom does provide help in case oftrouble, including a DOS diagnostic utility called MTERM and the necessarycables. To trouble shoot, you simply connect the loop-back cables to theRJ-11 ports, load MTERM, and follow screen instructions.   If you still have problems, Netaccess' documentation is thorough. Itincludes complete installation instructions and reference guides for bothHayes Microcomputer Products Inc.-compatible AT commands and S-registercommands. Technical support is available via the Internet.   If you are looking for a cost-effective solution to handle a growingnumber of mobile users, Netaccess may be just what you need. It works withAIO, NDIS-WAN, and COM-port remote-access software, delivering stable,high-performance modem connections.

Payton   Two more combination Ethernet/modem PC Card adapters have joined thehigh-speed connectivity race: ActionTec Electronics Inc.'s ComNet 28.8 andXircom Inc.'s CreditCard Ethernet+Modem 28.8. The companies come to theplaying field with significantly different backgrounds. ActionTec,previously known as PreMax Electronics Inc., boasts one of the broadest PCCard lines on the market, whereas Xircom has focused mainly on networkcommunications.ActionTec ComNet   Your users will find it easy to install the ComNet card, mainly becausethe DOS-based setup severely limits available options. Only Novell Inc.NetWare and Microsoft Windows for Workgroups network drivers are included,and the program offers only two IRQs (interrupt request lines) for Ethernetoperation: 15 and 10. If the modem portion is configured for COM2, only IRQ3 can be used. If COM3 or COM4 is chosen, the IRQ selection broadens, butit remains restricted to a value less than the one chosen for the network.COM1 is entirely unavailable.   After our installation, the network driver refused to load at all if anyinterrupt other than the two ActionTec recommends was selected. In fact,one of the recommended values allowed the driver to load but would notactivate the Ethernet adapter.   The manual was of little help. Although it is a satisfactory referencefor modem use and commands, it offers little trouble-shooting information.The Ethernet portion seems like an afterthought, even though it is locatedat the beginning of the book. Technical support was much more helpful inconfiguring the card, although they did seem inexperienced with advancedissues.   After finding a working network-adapter configuration through a processof trial and error, we loaded the required Card and Socket Services--nopoint enabler was available--and the network drivers. This left memoryavailable for programs distressingly low, although we could run Windows anda single program. Our Ethernet communications were smooth, and ComNetsupports Novell's LANalyzer for Windows. The card's physical connection isthe only drawback in this area: ComNet provides an RJ-45 intended toreplace the patch cord.   The modem portion of the card fared about as well. We had to fight tomake the card work but couldn't argue with performance. SimultaneousEthernet/modem operation worked as well as standalone and was actuallyeasier to configure because the manual's instructions for using themodem-only enabler are completely inaccurate. And although the manualclaims that cellular capability is available, ActionTec's technical supportstaff told us this isn't so--another strike against the documentation.   ComNet's software bundle is impressive. The package includes TravelingSoftware Inc.'s LapLink for Windows, Starfish Software Inc.'s Sidekickpersonal organizer, McAfee Associates Inc.'s VirusScan, and CompuServeInc.'s Spry Mosaic browser, as well as access software for CompuServe,America Online, and GENIE. Strangely, no basic communications or faxsoftware is included.Xircom CreditCard   Xircom's CreditCard Ethernet+Modem (CEM) 28.8 has evolved nicely fromthe CEM II we reviewed in a comparison last spring (see ``PCMCIAEthernet/Modem Cards,'' April 24, 1995, Page 101). Its sophistication isevident from the moment the installation program auto-detects and loadsWindows. The installation software is also extremely flexible, letting youcustomize nearly every aspect of the card. We achieved a workingconfiguration on our first try. The Ethernet and modem portions operatedwell--both independently and simultaneously--even without the help of Cardand Socket Services.   Xircom technical support told us that, like the CEM II, the CEM 28.8will not work with LANalyzer. As it turns out, this is not the case at all.As long as you load the RXMONSTK.COM driver before the Multi-Link InterfaceDriver, LANalyzer runs quite well, omitting only runt packets from ouranalysis. We had mixed feelings about the situation. We were glad the CEM28.8 was compatible with LANalyzer, but we worried that technical supportmight be offering incorrect information in other areas as well.   The CEM 28.8 has a separate module for 10Base-2 connections, increasingits connection flexibility, and administrators will appreciate the card'sSNMP manageability. Unfortunately, a cellular module is not available,although Xircom is redesigning the card to work with its standard cellularkit. The company says it will offer an inexpensive swapout when theredesign is complete.   The manual, which we barely needed, is well-organized, with equal weightgiven to both Ethernet and modem functions. The separate trouble-shootingguide includes tips for a large number of configurations, evidence of thetesting Xircom has put the card through under different environments. TheCEM 28.8 comes bundled with Delrina Corp.'s WinFax Lite and WinComm Lite,as well as Shiva Corp.'s ShivaPPP client software.   You probably won't be surprised to hear that we strongly favored the CEM28.8. There are some similarities between the products: Both companiesoffer support via voice, fax, and BBS; both advertise cellular capabilitythat does not yet exist; and both achieved about the same performance inour testing. However, ComNet's requirement of Card and Socket Servicesdepletes resources that could be put to better use, and CEM 28.8's setupand documentation were clearly superior.

NET-PROTTwo stellar products offer virus protection for your networkBy:Tom Springer   Approximately 100 new computer viruses appear each month, adding to the6,000 known viruses currently in existence. Network file servers areespecially susceptible to infection, and experts agree that virusprevention is much easier than virus removal. Both NET-PROT from CommandSoftware Systems Inc. and NetShield 2.2 from McAfee Associates Inc. areeffective virus-detection programs that, when used with the companies'disinfection tools, can help keep your system free of uninvited guests.The Match Game   Although NET-PROT and NetShield each use proprietary virus-scanningtechnology, the basic functionality of the two products is the same. Bothperform on-demand, on-access, and periodic scanning of network traffic toprevent viruses from loading. NET-PROT, however, can only perform periodicscans weekly; NetShield offers daily, weekly, or monthly scans. For addedflexibility, both tools let you specify certain files and volumes forexclusion from a scan, although only NetShield will let you excludedirectories.   If a scan detects an infected file, both NET-PROT and NetShield candelete the file or move it to a specific location. To disinfect a virus,however, you must run workstation versions of the server software.NET-PROT's version, F-PROT PROFESSIONAL, is included with the product, butNetShield's offering, VirusScan, must be purchased separately.   NetShield's management console integrates very well withVirusScan-convenient when you want to immediately disinfect a file aftervirus detection. NET-PROT, on the other hand, requires you to exit theoperator's console and run F-PROT PROFESSIONAL from DOS.   Each product uses its own scheme to maintain network performance duringa scan. NET-PROT uses configureable utilization levels; you set scans tooccur only when CPU utilization falls below a certain value. This methodensures that a periodic scan will not run when the network is busy.NetShield uses a priority scheme, with a highest priority of one and alowest of 10. McAfee claims that a priority one periodic scan is about 10times faster than a priority 10 scan.Caught Them All   Both products could detect all our test viruses, but NetShield took muchlonger to do so. NET-PROT scanned a 500MB volume in just over two minutes,but a priority one NetShield scan of the same volume took almost sixminutes.   NetShield beats NET-PROT regarding administrator notification. Bothproducts can broadcast a network message to specified users when a scandetects a virus, but only NetShield offers E-mail and pager notification.Unless you constantly check NET-PROT's log file, you may be unaware a virushas infected your system, giving it more time to spread.   NET-PROT and NetShield offer basic password-protection capabilities andoptional security features. For example, NET-PROT can automatically log offany user who tries to copy an infected file to the network, and NetShieldcan restrict write access to certain files, directories, or users. Overallthough, we found that NetShield provides a little more flexibility forthose networks that need extra security.   And although both companies claim their products can detect previouslyunknown viruses, some new viruses always go undetected, and McAfee andCommand Software continually update their lists of known viruses. With asite license you can download the latest updates from Command Software'slist without charge; McAfee, on the other hand, requires a two-yearmaintenance fee.What It Takes   NET-PROT and NetShield use a Microsoft Windows-based management console,and NET-PROT includes a DOS version if you don't prefer a GUI. Neitherproduct supports Apple Computer Inc. Macintosh or IBM OS/2 systems.   NET-PROT requires a file server with 85K of free RAM running Novell Inc.NetWare 3.x or 4.x. The management console only requires DOS 2.0 orhigher.   NetShield requires a NetWare 3.x or 4.x file server with 718K of freeRAM and 18MB of free disk space. The operator's console requires at least a386SX, 4MB of RAM, a VGA monitor, DOS 5.0 or higher, and Windows 3.1. Ifyou are running NetWare 3.11 or 3.12, you will also need several NLMpatches. They are included on the CD-ROM release and are available fordownload. The NetShield client works with either Windows 3.1 or Windows95.   Despite NetShield's slower speed, we really had no complaints abouteither product's performance. Note, however, that NET-PROT requiressignificantly fewer system resources than NetShield.   We were up and running with NET-PROT in about five minutes; NetShield'sinstallation, on the other hand, was much more difficult. We discoveredthat if the attributes for AIO.NLM and AIOCOMX.NLM are set to read-only,the installation program--after it is 97 percent completed--will notify youthat the target directory is read-only and you should check to see if youhave the appropriate rights. This message can be confusing, especially ifyou are running the installation from a supervisor account with completeprivileges. To finish the installation, you must change the attributes ofthe two NLM files.   Also, NetShield uses search path 1 to point to the system directory. Ifanother module previously defined search path 1, NetShield will not load.We think the program should be smart enough to use the next availablesearch path.   Although NetShield is more powerful and has more features than NET-PROT,it is also slower and considerably more expensive. Generally, we preferNET-PROT for single-server systems and NetShield for multiserverenvironments. How-ever, you won't go wrong with either; both provide excellent ways to keep anetwork free of viruses.   Command Software Systems Inc., 1061 E.

Supposedly, the days of the small single-purpose program areover. Don't believe it. One of the best information-management utilitieswe've seen came to us on a single floppy disk and runs well on an IntelCorp. 386-based machine with Microsoft Windows 3.1 and 4MB of RAM.   We speak of Micro Logic Corp.'s Info Select 3, a note-taker, planner,and PIM (personal information manager) fused into a single package. Thatdescription isn't an exaggeration; Info Select really is all thosethings--and more. Even better, Info Select's interface is just asversatile.   Info Select's opening window is a split screen, with a treelikedirectory called the Selector on the left and a work space on the right.The Selector contains different data types--Notes, Topics, Forms, andCalendars--each of which is indicated by its own icon. Other icons in theSelector indicate that a particular item in the database has an associatedfile, is read-only, has a user-imposed search barrier, or is a templatethat can be used for the creation of new items.   Notes are used for free-form text documents; if you suddenly get an ideafor a new project, you can just press `Alt-Tab' to access Info Select andstart typing. Notes' word-processing features are basic but adequate,including simple page-layout options. If you're organized, you can placeNotes into categories. Topics act like folders, classifying data intoheadings and subheadings. You can use the flexible Forms feature to takephone messages, prepare purchase orders, conduct surveys, manage invoices,or organize any type of field-oriented information. Design tools for Formsare also basic but functional. With Calendars, you can scheduleappointments, one-time events, recurring events, ticklers, and so on.   For such a simple program, Info Select contains fairly sophisticatedsearch capabilities, and we searched our sample database at very acceptablespeeds. Search tools include exact, neural (fuzzy), Boolean, size,data-range, and change-date searches.   Info Select's interface includes a tool bar, a folder bar, and a statusbar. The tool bar provides a quick way to perform common tasks--pulling upa Calendar, for instance--and it can be customized or hidden from view. Thefolder bar provides shortcuts for formatting font style, size, and color.Stripped Down   Info Select's network capabilities stay true to the lean, mean design ofthe rest of the product. Co-workers can share name and address databases,keep group to-do lists, and distribute just about any kind of informationto other Info Select users. Although multiple users can view shared files,only one user can edit a shared file at a time.   Installing Info Select on a network is fairly straightforward. Inaddition to its built-in data-sharing capabilities, the program can hookinto your E-mail system, letting you send and receive Info Select data.After installing Info Select on a server, you must create a subdirectory ona shared drive; Info Select files that contain shared data are placed inthis directory.   For a workstation to be able to use the data-sharing capabilities, itmust be manually configured. After installing Info Select on theworkstation, you run the network-installation program, which asks for thepath to the shared directories.   Info Select is an information manager designed to yield maximum utilityto those with minimum experience. Users won't have to learn complexdata-entry procedures, nor will they be forced to upgrade older PCs to takeadvantage of Info Select's excellent features. This isn't a full-fledgedgroupware application, but if your users need to share basic data, thiscould be a fairly painless way to achieve it.

The hub, switch, and router technology thatmakes up the MultiStack System has been around for a while. But althoughthe MultiStack doesn't offer any original functionality, it does deliverthe management paradigm that administrators of small- to medium-sizednetworks have been waiting for.What We Waited for   The MultiStack System is a hot-swappable collection of internetworkingcomponents that includes Digital's 90 series repeaters, the RoamAboutwireless network hub, and the NetRider remote-access hub. The excitementabout the MultiStack System is that it can be managed as a single SNMPmanagement domain using HUBWatch, Digital's management software. Byproviding for stacks of key components up to 16 hubs high, Digital finallydelivers the flexibility and management network administrators have alwaysneeded. What's more, all this is available at a realistic price. Forexample, 10Base-T hubs cost as little as $50 per port.   Because of its extreme manageability, remote-access capability, andcompact size, the MultiStack System is especially well-suited forbranch-office networks. Initially, you can stack the components on a tabletop in the branch office. Later, as the office grows, you can mount theMultiStack components in a standard 19-inch rack. You can distributeMultiStack components throughout your network as necessary up to 185 metersapart, and you can install 90 series hub modules in a DEChub 900MultiSwitch hub chassis.   The MultiStack System also integrates with Digital's DECswitch family toform what Digital calls ``switched edge stacks.'' This provides a fairlyeasy and inexpensive way to implement switching in high-traffic segments.Tough Installation   We found piecing together the components of the MultiStack System achallenge. We had to wade through a swamp of documentation--much of itinadequate--to find the tidbits of information we needed. ConfiguringHUBWatch is also an involved and time-consuming process. Allow yourselfplenty of time to get acquainted with this system before expecting toperform management miracles with it. Still, once configured, MultiStack isan administrator's paradise--a neat, compact stack manageable as a singledomain.   To test the MultiStack System's hardiness, we flooded the ports of oneof the hubs until it auto-partitioned and lost its connection to the restof the stack. Even then we could see the device on HUBWatch, although wecouldn't manage it. Management for the rest of the stack was unaffectedthanks to MultiStack's use of a separate channel to integrate SNMPconnections. This provides a particularly robust means of managing alldevices in the stack, although sometimes--as in our test--maintainingcontact with a partitioned device isn't much help.   Digital's MultiStack System, a new paradigm in network management,delivers internetworking the way it should be. This relatively low-costsystem brings together hubs, switches, remote-access hubs, and wirelessdevices into a compact and easy-to-manage stack. Although you've seendevices like these before, you've never seen them work together quite likethis. They snap together quickly and easily, and once the configurationheadaches are behind you, they manage as a single SNMP domain withDigital's HUBWatch software.

At least that seemed to be the general conclusion drawn by a group ofvendors, analysts, and users assembled here last month to discuss the topicof desktop management.   Participants in the round-table discussion--moderated by the EnterpriseManagement Institute and sponsored by LAN Times--cited a mislaid emphasison completing tasks rather than meeting business objectives as a key reasonfor the slow adoption of desktop-management tools.   Although the purpose of the round table was to take stock of the currentstate of desktop management, there was little discussion of the technologybehind the tools themselves. Instead, the discussion centered around morephilosophic topics, such as defining the functions of desktop managementand exploring the relationship between LAN managers and users within anorganization.   Representatives from top desktop-management softwaredevelopers--including Intel Corp., McAfee Associates Inc., and MicrosoftCorp.--agreed that users should be more aware of what it takes to managetheir systems but disagreed on how much awareness was appropriate.   ``Users hate the fact that they don't see any perceived value in systemsmanagement,'' said David Hamilton, network- and systems-management productmanager at Microsoft. ``They're concerned about the Big Brother issue;they're concerned about administrators having too much control.''   But reconciling users' wants and administrators' needs can be abalancing act.   ``I think it's scary to give [users] a lot of control,'' said RickKreysar, vice president of marketing at McAfee in Santa Clara, Calif. ``Toomuch perceived value and you're going to up your support calls.'' Hesuggested that perceived value may be in making management processes thatoccur at the desktop invisible to the user.   Other participants pointed out that restricting users' desktopactivities could cause a similarly negative reaction.   ``People are looking at ways to minimize the amount of effort it takesto maintain a certain number of users,'' said Stephen Saks, chiefinformation officer for California Trucking Association in Sacramento.``But what sometimes happens is you wind up with more support calls, withIS individuals fixing problems that don't exist,'' he said.   Another key point of discussion centered around getting otherdepartments in an organization involved in desktop management.   ``It's hard to [justify tools] to the head of the engineering ormanufacturing department. The MIS guy understands the cost benefits [ofdesktop-management tools], but the head of the manufacturing department isthe guy who ultimately has to sign off on it, and he may not understand howthat's going to increase his department's productivity,'' said Kreysar.   ``In a lot of ways desktop management is still an evangelistic market,''said Ken Mackin, systems-management strategy manager at Intel in Hillsboro,Ore. ``There is a lack of education about what these tools can do.''   From a customer standpoint, there is also a great deal of skepticismabout what tools can do, volunteered California Trucking's Saks. ``Thereare a lot of [vendor] promises made but very few are kept,'' he said.``You're going to hear a lot more `I'll believe it when I see it' '' astools evolve.   In many ways, the notion of network management is changing, said analystMichael Howard, president of Infonetics Research Inc. in San Jose, Calif.   ``I predict that in five to seven years we won't even use the termnetwork management because we're going to get to the point with ATM wherethere will be no network monitoring. You'll probably outsource that to yourphone company.'' Instead, business management will become the focus. ``Iwould suggest that there is an eighth layer to the OSI [Open SystemsInterconnection] model, and that's the business layer.'' Desktop andsystems management will be inherent in how organizations apply networkresources, he said.   ``Our job will be done when PCs are managed by the human-resourcesdepartment,'' summed up Intel's Mackin.On defining desktop management:   ``We believe that you need to make a clear distinction between systemsand network management. Systems-management solutions should functionwhether or not the network is there.''--Ken Mackin, systems-managementstrategy manager, emerging technologies group, Intel Corp.   ``I'm afraid of breaking network and systems management up. I think thatwe have to turn it around and start looking at business issues like cost ofownership and work from that perspective, rather than be too careful withour definition of what the particular areas are.''--David Hamilton,network- and systems-management product manager, Microsoft Corp.   ``Desktop management, from my perspective, is how do I provide my endusers with the tools that let them be as productive and creative aspossible? Far too often you end up frustrating the user [with management]instead of providing them with something that gives them the ability toperform at a higher level.''--Stephen Saks, chief information officer,California Trucking AssociationOn the cost justification of tools:   ``Network management is easier to [cost] justify than systems managementbecause network management is about routers and hubs and bridges. These arethings people can understand and care about. I think we're not asuser-focused or as business-oriented as we need to be to sell systemsmanagement.''--David Hamilton, Microsoft   ``When you go and tell executive officers, `We can reduce our workloadby using this tool,' they're not going to care because it doesn't impactthe bottom line.''--Stephen Saks, California Trucking Association   ``If you can turn your management products into middleware and deliverthat data to some financial-management package, then all of a sudden youcan make a business case for buying and installing a particular[management] module or solution.''--Ken Mackin, Intel   ``Management has to be central; it has to be built into the network fromthe ground up. If we assume management is a value add, we're going to havetrouble moving on.''--David Hamilton, MicrosoftOn the struggle for control:   ``Our biggest problems are caused because [network managers] don't havecentralized control, but at the same time, users don't want you to havecentralized control.''--Rick Kreysar, vice president of marketing, McAfeeAssociates Inc.   ``The only effective way to control the desktop is to have an absolutelyclear corporate mission about what you are controlling and why you arecontrolling it.''--Michael Howard, president, Infonetics Research Inc.   ``Too many developers are out there trying to convince the IS peoplethat they are the important ones--that they make the decisions and thatthey will dictate to everyone else.''--Stephen Saks, California TruckingAssociation   ``Desktop management is like outsourcing in that you're reallytransferring responsibility of the system to someone else. If you think ofmanagement in terms of outsourcing, it changes what you think you can[control] and how you try to do it.''--Rick Sturm, principal, EnterpriseManagement Institute Inc.On promoting the use of tools:   ``When we say we need to provide business solutions instead oftechnology solutions, I think what we really mean is that we need to thinkabout who we're defining solutions for, and we need to recognize that thefinancial person in an organization needs to be involved.''--Ken Mackin,Intel   ``Networks are becoming a commodity--almost. The people who take care ofcommodities are not as sophisticated as the people in the glass house. Youcan no longer give somebody a tool and expect them to figure it out, writetheir own code and macros and such.''--Rick Kreysar, McAfee   ``I agree we have to make management [tools] easy for the administrator,but we also have to convince end users of its value. Whether its helpingthem tune their systems, making applications work together, or showing themthat they get better help-desk support.   ``I'd like users to know [management] is there and see value in itrather than have to hide it.''--David Hamilton, MicrosoftPhotograph(s):Photograph: Ken MackinPhotograph: Michael HowardPhotograph: Stephen SaksPhotograph: David HamiltonGARY LAUFMANCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsMICROSOFT TO SPEED UP SNA OVER WIDE AREABy:Brian Riggs   Network administrators are eyeing Microsoft Corp.'s upcomingarchitecture for distributed SNA gateways that promises to combat sessionloss, excessive bandwidth utilization, and complex management.   Distributed gateways, made possible when Microsoft integrates theDistributed Gateway Service into its new SNA Open Gateway Architecture(SOGA) later this month, are intended to transform SNA Server into ascaleable framework for transporting and managing SNA traffic amongmultiple branch offices.   The first products to support SOGA include Sourcecom Corp.'s Incardaserver internetworking card and Polaris Communications Inc.'s System 2000Gateway. Bay Networks Inc., Sync Research Inc., and others are expected toannounce products later in the year.   SOGA-supporting hardware is expected to let SNA and LAN traffic run overwide-area connections without excessive timeouts, high bandwidthrequirements, or complicated management techniques.   SNA network administrators have used recent versions of SNA Server toconnect branch offices to a centralized host via SDLC (Synchronous DataLink Control) leased lines or the 802.2/Logical Link Control protocol.Alternately, remote LANs can connect to a central SNA gateway usingstandard LAN protocols. But these solutions have led to timeouts and highbandwidth utilization.   ``What we need is a way to run IP without having to encapsulate it intoSNA,'' said Mark Lee, systems consultant at the Bank of Hawaii inHonolulu.   The Bank of Hawaii currently connects 70 branch offices to its Honoluluheadquarters by running SNA over X.25 lines. Lee, who is planning to use aUnix server for data warehousing later in the year, has been looking at SNAServer as a way to send IP over the SNA backbone. ``Microsoft came in andshowed us how we could use [the current version of] SNA Server, but wefound it to be unreliable and slow,'' he said.   Lee said he is counting on SOGA's upcoming Distributed Gateway Serviceto transport both host and server traffic over native TCP/IP.   Existing approaches to SNA transport have worked well in campusenvironments because fiber and 100Mbps Ethernet provides users with plentyof bandwidth, according to Lynn Nye, president of NetResults, a consultancyin Portland, Ore.   But when SNA data from branch offices is transported over the wide areaat the 56Kbps and 1.544Mbps speeds that are typical of WAN services,response times between host and branch can slow to a crawl, he said.   Moreover, when using equipment such as 802.2 connectors, SNA transportis subject to unpredictable delays caused by session loss. And whentransported over the wide area via TCP/IP, client transmissions tocentralized SNA gateway servers can carry as much as 200 percent moreoverhead compared with local- and campus-area transmissions.   SOGA's Distributed Gateway Service, on the other hand, letsadministrators deploy SNA gateways at each branch site. All remote gatewaysconnect to the host and all traffic between gateways uses native TCP/IP,IPX, or Banyan Systems Inc. VINES.   Without the 802.2 connectors, SNA WANs based on SOGA are not expected toexperience session loss. And because SNA is running natively over IP,traffic will occupy considerably less bandwidth, letting networkadministrators use small, less-expensive WAN lines, Nye said.   From a management perspective, network administrators using SOGA will beable to pool logical units (LUs) over the wide area. This is expected toreduce the total number of LUs that need to be managed. With gateways ateach branch site and all gateways connected with TCP/IP, administrators canextend IBM's NetView management platform over the wide area. ``In the past,[network managers] could only see central-site gateways with NetView,'' Nyesaid.   But because SOGA's Distributed Gateway Service lets SNA gateways bedistributed to all branch locations, managers will have a complete view ofall gateways on the WAN, he said.

The switch, which can route and convert E-mail messages among a widerange of LAN, mainframe, and Internet mail systems, is aimed at customerswho can't afford or don't need the company's VAX-based message switches.The product is also one of the first E-mail tools to use World WideWeb-based administration tools.   Missive/AIX is the first of a series of products that will utilize opensystems and emphasize ease of use. The company plans versions of theproduct for Microsoft Windows NT as well as other flavors of Unix.   ``Wingra has moved from the proprietary world into the enlightened Unixworld,'' said Mark Levitt, senior analyst at International Data Corp., amarket-research company in Framingham, Mass. ``That opens up a much largerpotential customer base.''   That customer base will get an E-mail switching core that includes a1988 X.500-compliant directory; an integrated message router; documentconversion software; and IPX, TCP, and Digital Equipment Corp. DECnettransport-level protocol stacks. Individual E-mail packages are then tiedinto the Missive/AIX core via ``channels,'' that average $3,000 a piece.The $15,000 entry price includes channels for two E-mail systems.   Wingra is shipping channels for Lotus cc:Mail and Notes Mail, MicrosoftMail, Novell Inc. GroupWise, and other MHS (Message Handling Service)- andGlobal MHS-based E-mail systems such as ON Technology Corp. Da Vinci eMAIL.Digital VMSmail, Digital Message Router, and E-mail systems based onSMTP/MIME (Simple Message Transfer Protocol/Multipurpose Internet MessageExtension) channels are also available. A channel for IBM PROFS isscheduled to ship by April, and X.400 support is due by year-end.   Missive/AIX administrators can also access the user directory from a Webbrowser. This not only simplifies management but also allows remoteadministration. Registered users can browse the directory to search forE-mail addresses and modify a configureable subset of attributes, such asdocument conversion profiles, phone numbers, and addresses. Users withoutbrowsers can use E-mail to query the directory for other users' E-mailaddresses.   Missive/AIX is targeted to threaten message switch products from vendorssuch as Control Data Systems Inc. and Lotus Development Corp that oftencost $100,000 more and require extensive customization--often at additionalexpense.   ``I was in the market for something easy,'' said an E-mail administratorat an East Coast financial services firm, who--citing companypolicy--declined to be identified in print. He claimed he was able to bringMissive/AIX online, fully configured to integrate cc:Mail, Notes Mail, andUnix SMTP mail systems in only one and a half hours.   Innosoft International Inc. and Worldtalk Corp also offer low-costmessage switches. However, the real challenge to Missive/AIX could comefrom the next-generation of E-mail products, which support SMTP and X.400natively.   Even with the deployment of such E-mail packages, Missive/AIX andproducts like it will still have a place when companies have multipleE-mail systems. ``Even those users who have committed to migrating to asingle E-mail system will need time to do that,'' said Levitt. ``Untilthat's in place, they will still need products to connect their existingsystems.''Illustration(s):Illustration: Chart: Missive/AIX DeliversCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsATTACHMATE TO CONNECT MAINFRAMES TO NETAcquisition yields Web-based workgroup products for legacy systemsBy:R. Scott Raynovich   Following its planned acquisition of Internet software specialist TheWollongong Group Inc., Attachmate Corp. will deliver a series of workgroupproducts that let businesses use World Wide Web-based applications toconnect to mainframe systems.   Products planned for the first quarter include the Emissary HostPublishing System and Emissary Workgroup. In addition to allowing mainframedata to be converted into HTML (HyperText Markup Language) format, theproducts will also offer E-mail, group conferencing, and Internet browsingcapabilities. The server-side products will be based on Microsoft WindowsNT and the client-side products will be based on Microsoft Windows 3.1 andWindows 95.   Industry watchers say Attachmate's approach will permit the integrationof mainframe systems with Web applications, improving connectivity acrossinternal TCP/IP-based corporate intranets or the Internet.   ``A lot of people don't want to deal with emulation or other software tobring the mainframe interface to the desktop,'' said Clay Ryder, analystwith Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City, Calif. ``If you can delivermainframe data as a Web page, you'll deliver a universal access client.''When its deal to acquire Wollongong is finalized, Attachmate will getEmissary, a highly regarded Web browser that also integrates messaging andfile-system functions. Emissary is based on Wollongong's Client ObjectLinking Technology (COLT), which links OLE-based objects and applicationsthrough a single interface. Emissary will form the basis of Attachmate'snew browsing interfaces, and Attachmate's OpenMind collaboration softwarewill be combined with Emissary to further develop its capabilities.   Attachmate officials said their goal is to offer an architecture thatlets companies use Emissary Workgroup and Emissary Office as the standardcorporate interface for exchanging information.   Sandy Bateh, assistant computer systems officer for the city ofJacksonville, Fla., said he may eventually use the Attachmate products toprovide the city's desktops with both mainframe and Internet access.   Bateh said he has been using Attachmate products for mainframe accessand would like to consolidate Internet browsing with mainframe access. Thiswould be cheaper than paying licensing fees for both Attachmate'shost-connectivity products and Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator.   Some analysts say that using COLT to exchange OLE objects over networksin combination with Attachmate's collaboration technology will make theEmissary products attractive to IS managers trying to consolidate clientplatforms.   ``Emissary's automatic-update feature and Attachmate'ssoftware-management features are the types of things that will help ISdeploy Internet products,'' said Tim Sloane, director of messaging for TheAberdeen Group Inc. in Boston. Sloane said vendors such as IBM, DigitalEquipment Corp., and Oracle Corp. have provided tools for integratingdatabases into the Web but that the products are limited to their ownproprietary technologies.   Attachmate's Host Publishing System will come with database tools thatlet programmers integrate PC applications with IBM DB2, DB2/400, andSQL/DS databases. The publishing system itself will enable on-the-flyconversion of IBM host screens into HTML pages, letting users browsemainframes just like Web servers.   Emissary Workgroup will include the Windows NT-based server componentsand Windows 95 and 3.1 clients for Internet and file browsing, groupconferencing, and document management.   Both Emissary Workgroup and the Host Publishing System are expected inthe first quarter. Pricing has not been set.

In upcoming products due in the first half of next year, Wang plans tocombine storage-management technology gained from Avail with its OPEN/imageand OPEN/workflow server software, company officials said. Furthermore,this convergence of storage-management and imaging technology resultingfrom the merger will expand on existing partnerships that both Wang andAvail have with Microsoft Corp.   A front end to Wang's ImageView client piece will be integrated byMicrosoft in the next release of Microsoft Windows 95, code-named Memphisand due next year, Wang officials said. Separately, Microsoft has alreadyembedded Avail's NetSpace Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) software inWindows NT, and it will also be included in Cairo, the forthcoming versionof NT due in 1997.   From their desktops, users will be able to click on an ImageView icon inthe Memphis version of Windows 95 and launch a full-blown document-imagingapplication. Network managers, meanwhile, will be able to view,manipulate, and archive document images on Windows 95 desktops and thenstore the massive-image data types on tightly linked Windows NT servers.   Billerica, Mass.-based Wang exchanged 1.8 million shares of its commonstock for Avail, valued at $18 per share or approximately $32 million.Avail will become the Enterprise Storage Division of Wang's softwarebusiness unit.   Robert Wight, president and CEO of Avail in Boulder, Colo., expects themerged products to simplify the job for users now managing proprietaryhardware dedicated to either imaging or storage-management software.   ``There is a natural need to integrate [imaging and storage management]together,'' said Wight. ``We are taking a new step in going away fromproprietary products with [new] products that do imaging, backup, andstorage management on [any] NT server.''   Gerry Murray, senior analyst with International Data Corp. inFramingham, Mass., said that a lack of imaging and storage-managementintegration has affected large companies burdened with too many imagingsystems.   ``This is a real nightmare and obstacle for large organizations,'' saidMurray. ``For large companies with 10,000 employees, there are about fiveor six different imaging systems, and there is a frustration in waiting forthe image at the desktop.'' Murray explained that having a variety of servers can complicate the task of processing and sending images to Windows95 clients.   Bob Abraham, vice president of Freeman Associates in Santa Barbara,Calif., agreed. ``Now the marriage and the integration can happen. The userwants an open approach that was previously separate between Wang andAvail.''Murray said the convergence of imaging technology with storage-managementsystems lets images be stored as just another data type in workgroupenvironments.   ``The storage-level piece of the puzzle links a production-level systemand a workgroup,'' he said.   NetSpace users expect that the Wang plans for product integration willimprove the performance of document imaging and other applications.   ``We are using [Avail's] HSM software for CAD drawing,'' said EarlHuskamp, MIS manager at Professional Engineering Consultants in Wichita,Kan. ``If Wang adds more storage--such as optical jukeboxes--that wouldhelp me out.''Illustration(s):Illustration: Imaging Meets StorageCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsNOVELL'S ROAD AHEADAfter a tumultuous year, company looks to steady the shipBy:Amanda Mitchell Henry   After spending the better part of last year cleaning house, Novell Inc.is now under pressure to deliver promised technology to skepticalcustomers.   Unburdened by products such as Unix and misfit business applications,Novell has freed itself this year to persevere in its goal to make NetWare4.x a de facto networking infrastructure on which a company's core servicesrun. One key to that strategy is the agreements forged with Hewlett-PackardCo., The Santa Cruz Operation Inc., and possibly other vendors to shipversions of those companies' Unix operating systems with integrated NetWareservices.   That infrastructure strategy has also conveniently given way to newphrases coined by Novell, such as Client Network Computing--a paradigmwhereby NetWare no longer competes head to head with Microsoft Windows NT.Rather, Novell is pledging to better integrate its products with those fromMicrosoft Corp. and has, for example, developed a working prototype of aserver interface between NetWare services and NT.   ``We decided that we are not going to fight it out in [theapplications-server] market. Instead we will provide networking services toall sides,'' said Novell CEO and Chairman Robert Frankenberg, whose ClientNetwork Computing concept includes a set of programmable services thatwould be provided by the network. Under the company's abandoned plan forSuperNOS--the hybrid operating system that had been slated to combineNetWare 4.x and UnixWare--Novell would have competed squarely withMicrosoft on the applications-server front.   And the newer, leaner Novell is not finished. On a conciliatory note,Frankenberg admitted that his ``objective is to execute product plans ontime with great quality and not disappoint our customers. In the past wehaven't done that, so this will be an intense focus for us.''   In recognizing that a directory-enabled infrastructure is nothingwithout the software, Frankenberg has pledged to round up by year-end atleast six times as many of the 140 NDS-compliant applications that existtoday. As promised in last fall's product road map, in 1996 Novell willalso ship the Green River version of its operating system with support forNetWare Distributed Print Services (NDPS) and its Net2000 SDK (softwaredeveloper's kit).   And as many as 200 Novell Embedded Systems Technology (NEST)-enableddevices will be available by year-end, as opposed to today's 24 products,to spread the NetWare infrastructure within reach of office products.   On the applications side, Novell is hanging on to its groupware product,despite the pending sale of its other business applications, and is due toship its Lotus Notes competitor, GroupWise XTD, this year.   Making ship dates is key, according to at least one reseller. ``We arelooking for Novell to stick to its schedule of new products,'' said AndrewPercy, chief technology officer for systems-integrator Edge InformationSystems in San Jose, Calif. ``The three key pieces we are expecting fornext year as things that will help us develop our business will be thearrival of SMP [symmetric multiprocessing] products through the OEMprocess, the GroupWise XTD product, and the [Microsoft Windows 95] clientsoftware.''   Novell's Windows 95 client for NetWare is currently in its second betarelease.To Be or Not to Be--Bought   From the outside looking in, a whittled-down Novell may appear to beturning itself into an opportunity ripe for acquisition. Not so, accordingto Frankenberg, who contends he is simply busy divesting himself and thecompany he runs from a strategy once bent on competing directly withMicrosoft. ``We have no interest in making ourselves more valuable to asuitor. I actually think that we are more valuable independent.''   Numbers show that Frankenberg--now in his second year at Novell'shelm--has his work cut out for him because, for the first time, the companyis facing a market-share battle. Last year Novell lost three points fromits leading position among NOS makers, dropping to 62.2 percent in a marketthat reached $1.2 billion, according to a 1995 midyear LANoperating-systems analysis by International Data Corp. in Framingham,Mass.   At the same time, IDC's report found that Windows NT is picking up steamin a market where Novell has firmly held its ground. Although Novell washeartened to find that NetWare 4.1 shipments reached 96,100 and earned 22.6percent of the LAN OS market, many of those sales replaced NetWare 3.xshipments.   Among the OSes mentioned in the report, Windows NT managed to increase its market share by the greatest amount with shipments jumping 70 percentbetween the first and second quarters of 1995. Windows NT landed a 13.3percent share of the market for the first half of 1995, with 68,000file-server licenses sold.   This year, Frankenberg said he wants to ``gain that [lost market share]back, plus a couple of more points.''   But Novell's greatest challenge is in winning new installations, saidJesse Berst, editor of Windows Watcher newsletter in Redmond, Wash. ``BothNetWare 4.1 and Windows NT started from a very small base. So while thecompanies trumpet about increases, it's not just the percentage of growthyear over year and not just unit shipments that's important. The key markeris new business.''Eye on the Internet   Frankenberg is looking to add more Internet capabilities to Novell'slineup, so the World Wide Web craze has not been lost on Novell. Last monththe company shipped its $995 NetWare Web Server and last November deliveredon its long-awaited AT&T NetWare Connect Services.   Furthermore, Frankenberg outlined plans for Novell to become ``protocolagnostic'' beginning with this summer's release of Green River, which willinclude IP out of the box as a configuration option.   Nevertheless, the company missed its year-end deadline to ship Ferretand Corsair, Novell's browser and Internet-development environment,respectively. And it is now in the shadow of a recent Web marketing thrustby Microsoft. The software giant plans to integrate its forthcomingInternet Information Server directly into Windows NT as a key piece of anall-Microsoft Web-access solution.   Frankenberg pointed out the bottom line when analyzing a product thathas yet to be delivered: performance. ``Think about what a Web serverdoes,'' he said. ``It's a file and print server in the form of printingelectronic documents. NetWare does that better than anything else on themarket.''Illustration(s):Illustration: Chart: Novell's '96 GoalsIllustration: Figure: Client Network ComputingPhotograph(s):Photograph: Robert Frankenberg, Novell chief cleaned house in '95. What'snext? Q&A, Page 8.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsLAN TIMES SURVEY: SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONSBy:Sean Pfister and Adrienne Russell   LAN management can be compared to politics: Everybody talks about theproblems, but most people find it difficult to do anything about them.   According to a recent survey of LAN Times readers, the network- andsystems-management problem is well-understood: As networks grow in bothsize and complexity, so do the responsibilities of the LAN manager. Atvarious times any combination of network analysis and planning, servermanagement, and desktop management all fall under the purview of theaverage network manager, but not with equal weight. Many, it turns out,simply don't use available management tools.   The most telling and least surprising finding from the survey is thatnetwork managers can expect an increase in their workload for 1996. Anaverage LAN Times site is moving from one LAN segment to three LAN segmentsper network manager in the next 12 months. Across all organizationssurveyed, the average number of PCs will increase a year from now by anaverage of 8 percent and LAN segments will increase by 71 percent, but thesize of networking staffs are projected to decrease somewhat, from anaverage of 11 to about nine.   More than half of all managers surveyed are responsible for networks atremote locations. Of these, about six in 10 manage remote networks fromlocal consoles. Despite this, 34 percent take at least one monthly trip toa remote location for trouble shooting LANs. The 40 percent of managers notadministering remote networks locally take an average of five trips permonth for trouble shooting.Setting Priorities   With projected increases in LANs and PCs and no real growth in staff,which aspects of network management do administrators think are toppriorities? Judging from the results of the survey, network managers aremore focused on the server and network-traffic parts of their jobs than onissues related to desktop management, including software distribution andmetering and asset management.   We asked LAN Times readers to rate the importance of key managementissues for the efficient functioning of their networks. The ratings wereconducted on a 1-to-6 scale, with 1 being ``not at all important'' and 6being ``very important.'' We also asked managers to tell us how dependentthey are on hardware and software tools to help them with keynetwork-management issues.   Respondents tend to consider the management of network-related issuesmore important than desktop-related or financial and administrative issuessuch as metering or asset and inventory control.   Of the six categories we asked about, server management and networktraffic are on the top of the priority list for effective functioning ofthe organization's networks. Seven out of 10 LAN administrators reportedthat server management is important (a 5 or 6 rating), whereas slightlyfewer are concerned with network traffic. Just under half the managerssurveyed reported that managing specific network devices such as hubs androuters is important. In contrast, for each of the three desktop-relatedcategories measured, one-third or fewer assigned a rating of 5 or 6 on theimportance scale.   Network managers' responses to queries about their single greatestmanagement need range from the specific (``full implementation of SNMP'')to the more general (``increased budgets, more time''), while passingthrough the somewhat humorous (``software for managing people''). A ratherlarge portion of the respondents are concerned with network diagnostics,traffic loads, performance monitoring, and so on.   Just under half the network managers surveyed reported the use ofserver-management or network-analysis tools at their work locations. Four in 10managers currently use network-device management.   Desktop-management tools are less commonly used. Roughly 19 percent ofnetwork managers surveyed use software-distribution tools, 28 percent usesoftware-inventory tools, and 33 percent use software-metering tools.   For both the network- and desktop-related tools, the usage patterns varysignificantly depending on the size of the networks managed. At sites with30 or fewer PCs installed, the percentage of network managers using networksolutions is generally lower than at larger sites. Only nine percent ofmanagers at small sites use network-based software distribution, forexample, compared with 37 percent at sites with 150 or more PCs.   In the case of network-analysis tools, this difference is particularlypronounced. At small sites, 24 percent of network managers analyze networktraffic flow, and at large sites, 78 percent do so.   Even though large sites are more likely to manage desktops through thenetwork, they still follow the same general usage patterns as all sites:Tools to manage servers, traffic, and network devices are more common thannetwork-based solutions for desktop administration.Winds of Change   Six months from now, however, this picture should look somewhatdifferent. Although the use of network-related management tools willcontinue to outstrip desktop- related solutions, the gap will narrow.   The fastest growth is predicted for software distribution over thenetwork, which will nearly double--from 19 percent to 37 percent--duringthe next six months. Rapid growth is also expected for software meteringand inventory. More than half of LAN managers will use network-basedsoftware metering, and 46 percent will use software-inventory programs.   In spite of the projected growth in all categories, network-managementsolutions are not particularly widespread now, nor will they be ubiquitousin six months. Why are some network managers not using available tools?Typically they reported that the tools, whether for network or desktopmanagement, are not necessary for the kinds of networks they manage.   Respondents were also asked for each category whether price, difficultyin use, or difficulty in evaluation had any bearing on their decisions notto implement any of the network- or desktop-management tools. For eachcategory measured, the largest proportion of respondents indicated thattheir networks do not require the types of tools specified.   Among users of the tools, the typical reason offered for use is based onthe workload. Respondents indicated that the tools lessen the need forsupport staff. Given the prognostication for personnel growth in the nextyear, it's not surprising that network managers cite this when implementingthe tools.Illustration(s):Illustration: Graph: Going Gets TougherAbout the Author(s):Sean Pfister is the research manager and Adrienne Russell is the researchassistant at LAN Times.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsLAN TIMES READERS SPEAK OUT ON MANAGEMENTMethodology   The LAN Times 1995 Manager's Survey was conducted among a random sampleof 2,000 LAN Times recipients between Oct. 31 and Nov. 11, 1995.

Just as users started to understand Lotus Development Corp.'s flagshipproduct, the World Wide Web threatens to make Notes irrelevant in thegroupware field it pioneered. Once again, the company faces an uphillpublic-relations battle, this time to position Notes as a player in thewhite-hot Internet market and the nuts-and-bolts messaging-applicationsspace.   To that end, Lotus' latest communications strategy, announced lastmonth, folds key Internet technologies into the Notes platform. The companyhas also revised Notes pricing to make it a more attractive client/servermessaging and groupware platform. However, critics fault the Notes-centricWeb strategy for doing little to attract new users while delivering alackluster client/ server messaging strategy.   ``The issue with all of Lotus' Web efforts has been to facilitateadditional features for people who are already Notes users,'' said AndrewPercy, chief technology officer at Edge Information Systems, asystems-integration firm in San Jose, Calif. ``I don't believe it wins themany additional business.''   New and current Notes users will find a midyear upgrade to the Notesrelease 4 server beefed up with Web-focused technologies, including HTTP(HyperText Transport Protocol), HTML (HyperText Markup Language), and SunMicrosystems Inc.'s Java programming language. In addition, the companywill give away InterNotes Web Publisher 2.0 free of charge when release 4initially ships this quarter. Originally a $3,000 add-on product, WebPublisher 2.0 translates Notes documents into HTML pages. Prior to themidyear upgrade, release 4's HTTP functionality will be delivered via abundled, yet separate, HTTP server.   With Internet protocol support, Notes servers will extend their audienceto include Web browsers in addition to Notes and MAPI (Messaging API)-basedclients. Notes will dynamically convert Notes documents to HTML or viceversa, depending on which type of client accesses the server.   Meanwhile, Notes release 4 clients will include the InterNotes WebNavigator to let users browse the Web from within Notes. Web Navigatorrequires a connection to a Notes server so remote users will have to dialin to the Notes server for Internet access.   ``The Web, in many people's minds, is a direct Notes competitor,especially in information publishing,'' said Jamie Lewis, president of TheBurton Group, an industry-analysis firm in Salt Lake City. But Lewis addedthat Notes can do some things that the Web-based products cannot, forexample field-level replication and sophisticated security functions suchas being able to hide fields of a document from certain users.   According to Lewis, the question is, ``How much of Lotus' installed baseand how much of the new customer base--the potential marketplace--needsthose features?''   That question clearly weighs on Internet-focused companies such asNetscape Communications Corp. The company's recent activity validates theLotus strategy of blending groupware and the Web. Netscape purchasedCollabra Software Inc., whose Collabra Share brings discussion-database andreplication technologies into the Netscape fold. Moreover, the Internetcompany last month added an E-mail server to its line of applicationsservers.Back to Basics   Although the Internet is clearly the hot spot for Lotus, it is not thesole focus of the company's 1996 communications strategy. Lotus has alsotaken steps to ease the costs of deploying Notes as a messaging solution byintroducing the $55 Notes Mail client and dropping the price of the NotesDesktop client from $155 to $69.   Due to ship with Notes release 4, Notes Mail effectively replaces NotesExpress as the entry-level Notes client package. With Mail, users can workwith E-mail, document libraries, discussion databases, and the Internet viathe Web Navigator. Unlike Desktop, the new client will not be able to runcustom applications. Neither Mail nor Desktop have theapplications-development capabilities of the full Notes client.   Mail's price gives Lotus a messaging and groupware package that shouldeffectively compete with Novell Inc. GroupWise XTD and Microsoft Exchange,both of which are scheduled to ship this quarter. However, those low-pricedmessaging platforms will also provide groupware functions such asdiscussion databases and replication, perhaps blunting Lotus' competitiveedge.   Moreover, GroupWise XTD and Exchange are shrink-wrapped ready-to-useapplications, whereas Notes is a development environment. Consequently, theprice of deploying a Notes network goes beyond the costs of clients,servers, and applications administration to include the groupwareapplications that supplement E-mail.   ``The cost of Notes is not buying the product,'' said Percy. ``The costof Notes is accessing the features, which means developing applications.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsORACLE HITS BUSINESS-APP SUITE SPOTBy:Bradley F. Shimmin   The integrated suite of services unveiled by Oracle Corp. last monthpromises to drive down the cost of managing multiple line-of-businessapplications.   Set for delivery in March, the Oracle InterOffice Suite will coupleWorld Wide Web, E-mail, document-management, multimedia, client/server, andeven management services all within the Oracle7 RDBMS (relational DBMS).The InterOffice Suite server will be available in Workgroup and Enterpriseeditions for Intel Corp. CPU-based machines running Microsoft Windows NTand SunSoft Inc. Solaris. It will rely on extensions to the Oracle7 RDBMSthat let users search, access, and manage multiple data types such asaudio, video, and text in a consistent and simple manner, said JoeVassallo, vice president of InterOffice products at Oracle in RedwoodShores, Calif.   Through a document-server extension, for example, users can search fornot just the contents of large text items but also the actual meaning ofthose items, creating a summarization of the meaning in a text object.   The InterOffice server will provide these services for Microsoft Windows95 clients; however, it will also make them available from Oracle's Webbrowser, called PowerBrowser, which will let developers give users accessto the same features from either Windows or the Web.   Supporting both Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java and the Oracle Basicprogramming languages, PowerBrowser lets developers reduce the number ofapplications used on desktops, said Vassallo.   By bringing traditionally nonrelational data such as Web documents,groupware, E-mail, and video streams inside an RDBMS, InterOffice is alsocapable of bestowing transactional capabilities traditionally found only inRDBMSes, such as row-level locking, shared SQL, and read consistency.Physician, Manage Thyself   By centralizing these heterogeneous services within a single datastore,which can be managed from a single console, Oracle hopes to lowermanagement costs by minimizing the number of applications servers requiredin an organization, said Vassallo.   For example, users can add access to real-time video services to anexisting Oracle RDBMS through the InterOffice suite without purchasing aseparate video server, Vassallo explained.   Without a single solution, ``a company must buy a whole bunch ofseparate management tools, databases, Web servers, workflow products, andscripts to connect the Web server to the database server,'' said DanKuznetski, research director for Unix and server operating environments atInternational Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.   Yet some believe that the most important aspect of the InterOffice Suiteis its capability to reduce cost of ownership through its effectivemanagement of these services, said Kuznetski. ``By managing this onepackage with one tool,'' he said, ``Oracle reduces installation, tuning,management, and problem resolution.''   To this end, the suite comes equipped with the InterOffice Manager,which manages servers, clients, services, and even systems informationthrough Intelligent Agents.   These agents, according to Oracle Chairman and CEO Larry Ellison, letmanagers automate time-consuming tasks such as disk-space management,backups, and even applications distribution. ``It helps you keep track ofall the software you have throughout the network because it does thedistribution for you,'' he said. ``So instead of running around with afloppy disk, you just put one copy of the software on one server, whichdistributes that software to other servers, which in turn distributesoftware to client computers.''   However, IDC's Kuznetski points out that although existing Oracleinstallations will benefit greatly from the InterOffice Suite,organizations already housing adequate solutions for individual componentswill not be swayed without some strong marketing by Oracle. For example,though the RDBMS itself is well proven, there are many products in thesuite without a track record that must compete with existing products.``While the database piece is well proven as is, the management component,the Web, workflow, and multimedia components are new,'' said Kuznetski.   The Enterprise edition of InterOffice will retail for $14,995, and theWorkgroup edition will retail for $2,995.

Shimmin   IBM is a believer in the idea of a server-based applications suite, aswell. So much so, in fact, that it intends to combine no less than sevenserver components within its soon-to-be-released suite, code-named ProjectEagle.   To be available by the end of this quarter, Project Eagle will joincommunications, Internet, database, transaction-processing, directory andsecurity, groupware, and management components across all of its hardwareofferings in the hope of giving customers a single-vendor solution thatmeets not only a company's applications-services needs but its scaleabilityneeds as well, said Mark Nunn, IBM's worldwide brand manager for ProjectEagle in Armonk, N.Y.   ``This provides fundamental, base technology layers that an organizationcan rely on as rock solid and completely reliable, so they can bet theirbusinesses on this,'' Nunn said. ``Customers can start small and move tolarger systems.''For example, because the suite's security, directory, and distributionarchitecture is based on the Open Software Foundation's DistributedComputing Environment, applications built with suite components such as IBMDB2 and Lotus Notes can be easily scaled from IBM OS/2 PC machines toOS/390 mainframes without extensive modifications, explained Nunn.   ``Often when you start off with your first client/server application,you start in a pilot mode, but that builds and builds as you become morecomfortable with it,'' Nunn said. ``Because companies look for multiplelifetimes in these applications and data they are collecting, they might aswell invest them in systems that will be there for the long term.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsALANTEC TO JOIN FORE'S SWITCH FOLDAcquisition adds departmental and backbone LAN-switch expertiseBy:Michelle Rae McLean   Continuing its buying spree of products that drive the need for ATMbackbones, Fore Systems Inc. last month purchased Alantec Corp. The buyoutadds high-end Ethernet switches to a product line that ranges fromremote-access multiplexers to carrier network switches.   The stock-swap agreement, which will make Alantec a wholly ownedsubsidiary of Fore, brings a mix of LAN-backbone and departmental switchesinto the fold. The Alantec PowerHubs' support of multiprotocol routing mayprove key to Fore's plan to offer products that integrate legacy LANs withATM.   The Alantec products ``give Fore the reach into the LAN side that itneeded,'' said Skip MacAskill, senior research analyst at The Gartner GroupInc. in Stamford, Conn.   Alantec's desktop, departmental, and backbone PowerHubs offerhigher-capacity switching than the desktop-only product gained in Fore'sMay acquisition of Applied Network Technology Inc. Alantec's switches arealso the first to market in supporting multilayer forwarding, combiningboth fast bridging and routing.   ``Until other companies can add routing to their switches, the Alantecproducts give Fore an important advantage and immediate product delivery,''said MacAskill. Companies' router-based infrastructures will require theintegration point between legacy networks and ATM backbones to consist of aproduct that supports routing, he said.Running With the Routers   Though switches are beginning to replace routers as the core device innetworks, the need for routing functionality has not disappeared. Alantec'sexpertise in integrating routing capabilities in LAN switches shouldcomplement other interswitch routing technology Fore acquired when itbought RainbowBridge Communications Inc. last May.   Fore is banking on departmental and backbone switches to drive bandwidthusage, increasing customers' need for the higher-speed backbone that ATMswitches are designed to support.   ``All our acquisitions and alliances are for products that provideon-ramps to ATM and that help customers migrate to ATM,'' said Eric Cooper,Fore's chairman and CEO.   Alantec had already included ATM interfaces and Fore's SPANS ATMsoftware on some of its switches, and bringing that support to all PowerHubmodels is a priority, said Cooper. Making those switches stronger edgedevices, which connect Ethernet segments to ATM backbones, could end Fore'sreliance on NetEdge Systems Inc. for that technology, said analysts.   Fore will have to overcome the integration challenge of combiningnetwork-management products typical to every acquisition. The company plansto bring management of the PowerHubs under ForeView by the end of thisyear. The companies also plan to merge their U.S.-based direct sales forcesand will likely maintain their distribution partners overseas.

The problem can be attributed both to set-in-their-ways managers and totechnology vendors. But indications are that this situation is changing forthe better. Vendors and managers appear to grasp better than ever the needto bring the control and accountability of a centralized computer system tothe chaos of distributed systems.   In preparation for this issue's Manager's Outlook on LAN management(``The LAN-Management Paradox,'' Page 23), LAN Times conducted a readersurvey to gauge opinions and use of today's technology (an analysis of theresults starts on the Cover). A paradox was revealed: A relatively lowusage rate of all but the most basic server and internetworkingdevice-management tools defied an overall understanding of the need forbetter management tools due to increasing workloads.   Many survey respondents stated that they simply did not need elaborate,integrated management tools to do their job. In some cases, that responsecan be attributed more to the technological failings and pricing of thesolutions out there than to a lack of need. In other cases, it's possiblethat managers just aren't able to see the potential financial savings thatbetter network control affords.Accepting the Inevitable   However, as network managers move up the corporate-management food chainit's a sure bet that the need for better client/server accountability andmore efficient management will become apparent.   We're at a crossroads now. The fiercely independent adolescence of thePC LAN is coming to grips with more button-downed enterpriseresponsibilities. While LAN managers are still reluctant to``mainframe-ize'' their environments by turning user-productivity toolsinto terminals, they also expect technology vendors to meet their needswith more flexible, integrated, and easy-to-use management capabilities.   This expectation is evidenced by a sharp increase in positive responseswhen readers were asked about their purchase plans for the next sixmonths.   Thankfully, the internetworking, operating system, and utilities vendorsalso seem to be getting it. The march of progress means that moremanageability will be built into applications and systems, representing amove away from the add-on management mentality.   That's good because it goes a long way toward solving another paradoxresiding at the heart of the first: Too often today's management tools addcomplexity and cost to a networking system, thus discouraging the verymanagers they're designed to help.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsEDITOR'S NOTEBy:Leonard Heymann, Editor in Chief   LAN Times is launching the Manager's Outlook report to give networkmanagers a comprehensive review of key issues facing them in 1996. Our goalis to paint a detailed picture of both the products and the strategiesneeded to solve the most demanding network problems.   LAN management, the topic of our first Manager's Outlook, in particularrequires a thorough evaluation of both products and strategies. Looking atjust one angle of LAN management, such as the product side, portrays afalse view.   Network-administration suites, for instance, are rapidly maturingproducts that appear ready for prime time. But our survey reveals thatusers are far from embracing them -- and, for that matter, LAN-managementproducts in general. Issues such as cost and training, as well as doubtsabout whether the products offer any tangible benefits, are giving managerscause for concern. So exploring the strategies, even ones as basic asstandardizing the desktop, is the only way to reveal the true state of theart of LAN management.   Our new Cost Justification column, written by Testing Center ManagerTere' Parnell -- who has spent much of her time in the trenches as anetwork manager -- also appropriately debuts with LAN management. Sellingproducts in general to management is one of administrators' mostchallenging tasks. But selling management tools is even more difficultbecause their benefit to the company isn't always obvious. Parnell's columnoffers specific examples to prove the tools will boost the productivity ofyour business.   Manager's Outlook will appear quarterly, examining such topics asmulti-processing servers, groupware, and ATM migration.

Novell's business applications are up for sale. Is there a sense thatthe Microsoft Corp. strategy that was being mimicked by the acquisition ofWordPerfect just didn't work for Novell?A. Yes. The attempt was to match Microsoft product category by productcategory. It became clear to me that it could not be done.Q. Is Novell now ceding the applications-server market to Microsoft andMicrosoft Windows NT?A. We've said for a long time that NT's real competition is Unix--it'snot Novell NetWare. NetWare is a network operating system that providessecurity and the capability to share, communicate, manage, and accessinformation across a wide and local area. That's its focus. The fact thatit is very lean,and you can put a database on top of it and use thedatabase manufacturer's tools to create an extraordinary price-performancesolution means that, yes, you can do a certain kind of application serving,and you can do it better than on any other platform.   We haven't ceded the applications-server market to Microsoft or WindowsNT. Microsoft doesn't own it yet. The Unix world is still much larger thanNT. And as we have talked about, we will have NetWare incorporated intoevery copy of [The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.] SCO Unix and [Hewlett-PackardCo.] HP-UX.Q. How can you get something besides your own applications to support NDS[NetWare Directory Services]?A. First off, we now have 140 NDS applications shipping. Since thebeginning of 1995, we have shipped 25,000 SDKs [software developer's kits],which is more than ever in our history. So we are paying attention todevelopers, and frankly, Novell didn't pay enough attention to developersin the past. We would love to see Lotus Notes make use of the directory. Itwould make enormous sense for us and for them since Notes runs on top ofNetWare Connect Services [NCS]. With directories, as with many othertechnologies, there is this chicken-and-egg question. Is NDS in enoughplaces so that it's interesting to developers, and are there enoughdevelopers to make NDS interesting to users?Q. What you have laid out here addresses infrastructure, but it's theavailability of NDS-compliant applications that will undo thechicken-and-egg perception.A. Part of what we've done is that with NCS, the directory underpins thatare in every environment. The second path is to get it into all of the Unixsystems. The directory is a service not just to manage components of thenetwork but to be used as the directory for applications services that arewritten to it. It's not just for keeping track of users and what theirattributes are.   One of the things you will see next year is the capability to access thedirectory from an Internet browser and make use of the information that'sheld in the directory. So instead of getting on the Internet and doing ainterminable search to find something, the directory can go right to thetopic that you're interested in.   Frankly, this time last year was when we started shipping a directorythat was solid and that had the right utilities so that people had theconfidence that this thing was going to work. Up until then, there weresignificant questions.Q. One of NT's strengths is that it runs on non-Intel Corp. platforms.What is happening with regard to NetWare and non-Intel platforms?A. We dropped Processor Independent [PIN] NetWare. Unix is how we willaddress NetWare running on non-NetWare platforms. We had a team of 100 foreach platform, and that was not cost justified.Q. You have been criticized for being late with your strategy. If you hadit to do all over again, would you have implemented any sooner the changesthat you have recently made at Novell?A. First, I had to unsnarl [the PIN partnership] mess. I also had to getthe products to work. Novell's and WordPerfect's flagship products didn'twork. Now we have put in place a framework that fixed the strategy. Couldit have been faster? Yeah, maybe. But not a lot faster.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsIF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX ITPut off by high prices and a confusing marketplace, LAN managers shy awayfrom the very tools that aim to simplify their jobsBy:Claudia Graziano   Pick up any trade magazine, and you're bound to find more than a fewarticles extolling the virtues of LAN-management software. Yet more than afew LAN managers are passing up these software tools altogether, preferringinstead to stick to managing desktops, applications, servers, and otherdevices manually--or not at all.   Taken at face value, the results of the LAN Times 1995 Manager's Surveypaint a rosy picture of the state of LAN management. It would seem LANmanagers are doing so well they simply don't need the tools we write about.But is that what LAN managers are really saying?   By all accounts, the price of LAN ownership is high. Analysts fromgroups such as Forrester Research Inc. and Gartner Group Inc. continue toput the price of supporting networked PCs somewhere between $3,000 and$5,000 per PC annually. Of that, roughly half is management-related costs,analysts say. So how come more organizations are not using management toolsto help reduce these costs? One theory is that organizations aren't reallyaware of how much they're spending to support LANs.   ``LAN-management costs are hidden costs,'' said Waverly Deutsch,computing-strategies services analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge,Mass. ``The costs have to do with network downtime and the LAN manager'stime spent running from site to site.''LAN managers know they spend too much time putting out the proverbialfires. But many feel the available tools are more trouble than they'reworth.   ``All we've been doing is trying to administer this thing,'' said DaveBullamore, computer consultant for North Carolina's Department ofAgriculture in Raleigh. ``We don't have any time to plan ahead or thinkabout the future.'' Bullamore, who is one of three IS staff members whomanage the NCDA's approximately 600 PCs spread out over 14 Novell Inc.NetWare LAN segments, said cost and complexity are the two main reasons hisdepartment has been slow to deploy management tools.   ``The state is pretty tight about adding new positions, so we're beingforced to evaluate some network-management tools,'' he said. ``But we justdon't have the time to set up a test lab to evaluate all these tools. Theyall have so many pieces. Just figuring out how to set them up is a lot tolearn.'' So far, Bullamore has chosen Novell's LANalyzer for keeping tabson traffic levels and Bay Network Inc.'s Optivity for managing the NCDA's35 SynOptics Ethernet series hubs. But non-trouble-shooting tools are hardto justify, he said. ``We're looking at [Intel Corp.'s] LANDesk ManagementSuite and Novell's ManageWise, but they get pretty expensive when you starttalking $40 or $50 per node.''   In fact, cost justification seems to be a problem for many organizationswhen it comes to management tools.   ``The question is not about whether to use management tools, it's who isgoing to use the tools,'' said Ken Brown, industrial engineer at RRDonnelly & Sons Inc. in Crawfordsville, Ind. ``A lot of these tools requireone person just to manage the software. Unless we can show that kind oftool is cost-effective, like if it eliminated the need for staff, there'sno way it's going to get approved.'' Brown, whose job it is to review anypurchase requests that come from one of the organization's six LANmanagers, said his staff rarely asks for software funds.   So exactly how is RR Donnelly managing its 700 PCs? ``Our networkmanagers are fairly well-experienced. Each handles about a hundred or soPCs, and they seem to get everything they need done. Also, our users arepretty well-educated. We have in-house training classes for them, so theydon't need a lot of support.'' But not everything at RR Donnelly is donemanually.   Larry Freund, LAN administrator, said his department wrote its softwarefor administering the group's two Oracle Corp. databases and managing itstwo IBM OS/2 LAN Server file servers. He also uses home-grownapplications-metering software. ``At the time we needed it, there weren'tany OS/2-based management tools,'' he said.   For others with larger networks, the cost of management software is evenhigher.   ``By the time you buy the basic package and all the support andtraining, [enterprise] management platforms become an extremely high-ticketitem,'' said Brian Sugano, manager of communications services for thecounty of San Mateo in Redwood City, Calif. ``These types of tools are soexpensive they're really only applicable to large companies that have a[wide-area] infrastructure to support,'' said Sugano, who uses IBM'sNetView 6000 for managing the county's 3,000-node network spanning multiplecity offices. ``Management platforms require extensive training toconfigure the system,'' he said. Consequently, ``we've become a trainingground for NetView. It's hard to keep the trained people on staff.'' Suganoadded that he too struggles with the problem of cost-justifying tools.``Management is an application nobody sees. It's hard to get money forit,'' he said.Making a Case for Tools   Forrester's Deutsch agrees that tools on the market today are numerousand somewhat immature but feels that ignoring management tools is a seriousmistake. ``Yes, tools are complicated. Yes, tools are hard to evaluate.That's because every tool has its own interface, its own data repository,its own way of executing actions.'' But management problems are going toget worse, not better, she said. ``With more companies movingmission-critical applications off host systems, network managers are goingto be faced with a lot more than user-productivity problems.''   Not surprisingly, developers agree these tools are too important tooverlook.   ``Management has been perceived as a value-add, and I think that'sabsolutely wrong,'' said David Hamilton, systems- and network-managementproduct manager for Microsoft Corp. Trying to manage devices andapplications after they've been deployed is almost certainly going to leadto downtime and poor service for networked users, he said.   But developers, too, need to do their part to increase adoption ofmanagement tools. Making products simpler to use, increasing integrationamong so-called suites of tools, and committing to standards such as theDesktop Management Interface (DMI) are a few ways vendors can help.Fortunately, just about every major management-applications developer hasalready pledged support for DMI, a budding standard that aims to makedesktops and related components universally manageable. But work is stillunderway to give management applications a means for accessing DMIdata--how PCs and related components describe themselves--remotely.   In the absence of a completed standard, vendors have yet to put theirdevelopment money where their mouth is. However, given the DesktopManagement Task Force's schedule for completing the specification's missinglink, it could be midyear before vendors are able to embed support for DMIin their applications.   The problem of integration, on the other hand, could take longer forvendors to solve. Right now, suites offer little more than a convenient wayto purchase software, said Ted Schlein, vice president of networking andclient/ server technology for Symantec Corp., a management-applicationsdeveloper in Cupertino, Calif.   ``Point solutions should leverage one another'' through functions suchas event forwarding and real-time data sharing. But ``there isn't a greatdeal of that kind of integration yet,'' Schlein said.   For its part, Symantec is embarking on a strategy to not only integrateits own products but also work with other vendors to promote cross-productintegration. ``We don't want to have to force customers to do everythingthe Symantec way. That's not real life,'' Schlein said.   Symantec is just one of many vendors trying to deliver better integratedLAN-management product suites. Competitors McAfee Associates Inc. andSeagate Enterprise Man- agement Software Co., in particular, are grapplingwith integrating product lines inherited through recent companyacquisitions. Not only do these companies face the challenge of pullingtogether products with completely different development histories, but theymust do so at a more meaningful level than just at the GUI.   For instance, Santa Clara, Calif.-based McAfee is working on reconcilingproduct lines acquired over the past two years from Automated DesignSystems Inc., Brightwork Development Corp., Saber Software Corp., andMountain Network Solutions Inc. And Seagate's newly formed managementdivision is busy sorting out product lines acquired from Frye ComputerSystems Inc., NetLabs Inc., and Network Computing Inc.   Given the current state of flux of most of these products, manydevelopers are not surprised at LAN managers' reluctance to invest inthem.   ``The massive consolidation in the industry brings up valid concernsabout the viability of these vendors,'' said Bill Larson, McAfee'spresident and CEO. But Larson and others believe market consolidation isultimately good for LAN managers for a number of reasons. First, aconsolidated industry means fewer products for LAN managers to evaluate. Asecond benefit is fewer points of contact--or even a single point ofcontact--for technical support and training. Third, asurvival-of-the-fittest marketplace stands to yield more sophisticatedproduct offerings.   Of course, the downside of all this consolidation is that LAN managersare essentially put on hold while vendors sort out their integrationstrategies.   ``Because there are no integrated tool sets, people can't yet see thevision of what's going to be possible,'' suggested Michael Howard,president of Infonetics Research Inc., a consulting company in San Jose,Calif.The Art of Simplicity   Making tools easier to evaluate and purchase is a subtler changeexpected in the evolution of management software. Developers admit theyhaven't done a great job of making tool purchases easy to justify to thepowers that be, but they say they're working on it.   ``If administrators are not implementing tools, it's because we haven'tgiven them a reason. Vendors need to make a business case for managementtools, not just an IS case,'' said Ken Mackin, manager of thesystems-management strategies group at Intel. An avenue that Intel andothers are exploring to help get corporate types more involved in managingthe network is making data collected by management applications accessibleto de- partments other than IS. Inventory data, for example, should beaccessible to the finance and human-resources departments. ``Companies haveto have adequate systems management to know what the cost of ownership is.Once you have cost of ownership, then you can justify the purchase of toolsbecause you can show how to reduce those costs.''And while tools aren't likely to get any cheaper, they are supposed to getsimpler to use. As hardware and software become instrumented withmanagement--either through standards such as DMI or built-in devices andeven the operating systems themselves, developers say administrators willsee complexity drastically reduced. ``Right now, [management] vendors haveto play integrators,'' Mackin said. But once management becomes built in tomore components, vendors will be able to concentrate on managing thenetwork, not the management system.Illustration(s):Illustration: Graph: Reality CheckIllustration: Graph: What Matters?Illustration: Not Enough BodiesCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsREGAINING CONTROL OF THE DESKTOPStandard configurations are today's panacea for controlling costs, buttheir effectiveness may be short-livedBy:Jill Marts   While the majority of IS professionals applaud the added freedom thepersonal computer provides users, many--especially those managing largenumbers of nodes--are finding the cost of maintaining disparate PCs too biga pill to swallow.   An effective and common solution is to restrict desktop configurationsby instituting policies and standards to give all desktops the same lookand feel. Many users, IS professionals, and industry analysts, however,charge this practice is obliterating the personal from the PC.   But standardized desktops offer a number of critical benefits, the mostimportant of which is cost-effectiveness. The less time managers spendreconfiguring desktops, the more time they have to support and maintain thenetwork. Standardized nodes are also easier to manage--IS staff don't needto maintain a mountain of different applications--and they're more secure,which increases the integrity of the information system as a whole. Theseadvantages, claim the proponents of standardization, far outweigh users'loss of control over their desktop environment.   ``The time and effort we spent trying to diagnose individual problemsjust wasn't worth it. Our desktop standard is by far the mostcost-effective thing we could do,'' said Gary Light, manager of advancedtechnology at Concord Hospital in Concord, N.H.Varying Levels of Control   Solutions for regaining control of the desktop vary from such mildmeasures as instituting restrictive policies to providing centralizedaccess to some or all applications on the server. An even more extrememeasure eliminates hard drives from PCs altogether.   Which strategy you choose, or if you standardize at all, often comesdown to the size and type of network you manage. Large organizations standto gain the most from uniform configurations, along with those that don'trely heavily on user creativity. Banks and health-care organizations aregood examples of companies that stand to benefit most. Their businessprocedures are usually already standardized, so uniform desktops generallydo not adversely affect productivity. Software-development companies, onthe other hand, are probably not good candidates, because businesses ofthis type usually depend heavily on user creativity.   Most organizations that implement desktop standards take amiddle-of-the-road approach, which involves using one or two standards,running some or all of the applications from the server, and institutingpolicies.   When Concord Hospital moved toward standardization, Light found itnecessary to develop two desktop standards. The common standard works forapproximately 75 percent of the hospital's users. It includes the NovellInc. NetWare 3.12 Requester and provides access to a half-dozenapplications on the server such as Novell WordPerfect, Microsoft Excel, andLotus Freelance Graphics. Only Microsoft Windows and the Windows swap filesare installed locally.   Light found this standard wasn't feasible for the remaining 25 percentof the hospital's workstations, most of which are located at nurses'stations and require health-care-specific applications. Be- cause doctors,nurses, and other medical personnel need to be able to walk up to any ofthese workstations and access data, this alternate configuration had to behighly standardized so that all clinical workstations would have the samelook and feel.The Case of the Missing Tools   The combination of uniform configurations and user policies that helpmaintain the setup has paid off for Concord Hospital. Policies thatrestrict users from bringing in software, copying it off the servers, orediting files such as CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT have been mostly adheredto.   Whereas automated tools are readily available to help maintain theconfigurations and enforce policies once they've been established,Concord's IS staff hasn't taken advantage of them, other than using McAfeeAssociates Inc.'s SiteMeter for metering software licenses on the server.Missing from the playing field are automatic software-distribution andinventory--tools that Light acknowledges contribute to a weakness inConcord's strategy.   ``Sooner or later we're going to have to get off the stick and find thetools that work for us,'' Light says. ``But it takes a substantial amountof time and energy to learn how to effectively use those packages.''   Without software-distribution, metering, and inventory tools,maintaining standard configurations amounts to a lot of leg work for ISstaff. Light's reticence to implement most of these tools echoes a largertrend among network administrators in general. The LAN Times 1995 Manager'sSurvey revealed that less than 35 percent of our readers are usingdistribution, inventory, or metering tools (see graphic, Page 41).   Light expects Concord's network to grow from 400 PCs to 800 PCs in thenext few years. By that time, he says, automated tools will be anecessity.Banning the Hard Drive   For some organizations, centralizing all applications on the server andproviding one or two standard configurations is simply not enough.   Andy Kiolbasa, networking chief of technology at ITT Fluid TechnologyCorp., which designs, manufactures, and distributes pumps and valves, sayshis company is sold on stringent desktop standards and policies. TheMidland Park, N.J.-based company has more than 2,000 workstations locatedat sites in five countries.   In 1987, ITT began eliminating hard drives from all its workstations.Kiolbasa and his staff wiped out the existing ones and partitioned themdown to 20MB to be used as very fast boot disks or swap files. As new PCswere added to the network, they were purchased without hard drives. Now,with about 70 servers running NetWare 3.12, the company has more than 200PCs without a single hard drive connected to each server. All applications,including Windows, are centralized on the file servers.   Kiolbasa's attitude toward desktop standards is matter-of-fact: ``Thereisn't any reason to install [Microsoft] Word on 2,000 local hard drives andthen have some users destroy the configuration. We install one copy on ourserver, make sure we have the proper licenses, and we're done.''   Unlike many administrators, Kiolbasa doesn't see standardization as away to avoid using management tools. He uses ON Technology Corp.'sWinINSTALL product for automatic software installations and updates. Theadvantage, Kiolbasa says, is that the IS staff writes the routine only onceto give a new Windows user access to Word, for example, and WinINSTALLautomatically installs the program into the Windows environment when theuser logs in.   The IS staff also uses Bindview Development Corp.'s BindView NCS tomonitor hardware and ensure users' configur- ation files conform to thestandard.A Creativity Killer?   While there's no shortage of standardization proponents, there areothers who contend this strategy isn't a panacea for all desktop-managementwoes.   Most administrators who manage desktops through standardization will bethe first to admit that there are at least some drawbacks. For one thing,user resistance often runs high when administrators attempt to institutestandards in an environment that previously lacked them. And even withsuccessful implementations, IS professionals can't expect to get totalcontrol of the workstations. Removing all hard drives, for example, workswell until someone gets a laptop.   ``Given the constantly changing PC industry and the fact that users haveultimate dominion over their machines, it's unlikely that any desktopstandard will remain standard for very long,'' said Chris Thomas, managerof emerging technology for Intel Corp.'s enterprise-server group inHillsboro, Ore.   Productivity issues surround standardization as well. Some argue it'svery restrictive to expect people to have only a certain set of tools in anenvironment that uses PCs as personal-productivity devices.   ``There are certain things that are good about policies and standards,but the blanket approach is very short-sighted,'' said Steven Saks, vicepresident of IS at the California Trucking Association (CTA) in Sacramento,Calif. ``What you're doing is eliminating the unique abilities of eachindividual and turning them into drones.''   Saks opted to go light on standards at CTA and has placed more emphasison policies to manage the desktops on his 60-user, four-server NetWarenetwork. He limits creativity, he says, to a given product but never totypes of products. So, for example, he permits only one word processor andone spreadsheet program, but doesn't forbid the use of other types ofapplications on different desktops that individual users may need. Inaddition, he has instituted policies that prevent users from sharingworkstations or passwords.   Although consolidating products on a single platform or set of platformsoffers great potential for reducing cost of ownership, many agree thatoffering a restricted set of products isn't a long-term solution.   Intel's Thomas says that restricting desktop configurations is probablythe worst way to think about managing the desktop, but it is the easiestoption for administrators right now.   ``As a way of getting your arms around the task, it's a good startingpoint,'' Thomas said. ``But it doesn't replace the need to find solutionsthat deal with the evolving desktop.'' Thomas emphasizes that the crux ofthe problem is that the platforms themselves are not standardized on howthey set up and configure other products.   The real, longer-term solutions to unruly desktops will most likely comefrom vendors as they work to provide more manageable platforms andproducts. Eventually, when most hardware and software adheres to some ofthe simple standards of installation and management, it will be lessimportant for support staff to limit choice.   Thomas compares the situation at hand to that of the telephoneindustry--it was not until companies agreed on wiring infrastructures andvoltage levels that any phone from any company could be plugged in to thewall and work. In the PC industry, as products consolidate and standardizeat the OS level, it will be easier to use different platforms morereadily.Illustration(s):Illustration: Which Ones Get Used?Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsTOOLS THAT FOLLOW THE RULESA new breed of policy-based software promises to tighten security and cutcostsBy:Claudia Graziano   When Novell Inc. introduced NetWare 4.x two years ago, networkadministrators found they had a lot more to contend with than justinstalling the new enterprise NOS. For the first time, many administratorswere required to organize a standard naming convention for networkedresources and establish guidelines for giving users access to thoseresources. In short, upgrading to NetWare 4.x meant institutingcorporatewide policies to govern the network.   Since then, the idea of policy-based management has caught on as a wayto reduce administrative costs, tighten security, and even speedtrouble-shooting by setting standards for dealing with a variety ofsituations, ranging from adding new users to the network to reacting tosystem faults. To make the process of coordinating corporate policies andmanagement practices easier, network- and systems-management applicationsdevelopers have begun building policy-based management capabilities intotheir tools.Automatic Management   Policy-based management may seem like a futuristic prospect, but it'sclosing in on reality--many administrators already have policies in placeto help them manage the network. Backing up file servers every Friday, forinstance, or inventorying the network twice a year are examples of commonpolicies used to maintain network operations. The only difference is thatthese policies aren't automated. Rather than being organized in a database,management policies are often written on scratch pads, saved in E-mail, orjust noted mentally.   Management-applications developers are out to change this scenario tohelp organizations take control of growing enterprise networks.   ``The advantage of policies is that they ensure a consistentenvironment. Client/server environments that are not consistent break,''said Scott Harmen, vice president and general manager of Tivoli SystemsInc.'s applications-management division in Austin, Texas. Securitymanagement, for example, requires policies to determine which users haveaccess to what network resources. Without such policies, security is boundto be compromised. Policies can also help streamline administration tasks,such as configuring new users' desktops and preventing the use ofunauthorized software.   The key to policy-based management, of course, is automation.Administrators of mainframe and Unix environments have long usedjob-scheduling utilities to automate certain tasks. Now those same types oftools are finding their way into the PC LAN world. Seagate EnterpriseManagement Software Co.'s Ashwin, for example, lets administrators schedulebackground and after-hours processing jobs for Microsoft Windows NT andWindows 95 machines, as well as Unix workstations and IBM mainframes andminicomputers.   ``Basically, any utility that has script-writing capabilities canaccomplish rudimentary automation,'' said Waverly Deutsch,computing-strategies services analyst at Forrester Research Inc. inCambridge, Mass. What's needed are applications that not only automateadministrative tasks but also provide an interface for managing thepolicies themselves.The Ground Up   Two applications developers that are pioneering policy-based managementat the desktop are McAfee Associates Inc. and Symantec Corp. Last March,both companies licensed code from Microsoft Corp. that will let eachdeveloper exploit management capabilities already built in to the Windows95 operating system. Specifically, the code provides links to the Windows95 Registry, which records changes to desktop configurations. The code willalso provide links to an embedded policy editor, which contains 50predefined user-configuration ``profiles.''   By tapping the Registry and the embedded policy editor, McAfee,Symantec, and others will be able to create applications that can centrallymanage desktops on the basis of administrator-defined policies. Forexample, user access rights, start-up applications-- even backgroundcolors--can all be defined from a remote-management console.   McAfee plans to release the first application that incorporates thelicensed code next month. The new product, called Saber Tools 1.0, is acombination of McAfee's NetTools and the former Saber Software Corp.'sSaber Menus. According to Product Manager David Wilbanks, Saber Tools willextend Microsoft's desktop policy-editor functions to the server, lettingadministrators browse Novell's NetWare directory to select individuals orgroups of users for applying policies.   Although administrators can already access Microsoft's policy editorremotely, changes can be made only for one user at a time, Wilbanks said.And the embedded policy editor has no system for manipulating severalpolicies at once. In contrast, SaberTools will let several policies begrouped and applied to users with a single command.   Policies that administrators might choose from the Saber Tools policyeditor include restricting users' access to files, directories, servers,and even executeables. Policies that restrict users' access to the startmenu, for example, can be helpful in reducing the number of support callsto the help desk.   ``If users accidentally change or delete their IP settings, they maylose their network connection,'' said Wilbanks. ``This could take up to 30minutes to fix.''   Other policies may enforce company directives, such as not bringingsoftware from home. Symantec's Norton Administrator for Networks and NortonDesktop Administrator--both slated to incorporate policy-based managementby mid-1996--will let administrators set policies that deny users access tothe network if virus checking or metering is disabled at the workstation.   ``There's been no way to enforce this level of security in the past,''said Jonathan Niednagel, senior product manager for Symantec in Cupertino,Calif.   Policy-based management is also making its way into high-end managementapplications. Last June, Hewlett-Packard Co. introduced an add-on to its HPOpenView platform, called AdminCenter. The Unix-driven management softwareis aimed at streamlining administrative jobs such as configuring users andapplications. But unlike emerging PC-based solutions, AdminCenter providesa sophisticated mechanism for organizing policies and reconcilingconflicting policies.   The software uses a knowledge base to store the policies hierarchically.Administrators can designate policies for the global environment, forspecific domains, or even for specific workstations. AdminCenterautomatically assigns ratings to policies that allow very specific,low-level policies to overrule more general, high-level policies.   For example, a high-level policy dictating that only users with an IDnumber between 100 and 500 can access the accounting server may beoverruled by a low-level policy that says users in the remote accountingoffice can also access the server. But high-level policies are overruledonly if the administrator who writes the low-level policy has theappropriate access privileges.In a Similar Vein   Tivoli Systems Inc. offers a similar product for policy-based systemsadministration called Tivoli/Admin. Part of the Tivoli ManagementEnvironment product suite, Tivoli/Admin lets customers attach policies toany systems-management function controllable from the TME console.Currently, the software supports only Unix clients and servers, but Tivoliis promising a version of its Admin product that runs on Microsoft WindowsNT Server in the first quarter. The new version of Tivoli/Admin will letcustomers control not only Unix and Windows NT clients but also Windows andNetWare clients.   Like HP's AdminCenter, Tivoli/Admin uses object-oriented code and arules-correlation engine to manipulate default and user-defined policies.However, it has no system in place for resolving policy conflicts.   ``Basically, the most recent policy wins,'' said Martin Neath, vicepresident and general manager for TME core products.   But for some, this lack of higher intelligence is a minor detail.   Steve Henderson, systems engineer for GTE Telephone Operations Corp. inTampa, Fla., said Tivoli/Admin saved his department from having tocontinuously modify and develop its own internal policy-based managementsoftware.   ``The [policy-based management] software we'd written was a maintenancenightmare. Somebody had to recompile the code every time there was achange. It just didn't evolve naturally,'' he said. ``But doing things onemachine at a time just wasn't going to work for us.''   Henderson's group began rolling out Tivoli/Admin more than two yearsago, when the concept of policy-based management was unknown to most. Butfaced with several thousand Unix clients to manage, Henderson said hisgroup had a vested interest in putting its mainframe experience to work inthe client/ server world.   Although Tivoli/ Admin has helped reduce the administrative burden, theproduct provides little in the way of security enforcement. ``Tivoli/Admindoesn't really cover things like controlling access to certain servers onceusers get on the network,'' Henderson said.   The benefits of policy-based management aside, analysts say thetechnology's inherent complexity may not be worth the pain of implementingsuch solutions for some organizations.   ``It's very, very difficult to implement a policy-based managementsystem,'' said Jill Huntington-Lee, senior analyst with Datapro InformationServices Group in Delran, N.J. ``Not only do you have to deal with feedinga lot of data into these systems to get started, you have to deal with alot of internal company issues.''Corporate Culture Cops   In fact, defining corporate policies for the software to enforce hasproved such a challenge to early adopters of Tivoli's Admin product thatthe company retains a team of integrators to help customers through theprocess.   ``You have to have a clear business case for implementing policy-basedmanagement,'' Huntington-Lee continued. The technology can be particularlyvaluable to financial, government, research, and other organizations whereaccess to systems needs to be strictly regulated, she said.   Regardless, companies need to do a lot of work beforehand to get themost out of policy-based management.   Companies evaluating this technology ``need to examine theadministration processes they have in place now and compare that to theprocesses they want automated,'' said Huntington-Lee. From there, companiesneed to figure out whether the products that are available present arealistic solution.Illustration(s):Table: Policy-Based Management Tools (This table is not availableeletronically.

But despite its popularity, the protocol has someprofound limitations that make it inappropriate for managing every LAN.Proposed revisions to SNMP are also steeped in controversy, as proponentsof alternative management strategies butt heads over standards forcontrolling networks.   Network management ought to be simple: Managing network devices frommultiple vendors requires a standard for defining and gathering managementinformation. Today that standard is SNMP, but the protocol wasn't intendedto be a long-term solution.   The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) originally proposed the SNMPstandard as a stopgap measure until businesses could migrate from TCP/IP toOSI (Open Systems Interconnection)-standard networks, which were expectedto include a robust and secure network-management standard. When thismigration failed to occur and TCP/IP grew even more popular, the IETFattempted to approve a new version of SNMP to address its shortcomings.   Unfortunately, the new version has failed to appear, and administratorsare now left with growing networks and no effective way to manage them.Defining the Limits   Some of SNMP's limitations stem from its architecture, which usespassive agents on clients that are activated only when polled by amanagement application. This design is SNMP's first drawback: Pollingconsumes a significant portion of network bandwidth and can limit what'sleft for business applications. And because the agents can't proactivelyreport exceptional events, SNMP managers must continuously collect andprocess information--even when no problems exist--which limits the numberof devices a single console can manage.   SNMP also lacks any means of communicating among managers, so themanagement function can't be distributed. This effectively limits SNMP'sscaleability and, therefore, capability to meet the requirements of a largeorganization.   Even if management could be distributed, SNMP couldn't deliver thesophisticated information needed to tune a complex network. This is becauseSNMP managers cannot retrieve large amounts of data, such as a completerouting table, in a single inquiry. The MIB (Management Information Base)format, used to store collected data on the client, is inflexible, andSNMP's TCP-centric nature means it does not mix well with the IPX, OSI, andAppleTalk networks found in most large organizations.   Another drawback is that managers' agent-to-manager communications arerudimentary at best. Agents can notify managers of problems but have no wayof verifying the information was received, and they can't provide anydetail in the notice. Instead, the manager must poll the agent to determinewhat happened.   The worst of SNMP's drawbacks is that the protocol turns a blind eye tosecurity. It doesn't provide for authentication or data encryption, whichleaves agents open to manipulation by unauthorized managers. It alsopermits the interception of authorized commands.   The IETF attempted to fix the limitations of SNMP by producing a secondversion of the protocol, SNMP version 2. But this standard has been plaguedby conflict among the proponents of differing technologies. The result hasbeen a confusing series of different SNMP 2-proposed standards.   Originally developed in 1993, the SNMP 2 proposal provided for security,bulk information retrieval, manager-to-manager communications,remote-configuration capabilities, protocol enhancements that would expandits usefulness beyond TCP networks, and other performance enhancements.   But after reviewing the proposal it developed, the IETF deemed SNMP 2too difficult to implement and use, especially in the area of security.After much debate within the IETF over two competing security models,called SNMP 2* and USec (Users-based Security), the SNMP 2 working groupsuggested an interim version of the protocol that would omit the originalrevision's controversial elements.Attempted Revamp Also Stalled   This ``new'' SNMP version is referred to as SNMP2t, SNMP2C, SNMP1.5, orjust SNMP 2 and includes commands for retrieving large quantities of datato give management applications better performance, better error messagesto help management applications better diagnose configuration problems, andprotocol enhancements.   However, the updated version 2 also lacks some of the most-neededcritical enhancements--security, manager-to-manager communications, andremote configuration--and falls short in solving a wide range ofnetwork-management problems.Not Up to the Challenge   Unfortunately for network professionals, this situation won't beresolved anytime soon. The IETF has decided to suspend work on the updatedSNMP 2 until September, hoping that a cooling-off period will bringagreement when work resumes.   Meanwhile, outside the IETF in an unofficial capacity, a ``blue-ribbonpanel'' of users and vendors is attempting to develop yet another solution.Tentatively called SNMP version 3, this SNMP standard is designed to havemore security and functionality than the current SNMP 2 and couldultimately become a de facto standard if it is adopted by systems vendors.   But SNMP 2--if it is delivered at all--will ultimately be a day late anda dollar short. It will not be much use to LAN managers because thedeficiencies addressed by version 2 are not critical, so the benefits ofupgrading don't justify the costs of replacing existing SNMP technologyinvestments.   This situation leaves administrators faced with a network-managementdilemma: SNMP is not up to managing large complex networks--let alone thewhole IT infrastructure--and SNMP 2 is delayed and deficient. OSI's CommonManagement Information Protocol, on the other hand, has the scaleabilityand security to handle today's large heterogeneous networks, but littlecommercial support exists for it outside the telecommunications industry.   In the absence of standards-based solutions to solve managementproblems, suppliers are delivering their own technology to providecustomers with much-needed management functionality.   Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Solstice Cooperative Console (CC), which is anadd-on that links multiple Solstice SunNet Manager management serverswithin an enterprise, is a good example of a product that has developedvalue not found in SNMP today.   Solstice CC performs selective data replication by sharing topology,event, and SNMP trap information with servers using Sun RPCs (remoteprocedure calls) and real-time connections. This capability givesadministrators management control over other domains. Solstice CCs can beconfigured as peers so each has full control over the other's domain, orthey can be centralized or divided by geography or area of expertise.   Fujitsu Ltd. has a similar module for its NetWalker SNMP managementplatform. And other vendors are expected to develop similar solutions. Infact, early this year, multiple suppliers are planning a collaboration tocreate interoperable Solstice CC-type solutions, allowing disparate manage-ment consoles to share information.Circumventing the Process   Solutions such as this, in which technology is shared among severalsuppliers, not only will yield better scaleability for a single-vendor'splatform but will also give network managers the benefits of an officialstandard, including competitive pricing, interoperability, and no vendorlock-in.   Long overdue, this solution nicely sidesteps the broken-downstandards-approval process. If it emerges as a common solution, it couldevolve into a de facto standard or even gain the acceptance of an officialstandards body for solving manager-to-manager communications problems inSNMP.   But for now, the reality of SNMP is that it was never intended to domore than basic monitoring and management of network devices, so it can'tbe extended to incorporate systems management. Its prevalence makes it atempting choice, but until suppliers somehow expand the technology, SNMPmanagement platforms and applications will never provide requisitefunctionality, scaleability, and security.   SNMP's convoluted evolution is a good example of what happens whenstandards bodies fail to deliver timely solutions. In the absence of suchsolutions, market pressures eventually force vendors to step in and providethe needed technology. It's possible that collaboration amongnetwork-management vendors may give the IETF the stimulus it needs to getback on track. But what's certain is that the demands of customers aregrowing too complex to tolerate the bottlenecks caused by a delay in thestandards-approval process.Illustration(s):Illustration: Chart: SNMP's Convoluted EvolutionAbout the Author(s):Sylvia Clark is a senior analyst with The Aberdeen Group Inc., aninformation-systems consulting company in Boston.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsOUTSOURCING'S REFINED ALTERNATIVEAn a la carte strategy is quickly gaining ground over the four-courseapproach to outsourcingBy:Jill Huntington-Lee   When the job of managing a network gets too big for an internal ISstaff, most companies call on outsourcers to pick up the slack. But whilethese consultants can work miracles getting your company up to speed on thelatest technology and methodologies, they're also expensive and oftendemand the authority to make over your network in any way they see fit.   But a scaled-back alternative to expensive consultants, called``out-tasking,'' is rapidly gaining ground and promises some relief for thetenacious conflict between growing networks and shrinking budgets.   Out-tasking uses ``boutique'' consultants to handle specific,well-defined activities of a LAN-management or other IS effort. In contrastto the four-course dinner approach of big systems integrators, out-taskingis strictly a la carte--a strategy its proponents say prevents runawaysystems projects and unneeded services.Getting a Jump Start   Inventory and asset management, performance analysis, and automatedbackup are three of the fastest growing out-tasking services today.Server-performance analysis, software-distribution services, cablemanagement, and even network- and systems-resource accounting andcharge-back services will soon be available from specialized providers.   Out-tasking lets user organizations jump-start important butlong-neglected management tasks such as inventorying desktop hardware andsoftware, analyzing network-performance trends, instituting automatedbackup, and building an adequate help-desk infrastructure. Critical taskssuch as these aren't complicated, but they are time-consuming--and thatmakes them perfect candidates for out-tasking.   Customers who have contracted out-taskers for these services arereporting dramatic gains. At ASC Services Co., a Chicago-based ISconsultancy that specializes in architectural and construction issues, MISManager David Weinstein drastically cut the time needed to inventory acustomer's PCs by giving the job to out-tasker Micropath Inc. in Bellevue,Wash.   ``Micropath is conducting a complete inventory of our client's network,which spans more than 20 offices across a five-state region,'' Weinsteinexplained. ``This effort would take me over a year--Micropath is doing itin less than three weeks.''   According to Bill Holder, director of operations at Micropath, thecompany's business is based completely on out-tasking inventory chores.``Our customers typically don't have enough staff to adequately inventorythousands of PCs,'' he said.   A true specialist, Micropath comes armed with its own software and afull suite of commercial inventory packages. The company also offers a60-page, step-by-step methodology for do-it-yourself inventories, but mostclients let Micropath do the work. ``Our customers usually want us toperform the initial inventory because we've done this many times before,''said Holder. ``When we're done, we leave behind a database and a managementreport with recommendations for ongoing asset-management andchange-management policies, so the customer can maintain it themselves onan ongoing basis.''   Of course, administrators building a network from scratch are in abetter position to use a disciplined approach to inventorying from dayone--but most organizations don't have the luxury of starting from a cleanslate.   ``In the 1980s, many companies were buying PCs like crazy,'' Weinsteinsaid. ``But often, the records kept weren't adequate, and no one reallyknew who had what or what software was out there.'' A comprehensiveinventory is a crucial first step toward positive network management and isrequired by many network-management programs.   Inventorying is only one area targeted by out-taskers. Performancetrending and analysis is another fast-growing service. Out-taskers take thegigabytes of cryptic data churned out by systems-management tools and turnit into cogent reports showing patterns and trends.   ``Often network administrators lack the time to develop the software andprocesses necessary to support thorough performance analysis,'' said SteveWaldbusser, principal architect for out-tasker International NetworkServices Inc. (INS) in Mountain View, Calif. ``Writing scripts or programsto support those processes takes even more time. We provide the processesas well as the software, so the solution is about as turnkey as it gets.''While a performance-analysis service is certainly appealing to companieslacking technical staff, even large companies with vast technical expertisefind time-saving services such as those offered by INS cost-effective. INSclaims as clients several of the nation's largest banks and many regionalBell operating companies.Glass-House Performance Stats   Performance analysis also appeals to network managers with glass-houseexperience. ``I came from a background of minis and mainframes, so I wasused to getting hard statistics on performance,'' said Jim Sedlacek,network-planning manager for Cleveland Clinic. ``We use [Sun MicrosystemsInc.'s] SunNet Manager for monitoring about 30 routers, but we didn't havea way of putting all the raw statistics into useful reports without a lotof programming.''   About a year ago, Sedlacek learned about the performance-analysisservices provided by 3DV Technology Inc. in Chicago. 3DV's RouterPM serviceprovides in-depth reports of Cisco Systems Inc. routers, includingserial-line utilization, bidirectional analysis of congestion at theLAN/router interface, and interface-related signal-quality problems.   3DV handles everything, including installing proprietary data-collectionsoftware on a Microsoft Windows NT-based PC running on an Intel Corp. 486.The software, which supports distributed polling, queries routers 24 hoursa day and converts raw data into trended reports in weekly or year-to-dateformat.   Currently, 3DV's performance-analysis reports are restricted to MIB(Management Information Base) II objects and variables stored in theprivate MIBs of Cisco routers. 3DV plans to expand its support to includeCabletron Systems Inc. hubs in the near future. Competitor INS supportsRMON (remote monitoring) and Cisco private MIB objects, as well as BayNetworks Inc., 3Com Corp., and Chipcom Corp. devices and MIB II and Ciscorouters.   The dramatic growth of startup out-taskers hasn't been overlooked bymainstream IS consultancies, which are busy developing out-tasking servicesof their own.   ``While we are capable of full-service outsourcing, most of the serviceswe offer today are out-task,'' said Dennis Duyme, director of programmanagement for enterprise-network management at Bell Atlantic NetworkIntegration Services in Frazer, Pa. Unlike 3DV or INS, Bell Atlantic'sservice supports performance analysis through an active in-band connectionto the customer's site.Slashing Monitoring Costs   Bell Atlantic compiles baseline-performance information and providestrend-analysis reports on selected devices, the 10 busiest devices bymonth, router ports, and router-interface error profiles. According toDuyme, his company can provide fault and performance monitoring for just 40percent of what it would cost customers to do it themselves.   Administration isn't the only cost that can be pared by out-tasking. TheBBN Systems and Technologies Division of Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. inCambridge, Mass., claims its analysis of networks can save customers frombuying too much bandwidth.   Using an internally developed tool called StatsWise, BBN staffersanalyze the health, capacity, and traffic levels of a customer's network.The service is targeted at companies that have tried to resolve performanceproblems by buying more band-width but haven't seen the expectedimprovement, according to Pete Nelson, director of marketing for BBN'sEnterprise Management Group. ``We're able to use StatsWise to gatherdetailed information about how the network is actually behaving overtime,'' Nelson said. ``Then, we can make recommendations for reconfiguringthe network based upon this information. Some customers request baseliningannually, but most want it on a monthly or quarterly basis.''   Automated backup is another network-management function that's a goodcandidate for out-tasking. Rimage Corp. in Minneapolis, a provider offloppy disk-replication services, has launched a rapidly growing backupservice called Televaulting that automatically backs up network fileservers to an offsite location. For charges that the company says typicallyrun from $250 to $350 per month, Rimage installs an agent on a nondedicatednode at the customer's site. At a prescheduled time, the agent logs in toeach server and backs up the data via an ISDN connection to a regionalRimage site. File encryption helps ensure security while in transmissionand at Rimage as well.   A typical departmental server with 2GB of data takes less than an hourto back up, said Keith Stacy, general manager of the Televaulting service.``After encryption and compression, the amount that is actually transferredis usually between 1 [percent] to 2 percent of the client data files[because] only incremental changes are transferred during a typical backupsession.'' Customers can request full backup periodically for archivalpurposes, usually on a quarterly basis.   Although most customers are initially interested in Televaulting fordisaster-recovery purposes, many end up using it to supplement or evenreplace their daily tape-backup processes. Televaulting stores itscustomers' data in optical-jukebox storage systems, allowing for rapidrecovery in the event of data loss at the customer's site. The base fee forTelevaulting is $150 per agent per month, with small incremental fees forthe number of megabytes transferred. For a 100-user network, typicalbilling fees run about $250 to $350 per month.Can You Really Trust an Outsider?   Although the concept of out-tasking is permeating the network-managementcommunity, network administrators still question the wisdom of a thirdparty handling even well-defined areas of network maintenance, operations,and planning. Many organizations retain highly competenttechnical-operations and support staff, capable of writing scripts andevaluating performance.   Ultimately, the tab for managing a network is not only the salaries ofthe support staff but also the cost of opportunities missed when resourcesare unavailable. It's important to ask yourself whether you want your bestpeople counting computers and answering phones. Out-tasking, when used aspart of a focused systems-management effort, can free talented computerprofessionals to pursue loftier goals.Illustration(s):Table: Cost Justifying Out-Tasking (This table is not availableelectronically.

It's as if information networks have reached somecritical point of evolution and are starting to take over their humanmasters, like the cyborgs in ``The Terminator.''   LAN managers have never had to cope with such fast-paced change.   ``I've been in this business for 12 years, and I've never seen a timewhen things were moving as rapidly as they are now,'' said Greg Scott,information-services manager for Oregon State University's College ofBusiness in Corvallis.   A lot of different elements--robust client platforms, symmetricmultiprocessing, distributed databases, directory services, fasternetworks, telephony, new WAN services, maturing middleware, and betterdevelopment tools--are all converging in the PC LAN space. The scope andcomplexity of what LAN managers have to deal with has increasedsignificantly. Individuals who previously confined themselves to the bottomlayers of network computing now have to know what goes on in the upperlayers to understand the impact of client/ server applications on thenetwork.   ``It's getting very sticky,'' said Mark Brooks, a senior LAN specialistfor TIAA-CREF in New York. ``It's one thing to do [Network General Corp.]Sniffer-type trouble-shooting, but it's a whole different ball of wax whenyou're trying to diagnose problems in the upper layers. You have to getinvolved with client/server equipment, which traditionally was handled bythe programmer group.''A class of tools for trouble-shooting client/server applications isemerging, but it is plagued by a lack of standards and use of experimentaltechnology. The products are very expensive and difficult to use, and someradical improvement is needed before they can bail LAN managers out.   Meanwhile, client/server applications are creating some unusualproblems. ``You end up having strange, sporadic occurrences you can'tidentify, and everyone says, `It's not me,' '' said Brooks. LAN managershave to be able to make very fine-tuned changes to the servers or clientsor the infrastructure in between. And to do that, they need to grasp thewhole picture.   Life was a lot simpler when LAN managers just had to know Novell Inc.NetWare and how to get to the mainframe. But LAN managers who are still inthis mode are an endangered species threatened by an almost universal movetoward centralization and standardization. The autonomy that was thehallmark of the original PC LANs is falling victim to the need to achievesome economies of scale and make things easier to manage.   ``Our company is trying to find the right mix of centralization anddepartmental autonomy,'' said Bill Eckenrode, a senior network specialistat E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. in Wilmington, Del. ``The trend wasdecentralization for a long time, but in the last six to 12 months we'vemoved back to a more centralized philosophy. The company is trying to adoptan end-to-end service paradigm, getting everyone to be part of a largerwhole.''Not all LAN managers like to acknowledge this state of affairs. ``There isa reluctance to say the mainframe people were right--that we need to havemore centralization,'' said Brooks.Centralization Ups the Ante   Instead of having a lot of little database servers and point solutionsscattered among various divisions and departments, with multipleintermediary boxes between the database and the end station to accommodatea mix of protocols and operating systems, companies need to consolidatethem into a few bigger servers running enterprise solutions on standardplatforms.   Basic server administration and management, such as backup, externalcommunications, and security, can then be centralized. And applicationsdevelopment can be decentralized to provide some solutions flexibility.   Yes, putting more people on bigger servers can strain existing networkinfrastructures. But upgrading those infrastructures will be a lot cheaperin the long run than building up staffing in small, decentralized groups.   All this centralization increases the challenge--and associated risk--ofbeing a network professional. LAN managers who have been installing NetWarefor years suffer sticker shock when they see the price of a MicrosoftWindows NT-based server with dual Intel Corp. Pentium 100MHz processors,140MB of RAM, and a 20GB disk array. Some of these systems can costhundreds of thousands of dollars.Challenge From the Specialist   An even greater source of stress is the increasing importance of LANsand the applications and data they deliver. A few years ago they were aminor appendage to a company's information systems. Today they are theinformation system for a lot of businesses. Organizations are putting a lotof trust in a few individuals, expecting them to sort through all thecomplexity of network computing and keep things under control.   ``The stakes are higher these days--a little higher than many LANmanagers are comfortable dealing with,'' said Ken Kozikowski, informationcenter manager for T.J. Maxx in Framingham, Mass.   While the demands of client/server computing are broadening therequisite knowledge base of the LAN manager, other forces are pushing skilldevelopment in the opposite direction. Specialization tends to be abyproduct of centralization.   Departmental LAN managers had to be generalists, but centralizedorganizations can build up teams of specialists with deep knowledge incertain areas. But specialist status is a double-edged sword.   It's nice to have a skill that is in high demand right now, but goingdown the specialist path limits future options.   ``A lot of people are resistant to specialization,'' said SandraLieb-Geiger, technical-support supervisor for Andersen Consulting in SanFrancisco. ``You try to turn them into an expert, but they are concernedthat the need for expertise in that area might vanish overnight astechnology takes a sudden turn.''   Technology does take sudden turns, and the road is starting to fork,too, with the network infrastructure splitting off from network resources.LAN managers will have to decide which path to take.   ``On the Internet, resources and infrastructure are not the same thingand are not managed by the same people'' said Patrick Corrigan, managingdirector of The Corrigan Group in Portland, Ore. ``The same thing willhappen on corporate networks.''   Meanwhile, today's LAN managers have to be familiar with all thedifferent client and server environments, the applications, theinfrastructure, and the WAN links. With expanded responsibilities anddownsized staffs, they have less time to wade through more information.   ``I'm not an expert in the client/server area, but the peek I've hadbehind the curtain is very sobering,'' Scott said. ``You can suck up theinformation you need and march ahead or start thinking about a careerchange. I don't see much in between.''Relief in Sight?   Technology will come to the rescue eventually, as it has so many timesbefore. Developments such as true plug-and-play network components andmature directory services that have been integrated with E-mail and otherapplications will help enormously. Technology will be used to tametechnology. And, with time at such a premium, products that are easiest touse--not fastest or cheapest--will win.   Meanwhile, networks have to be managed and a combination of teamworkwith the right leadership is critical. One way to deal with thecontradictory needs for specialization and broad knowledge is informalcross-training. With this strategy, different groups of specialists cantake turns educating everyone else about a particular area of technology atmonthly staff meetings.   Above all, LAN managers need to keep the application of technology inperspective.   ``Your company is best served if you concentrate on interpreting itsbusiness needs and putting to use the infrastructure you already have inplace,'' Kozikowski said. Upgrade pressure differs from industry toindustry, but even the network professionals in IS-intensive businessesneed to filter out a lot of noise.   Outside of science fiction, technology won't really take over because itcan't sustain itself. But it will bury individuals who can't ignore all thehype about the latest and greatest and focus instead on the newdevelopments that must be mastered. The ability to make this distinction isthe single greatest skill that today's LAN managers can have.Illustration(s):Illustration: Graph: Trial by FireCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsTHE LAN MANAGER EVOLUTIONBy:Susan Breidenbach   A day in the life of the typical LAN manager is quite different todaythan it was when LAN Times was first published almost a dozen years ago.The job's scope and complexity have increased enormously along with theimportance of the LAN platform itself in the corporate IS hierarchy.   This trend is becoming even more marked as a number of keyelements--extremely robust client and server platforms, distributeddatabases, directory services, high-bandwidth networks, telephony, new WANservices, maturing middleware, and better development tools--all cometogether. Driven by these factors, the PC LAN is increasingly hostingmission-critical applications, not just connecting users to them.   As one of our Reader Advisory Board members said recently, LAN managerstoday are coping with ``a whole different ball of wax'' (see ``The ChangingRole of the LAN Manager,'' Page 48).   And as the LAN manager's role changes, so does the type of personfilling that role.   The original network and systems professionals were technoids who rarelyventured outside their own domain. Most lacked the people skills theyneeded when the PC revolution suddenly turned their users into computeroperators. But technology saved the day when better interfaces--menuingsystems and then GUIs--enabled the development of products that could beused by people who didn't know assembly language.   The new wave of network professionals included the pioneers whoinstalled and managed the first PC LANs in the early 1980s. They were aneclectic bunch--shoe salesmen, office managers, auto mechanics, and evenlawyers wanting to make an honest living--who bootstrapped their way up,learning as they went. And, of course, there's the LAN manager who was theperson sitting closest to the printer when the organization decided toinstall a network for sharing it. Anyway, they were looking for a newchallenge, or at least for a more accessible information system, and thisnascent technology looked promising.   Today, rookie LAN technicians tend to have a computer science or ISbackground, and in a way, that's unfortunate. They seem more apt to beinterested in technology for technology's sake rather than as a solution toa business problem. The shoe salesmen and office managers brought areal-world perspective to the job that may be missing now.   ``Today, we get computer-science types who learn how things operate atone point in time and think that knowledge will carry them for the next 20years,'' said Patrick Corrigan, managing director of The Corrigan Group inPortland, Ore. ``I think we'll see a lot less innovation and less abilityto see through vendor hype.''   This new generation of LAN managers may also have less ability to homein on the root of the problem during trouble-shooting. About 15 years ago,the dean of my university's engineering school lamented the effect thatcalculators were having on the mental-arithmetic skills of engineeringstudents. ``They are losing the ability to `guesstimate,' a skill that isvery important in the design and planning process,'' he said.   Similarly, while the original LAN managers learned networking throughhands-on experience, the new breed is more likely to be separated from thenetwork by textbook theory and layer upon layer of GUI interfaces and othertools. They lack the intuition that comes from years of direct contact withthe basic network technology that is so critical to diagnostics.   In these circumstances, one would expect technical wizards with gooddiagnostic skills to be at a premium. However, vendor claims aboutplug-and-play interoperability, management tools, and self-healing networksoften have nontechnical executives thinking that these skills are ofdecreasing value.   Today, some network administration tasks can indeed be automated, or atleast handled by a quasi-technical staff equipped with the right tools. Butthe ultimate responsibility for the network needs to rest in the hands ofpeople who have a real-world perspective and a complete understanding ofnetworking technology.   Some of the original LAN pioneers may, in fact, be out of their depth,but individuals always fall by the wayside as technology advances--eventhose with formal computer-science education. The old guard is a preciousresource that companies need to exploit to the fullest as they take theirnetworks into the 21st century.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsRAID 5 IS AN IDEAL SOLUTION FOR ENTRY-LEVEL STORAGEBy:Roger Cox   Today's network administrators are increasingly relying on RAIDsolutions to manage their storage. According to a survey conducted byPeripheral Concepts, a market-research company, RAID use has doubled overthe past two years.   It's no wonder why: The Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Peripheral Conceptsestimates that the hourly costs of downtime are reaching $20,000 an hourfor a Novell Inc. NetWare installation. There is no need to address thevirtues of fault-tolerant storage. Rather, I will focus on bringingattention to RAID 5, a superior solution for entry-level fault-tolerantstorage.5 Alive   RAID 5, defined as block-level data striping with distributed parityover a minimum of three drives, offers the best cost/performance fortransaction-oriented networks. In particular, a three-drive RAID 5 storagesolution offers several advantages over such two-drive solutions as NetWareembedded mirroring: superior storage scaleability, better performance,richer fault tolerance, and a lower overall price.   Superior scaleability. The storage requirements of network file serversare constantly evolving to meet the needs of workgroup expansion andapplication complexity. Therefore, the capability to add storageincrementally--as you need it--is key. With NetWare embedded mirroring, youmust add two drives when you need to increase your storage capacity. Or youcan replace your existing two drives with two new, larger-capacity drives.Either approach has serious cost implications.   With RAID 5, on the other hand, you only buy the capacity you need tomeet expanding storage requirements.   Increased performance. Local-area network administrators are constantlylooking for ways to increase performance. Today's top-performing fileservers require high performance I/O, which translates to faster SCSI diskdrives, faster spindle revolutions-per-minute read and write rates, andlower access times.   To determine the performance relationship of a two-driveNetWare-embedded mirroring configuration to a three-drive RAID 5configuration, Adaptec Inc. ran a series of standard tests in itsperformance-analysis lab. Using a three-drive RAID 5 configuration provedto be 28 percent faster than the two-drive NetWare embedded-mirroringconfiguration. Moreover, reconstructing a failed drive in the three-driveRAID 5 configuration was 60 percent faster than NetWare embedded mirroring.(Benchmark reports are available directly from Adaptec).   Far richer fault tolerance. In addition to providing better performance,increased partition capacity, and protection against data loss, a primemission of any fault-tolerant storage solution is to eliminate serverinterruption caused by a failed drive. By providing such capabilities ashot-spare, warm-swap, and hot-swap drive support, contemporary RAID 5adapters allow for real-time data recovery without having to restore anentire database.   Hot-spare drive support enables you to automatically reconstruct datawithout user intervention. Warm-swap drive support lets the user pauseactivity on the SCSI bus while you replace a failed drive. Hot-swap drivesupport lets you replace a failed drive without having to interrupt serveractivity. (When shopping for a RAID 5 solution, remember to keep in mindthat hot-swap drive support must be supported by the drive enclosure.)   Lower price. Recent reductions in the cost of storage peripherals andadapters have made RAID 5 a viable and popular alternative to NetWareembedded mirroring. As network storage requirements increase and storagecapacity must be added, the cost advantage of RAID 5 becomes veryfavorable. With RAID 5, you purchase additional drives one at a time. Thisadvantage is important for two reasons: First, you minimize your storageexpansion cost, and second, because the cost per megabyte of storage isconstantly falling, every megabyte of disk storage you can put off buyinguntil the future will cost less.   RAID 5 is an essential, cost-effective solution for today'sbusiness-critical networks. When evaluating your storage needs, it isimportant to consider cost, price/performance, scaleability, and the typeof fault-tolerant storage requirements needed to support your networkusers.About the Author(s):Roger Cox is the manager of array marketing at Adaptec.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsTHE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOBNow that you've told us what you want in a network-management package, theLAN Times Testing Center shows you where to find itBy:Reggie Lisle   Not long ago, a crescent wrench, a socket set, and a Saturday afternoonwere about all you needed to work on the family wagon. But now that itseems you need specialized gear just to change the oil, your trusty toolboxisn't the help it used to be. It's the same with network management.Veteran administrators remember the days when management tools could fit ona few floppy disks. Now, the utilities that ship with a NOS, although finefor certain tasks, won't take you very far. It won't be long before you'researching in vain for the right tool for the job.   If you're looking to add to your tool chest, there are a number ofoptions, and the LAN Times Testing Center takes a look at four leadingnetwork-administration suites in this issue. In some cases, we had to lookat a company's entire product line because of the modular approach of theirutilities. We evaluated Seagate Enterprise Management Software's SeagateFrye Utilities for Networks, Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Management Suite 2.01,McAfee Associates Inc.'s Saber LAN Workstation 5.5, and Symantec Corp.'sNorton Network Series 2.0.   (Because of recent acquisitions, both the Seagate and McAfee productlines are in transition. Seagate Enterprise Management Software, a divisionof Seagate Technology Inc., is a joining of Frye Computer Systems Inc.,NetLabs Inc., and Network Computing Inc. Most of the modules reviewed inthis comparison were formerly part of Frye's management suite. McAfee,meanwhile, plans to rename its network-management strategy McAfee SystemsManagement sometime this year. For the sake of clarity, we will refer toSeagate's product line as Seagate Frye Utilities and McAfee's product lineas Saber LAN Workstation throughout the comparison.)The products we tested deal with both desktop and LAN management, but wechose to lump all of them under the moniker network administration. Afterall, it is becoming more difficult to determine where the desktop ends andthe network begins.Your Call   To find out which management features were most important to you, weconducted a phone survey of some LAN Times readers. This survey wasconducted by the Testing Center independently of the larger study referredto elsewhere in this issue, but the results were similar. We asked networkmanagers what tasks were crucial for administering their networks and whatkinds of utilities they needed that don't ship with their network software.The three most important tasks were asset management, license metering, andsoftware distribution; server monitoring and suite integration were deemedslightly less important. These five tasks, along with a miscellaneousclassification that includes remote-control and anti-virus capabilities,were the criteria on which we based our testing.How Not to Make a Network Quilt   End-to-end management of a network is like a bad patchwork quilt:Components from different vendors are roughly stitched together--and theseams don't always hold. Corporate networks usually boast severalgenerations of PCs, and they grow haphazardly rather than according to anoverall strategy. Some companies have three different support staffs justto keep their patchwork running: One to manage the wiring and phonesystems, one to administer the servers, and one to take care of userrequests. Vendors, the consummate promisers, continue to claim that as soonas some standard becomes well-established, this network quilt willtransform itself into something resembling your grandmother's afghan withits smoothly interlocking pieces. Still, no single tool has emerged thatcan handle an entire enterprise. Even large systems-management packagessuch as Hewlett-Packard Co. HP OpenView or IBM NetView still requiredifferent consoles and management utilities to fully control the network.Boon or Bane?   Standards can serve as stumbling blocks or as an impetus to neededchange. One promising standard, SNMP, provides control over compliantdevices such as hubs, routers, and UPSes (uninterruptible power supplies).However, SNMP's coverage is spotty, and its implementation can be a bitconfusing.   The Desktop Management Interface (DMI) specification, developed by agroup of vendors spearheaded by Intel Corp. and called the DesktopManagement Task Force (DMTF), also holds promise. However, of the productswe tested, only Intel's LANDesk adheres to the DMI. The DMI specificationwas published about three years ago and is a potentially elegant solutionto the expensive problem of managing desktop PCs and other network devices.It was designed as a way to gather meaningful information from thethousands of desktops scattered across corporate LANs and WANs.   Unfortunately, it lacked a vital component: a way to pass collected dataacross the network. With the recent announcement of the Remote DesktopManagement Interface (RDMI), however, that problem will soon be solved.Vendors predict they will begin adhering to the RDMI standard within 12 to18 months. Of course, we've heard promises before.   DMI-enabled applications may still conquer the desktop, but thespecification's fate will likely be decided by Microsoft Corp. The softwaregiant is wavering in its support of DMI--perhaps until it can come out withsomething more in its favor. Naturally, the company with the biggest say inwhat happens to the desktop can afford to watch from the sidelines for awhile. Microsoft Windows 95, for instance, has some desktop-managementfeatures built in, but it is not yet DMI-compliant.   We recommend that you continue to use your currentsystems-administration tools to manage an imminent Windows 95 rollout. Ofthe vendors in this comparison, only Symantec has released products thatare Windows 95 and 32-bit certified: Norton Utilities for Networks, NortonAnti-Virus, and Norton pcANYWHERE. Within six months, expect the release ofadditional Symantec products and offerings from the other vendors that takeadvantage of Windows 95's management hooks. If you plan to stick withWindows 3.x for a while, these four products currently shipping, althoughfar from perfect, should help you get a better handle on your network.About the Author(s):All of the articles in this comparison were written by LAN Times AssociateReviews Editor Reggie Lisle.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY   For this special issue of LAN Times, the Testing Center takes a look atfour leading network-administration packages: Seagate Enterprise ManagementSoftware's Seagate Frye Utilities for Networks, Intel Corp.'s LANDeskManagement Suite 2.01, McAfee Associates Inc.'s Saber LAN Workstation 5.5,and Symantec Corp.'s Norton Network Series 2.0. Our evaluation was based oncriteria deemed most important by a sample of LAN Times readers: assetmanagement, license metering, software distribution, server monitoring, andsuite integration. We added a miscellaneous criterion for capabilities thatdid not fit neatly into the other five categories. Three of these fourcompanies offer a collection of multiple products (or modules) to meetthese management needs, with varying degrees of communication between theparts. Intel was the only company that offered a tightly integratedsolution.   Although Seagate Frye Utilities for Networks is a modular suite, thecompany has put a lot of effort into integration. In addition to thesuite's common management console, many of the modules can share data. Wegave the product high marks for server monitoring but only an average scorefor the license-metering utility.   LANDesk was the best overall network-management solution; it won thecomparison and just missed getting a Best of Times award. LANDesk nowsupports NDS (NetWare Directory Services), and we liked its servermonitoring and software distribution. However, we wish we could haveexported data from the inventory utility to the license-metering module.   After the company's acquisition of Saber Software Corp. last fall,McAfee's network-administration tools are in a period of transition.Although all the modules scored well, we wish integration was a littlestronger.   Symantec has put a lot of effort into the Norton Network Series, whichencompasses a range of top-of-the-line products. We especially liked theasset-management module in Norton Administrator for Networks.Unfortunately, the package lacked a server-monitoring tool, whichdramatically affected its overall score. With an adequate server-monitoringfeature, Norton Network Series could have scored as high as any of theother products in the comparison.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsWHAT WILL ALL THAT DEALING MEAN?   Mergers and acquisitions among companies that produce network-managementsoftware have been fast and furious in the past six months. If you've triedto keep track, you may have found it simpler to count the companies notinvolved in some sort of maneuvering. Indeed, all of the software makers inthis comparison, except for Intel Corp., have recently made changes totheir product lines due in part to changes in their corporate composition.   By purchasing Frye Computer Systems Inc. last August, Seagate TechnologyInc. acquired the popular Frye Utilities, distributed now by Seagate'sEnterprise Management Software division. In the longer term, Seagate isdeveloping an end-to-end network- and systems-management package that willintegrate the Frye Utilities with technologies and products from otheracquisitions such as Arcada Software Inc. and Palindrome Corp.   Seagate is aiming to produce management and backup tools for Novell Inc.NetWare, Microsoft Windows NT, and Unix platforms, as well as developing a32-bit version of Frye Utilities. This edition will take advantage of theWindows 95 architecture and should be available by the middle of thisyear.   McAfee Associates Inc., which recently purchased Saber Software Corp.,has an ambitious plan to create a series of enterprise-management productsfor NetWare and Windows NT, called McAfee Systems Management. Although thestrategy is not surprising, the speed at which the company hopes to meetthese goals is. This year, McAfee plans to release 13 major products thatrun on Windows 95, are SNMP-compliant, have TCP/IP support, share a commonOLE management console and scripting language, and are scaleable.   Symantec Corp. recently finalized its purchase of Delrina Corp., whichfollowed a long line of acquisitions. Symantec was one of the first vendorsto offer 32-bit programs for Windows 95, such as its Norton Utilities, andthe company will be releasing most of its product line for Windows 95sometime this year.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsNOT READY TO RUMBLE   Some people view Novell Inc.'s ManageWise and Microsoft Corp.'s SystemsManagement Server as two heavyweights trading blows in thenetwork-management arena. Unfortunately, they're more like fighters whonever face each other in the ring because they work for differentpromoters.   The LAN Times Testing Center has received numerous requests to comparethe two products, but so far there hasn't been much to compare. There are afew similarities: Both Systems Management Server (SMS) and the LANDeskportion of ManageWise perform software distribution, for instance. But thedifferences far outweigh the similarities.   A very powerful package with many wide-area capabilities, ManageWise 2.0combines Novell's LANalyzer 1.0 and NMS (NetWare Management System) 2.0with Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Manager 1.51. It is designed for multiserverNetWare environments in which the need to control non-PC, SNMP-compatibledevices such as routers, hubs, and UPSes (uninterruptible power supplies)is critical. ManageWise's strength is its openness, and Novell encouragesindependent software vendors (ISVs) to write software that takes advantageof its services. In fact, Novell offers a 120-page list of compatibleproducts.   Systems Management Server 1.1 runs on Microsoft Windows NT and is partof the Microsoft BackOffice suite. It also requires Microsoft SQL Server,another component of BackOffice. SMS offers robust remote-control andtraffic-monitoring capabilities, as well as an excellentsoftware-distribution utility with an integrated inventory database. Itsstrengths are an easy-to-use GUI and good integration of the differentfeatures. Microsoft also encourages ISVs to write software that takesadvantage of SMS' services.   The bottom line? We will compare the two products only when ManageWisecan manage Windows NT or SMS can manage NetWare. Until then, neither canlegitimately claim the championship belt.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsNETWORK-ADMINISTRATION SUITES FEATURES CHARTIllustration(s):Table: NETWORK-ADMINISTRATION SUITES FEATURES CHART (This table is notavailble electronically. Please see January 8, 1995 issue.)Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsSURVEY OF READERS DETERMINES CRITERIA   Although the feature sets of the four product lines overlap in severalareas, each network-management package has certain capabilities that theothers do not. Because we wanted an apples-to-apples comparison, wetelephoned a number of LAN Times readers to determine the areas theyconsidered most significant when evaluating a network-administrationproduct. In order of importance, they were asset management, licensemetering, software distribution, server monitoring, and integration. Amiscellaneous category was created as a catchall for features we thoughtworthy of mention but that did not fit neatly in our test criteria.   We used three servers and 12 workstations to perform our testing. ACompaq Computer Corp. ProSignia 486/66 with 32MB of RAM ran Novell Inc.NetWare 3.12; a Hewlett-Packard Co. NetServer LM 486/66 with 24MB of RAMand the latest copy of Microsoft Corp.'s File and Print Services forNetWare ran Microsoft Windows NT 3.51; and an HP Vectra 486/33 with 24MB ofRAM ran NetWare 4.1. We used 12 HP Vectra 486/33s with 8MB of RAM for theclients: Three ran Microsoft DOS 6.22, eight ran Windows 3.1, and one (with16MB of RAM) ran Windows 95. Although 32-bit editions of these programswill not be released until later this year, the 16-bit versions operated onthe Microsoft Windows 95 workstation without any obvious problems.   We installed each suite or group of products on the NetWare 4.1 serverand then on the NetWare 3.12 server. Those products that supported WindowsNT were installed on the NT server. They were then evaluated according tothe following criteria.Management Material   The LAN Times readers we surveyed deemed asset management, licensemetering, and software distribution the most important capabilities in anadministration tool, and we gave these criteria higher weighting in ourscoring. The main goal of asset management is simple: Find out whathardware and software exist on your enterprise. Thus, we looked for thecapability to detect resources on both servers and workstations.   We also wanted to see whether workstation audits were performed by loginscript or batch file. We checked for Desktop Management Interface (DMI)compliance by using various Management Information Formats (MIFs). Forlicense metering, we checked to see if the packages supported network andlocal drives, multiple servers, applications suites, and remote checkout.   To test software distribution, we performed a standard battery of tests,including installing the Microsoft Office suite in a number of ways. First,we loaded the suite from the workstation running each product's managementconsole, then from a local server on the same segment as the workstations,and finally from a remote server across a router.   We weighted server monitoring and product integration slightly lowerthan the first three criteria. Even though there are hundreds of possibleserver statistics, we looked for the most common and useful ones, such ascurrent connections, disk and volume information, and memory utilization.For integration, we looked specifically at links between theasset-management and software-metering modules, as well as how theyintegrated with a common management console. And as previously mentioned,we added a miscellaneous category for unique features that did not fit theother criteria.   Finally, we kept useability in mind throughout the testing process,although it didn't get its own criterion. All of these products aresupposed to make the administrator's job easier. If a tool's learning curveis too high, then you may not be getting your money's worth.

Without a good asset-management strategy, importantquestions such as ``Are we using all the software we've bought over thepast year?'' and ``What hardware do we have, and where is it?'' cannot bereadily answered. Utilities that perform hardware and software inventoriesare not a panacea, but they are an immense help in tracking what's on theLAN.   As we tested the inventorying functions of the four products, werepeatedly encountered a particular error. Although the utilities werecapable of finding everything on our test network, they often made mistakesin reporting the processor speed of some machines. Everything else workedwell, however, and we gave good marks across the board--with SymantecCorp.'s tool receiving the highest score.Seagate Frye Utilities   LAN Directory (LAND) is the Seagate module that performs hardware andsoftware inventories. This utility was very easy to install, and we wereinventorying workstations in short order. LAND correctly identified all ourworkstations and the applications loaded on them thanks to its built-inlist of 6,000 software titles. In addition to its basic capabilities, LANDcan track inventory history and noncomputer equipment.   Although LAND makes it easy to scan individual user records, the syntaxof its report writer is not easy to understand. If you need moreinformation than the two dozen canned reports provide, you will be betteroff modifying one of the samples rather than creating a new one fromscratch.   WinLAND is the recently released edition of LAND for Windows 3.1. Itships with a version of the Watcom International Corp. Watcom SQL database,which enables more ad hoc queries to be performed from a third-partyprogram.LANDesk   Intel Corp.'s LANDesk is tied tightly to Novell Inc. NetWare. Itshardware and software inventory functions are placed in a NetWare loginscript and can be set to execute every time a user logs in to the server orat other predefined intervals. You can also set up the server tocontinuously scan for new software. Viewing inventory information is easy.A number of canned reports are available, or you can customize them withuser-defineable data such as serial numbers and installation date.   Because of its close ties to Novell's NMS (NetWare Management System),LANDesk can inventory SNMP-capable devices. Discovered workstations anddevices are managed by a utility similar to the Microsoft Windows FileManager. Individual workstations can be identified by a unique name, thehardware address of the network card, or the last user to log in at thatstation. LANDesk was the only Desktop Management Interface (DMI)-compliantproduct that we tested.Saber LAN Workstation   Although Saber Software Corp.'s Saber LAN Workstation (SLW) 5.0 had anadequate inventory tool, it was considered weak compared with McAfeeAssociates Inc.'s LAN Inventory, a part of BrightWorks 2.1. McAfee'sacquisition of Saber has left the asset-management part of SLW 5.0 out inthe cold for now. In SLW 5.5, most of the old BrightWorks utilities havereplaced Saber's tools.   LAN Inventory is demanding; it needs seven NLMs on the file server and aTSR on each workstation. (The TSR is a Btrieve Technology Inc. Btrieverequester that will no longer be needed when McAfee converts to a MicrosoftFoxPro database scheme.) We thought the product performed an adequate, butnot stellar, job of gathering inventory information from our workstations.BrightWorks currently supports Compaq Computer Corp.'s IntelligentManageability firmware, which is very similar to the DMI specification.Norton Network Series   With its built-in list of thousands of software packages, Symantec'sNorton Administrator for Networks (NAN) 2.0 accurately identified theapplications on our test system, but if an application you use is not onthe list, you can add it. And it took just a few mouse clicks to generate acomprehensive report about our workstations.   Starting with a scan of the system BIOS, NAN delivers a level of detailin its hardware inventory matched only by Frye's LAN Directory. Both DOSand Windows versions are available, although the Windows version providesmore information about Windows drivers and statistics. Last but not least,NAN lets an administrator run the inventory program from a floppy disk on astandalone computer and then merge collected data into the master databasewhen convenient.Illustration(s):Screen: LAN Directory, the inventory module of Seagate EnterpriseManagement Software's Seagate Frye Utilities, makes it easy to select alist of hardware to search for.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsNOT JUST FOR METERING ANYMORE   Application license metering isn't the hot new technology it was severalyears ago. Now, it's almost a necessity. Increased vigilance by theSoftware Publishers Association and the Business Software Alliance has senta stern message to pirates: Comply or else. However, savvy managers havefound an additional benefit to the tools they first used to getlegal--allocating and managing existing licenses to reduce the number ofnew licenses they are forced to buy.   Last summer, we reviewed eight metering tools, including the four thatare part of the network-management packages in this comparison (see``Software-Metering Tools,'' July 3, 1995, Page 65, and ``Another Look atSoftware-Metering Tools,'' July 24, 1995, Page 101). Then, as now, we weremore interested in license management than in simple license metering.McAfee Associates Inc.'s SiteMeter earned a Best of Times last summer, andit received the top score in this comparison.Seagate Frye Utilities   Software Metering And Resource Tracking (SMART) is Seagate'slicense-metering module. A Microsoft Windows version isn't available, butthe DOS interface is fairly easy to use. SMART is an NLM-based product anduses a TSR to monitor clients. It can monitor single-user, concurrent, andsuite licenses on both local and network drives. SMART identifies files tometer only by filename or path information; it can't use other identifierssuch as file size and date.   When license limits are reached, SMART can passively monitor thesituation, keeping a log for the administrator, or it can actively preventapplications from being used until a license is available. Overall, ifyou're looking for an effective metering tool and don't need to managelicenses, then SMART deserves a closer look.LANDesk   Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Management Suite offers an NLM-based meteringsolution that provides a good way to manage licenses across multipleservers. Several NLMs access the metering database, transfer access andmetering information between workstations and servers, and scan for fileopens and closes.   In a typical multiserver environment, a management server contains theprimary metering databases and a relay server stores copies ofapplications. When a user loads a metered application, only eight packetspass among the workstation, relay server, and management server. Thisreduces the amount of interserver chatter so effectively that LANDesk canoperate adequately over a 56KB per second WAN link. LANDesk uses pathinformation to identify executeable files (including applications suites)on Novell Inc. NetWare file servers, but it can't monitor local hard drivesor servers based on other platforms.Saber LAN Workstation   The license-metering product for the previous version of Saber LANWorkstation was known as Saber Enterprise Application Manager (SEAM). AfterMcAfee's acquisition of Saber, however, SEAM has been scrapped in favor ofMcAfee's own SiteMeter 5.1, which McAfee acquired when it purchasedBrightwork Development Inc.   As an NLM-based product, SiteMeter requires NetWare 3.1 or higher. Ittracks applications by monitoring file opens and closes on the server. Italso offers TCP/IP support with license load balancing, which reduces WANtraffic by allowing SiteMeter to automatically migrate licenses to theserver from which they are most commonly requested. Unlike most otherNLM-based metering products, SiteMeter doesn't ship with a TSR formonitoring local hard drives, an option we think most administrators wouldprefer to have.   An administrator can gather license statistics--in real time or over aspecified period--on all metered servers on the internetwork. SeagateTechnology Inc.'s Crystal Reports Microsoft Windows-based software isincluded with SiteMeter for generating reports.   Installation is easy, but you will need to have the latest versions ofCLIB.NLM and BTRIEVE.NLM on your file server. Once you configure one fileserver with license and permission information, you can use thelicense-replication feature to copy the information to other servers, whichis a real time-saver.Norton Network Series   Norton Administrator for Networks (NAN) includes the software-meteringportion of the Norton Network Series. It is a client-based product thatuses DOS and Windows TSRs (Symantec Corp. calls them Agents) along with anadministrative program to monitor and enforce license limits. The productcan meter concurrent, server, and site licenses on network and localdrives.   Installation can be time-consuming because an Agent must be running oneach workstation to be monitored. However, NAN's software-distributionfeature can be used to ease this chore, loading the Agents when users login to the network.   Because NAN links its asset-management and metering pieces, it is easyto create a list of the applications on your network to be monitored. Inaddition, NAN includes over 5,000 predefined applications; if a program isnot on the list, you can add a description to the database. Our onecomplaint in this regard was that the list of metered applications must bemanually copied to other servers. However, data from all of the servers canbe combined into a single report.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsLET THE SUITE DO THE WALKING   Visiting every workstation on the network to install the latest softwareupgrade is one of the most tedious, time-consuming jobs a manager isresponsible for. That's why software distribution over the LAN is one ofthe best ideas ever developed for network administration. Intel Corp.'sLANDesk won this portion of our comparison, with its innovative, yeteasy-to-use, tool.Seagate Frye Utilities   Seagate's software-distribution module is called Software Update andDistribution System (SUDS), and we liked it almost as much as LANDesk'stool. Some of the common tasks that can be performed are searching andreplacing in text files, finding duplicate files on workstations, anduninstalling packages. It also has a scheduler that lets file distributionbe run after business hours. This feature requires that a TSR run on thetarget workstation.   Seagate offers single-server, server-to-server, and WAN versions ofSUDS. The server-to-server option is useful for updating NLMs and otherfiles between servers. This feature is similar to Symantec Corp.'s NortonAdministrator for Networks' Site Manager utility, but it can also scheduleand execute console commands that load and unload NLMs on the targetserver. The wide-area option lets an administrator distribute jobs to otherSUDS servers on the WAN. A single copy is sent across the link; thereceiving SUDS server distributes copies to its workstations. This reducesWAN traffic and is great for slower (dial-up or 56Kbps) connections.LANDesk   Intel's software-distribution solution is the easiest we encountered, atleast for networks with standardized workstations. LANDesk uses amanagement agent on a reference workstation to track changes to thatclient's installed software. When it's time for an upgrade, LANDesk applieschanges made at the reference workstation to all clients on the LAN. Mostother software-distribution packages use server-based rules to upgradesoftware.   There are drawbacks to LANDesk's method, however. If software needs tobe uninstalled, LANDesk will restore .INI files to the state they were inbefore installation. On the surface this seems good, but it could causeproblems if something else has been installed since the last LANDeskdistribution job.   There are several ways to choose recipients of a distribution job. Youcould query the hardware-inventory database and then specify only themachines with a certain minimum configuration.   Like the other packages in this comparison, a job can be performed evenif users have logged off, although their network drivers must still beloaded. And like SUDS, LANDesk is able to work efficiently over the WAN.Each local server is responsible for distributing software to itsworkstations.Saber LAN Workstation   The program that handles software distribution for McAfee AssociatesInc.'s Saber LAN Workstation (SLW) 5.5 was formerly known as SiteExpress3.0 when it was part of the BrightWorks package. Like most of McAfee'scurrent product line, this program is targeted at Novell Inc. NetWare 3.xand 4.x networks with DOS and Microsoft Windows workstations. It performsstandard distribution jobs well, and workstation distribution can bescheduled to occur at login or logout. The product relies heavily on aMicrosoft Visual Basic-like scripting language that administrators may notwant to take the time to learn, although it is powerful and relatively easyto use.   The SLW 5.5 utility supports TCP/IP, which lets administratorsdistribute software to remote IP servers that are not part of the local IPXnetwork. And thanks to NDS (NetWare Directory Services) support, softwarecan be distributed to NDS tree objects. In our testing, we created an NDSuser object on our NetWare 4.1 server and used this tool to send a simpledistribution job.   Because distribution jobs usually create a high amount of networktraffic, the SLW 5.5 utility can compress the files it moves. However, wedidn't notice much of a difference on our relatively small test network. Onmuch larger distribution jobs, compression could make a substantialdifference.Norton Network Series   Norton Administrator for Networks (NAN) delivers a decent implementationof software distribution. Although creating distribution jobs is harderthan it is with the other packages in this comparison, the distributionphase is the fastest and most trouble-free of the quartet.   Like SLW 5.5, NAN relies heavily on a scripting language, in this caseSymantec's version of BASIC, and the company has included a number ofsample scripts. NAN can even record keystrokes for fast customization ofjobs. If you use the scripts provided, you should not expect any problems.   We experienced difficulties, however, when we tried to create customscripts without consulting the manual. Fairly complex jobs can be createdif you're willing to spend the time, but the process isn't easy. We alsothink it's wise to test any procedure before scheduling a job on thenetwork.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsPREVENTIVE ADMINISTRATION   Most servers are either tucked away in some nook or cranny or secretedin closets and locked rooms. Unfortunately, this arrangement promotes anout-of-sight, out-of-mind attitude. When a server exhibits a problem, thefirst sign an administrator often has is a slew of phone calls from franticusers. With the server-monitoring feature of a network-management package,however, an administrator can monitor a server's health, often heading offproblems before they occur.Seagate Frye Utilities   Seagate has a number of packages for server monitoring. Taken as awhole, this set tops even Intel Corp.'s LANDesk. Unfortunately, by havingto buy separate products, you'll pay a quite bit more for the combinedfunctionality than you will for the other suites in this comparison.   Network Management for NetWare is a DOS-based module that can take theplace of native Novell Inc. NetWare utilities such as SYSCON, PCONSOLE,FCONSOLE, and FILER. If you spend a lot of time switching between theseutilities, Network Management for NetWare is well worth the cost. We usedit to add and delete users, set up print queues, monitor user connections,and identify old NETX.EXE shell versions.   Early Warning System for NetWare is an NLM-based module that monitorsserver events and can respond in a number of customizeable ways. EarlyWarning System can alert administrators via pager, fax, or E-mail ofcritical problems, or it can run an automated procedure for less crucialevents. This module integrates with Seagate's license-metering module toalert administrators when a license limit has been exceeded.   Console Commander for NetWare is essentially a scheduler that executesscripts at a predetermined time. We used it to unload and load a series ofNLMs on our NetWare servers. It is a capable, but bare-bones, utility.LANDesk   Intel's offering has some very comprehensive server-monitoringfunctions, and its object-tree structure makes operation easy. When youselect a server object from the tree, a list of applicable managementoptions appear. Intel has added over 100 new monitoring parameters to thisversion of LANDesk. Again, they are presented as a collapsible tree thatmakes it easy to view information and set alarm thresholds.   The new alert manager, Alert Management System, can receive alerts fromthe other LANDesk modules. It also lets you execute predefined tasks inresponse to an alert, similar to Frye's NEWS. Network administrators can benotified via E-mail or pager.   LANDesk includes a substitute for Novell's RCONSOLE.NLM to remotelycontrol the server's console screen from a workstation. The differencebetween them is RCONSOLE uses a text password stored on the server, butLANDesk encrypts the password.SLW   The Saber LAN Workstation line from McAfee Associates Inc. has some goodserver-monitoring tools from Brightwork Development Inc. These utilitieswill be upgraded and repackaged into the Server Manager, which should beavailable by the middle of the year. Because we don't know exactly whatServer Manager will look like, we evaluated HawkNet Inc.'s NetTune Pro, autility bundled with BrightWorks.   NetTune can monitor nearly all of NetWare's configureable settings. Italso can determine if current settings are causing problems and can suggesta solution, which it can institute automatically. However, NetTune doesn'tprovide any network traffic statistics like Frye's or Intel's products do.Norton Network Series   The Norton Network Series does not offer any server-monitoring featuresas we define them, which really hurt its final score. If Symantec Corp.adds some server-monitoring capabilities, the Norton Network Series,already an excellent all-around package, might surpass even Intel's LANDesksuite.Illustration(s):Screen: Formerly known as SiteExpress, the software-distribution piece ofSaber LAN Workstation uses scripts to handle jobs.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsPUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER   Three of the product lines we looked at--Seagate Enterprise ManagementSoftware's Seagate Frye Utilities for Networks, McAfee Associates Inc.'sSaber LAN Workstation, and Symantec Corp.'s Norton Network Series--areloosely integrated sets of modules with a common management console.Applications are loaded from the console as needed by the administrator.Although these products started as standalone tools, their developers havemade impressive strides toward tying them together. The module approachworks well because you can add management tools as your network grows.   Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Management Suite 2.01, on the other hand, is atightly integrated one-stop package. Communications between theasset-management and network-monitoring portions are excellent, forinstance. LANDesk would have easily won this portion of the comparison ifits software-inventory and -metering functions had been linked.Seagate Frye Utilities   Seagate's modular approach made installation a little tiring; wecouldn't help but wonder if there were a better way after loading the ninthor 10th separate piece. We hope a CD-ROM installation will be availablesoon. After installation, however, we had very few complaints. All theprograms detected the presence of previously installed modules and pluggedthemselves in to the shared management console. Also, all of the moduleshave some data-sharing capabilities. For example, the inventory module, LANDirectory, shares its asset database with the software-distributionmodule.   Most of the modules can also make use of the scheduling capability ofnetwork-alert tools. We were also able to examine user connections loggedin to the server and then launch the inventory program to access moredetailed information.   Seagate has done a pretty good job of integrating its software. The nextbig hurdle for the company will be tying together software from all therest of its recent acquisitions.LANDesk   As previously mentioned, LANDesk is a tightly integrated package. Thenew version includes a centralized Alert Management System that can receivealerts from the other LANDesk modules. Also, if an alert is generated, apredefined task can be run in response. LANDesk has a terrific reportgenerator that all of the management tools can directly send informationto. On the downside, the software-metering module can't import informationfrom the inventory database, a glaring shortcoming, and something we'd liketo see remedied in the future.Saber LAN Workstation   Given the recent structural changes at McAfee, it's difficult to speakdefinitively about the integration of the company's product line.Communications between SiteExpress and SiteMeter were adequate, but otherintegration, specifically between SiteExpress and the desktop-menuingportion of Saber LAN Workstation (SLW), could have been better. Of course,these products are in transition and promise to be much more integrated inthe future (see ``What Will All That Dealing Mean?'' above).Norton Network Series   The latest version of Norton Administrator for Networks (NAN) has addedsome centralized features that make it very easy to gather information. NANuses a primary/secondary hierarchy in which the primary level consists ofservers and the secondary level consists of associated servers andworkstations. NAN's Site Manager receives information from the secondarysites and makes sure that the master databases on the primary servers areupdated. These databases can include inventory, distribution, and meteringdata.   A centralized database lets an administrator at a primary server accessinformation from across the network. This data can be exported to thereport generator or to an ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)-compliantapplication such as a document manager.   Although NAN offers strong integration, there are gaps in other productsin the Norton Network Series. Some, for instance, will install themselvesinto the common console but can't share databases. In particular, we'd liketo see better integration between the backup and inventory programs.Illustration(s):Screen: The asset- management part of the Norton Network Series lets systemadministrators customize the inventory database among many fields.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightLAN TIMES via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 13, IsHOW DO THEY DIFFER?   Although there are similarities in the feature sets of thesenetwork-management products, each has important capabilities that don't fitprecisely into the five criteria we've used to analyze them. Some companiesinclude unique features to differentiate their offerings from the crowd;others have strengths in related product classes that can add value totheir basic management tools. In a comparison with such a broad focus asnetwork management, we decided to include a miscellaneous category for justsuch extras, although we could not test all of the products mentionedhere.Seagate Frye Utilities   Seagate offers a number of valuable extras, including the Node Trackerand the Alert Interface Manager for NMS (NetWare Management System). NodeTracker can monitor workstation statistics such as IPX components andnetwork shell version number.   Node mapping, however, is its most important feature. Not to be confusedwith network-mapping utilities, such as Microsystems Engineering Co.'sSysDraw, which create a graphical representation of the devices on yournetwork, node mapping collects information on attached workstations as themachines log in. Because Node Tracker can share this information with LANDirectory, you could pull up a detailed hardware inventory for aworkstation broadcasting bad packets, for instance. This would makereplacing an ailing NIC much easier. Node Tracker can also share data withNMS.   The add-on Alert Interface Manager for NMS increases NMS' capability tosend alerts via pager, E-mail, or Novell Inc. NetWare console message whenNMS generates an alarm or event.LANDesk   In addition to its strong core functions, LANDesk includes severalmiscellaneous goodies, such as a limited version of Virus Protect, IntelCorp.'s anti-virus software. The LANDesk packet-analyzer software isanother extra. With it, an administrator can set up filters to monitor dataflow across the wire. In addition to simple packet decodes, LANDesk hasfilters that can monitor application traffic. This will let you track aspecific program's impact on your network performance, rooting out theusers and applications that are bandwidth hogs. LANDesk can also monitorSNMP devices and snap in to some major network-management consoles such asNovell ManageWise, Hewlett-Packard Co. HP OpenView, and Digital EquipmentCorp. ManageWorks.Saber LAN Workstation   McAfee Associates Inc.'s Saber LAN Workstation has an obvious bonus--theanti-virus software that made the company famous. The server editionsupports NetWare and Microsoft Windows NT, and the desktop version supportsDOS, IBM OS/2, Microsoft Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT. McAfeealso offers a remote-control package called NetRemote. The product handlesthe basics well but is not serious competition for Symantec Corp.'s NortonpcANYWHERE or Microcom Corp.'s Carbon Copy. We successfully used NetRemoteto dial in to a machine and perform minor tasks such as retrieving E-mail.   With its acquisition of Saber LAN Workstation, McAfee has also gained agreat set of tools for desktop and menu management, capabilities that farexceed typical software-distribution capabilities. For instance, thepackage provides excellent control of .INI, AUTOEXEC.BAT, and CONFIG.SYSfiles.

All of these products integrate with the NortonAdministrator for Networks console.   We like pcANYWHERE, the leading remote-control program, so much that wegave version 2.0 our Best of Times award last spring (see ``pcANYWHERELeads Remote-Software Race,'' April 24, 1995, Page 109). Easy integrationwith Norton Administrator for Networks is the icing on the cake.   AntiVirus for NetWare is an NLM-based product that scans for viruses onyour NetWare server. Utilities Administrator adds new life to the venerableNorton Utilities collection, including the capability to run the utilitiesfrom a centralized console. Desktop Administrator is similar to thedesktop-control portion of Saber LAN Workstation, and we especially likedthat not all users need be under its control. Finally, the powerful NortonEnterprise Backup offers a many-to-many backup solution.Illustration(s):Screen: Intel's LANDesk delivered the easiest software-distributionsolution that we encountered.

The utilities are easy to install, andmost of the modules use a DOS interface, although Seagate is working onMicrosoft Windows 95 versions of the software. The package offers a widerange of server- and desktop-management functions but lacks anti-virus andbackup utilities. We hope these holes will be filled by Seagate, whichrecently acquired the Frye Utilities. In fact, watch for Seagate to releasean end-to-end network-management solution in 1996 composed of Seagate FryeUtilities, backup utilities from Arcada Software Inc. and Palindrome Corp.,and Unix-management utilities that Seagate recently acquired.

This packagecombines the asset-management and license-metering capabilities of McAfee'sSiteExpress 3.0 and SiteMeter 5.1 with the desktop-configuration and-menuing capabilities of SLW 5.0. It also complements McAfee's BrightWorks,which has strong server-monitoring features. SLW is aimed primarily atNetWare networks and DOS and Windows workstations.

Now comes the really hard part--getting the money to buy it. Youknow it will save time, freeing you and your staff to do support work thatnow goes undone: reports that aren't run, equipment that isn't inventoried,and software that isn't upgraded. More than likely, however, conservingyour time isn't a high priority for upper-level management. When you pointto all your neglected tasks, your manager may not understand theirimportance. After all, you haven't been doing them, and things seem to beOK.   Indeed, one of the desktop-management packages we've reviewed may behelpful, even vital, to your department--but only if you can get it intoyour shop. Given their reluctance to spend money on anything that won'tshow a tangible economic benefit, how do you convince the powers-that-be togive you the money to buy one?   The answer is deceptively simple: Put a price on it. Determine how muchthe system really costs and how much it will really save, or earn, and thenfigure out if the difference is worth it. You'll get a lot more attentionwhen you present a purchase request in terms of the money it can save yourcompany rather than convenience and ease of use. Telling your boss that amanagement system will let you track inventory more easily is one thing;pointing out that a more accurate inventory will save your company $25,000a year is another.   Of course, the nitty-gritty of determining these figures requirestechnical expertise, business acumen, and creative thinking. Here are a fewpointers on how to translate benefits and costs into dollars and cents.It's a Wonderful Life   The first step to putting a price on the benefit of a management system,or any technology for that matter, is to take an objective look at lifewithout the product--past, present, and future. Ask yourself what recentprojects the management system could have streamlined and use theseexamples when dealing with management.   Next, ask yourself what won't get done, or done well, in the futurewithout the management system and determine how that will affect yourbusiness. For example, if you want to show how valuable softwaredistribution is, conduct a survey to find out how much time people spendconverting documents and macros between two versions of a word processorbecause you haven't had a chance to upgrade everyone's copy.   As another example, assume that you administer a 2,500-node network andhope to use the management system to create an accurate inventory ofdesktop computer equipment. First, spot check your records, then select afew dozen entries at random (about a 1 percent sampling rate) and checktheir accuracy. Do your current inventory records correctly describe yourdesktop systems? Suppose in this example that you find inaccurateinformation for four desktop systems, about a 17 percent error rate. Thefirst system was listed as being in service but was actually broken beyondrepair; the second was listed as being in its third year of service when itwas really in its sixth year; the third was missing a CD-ROM drive yourinventory claimed it had; and the fourth had 8MB more RAM than recorded.   Your friendly accounting department can help you determine what such anerror rate means in terms of money. An inaccurate inventory of fixed assetsaffects depreciation, casualty and theft losses, insurance coverage andclaims, and property tax. In our example, two computers should have beentaken off your books completely, and two computers had the wrong valuation.In addition, the company may be eligible for an insurance reimbursement forthe missing CD-ROM player.Doomsayer   Now that you have a feel for the costs of not having adesktop-management system, take a moment to play Cassandra. Conjure up theworst-case scenario that could result from continuing to do without amanagement system. In our example, the inaccurate inventory could haveresulted in a massive overpayment of property tax, perhaps $25,000. A hardnumber like that is powerful ammunition in your dealings with those whosign the checks.   If you're looking for a more extreme example, consider the relativelynew issue of software-license management. Perform an audit of yourdepartment's software usage (the Software Publishers Association providesutilities for this at URL http://www.spa.org/piracy/download.html). Supposeyou find that your company regularly has 200 copies of a certain wordprocessor in use, but you only have 150 licenses. The worst-case scenariomight be a visit from the SPA, with federal marshals in tow. Calculate thecost of settling with the SPA: the full list price for each of the 50illegal copies and 50 new legal licenses. When you present visions likethese to your managers, you'll definitely have their attention.Consider the Alternative   At some point in your pitch, it's a good idea to concede that a completemanagement system is not the only way to administer your network. To have apersuasive argument, you must acknowledge the alternatives, prove that youhave considered them, and then reveal their inadequacies--if you can.   Alternatives to managing inventory could be to pay overtime or to hirean additional employee. Naturally, either option costs money. Includesalary, benefits, annual raises, recruiting costs, and turnover in yourcalculations. Then estimate the accuracy of that person's work and makeadjustments. Human error is inevitable, and it is expensive. In our earlierexample, hiring someone to manage inventory manually might cost $30,000 peryear but only reduce the error rate to 6 percent; you could still beoverpaying property tax by about $9,000. That translates to a total cost of$39,000 per year.   If your primary concern is software distribution, consider the cost ofwriting and maintaining your own utilities to manage these chores. Also,the only real alternative to a license-management program is manual counts.Again, this means overtime or additional personnel--and a large margin oferror.The Price Is Right   Now it's time to put a price on the desktop-management system you wantto buy. Be honest with yourself when calculating these costs. As you know,the cost is much more than the purchase price. How will the system affectclient and server resources? Will additional hardware be required? Will youhave to purchase annual support contracts? How will implementing the systemaffect staffing? Overtime? Training? Don't forget that many of thesepackages aren't seamlessly integrated; you may have to spend some timecobbling together the best combination of tools.   After you evaluate the costs of the management system, you must assessits benefits. This is probably where you started, imagining theimprovements such a system would bring to the way you work. But when you'remaking your pitch, you'll have to have something more concrete than fuzzyimages of a no-hands network. How will it benefit the company? As mentionedearlier, making your life easier won't be enough to satisfy the budgetcommittee. A product that cuts personnel costs or solves a significantoperational or customer-service problem is going to get the budgetdollars.   In our inventory example, if the total cost of implementing themanagement system is $50,000 or less, the system will pay for itself in twoyears in property-tax savings alone. After that, the system will be putting$25,000 back in your company's coffers each year.   Now that you've gathered your facts, found the costs and shortcomings inyour solution, addressed the holes in your logic, and built a case based oneconomic need and common sense, it's time to prepare your presentation.Start by telling your audience how much the desktop-management system willsave the company. Then give an example of a past project that would havebeen done more cost effectively if the system had been in place. Presentthe worst-case scenario if the system isn't purchased, and conclude with astep-by-step explanation of the analysis you used to arrive at theseconclusions. And in case your argument sparks enthusiasm, it's a good ideato have a detailed implementation plan ready.You Can't Always Get What You Want   Your analysis will produce a sound, justifiable, and possiblyunassailable case for purchasing a management system--or a reasonableexplanation of why the purchase isn't feasible. In either case, you win.Understanding why a purchase doesn't make business sense will build yourcredibility with management as much as knowing why it does.   Just as important, you (and they) will be aware of the types of systemsand pricing that will make sense. If your analysis shows that purchasing amanagement system isn't a sound business move, don't give up. Calculate aprice at which the system would be a good buy, then present that figure toyour vendor; be fair--vendors have to make money, too. Even if there isn'troom for negotiation, your vendor will have information for themanagement-system developer. Perhaps their system is overpriced for theirtarget market.   This exercise will also give you a broad perspective on how your networkfits into your organization. It encourages constant, close communicationwith other departments and an understanding of how they use the network andinformation about it. This perspective will make you a better networkmanager and serve you well throughout your career.Put a Price on It   Your boss doesn't want to hear how much easier a network-managementsuite will make your job. It's all about the bottom line, and you'll needto be well-prepared before heading into budget battle. These five stepswill help you attach specific figures to the costs and benefits of amanagement package--and get the purchase approved.Dwell in the Past   Make a list of projects that could have been streamlined with the propertools: Upgrades that could have been rolled out faster, for example. Don'tforget to include IS projects, such as capacity planning or serveroptimization, that have been put off for lack of time.Find the Holes   Check your current inventory records against a random sample of about 1percent of your network devices. Document any inconsistencies and have theaccounting department assess the costs of the inaccurate inventory, such astax overpayments and neglected insurance claims. Also check forsoftware-license compliance with one of the utilities provided by theSoftware Publishers Association.It Could Be Worse   Sketch a worst-case scenario for your boss. Describe what would happenif your organization was caught illegally using software, for example.Consider the Alternatives   Balance your purchase request by calculating the costs of alternativesto a management suite. Put a dollar value on the expense of adding staff orpaying overtime, for instance.The Best Policy   Be honest with your boss--and yourself. Don't gloss over the hiddenoutlay associated with the tools you want to buy. Include the costs ofhardware and software upgrades or support contracts. Finally, don't forgetthe time it will take you to get up to speed with the tools.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List
