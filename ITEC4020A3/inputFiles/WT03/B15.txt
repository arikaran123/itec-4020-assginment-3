How does NetShade work? How is NetShade different from other encryptionproducts? Why should I be encrypting my TCP/IP sessions? Unfortunately, the technology on which the Internet and LANs arebuilt is inherently insecure. Data does not travel directly from yourmachine to the intended destination. Instead, it is bounced and broadcastthrough a number of computer networks, until it can finally be grabbed offthe network by the "receiver". The fact is, nothing stops other peoplefrom grabbing the data off the network, too. It is much like a party-linetelephone; there is a polite agreement that other users of the line won'tlisten in, but nothing else protects your privacy. In the past, network eavesdropping required a great deal of technicalskill, as well as expensive hardware analysis tools. Today, stealing dataoff a LAN or the Internet is as easy as running a simple application calleda protocol analyzer -- some of which are available as shareware. Forthis reason, it takes no skill or special ability to steal network data,including email, file transfers, web data, or even login IDs and passwords. Most computer professionals agree that encryption is the best wayto prevent this type of networkeavesdropping. Encryption can be used to transform messages intociphertext, making them unintelligible to network eavesdroppers. When a message arrivesat its destination, it can be decrypted: restored to its original state with the "key" that was used to scramble it. NetShade uses encryption to protect all of the TCP/IP data sent fromyour machine to other NetShade users. While most network security tools use encryption to protect specific kindsof data (for example, e-mail), NetShade can protect your e-mail, your FTP sessions, your Telnet sessions, your Webserver -- in short, it can protect everytype of data that can be sent over the Internet or any other type of TCP/IPnetwork. To learn how, read on. (Also seeSample NetShade Configurations for specificimplementation strategies.) How does NetShade work? NetShade automatically and invisibly encrypts all of the TCP/IP (e.g.,Internet) data sent from one NetShade user to another, using a combination of secretkey and publickey encryption techniques (see below). NetShade is transparent to the upper layers of the network architecture;that is,it runs independently of applications and system features that use your networkservices. This means that it will work with Telnet, FTP, client/serverapplications, remote backup programs, remotely published documents, e-mail,remote databases, Web browsers/servers and any other TCP/IP-compatibleapplication. NetShade is also transparent to the lower layers of the system; that is,it runsindependently of the network hardware. This means that it will work withSLIP, PPP, Ethernet, token ring, wireless, etc. Secret key encryption NetShade uses a number of different encryption methods that fallinto two maincategories: secret key encryption and public key encryption. Secret key encryption methods use a single secret key to lock and unlockdata; therefore, only someone with access to the key can decrypt the data. Thiskey must, ofcourse, be kept secret from all third parties. When data is encrypted, it becomes ciphertext and looks like garbageor noise. Ideally, no information about the original data can be determined from thisnoisewithout knowledge of the secret key. However, an entire branch of mathematicsis devoted to finding an original message from its corresponding ciphertext. This science iscalled cryptanalysis (you can think of it as the art of crackingencryptionmethods). It is an extremely complex science which requires an in-depthmathematical knowledge of cryptography. NetShade currently supports the following algorithms: DES.(pronounced D.E.S. or "dezz") This algorithm was adopted as astandard by the US government in the 1970's. Since then, it has held upwellagainst analysis, so many people have a great deal of confidence in its security. However, it is still possible to build multi-million dollar supercomputerswhichcan try every possible key, thus unlocking ciphertext by "brute force." Again,DES should protect your data from anyone but a government or other powerfulentity. Triple-DES. This algorithm works by encrypting datathree times with three different keys. This makes the process of brute-forcecryptanalysis take so long that it cannot even be done by the US government. (It ismuch more than three times as strong as DES; it is more like a million-billiontimes stronger). Triple-DES is widely considered to be unbreakable at thistime. NightShade Algorithm. This is a "scrambling" algorithm designedspecifically for encrypting network data at high speeds. Although not ascryptographically strong as DES or IDEA, it is still much better than sendingdata with no encryption at all. In order to "crack" a message, an attackerwould have to perform mathematical cryptanalysis, which is more than mostpeople are willing or able to do. It is so fast that it can be leftrunning at all times, so you will never have to send data in the clear. Public key encryption Of course, the main problem with secret key encryption is findinga safe way todistribute the secret keys. Fortunately, a number of methods have been developedfor secure key distribution. We use one called theRSA public key cryptosystem. RSA requires each party wishing to communicate to have a pre-generatedkeypair, consisting of a public and a private key. These keys are complements ofone another; something encrypted with the public key can be unlocked only with the privatekey, and something encrypted with the private key can only be unlocked with thepublic key. This is very useful. In practice, the public key may be distributed freelytoanyone (hence its name), whereas the private key is kept secret. If Alicewantsto send a message to Bob, she can encrypt it with Bob's public key. Oncethis hasbeen done, no one (not even Alice) can unlock the message. The only wayit canbe unlocked is with the private key, and Bob is the only one who knows thiskey. Likewise, if Bob wants to reply, he can encrypt a message with Alice's publickey; then, only she can unlock it (with her own private key). For moreinformation on the RSA public key cryptosystem, visit the RSAWeb site. How NetShade uses these encryption methods NetShade sets up sealed sessions between any two NetShade-equippedmachinesbefore they start to exchange data. Here's how the process works: Step 1: Alice's machine sends a "log-in" request to Bob's machine. This request,whichis sent in the clear, contains Alice's public key and specifies the algorithmthat Alice wants to use for encryption (in this case, Alice has set DES asherprimary mode). Remember, it doesn't matter who intercepts the public key;it'sOK for everyone to see it. Step 2: Next, Bob's machine generates a secret DES key at random. This key willbe usedto encrypt the network traffic between the two machines. The secret keyisstored in the memory of Bob's machine. Step 3: Next, Bob encrypts the secret key using Alice's RSA public key. Bob's machinethen sends the encrypted key to Alice's machine. Remember, no one will beableto steal the secret key off the network, since it is encrypted. Step 4: Finally, Alice's machine decrypts the secret key using her RSA private key. Atthis point, both machines have a copy of the secret key. From this pointon, alltransmissions between the two machines will be encrypted with the secretDES key. Of course, this entire process takes place automatically, without userintervention. All the user will notice is a slight pause at the beginningof thesession, caused by the slowness of RSA encryption. *** For a more technical description of how NetShade establishes secure sessions,consult the NetShade white paper. Also, the page describingsample NetShade configurations may be helpful. How is NetShade different from other encryptionproducts? Most network security software products are only designed to securespecific types of data, such ase-mail or shared files. By contrast, NetShade can secure any type of datathat can be sent over the Internetor a TCP/IP LAN, regardless of what application sends the data or what itwill be used for. Over the next fewyears, people will be using the Internet to share information in many newways: groupware, telephony, videoconferencing, and more. With NetShade, you'll never have to changeyour network/Internet security system again; even better, you won't have to upgrade any new applicationsto support NetShade. (In contrast, security standards like the Secure Sockets Layer require applications tobe rewritten in support of SSL.) NetShade is also easier to use than most network security products. As soonas NetShade has been configured with yourspecific security settings, it will run in the background and encrypt allof your TCP/IP data automatically. You won't have to learn any new applications, or even learn any new ways to use yourexisting ones: NetShade will simply applyan invisible blanket of security to all of your network activity.

Secure a smaller LAN workgroup? Securing Point-to-Point Applications A "point-to-point" application is any program that establishes adirect link between two machines.Groupware, telephony, FTP, Telnet, videoconferencing programs, and client/serversystems are all examplesof point-to-point applications, as they all establish direct connectionsfrom one machine to another. (E-mailsystems are not usually point-to-point applications, as most of them routemessages via intermediary machines. See below for more on securing e-mail systems.) Once NetShade has been installed on two machines, any informationexchanged directly between those machines --regardless of which application is used to send the data -- will be automaticallyand invisibly encrypted. It doesn'tmatter how the two machines are connected (Internet, LAN, VAN, WAN, seriallink, etc.): as long as the link is bi-directional, and as long as the information is exchanged using the operatingsystem's TCP/IP network support, all ofthe information shared between those machines will be encrypted. For example,installing NetShade on an FTP serveror other Internet host will allow any NetShade user to establish an encryptedlink with that host. Since NetShade encrypts data at the protocol level, you won't need to modifyany of the applications you use toexchange data. Once NetShade is installed and configured on all the machinesthat communicate via point-to-point applications,you can keep using those applications in the same way that you use them now-- the only difference is that with NetShade, the applications will be exchanging data acrosssecure channels. Securing E-mail Systems NetShade is designed to establish a secure TCP/IP connection fromyour machine to any other machine that isrunning NetShade. This "point-to-point" security is automatically appliedto any application that sends data directly from onemachine to another. However, most e-mail systems don't send messages directlyto the addressees' machines; instead,they use a technique called "store and forward." This makes e-mail systensslightly more difficult to protect than applications supporting point-to-point communication. When you send a message to somebody using a "store and forward" e-mail system,it is first routed to an intermediatemachine called a mail server. Your mail server determines which mailserver the message recipient is using,and routes your message to that mail server. Usually, the message is storedon the recipient's mail server until therecipient retrieves it. Since NetShade requires direct contact between two machines to establisha secure channelbetween those machines, and since store-and-forward never puts the e-mailsender in direct contact with the e-mailrecipient, an extra step is needed to secure the message in transit (seeFigure 1 below). Once NetShade has been installed on the intermediate mail servers, any e-mailrouted between those serverscan be secured in a simple three-step process.For example, if Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob, NetShade shouldbe installed on her mail server and on Bob's mail server.When Alice sends the message, her copy of NetShade encrypts the message forher mail server, not for Bob. Alice'smail server decrypts the message when it arrives, and then immediatelyre-encrypts the message for Bob's mail server; again, the message is decrypted by Bob's server upon arrival. When Bob retrieveshis e-mail from the mail server, the mail server encrypts it for Bob's machine;Bob's machine decrypts the e-mail when itarrives. Of course, the entire process happens automatically, without anyneed for user intervention. Although Alice's message has been unencrypted twice en route to Bob's machine,the points of greatest vulnerability --the network pathways -- are completely secure. Nevertheless, this scenariounderscores the need to combineNetShade with a strong local encryption product (such asRSA Secure) in any situation where networkdatawill be stored on a hard drive. Establishing a Secure Web Site If NetShade is installed on a machine running a Web server, any otherNetShade user will be able to access that Web site securely. As soon as authentication services are available (withversion 2.1), server administrators will also be able to use NetShade torestrictaccess to private Web sites. NetShade provides a level of security similar to that offered by the SecureSockets Layer(SSL) security protocol. However, NetShade is cheaper, more flexible andmore easily maintained than the SSL system,which requires applications and servers to be modified at the source codelevel before their data can be secured. Compare this to NetShade's "plug-in" functionality, which adds security to all ofyour TCP/IP applications at once when it is installed. Securing a Local Area Network While many people already realize that Internet traffic can easilybe targeted by intruders, few realize that a similarsituation exists on local area networks. But as more and more organizationsexperience internal security breaches(where trade secrets are intercepted and stolen by an employee), LAN securitysystems must become better able to defend against internal eavesdropping attacks. NetShade can protect LANtraffic just as easily as itprotects Internet data. See Figure 2 below. Installing NetShade on every networked machine across a TCP/IP LAN will addan invisible blanket of security to theentire network. All of the network services and applications are used inexactly the same way, but the network data-- including e-mail, shared files, client/server sessions, etc. -- is encryptedto defend against eavesdropping attacks. Note that since NetShade encrypts data at the protocol level, any of themachines on this LAN can stillcommunicate securely with other NetShade users across the Internet. NetShade 2.0 will work with TCP/IP intranets. Future versions of NetShadewill be adapted to offer protection for other types of networks: AppleTalk,IPX/SPX, and others.(Note that NetShade version 1.1 can alreadybe used to encrypt Appletalk LAN traffic). Securing a LAN Workgroup If you are not interested in securing all of the machines on yourLAN, NetShade can easily be scaled back to protecta smaller workgroup. Any network data shared among members of this workgroupwill automatically be encrypted; you canconfigure NetShade to allow unencrypted connections between the workgroupand non-NetShade users, or to reject anyattempts at unencrypted communication. NetShade's flexibility of scale makes it the most cost-effective way to protecta subset of your network. Since NetShadeis a self-contained system, it can be managed entirely within its group ofusers. And of course, it can easily be scaledup to protect the rest of the LAN as your organization's security needs change.

An Overview of the Sealed-Session Networking Paradigmand theNetShade(TM) Implementation DRAFT: June 6, 1996 Introduction The key design principles for the NetShade v2.x architecture areas follows: · NetShade can provide an automatic, invisible blanket of securityfor an entire enterprise-wide network. That is, it can secure dataassociated with all common network protocols, operating systems, and networkapplications without requiring user intervention or drastically slowing networkperformance. · NetShade is designed from the ground up to support multiplehardware platforms (Mac, WinTel, etc.) and protocols (TCP/IP, AppleTalk ,IPX/SPX, etc.). This unique architecture allows NetShade to be easilyupgraded to support emerging technologies&emdash;IP-NG, SSL, emerging keymanagement standards, new encryption algorithms, etc. These design principles represent the heart of Atemi's sealed-sessionnetworking paradigm. In essence, sealed-session networking uses asymmetric(i.e., public key) encryption to securely share a session key between twocommunicating machines before any data is sent; once both parties have receivedthe session key, that key is used to encrypt all the data sent between thetwo parties. An implementation of SSN offers several advantages over other popularapproaches to network security&emdash;it is application and link independent,easy to use and maintain, scalable to all types and sizes of networks, etc. However, a full description of the benefits of sealed-session networkingis beyond the scope of this paper . Instead, we will focus on how thesealed-session networking paradigm is implemented in the NetShade v2.xarchitecture. Sealed-Session Networking Design Principles The overall goal of sealed-session networking (SSN) is to add aninvisible layer of security to all the data sent over an enterprise's network,protecting it from eavesdropping attacks. Since this goal can only berealistically achieved if the cost per user remains low, a hardware-basedapproach to the SSN paradigm would be ineffective. Therefore, a completelysoftware-based implementation of SSN should be the primary focus. Hybridhardware-software implementations should be of lower priority. The key requirements for an effective SSN system are: · It must use a software mechanism to intercept and encrypt networkdata at a low level in the system&emdash;between the application and physicallayers of the network architecture. · It must have a mechanism for securely sharing session keys betweenthe transmitter and recipient in any network session. · It must seed each session key with an effective random number. · It must be able to establish simultaneous sealed sessions withmultiple machines, each using a different session key. · It must support some type of mechanism for authentication. The RSA Public Key Cryptosystem Several of these requirements can be addressed through the RSA publickey cryptosystem . Using this technology involves the generation of an RSAkeypair, which includes a public component and a private component. Thereis a complex mathematical relationship between the two components, such thatdata encrypted with one component can only be decrypted with its correspondingcomponent; for example, data encrypted with a public key can only be decryptedwith the corresponding private key. The RSA cryptosystem is widely recognizedas one of the most secure (and most practical) implementations of asymmetriccryptography, as determining a private key from its corresponding publickey is computationally impractical for keypairs of 512 bits or greater . We have found that the RSA public key cryptosystem can address the needfor a secure key exchange mechanism in an SSN implementation, and can alsoprovide machine-based authentication to some extent. The actual implementationof the RSA technology is described in more detail in the section describingNetShade's implementation of SSN. MD5 Random Number Generation Another important part of an SSN product is a mechanism for generatingreasonable random numbers. This is a non-trivial problem, since most machineshave only primitive pseudo-random number generators. The possibility ofreproduction of random seed data represents a significant security hole onthese systems. In our approach to SSN, all random numbers are generated using an MD5generator. The generator is initially seeded at startup time using a numberof volatile low-memory system values (including the clock).

Establishing a Sealed Session: the NetShade Implementation Authentication and Key Exchange A NetShade user has the option of using an RSA-based authenticationmechanism to create a list of machines that are allowed to communicate withthat user. Often, user-based authentication services (i.e., password logins)are already provided by the upper-layer networking applications. These areoften sufficient, and do not require the additional management effort ofRSA key distribution. However, there are clearly some situations in which a second layer ofmachine-based RSA authentication is desirable. For instance, a user passwordlogin cannot effectively protect against so-called "Man-in-the-Middle" attacks. Administrators of security systems will simply need to judge their ownsecurity needs, and whether or not they require the more complete authenticationmechanisms provided. The session establishment description below describesthe fully authenticated method. [NOTE: Authentication functionality will not be incorporated into theNetShade product line until version 2.1.] RSA Keypair Distribution Each NetShade machine stores two complete RSA keypairs, an exchangekeypair (EKP) and an authentication keypair (AKP). Each NetShade machinealso stores a file called a "keyring," which contains IDs and public keysfor all the machines approved to exchange data with that machine. Details of the key management mechanisms used to actually distribute theAKPs are beyond the scope of this paper. Key management is a complex problemwith many solutions, each having benefits and deficiencies. For this reason,a number of different methods should be available, such as centralized keyservices or distributed "PGP-based" trust levels. NetShade provides a mechanism for encrypting private keys and keyringswith a user passphrase. This passphrase may be up to 64 characters long,and may contain spaces, punctuation, etc. If this option is used, the privatekeys are stored on the disk using Triple-DES encryption with an MD5 hashof the passphrase. As described earlier, all RSA keypairs include a public element and aprivate element. The public portion of each user's authentication keypair(AKP-Pub) is distributed to all the machines which are "approved" to connectto that user's machine; each of these machines adds this AKP-Pub to its keyringfile. To NetShade, the keyring represents a list of entities that cancommunicate with a machine, and provides a means of proving the identityof an approved entity. Each machine's EKP and AKP are generated and maintained separately. Thekeypairs may be of different sizes, allowing a larger keypair to be usedfor authentication; for example, a 768 bit AKP could be used with a 512 bitEKP. This allows EKPs to be changed frequently (thus enhancing security)without making authentication management a nightmare. Currently, NetShadecan create RSA keypairs ranging from 512 to 1024 bits. Authenticating and Establishing a Sealed Session When a NetShade user requests a network connection to another NetShadeuser's machine, the authentication process is activated. First, a packetcontaining the requestor's ID, EKP-Pub, and other miscellaneous informationis prepared. The entire packet is hashed with MD5. The hash is then signedusing the requestor's AKP-Priv and appended to the packet; the packet isthen sent to the responder. Upon receipt of the packet, the responder re-hashes the packet, and verifiesthe hash using the requestor's AKP-Pub (which is found in the responder'skeyring). If the request is valid and unmodified, a Triple-DES key is generatedand placed in a response packet. The Triple-DES key is then RSA encryptedusing the requestor's EKP-Pub. Some additional information is added to the packet, and then the entirepacket is hashed and signed using the responder's AKP-Priv. Finally, everythingexcept the RSA-encrypted Triple-DES key is encrypted with the Triple-DESkey, and the response packet is sent to the requester. Upon receipt of this packet, the requester verifies the authenticity ofthe packet using its AKP-Pub keyring. If genuine, it decrypts the Triple-DESkey using its EKP-Priv. At this point, both the requester and the responder have access to theTriple-DES key. This key is then used to establish secure pipes for datausing any bulk encryption algorithm desired by the requester. Additionalexchange packets are both protected and authenticated by the Triple-DES key. Determining the Encryption Mode Different NetShade users may prefer to use different encryptionalgorithms. One user may allow only DES and Triple-DES, while another mightallow only the NightShade Algorithm. Some users may allow unencryptedconnections with their machines, as well. To address this potential problem, NetShade allows each user to definea prioritized list of allowed encryption algorithms. Any attempts to connectto a NetShade machine using an algorithm that does not appear in this listwill be rejected. (The user may define "cleartext" as an allowed algorithm,which will allow insecure connections to your machine; if authenticationis turned off, even non-NetShade users will be able to connect with you.) When attempting to connect to another machine, NetShade determines whichalgorithms (if any) are supported by both machines. From this list, NetShadeselects the algorithm with the highest priority on the requestor's allowedlist. For example, if the requester allows DES, Triple DES and NightShadein that order of priority, and the responder allows Triple DES and DES inthat order of priority, the session will be established using DES as thebulk encryption algorithm. If there are no encryption algorithms supported by both the requesterand responder, the session will not be established. NetShade will insteadshow the requester a dialog box listing the encryption algorithms that aresupported by the responding machine. Network Packet Interception and Re-Entry One of the most challenging aspects of implementing a SSN systemis intercepting and re-admitting network data packets. Although the specificmechanism NetShade uses to intercept data is proprietary, we can offer arough description of how the process works. One flexible aspect of the main NetShade architecture is the ability tointercept and secure data from various different levels of the networkinghierarchy. This is valuable for practical rather than conceptual reasons. Different implementations of different protocols (for instance, Appletalkvs. TCP/IP) allow for interception at varying levels. For example, NetShadeintercepts TCP/IP at the data stream layer, whereas it intercepts Appletalkat the network packet layer. For the purposes of discussion, we will usethe term "packet" to refer to some chunk of data intercepted by NetShade;not necessarily a link-level network packet. NetShade monitors all of the incoming and outgoing packets. If NetShade'sauthentication feature is turned on, any incoming or outgoing packets sentto or from a source not listed in the keyring are immediately rejected. When processing any approved packet, NetShade checks the identity of theother party in the transaction (the sender of an incoming packet, or therecipient of an outgoing packet). If that party has already establisheda sealed session with the host machine, the packet is sent to the encryptionmechanism for encryption (outgoing) or decryption (incoming) using thepre-determined session key. If no sealed session has been established, NetShadeattempts to establish a sealed session with the sender's machine. Data Encryption Mechanism The currently supported block ciphers (DES, Triple-DES) are implementedin cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. All block algorithms used in the futurewill be supported in this mode. For implementation reasons, the amount of initialization vector data availableis dependent on the network protocol used. For TCP/IP, a full 64 bits ofIV data is used in block encryptions. This discussion of NetShade's encryption focuses on TCP/IP data. Notethat the design of the encryption engine is flexible, and that future NetShadeupgrades will add encryption support for data sent over the AppleTalk, IPXand SPX network protocols in the near future. While the structure of datapackets sent over these protocols will differ, the basic encryption functionalitywill operate much like the TCP/IP encryption process. Data Encryption Process NetShade performs bulk encryption on the data field of each TCP/IPdata block, and prepends an unencrypted "initialization vector" to this field. Figure 2 shows how a standard TCP/IP data block is modified during thisprocess. Assuming that the data block has already been approved for transmissionby the authentication mechanism and that a sealed session has already beenestablished between the sender and receiver, NetShade routes the outgoingpacket to the encryption engine. Next, NetShade looks up the encryption algorithm and session key thatwere set during the session establishment process. This information is usedto encrypt all the data in the data block except for the TCP and IP headers. Figure 1. TCP/IP Data Block Encryption Results The NetShade header includes an initialization vector and some other basicinformation about the sealed session. This information can be sent in theclear without compromising the security of the sealed session. Data Decryption Process Again, let us assume that an incoming packet has already been approvedby the authentication mechanism and that a sealed session has already beenestablished between the sender and receiver. Using the packet's source IPaddress to determine the identity of the sender, NetShade looks up the algorithmand session key that were set during the session establishment process. This key is combined with the initialization vector to decrypt the data block. Planning for Modular Upgrades The NetShade architecture itself is designed as a series of modules,making it easy to add support for additional platforms, operating systems,network protocols, and features (see Figure 2). Separate modules are devotedto platform-specific processing (memory management, interface, driverinformation, etc.), protocol-specific processing (packet processing andinterception), the encryption mechanism (selecting the algorithms to be used),and authentication (selecting the method by which the identity of connectingmachines or users can be verified). This modular design was chosen to reducethe development cycle for new versions of NetShade.

How can I use AtemiConnect? How is AtemiConnect different from AppleRemote Access? Aren't there serious security concernsassociated with Internet networking? CanAtemiConnect's technology be integrated into other applications? What is AtemiConnect? AtemiConnect is a utility thatlets you establish an AppleTalk network connection over the Internet. Thisproduct lets you connect your Macintosh to a remote AppleTalk LAN via theInternet, giving you access to all the data, programs and services on thatLAN.When used with NetShade(TM), Atemi's network security utility, AtemiConnectsetsup a secure virtual network across the Internet. File sharing, remotebackups, groupware, LAN-based e-mail, printing, etc. -- anything that youcan doover your AppleTalk LAN can now be done over the Internet as well. (Theclientand server must both be running the AtemiConnect software before the linkcan beestablished, and the remote LAN's AppleShare security settings will applyto thelink.) How can I use AtemiConnect? AtemiConnect is designed to bridge the gap betweenLAN andInternet networking. The old mindset for Internet use isthat the network services available over the Internet are limited -- FTP,Webbrowsers, etc. -- and that you need special Internet-specific programs tousethem. With AtemiConnect, anything you can do over a LAN can be done acrosstheInternet, using the same LAN-based applications that you use today. In theshortterm, this product will save you money on long-distance modem connectionsandFAXes. In the long term, it will help your organization share its resourcesmoreeffectively and efficiently. AtemiConnect offers a number of useful applications,including: Replacement of ARA for telecommuting. The telecommuter canplace a local call to a service provider instead of a long distance phonecall. Also, if high speed lines are available, AtemiConnect can takeadvantage of the higher throughputs. Replacement of Fax. You can select remote Appletalk printers thesame way as file servers. So, instead of sending faxes, you can printdirectly to a printer at a remote location. This allows for highresolution, color, and no long distance charges. Database applications. Use LAN-based database products over theInternet without modification. Games. Some LAN games (such as F18 Hornet) can be played head-to-headwith people across the world. How is AtemiConnect different fromApple Remote Access? There are two important distinctions between thesetwoproducts. ARA uses your modem and a telephone line to exchange AppleTalkdata,whereas AtemiConnect uses the Internet to accomplish the same purpose. Sincethecost of an Internet connection is usually much less than the cost of along-distance phone call -- especially if you are connecting to someone inanother country -- AtemiConnect is a much more cost-effective way to shareinformation than ARA. The second major difference is connectivity. If youwant to allow multiple remote users to connect to your AppleTalk networkat once,ARA requires you to purchase a "multiport server" -- an expensive piece ofhardware that allows you to make multiple modem connections to a server atthesame time -- and a modem for each simultaneous connection you wish to allow. Bycontrast, AtemiConnect doesn't require any extra hardware at all; multipleuserscan use AtemiConnect to establish simultaneous AppleTalk sessions with asingleserver. Aren't there serious security concerns associated withInternet networking? Yes. The Internet is a notoriously insecuremedium, and just about anything you send over it can easily be read by anintruder. Most experts agree that if you plan to send any important businessinformation over the Internet, you will need a way to keep it safe from outsideeyes. Fortunately, there is a simple way to keep your AtemiConnectsessionsprivate. By combining this utility with Atemi'sNetShade network security software, yourAtemiConnect data will be sent over a secure virtual link. NetShadeis designedto protect all the AppleTalk data sent from your Macintosh, making it anidealway to keep AtemiConnect sessions out of the hands of intruders. (Onceinstalled, NetShade will automatically protect your ARA and LAN data as well;seethe description of NetShade v1.1 for moreinformation.) Can AtemiConnect's technology be integrated intootherapplications? Yes, easily. Application developers will findAtemiConnect tobe the easiest way to add Internet support to any LAN-based application. AtemiConnect is designed to operate independently of all types of applications,so this technology can be bundled onto any LAN application just by addingAtemiConnect to that application's installation disk. This will add valuenotonly to the application, which will now be able to communicate across theInternet, but also to your customers' Internet connections: they will beable touse the Internet to share data and resources around the world.

How is NetShade different from other networksecurity products? How does NetShade work? What does NetShade's interface look like? What platforms does NetShade support? When will NetShade be available for otherplatforms and protocols? What encryption algorithms does NetShadesupport? What you need to know about networksecurity Most people don't realize that everything sent over most networksand modem linkscan be intercepted and read by anyone who cares to listen. Using a commonnetwork management tool called aprotocol analyzer, it is easy for anyone with access to your networkto tap into all thedata sent over it -- including passwords, user IDs, e-mail, shared files,etc. For telecommuters, the eavesdropping problem is even more critical. Thetelephoneis a notoriously insecure medium, and there are dozens of ways for a determinedintruderto access your telephone lines and tap into data sent during a remote session. This problemputs business data at so much risk that many organizations do not let theiremployees telecommute at all. Fortunately, there is a simple way to protect your AppleTalk network usersand ARA telecommutersfrom these attacks. NetShade v1.1 prevents eavesdropping and spoofing byencrypting allof your AppleTalk sessions before they reach the network. To an eavesdropper,all of your network and ARA traffic will be completely unintelligible. Here's how it works: when you send a message to another NetShade user, NetShadetransforms it into ciphertext using a complex secret key (knownonly to you and the message's recipient). To prevent an intruderfrom analyzing and duplicating your secret key, NetShade changes itwith every new network session, and uses RSA'spublickeycryptosystem to share the new key securely with the receivingparty. If you need more speed or more security at any time, NetShade can changethe way itencrypts your network data. The military-strengthDESand Triple DES algorithm upgrades are available for maximum dataprotection, while the proprietary NightShade(TM) Algorithm scrambles dataso fast thatyou won't even notice it running. NetShade's ability to encrypt all your AppleTalk data automatically and invisiblymakes it unique among software security products. Your network users willnever have todecide which data is sensitive enough to merit protection; in fact, theywon't even needto change the way they use their network applications at all. Best of all,you won't ever need to upgradeNetShade to support a new network application; groupware, multimedia toolsand any other applicationthat uses AppleTalk will be secured automatically and invisibly. NetShade v1.1 -- just turn it on and leave it on, and rest assured that yourentire network will remainsafe and private. How is NetShade different from other networksecurity products? NetShade is Flexible. NetShade protects all types of network traffic--regardless of source,purpose ordestination--from being intercepted and analyzed by hackers orindustrial spies. Security is not limited to a single application. NetShade is Easy to Use. Because NetShade is so easy to install, configure and operate, youwon't need to train your personnel in how to use it. And becauseNetShade is so affordable, you can use it to secure every machine acrossyour enterprise, rather than buying expensive protection for a few"mission critical" network users and leaving everyone else vulnerableto network attacks. NetShade is Invisible. NetShade is designed to be as inconspicuous as possible. Once youhaveloaded and configured NetShade, you won't ever have to think about itagain; all of your network traffic will be encoded automatically andinvisibly, preventing anyone other than the intended recipients fromreading it. And since NetShade won't slow your network's speednoticeably, it's easy to forget that NetShade was even installed onyour computer. NetShade Secures Everything. NetShade is the only network security solution designed to protecteverything you send over your network without affecting the wayyou work. Now, network security can be the rule for your organization,rather than the exception. How does NetShade work? Atemi has developed two papers to answer this question: Basic NetShade Operation.This paper offers a high-level explanation of how NetShade protects networktraffic from eavesdroppers. This is a non-technical look at NetShade'soperation. Advanced NetShadeOperation. This paper covers NetShade's functionality from a technicalperspective. Topics here include RSA keypair exchange, insecure sessionhandling, multi-algorithm operation, NetShade and non-encrypting devices,andNetShade configuration on a LAN, on a WAN, and over Apple Remote Access. What does NetShade's interface look like? To see a screen shot from NetShade v1.1, clickhere. What platforms does NetShade support? Platforms supported: MacOS (Accelerated for PowerMac) Protocols supported: AppleTalk, including Apple Remote Access (ARA) System requirements: Macintosh SE/30 or larger with at least 2 MB of RAM Apple System 7.0 or later AppleTalk version 57 or later When will NetShade be available for otherplatforms and network protocols? See the information on NetShade v2.0 for theanswer to this question. What encryption algorithms does NetShadesupport? At the present time, NetShade supports three main algorithms:DES,Triple DES, and the NightShade Algorithm. DES and Triple DES providethe strongest security, while NightShade is designed to maximizenetwork throughput. The RSA public key cryptosystem is used to sharethe secret keys for these algorithms securely. Atemi is willing to develop NetShade modules for any encryptionalgorithm requested by our customers. We are currently consideringdeveloping modules for RC5, IDEA and Blowfish; if you are interested inusing these ciphers (or any others) with NetShade, please call usdirectly.

To help explainhowthis application works, we have developed a series of case studies thatdemonstrate how NetShade establishes secure sessions in a simple networkenvironment. If you are more interested in how NetShade handles RSA keypair exchange,insecuresession requests and multiple encryption algorithms, or how NetShade couldbeinstalled on a LAN, WAN or Apple Remote Access (ARA) environment, consultthedocument titled Advanced NetShade Operation. Page Contents: Case 1: An Insecure Network Case 2: Two NetShade Users Case 3: Adding a Fourth User Case 1: An Insecure Network Figure 1 illustrates an extremely simple network with just threeusers: Alice,Bob and Trent. Whenever one of these users wants to send private data toanotheruser over the network, they are faced with a problem: the way the networkisconstructed means that the data will be sent to all the users on thenetwork. This means that normally, if Alice was sending network data (e-mail, sharedfiles, etc.) to Bob, Trent's machine would also receive the data, but wouldthendiscard it after recognizing that the data was intended for Bob. But usingacommon network utility called a protocol analyzer, Trent can captureandrecord the data before his machine discards it. This method of networkeavesdropping is essentially undetectable, so Alice and Bob might never knowthatTrent has been reading their private correspondence. Case 2: Two NetShade Users NetShade keeps private data out of eavesdroppers' hands byencrypting it,making it incomprehensible to anyone who doesn't know how to unscramble thedata. Whenever a network connection between two NetShade users is established,NetShade encrypts everything sent between those two machines, creating asealed session. In Figure 2, Alice has established a sealed session with Bob. Now, whenTrenttries to eavesdrop on Alice and Bob's network messages, all he will see isastream of white noise. Case 3: Adding a Fourth User The network environment gets a little more complex when you add afourth networkentity -- another user, a file server, etc. -- as shown in Figure 3. As we mentioned in the previous case, NetShade can only set up securesessions between NetShade users. So if someone else's machine is not protected,all the data sent between your machine and that machine will be vulnerabletoeavesdropping attacks. In Figure 3, Bob has currently established a sealedsession with Alice, and is also connected to Carol. But since Carol is notrunning NetShade, Trent will be able to intercept all the data sent betweenCaroland Bob. Installing NetShade on Carol's machine corrects this problem (see Figure4). Now, Bob can establish secure connections with Alice and Carol simultaneously,protecting all of his network messages from Trent's eavesdropping attacks.Moreover, since each sealed session is protected with a unique key, Alicewill beunable to eavesdrop on Bob's connection with Carol, even though she is runningNetShade and is connected to Bob. By the same token, Bob will be unabletoeavesdrop on Alice's connection with Carol. Because Trent is not running NetShade, all of his network data will be vulnerableto eavesdropping, even if he is connected to someone who is running NetShade.Everyone else on the network, however, will be able to share their privatedatawithout fear of being overheard. (Note: If Alice or Bob would rather notallowTrent to connect with their machines over an insecure medium, NetShade canalsobe configured to reject all insecure connections. This feature is describedinmore detail in the document titled Advanced NetShadeOperation.) Click here to read "Advanced NetShadeOperation."

If any of this information seems confusing or overly technicalto you,consider reviewing the Basic NetShade Operationdocument. Page Contents: RSA keypair exchange Handling insecure session requests Using multiple encryption algorithms Printers and other unencrypting devices NetShade network configurations: LAN, WAN, ARA RSA Keypair Exchange NetShade uses secret key encryption to encrypt all the networkdata sentto and from each protected machine. Secret key encryption methods use asinglesecret key to lock and unlock data. Therefore, only the people with thekey candecrypt it. This key must, of course, be kept secret from all third parties. Of course, the main problem with secret key encryption is finding a safeway todistribute the secret keys. Fortunately, a number of methods have been developedfor secure key distribution. We use one called theRSA public key cryptosystem. Instead of a single secret key, RSA uses a keypair, consisting ofa publicand a private key. These keys are complements of one another; somethingencrypted with the public key can be unlocked only with the private key,andsomething encrypted with the private key can only be unlocked with the publickey. This is very useful. In practice, the public key may be distributed freelytoanyone (hence its name), whereas the private key is kept secret. If Alicewantsto send a message to Bob, she can encrypt it with his public key. Once thishasbeen done, no one (not even Alice) can unlock the message. The only wayit canbe unlocked is with the private key, and Bob is the only one who knows thiskey. Likewise, if Bob wants to reply, he can encrypt a message with Alice's publickey; then, only she can unlock it (with her own private key). NetShade uses the RSA cryptosystem to set up a sealed session betweenanytwo NetShade-equipped machines before they start to communicate over a network.The first time these machines try to communicate, NetShade will generatea new,unique secret encryption key and exchange it using the two machines' RSAkeypairs. The process works like this: Step 1 Alice's machine sends a "log-in" request to Bob's machine. Thisrequest, whichis sent in the clear, contains Alice's public key and specifies the algorithmthat Alice wants to use for encryption (in this case, Alice has set DES asheractive mode). Remember, it doesn't matter who intercepts the public key;it's OKfor everyone to see it. Step 2 Next, Bob's machine -- which allows the DES communication mode --generates asecret DES key at random. This key will be used to encrypt the network trafficbetween the two machines. The secret key is stored in the memory of Bob'smachine. Step 3 Next, Bob encrypts the secret DES key using Alice's RSA public key. Bob'smachine then sends the encrypted key to Alice's machine. Remember, no onewillbe able to steal the secret key as it travels across the network, since itisencrypted. Step 4 Finally, Alice's machine decrypts the secret key using her RSA privatekey. Atthis point, both machines have a copy of the secret key. From this pointon, alltransmissions between the two machines will be encrypted with the secretDES key. Handling Insecure Session Requests Most NetShade environments will include a mix of NetShade users andunprotectedmachines. Since NetShade cannot establish secure sessions with unprotectedmachines, having a greater number of unprotected machines on a network makesitmore likely that someone will establish an insecure connection to your machine. NetShade lets you decide how your machine will handle requests for insecuresessions. If you want to ensure that data from your machine can only besentover a secure channel, you can tell NetShade to allow only secure (i.e.,encrypted) connections with your machine. If you wish to allow insecureconnections, you may choose to have NetShade warn you whenever someoneestablishes such a connection with your machine. In Figure 1, we see that Alice has configured NetShade to allow insecureconnections, but to warn her whenever an insecure session is about to takeplace. By contrast, Bob has set his copy of NetShade to reject any attempt to setup aninsecure session. (Since Alice, Bob and Carl will all be using the server,theserver's copy of NetShade has been set to allow all types of connections.) In this situation, Alice will be able to establish secure connections withBoband the server, since both of those machines are running NetShade. If Aliceconnects to Carl (or vice versa), she will be warned that an insecure connectionto her machine has been established. Bob, on the other hand, will only beableto establish connections with Alice or the server; if he tries to establishaconnection with Carl, NetShade will reject the connection. Carl won't noticeanything unusual when connecting with Alice or the server, but he will receivea"remote machine not responding" message if he tries to connect with Bob. Using Multiple Encryption Algorithms NetShade can establish several different types of secure sessionssimultaneously,giving you even more flexibility in setting the level of security for eachmachine on your network. Figure 2 shows how the machines in our sampleconfiguration might take advantage of this flexibility. Each copy of NetShade on this network is able to support four communicationmodes. Listed from least secure to most secure, those modes are: No encryption,NightShade, DES, and Triple DES (NOTE: the standard version of NetShade onlyincludes the first two modes; DES and Triple DES are available separatelyor withthe advanced NetShade Bundles). From this list of available modes, eachuserdetermines which communication modes will be allowed with his or hermachine. Any attempts to communicate with a machine using a mode that isnotallowed will be rejected. As Figure 2 shows, Alice's machine allows NightShade, DES and unencryptedsessions to be established with her machine. Bob wants more security onhismachine, so he allows only Triple DES and DES connections. The server allowsallfour communication modes. (Since Carl is not running NetShade, he effectivelyallows only unencrypted communication.) On each NetShade machine, one of the allowed modes is always set as theactivemode: the preferred method of communication for that machine. (In Figure2,each user's active mode is marked with a star.) Alice prefers to communicateusing NightShade, since it is the quickest secure algorithm available. Bobhasset his active mode to Triple DES, since it provides the most security. Whenever a NetShade machine initiates a connection to another machine, ittriesto establish that connection using its active mode. If the receiving machinedoes not allow that mode, the initiating machine tries to find a mode thatbothmachines will allow. If the recipient machine does not support any of theconnecting machine's allowed modes, the connection will not be established. For example, suppose that Alice wants to connect to Bob's machine. Her activemode is NightShade, so she starts by trying to set up a NightShade sessionwithBob. However, Bob doesn't allow the NightShade mode, so Alice's machinetries tofind a mode that both parties will allow. It turns out that the only modethatwill work is DES, so NetShade establishes a DES session between Alice andBob. Remember: all of these session negotiation functions happen in the background.Each user merely connects to the desired machine using the standard method(e.g.,mounting a volume with the Chooser); everything else happens automaticallyandinvisibly. Printers and Other Unencrypting Devices NetShade allows you to specify an "exception list" of devices thatcan onlyreceive unencrypted data. For example, since printers do not support encryption,you can add your printer name to this list; even if you have set NetShadetodisallow unencrypted communications, all data sent to the printer will beunencrypted. You can also add the name of a network user to this list. In our samplenetworkconfiguration, for example, Bob could add Carl's name to the exception list.This would enable Bob and Carl to communicate insecurely, even though Bobwouldtypically reject all attempts to establish an insecure session. To use a printer and retain maximum network security, you can assign a computeron your network to act as a dedicated "print spooler." In this scenario,theprinter is removed from the network and attached directly to the dedicatedcomputer; that computer's only job is to forward print jobs to the printer.Since the print spooler can run NetShade, this setup allows you to send encryptedprint jobs over the network. NetShade Network Configurations NetShade on a LAN The examples presented in the earlier parts of this document(Figure 1 and Figure 2) describe typicalNetShade-LAN environments. Adding more or less users to this type of LANenvironment would have little impact on NetShade's performance, althoughas morenetwork users start to run NetShade, the overall security of the LAN trafficwillrise accordingly. NetShade on a WAN Running NetShade on a wide-area network (WAN) is fairly similar tothe LANconfiguration. Figure 3 shows a typical NetShade-WAN arrangement. In a wide-area network, multiple networks are connected using a device calledarouter. When a machine on one network sends data to a machine onanothernetwork, it is passed through the router, which determines where the dataneedsto be forwarded. Since many routers are designed to forward data over insecure public channels--e.g., the Internet or telephone wires -- many organizations use specialencrypting routers to ensure that their data cannot be read in transit. Butsince NetShade encrypts your network data at the source and decrypts it atitsdestination, no special equipment is needed to secure the routed data. In fact, since NetShade encrypts and decrypts your network data at the sourceanddestination points respectively, this is in some ways a superior solutionto anencrypting router. If the encryption took place at the router level, andDwanted to send data to G, that data would still be vulnerable to eavesdroppingbyall the other users on both networks. NetShade's point-to-point encryptionensures that the data cannot be intercepted at any point in trasit, providingsubstantially more security. Now, G can connect with J, A, B and Dsimultaneously, secure in the knowledge that no eavesdroppers will be ableto tapinto any of these links. In some cases, it may be desirable to apply greater security to cross-networkcommunication than to single-network data. Since NetShade can easily beupgradedto support ultra-secure algorithms such as DES and Triple DES, when you sendinformation to a user on a separate network -- for example, when A makesaconnection with J -- you could simply change your active mode to one of thesealgorithms. After the cross-network connection is broken, you can resetyouractive mode to NightShade if you like. NetShade over Apple Remote Access (ARA) Using NetShade over Apple Remote Access is also very similar to usingNetShadeover a LAN. Figure 4 illustrates a typical NetShade-ARA configuration. In this scenario, remote user F logs into ARA server E over a dial-up modemconnection. The ARA connection allows F to communicate with any machineon thenetwork, including E. Assuming that F shares at least one allowed communicationmode (see Using Multiple Encryption Modes section) withA,B, D and E, all the data sent between F and those machines will be encrypted.Since C is not running NetShade, data sent between F and C will not be encrypted. By the same token, even if E (the ARA server) was not running NetShade,datasent between F and A would still be encrypted. Complex NetShade Network Configurations One of the most appealing aspects of NetShade is that it can securenetworktraffic over complex networks, including those with multiple zones and internets,without requiring any knowledge of how the network is set up. As long asyourNetShade machine can send AppleTalk data to any other NetShade machine --regardless of how that data gets there -- you can establish a sealed sessionbetween those two machines.

History of Aikido Why Study Aikido? Yahoo'sAikido Page CIAHome Page What is Aikido? "Aikido is the principle of nonresistance. Because it isnonresistant, it is victorious from the beginning.Those with evil intentions or contentious thoughtsare instantly vanquished." -- Morihei Ueshiba, Founder of Aikido Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art with roots in Jujitsu, Kendo,and Judo. It emphasizes unbalancing throws and pins,and the student learns how to redirect an attacker's motions instead oftrying to stop them by force. As a result, balance and perceptionbecome more important than physical size or strength. The name of Aikido is composed of three Japanese words: ai,meaning harmony; ki, spirit or energy; do, the path,system or way. Aikido is the way of the spirit of harmony. Martial arts are studied for self-defense and self-improvement,but Aikido is different from other martial arts in that thepractitioner seeks to achieve self-defense without injury toattackers. Instead of being a tool for the correction of others,Aikido is a way through which students become more aware of theirown potentials and limitations. Aikido is not a sport. There are no competitive tournaments.The Aikidoist betters his or her self without belittling others.And because Aikido seeks no harm to others, techniques can bepracticed at full power without fear of injury. A History of Aikido Morihei Ueshiba, called O-Sensei (meaning "great teacher"),founded the martial art known throughout the world today asAikido. Born in 1883 in Japan, he dedicated himself to becoming strongafter seeing his father attacked by political opponents. He soughtout and studied with masters in several martial arts, eventuallybecoming an expert in jujitsu (the art of weaponless combat),kenjitsu (combat with a sword), and sojitsu (combat with a spear). Dissatisfied with mere strength and technical mastery,he also immersed himself in religious and philosopical studies.The stories of his immense physical strength and martialprowess are impressive enough, but more important is thelegacy of non-violence and human integrity he has left mankind. In early 20th-century Japan, involvement in the martial partswas a competitive and dangerous business. Contests, feudsand rivalries often resulted in injuries and deaths.The formulation of Aikido dates from an incident thatoccured in 1925. In the course of a discussion about themartial arts, a disagreement arose between O-Sensei and anaval officer who was also a fencing instructor.The officer challenged O-Sensei to a match, and attacked witha wooden sword. O-Sensei faced the officer unarmed, and wonthe match by evading blows until his attacker droppedfrom exhaustion. O-Sensei later recalled that he had felthis opponent's movements before they where executed, and thatthis was the beginning of his enlightenment. He haddefeated an armed attacker without hurting him -- withouteven touching him. O-Sensei later wrote: "Budo (the Martial Way) is notfelling the opponent by our force; nor is it a tool to leadthe world into destruction with arms. True budo is to acceptthe spirit of the universe, keep the peace of the world,correctly produce, protect and cultivate all things in Nature.". O-Sensei continued to practice and teach Aikido into his old age.Observers marveled at his martial abilities, vitality, andgood humor. He was still giving public demonstrations of Aikidoat age 86, four months before his death.After he passed away on April 26, 1969, the Japanese governmentpostumously declared Morihei Ueshiba a Sacred National Treasureof Japan. O-Sensei's son, Kissomaru Ueshiba, inherited the titleDoshu ("Leader of the Way") and continues hisfather's work at Hombu Dojo, Aikido World Headquarters, inTokyo, Japan. Today, Aikido is practiced by men, womenand children throughout the world, and O-Sensei'steachings enrich the lives of thousands of people. Why Study Aikido? Aikido offers practical self-defense, but more importantly,it teaches self-improvement. Aikido is more than the studyof physical techinques. Proper etiquette, attitude andbehavior are also emphasized. Throwing and falling arestressed equally -- one's practice partner is not an opponent.Techniques are acquired by being thrown, andpracticed by throwing. Aikido improves not only one'sphysical conditioning (stamina, balance, flexibility,coordination, strength and resilience) but also mentalconditioning: self confidence, concentration, alertnessand concern for others. Also, Aikido has an ethic: to defend yourself withoutvengeance, to forgive your enemies, and to harmonize withany attack of any description. Aikido technique is ametaphor for a way to lead your life: avoid confrontations,harmonize with unavoidable challenges, and maintain graceunder pressure through good times and bad. Because Aikido does not depend on physical strength, it isattractive to men and women of all sizes and ages, and canbe practiced well into old age. In addition to empty-handedtechniques, techniques using or defending against weaponssuch as the jo (walking staff), bokken(wooden sword), and tanto (knife) are also taught.

Declaration of the UN World Conference on Human Rights June 1993 The need for the protection and promotion of women�s rights as human rights Amnesty International recognises that human rights are indivisible and inter-dependent, and works to promote all the human rights enshrined in the Universal declaration of human rights, through human rights education programmes and campaigning for ratification and implementation of human rights treaties. The Human Rights of women have been specifically targeted by Amnesty International since 1989. In that year the International Women�s Network was founded following the decision at the International Council Meeting, Amnesty International�s supreme governing body, to increase the focus which Amnesty gives to Women�s Rights. The reasons for Amnesty�s specific targeting of Women�s rights lie within the reality of today�s world in which; most of the casualties of war are women and children; most of the world�s poor are women and children and 80% of the world�s refugees are women and children. Women are in double jeopardy. Discriminated against as women, they are also as likely as men, If not more so, to become victims of human rights violations. Few countries treat their women as well as their men. The consequences of this discrimination are terrible. More women and girl-children die each day from various forms of gender based discrimination and violence than from any other form of human rights abuse. Every year, according to the UN Children�s Fund (UNICEF), more than a million infant girls die because they are born female. Every year, because of discrimination, millions of women are mutilated, battered to death, burned alive, stripped of their legal rights and bought and sold in an unacknowledged but international trade in slaves for domestic or sexual purposes. Because of their gender women are at risk of a range of violent abuses by private organisations and individuals. The global status of women has necessitated the specification and clarification of the existing body of international humanitarian law, and promotion of the concept that women�s rights are human rights. Amnesty International sent a delegation to The Fourth UN World Conference on Women of 1995, to work with other NGOs and to lobby for this desperately required specification and implementation of human rights standards. In the following text the results of the conference are reviewed and the question of "where to next?" is discussed. The Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing 1995 In 1995 Amnesty International undertook a campaign on women and human rights which ran from March until the end of September, and culminated in attendance at the fourth world conference on women (FWCW) in Beijing in September of that year. An Amnesty International delegation to the conference presented Amnesty�s message with respect to armed conflict and the human rights of women, universality of human rights and violence against women. Members and groups around the world simultaneously carried out their own demonstrations, exhibitions and vigils, and two staff from the Irish section attended the conference. Amnesty International�s objectives for the FWCW Our primary objective was that the platform for action, which was to be adopted at the conference should include: A clear statement of the current impediments to women�s enjoyment of their human rights but, above all, focus on practical steps which governments will implement to ensure a real and measurable advance in the situation of women in every region of the world. According to Kirsten Timothy, Deputy Director of the UN Division for the advancement of women and coordinator for the fourth world conference on women: "The real battlefield in the fight for women�s equality is still back at home in the context of the cultural, religious and traditional norms that govern our societies. Only by exposing the real situation of women everywhere to public scrutiny can change occur." In the Beijing declaration, the declaration of the conference, governments reaffirmed their commitment to the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. Furthermore they commit themselves to ensuring: "the full implementation of the human rights of women and the girl child as an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms". The Platform for action The platform for action is the document produced by the conference which sets out the actions to be undertaken by governments in the areas of education, review of national laws and implementation of international conventions. It represents an important step by governments all over the world towards acknowledging the reality of human rights violations against women and includes the following important declaration of the universality and indivisibility of all human rights. While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of states, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The platform for action advanced several concepts, such as those that promote sexual rights, the valuation of women�s unpaid work, the equal right of women to inheritance, the condemnation of genital mutilation as a form of violence, the concept that women�s rights are human rights, and the need to take action to curb all forms of violence against women. It weaknesses include a reluctance to identify many human rights violations against women which are prevalent throughout the world, in peace as well as conflict, such as rape or sexual abuse and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. Nonetheless Amnesty International views the platform for action as an important step forward by the world�s governments towards acknowledging the reality of human rights violations against women and girls. Beyond Beijing - The Struggle Continues Governments attending the Fourth UN World Conference on Women agreed in the Platform for Action that: "the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls is a priority for Governments and the UN and is essential for the advancement of women..." and that: "Governments must not only refrain from violating the human rights of all women, but must work actively to promote and protect these rights." ( strategic objective 1, paragraphs 213 and 215) In addition to the broad statement above, individual governments presented their Commitments for the promotion and protection of women�s rights as human rights in plenary speeches at the close of the conference. It is now the focus of Amnesty International, UN agencies and other NGO�s to ensure that governments worldwide fulfil the commitments they undertook at Beijing, to actively disseminate information relating to the conference and to educate women worldwide on what the platform for action could mean for them. To this end a number of human rights groups, including Amnesty International have come together for the purposes of organising a working Conference entitled "Women�s Rights are Human Rights", to take place in Dublin in March of this year - check this page for further information on the upcoming Conference. Amnesty International emphasises the importance of the principle endorsed in Beijing that women�s rights are human rights and will continue to urge that this principle be put into action by governments developing national plans of action for the promotion and protection of women�s human rights, through ongoing lobbying and campaigning activities worldwide.

Jerry is half Irish and half Cherokee Indian. His father was from Donegal, and it is partially because of his Irish roots that the AI Irish Section made the decision to campaign on his behalf, though the main reason is that there is so much evidence to suggest his innocence. Suzanne Harrison was brutally murdered on the evening of May 4th, 1986. Two days later Jerry was arrested. Jerry's conviction was obtained on flawed and scant circumstantial evidence and the dubious testimony of a so-called 'prison witness', to the effect that Jerry had confessed to him. The trial records show that prison employees testified that the alleged contact between Jerry and the witness could not have been possible - due to their housing locations and single recreation status. Jerry was due to be executed last year, but received a stay of execution three days before he was due to be put to death. Amnesty International has recently received news that Jerry is likely to have a new execution date set within the next couple of months. Since 1900 there have been 28 prisoners executed in the USA who were later found to have been innocent. Could Jerry become yet another sad statistic? This is why we need to make people aware of Jerry's case and why Amnesty International is now campaigning on his behalf. Amnesty International believes that the Death Penalty is WRONG in all cases, but is even more so when there is a strong likelihood that the inmate to be executed is innocent. Here are just some of the facts and evidence in this case: EVIDENCE... A car similar to the one owned by Jerry was seen at the scene. This car was a blue and white Blazer with an automatic transmission, bright tail lights, large off-road tyres and a man (not identified as Jerry) was seen in the driver's seat. He could be seen because of the interior light. FACT... Jerry's car was a blue and white Bronco, it had a standard transmission and, because it had recently been in an accident, had no tail lights. It had no interior light and had narrow street-tyres. EVIDENCE... A hair was found on clothing belonging to Jerry. The State said that this hair was from the victim. FACT... This hair was long and blonde, the victim had short auburn hair, while Jerry's wife had long blonde hair. The t-shirt that the hair was found on had been bought the day before Jerry's arrest. EVIDENCE... A semen sample indicated that the murderer was a secretor with foreign markers F, X and B. FACT... Jerry is a non-secretor with foreign markers F and B. Markers can be dropped during testing, but not picked up. EVIDENCE... Jerry was convicted of another offence that allegedly took place at the same time, but in another county. FACT... True! The drive from the location of the other offence to the location of the murder is approximately one hour. There were two witnesses who could identify Jerry for this robbery, but not one witness who could identify him as the murderer. He received 20 years for the robbery and the death penalty for the murder!

Njuguna NGENGI, councillor for Molo, farmer On 13 December 1996 Koigi wa Wamwere was released on bail from imprisonment on the grounds of ill-health. He remains in Nairobi Hospital and is due to travel to the United Kingdom shortly for the urgent medical treatment which he needs for his heart complaint. Speaking by telephone from the hospital to a member of Amnesty International�s International Secretariat, Koigi wa Wamwere said that he was "very, very happy for all the work that Amnesty International has done on my behalf". He requested that his deep gratitude be passed on to everybody who had sent appeals, saying that he believed these had had a crucial effect in both preventing a death sentence in October 1995 and in his current release. He expressed the hope that he will "get an opportunity to thank them in a better way". Amnesty International welcomes the release of Koigi wa Wamwere but continues to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Charles Kuria Wamwere and G.G. Njuguna Ngengi as prisoners of conscience. Both are in need of the special diets they have been prescribed in hospital but are reportedly not receiving. G.G. Njuguna Ngengi has non-insulin dependent diabetes and Charles Kuria Wamwere has a stomach problem, and their poor diets mean that these complaints are exacerbated. FURTHER RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send telegrams/telexes/faxes/express/ airmail letters in English or in your own language:- welcoming the release on bail of Koigi wa Wamwere for medical treatment abroad; - urging that, as a prisoner of conscience, his release be made unconditional; - expressing renewed concern for G.G.

The European Union (EU) should take decisive action now to help prevent further deaths of forcibly displaced Colombian peasant farmers, Amnesty International said today as representatives of the farmers continue their visit to several European countries. Even in the past few days, the paramilitary have killed four peasant farmers from the Bellacruz Ranch. How many more have to die before a strong, clear message is sent to the Colombian Government that justice should be done and paramilitary activities should be brought to an end," the organization said. Last October, the European Parliament adopted a resolution expressing concern about the human rights situation faced by the 280 peasant farmer families forcibly evicted by a paramilitary group from lands in the Bellacruz Ranch, department of Cesar. In urging the EU to take further steps, the organization noted the EU�s ongoing program of cooperation with the Andean countries, including Colombia. "The very nature of that cooperation places the EU in a unique position to demand stronger action on the part of the Colombian Government to protect the basic human rights of its citizens," Amnesty International said. "An ever increasing number of people are dying at the hands of the paramilitaries who commit atrocities with almost total impunity. It is only when these perpetrators are held to account for their crimes that the Colombian Government will be sending a clear message that this will not be tolerated." Amnesty International welcomes yesterday�s call by Dick Spring, Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs, for respect for human rights with regards to the Bellacruz case and the organization hopes that this will secure a strong response from the European Union (EU) and its Member States (Ireland currently holds the presidency of the EU). Amnesty International has been echoing Colombian human rights organizations in making repeated calls to the Colombian authorities to protect the lives of the nearly 2,000 individuals forcibly displaced from the ranch by illegal paramilitary forces operating with the support of the Colombian army. Nevertheless, the threats and killings by the paramilitary have continued, and the recent killings of four more peasant farmers just a few days ago raise to at least 30 the number of civilian farmers killed or "disappeared" as a result of the Bellacruz conflict. Brothers Diosenel, Dinael and Jos� del Carmen Toscano were killed on 5 December, in front of their young children by members of a paramilitary group who entered the house where they were hiding in Valledupar, department of Cesar. Their brother, peasant farmer leader Jes�s Toscano, was killed three days earlier in Pelaya, also in the department of Cesar, after returning to his house to collect some things. The paramilitary members responsible for killing Jes�s reportedly swore they would kill the whole Toscano family, and are said to have been looking for several months for Ariel Toscano, a fifth brother, who they also intend to kill. On 22 November, Amnesty International warned of a likely increase of human rights abuses by the paramilitary group operating in the Bellacruz Ranch and neighbouring areas, after documenting a paramilitary meeting said to have taken place on the ranch on 15 November. A death list was displayed at the meeting, and those present reportedly agreed that the Bellacruz peasant farmers would be persecuted and killed wherever they went, as a lesson for the denunciations brought by them at national and international level. "The brutal killing of four members of the Toscano families -- and the very real threat faced by others -- are clear indications that the fears expressed were well founded, and that lack of action on the part of the Colombian authorities is costing more and more lives every day," Amnesty International said.

In its report Human Rights Defenders on the Front Line, Amnesty International surveys the situation in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico and concludes that there is a persistent pattern of intimidation and persecution of defenders in the region, including in those countries undergoing peace processes and political transitions. "Governments renege all too frequently on two of their most important obligations, the promotion and protection of human rights. Furthermore, they attack those who carry out these activities, or allow others to attack them with impunity," the human rights organization said. "Solidarity and grassroots action to promote human rights values is often the only tool civil society has to protect these rights. Members of these organizations, or isolated individuals, should be protected, not targeted." A wide range of non-governmental organizations, individuals and associations - trade unions, popular and religious organizations, etc - are part of the struggle for the defence of human rights. Defenders include lawyers, journalists, peasant leaders, trade unionists, students, relatives of victims and many others who denounce and investigate violations, support and protect the victims, campaign for an end to impunity, promote human rights education and mobilize their communities by means of campaigns to end violations. In Mexico, Amnesty International has observed a new, alarming and increasing pattern of abuses against human rights defenders which has meant that practically all organizations dedicated to this task have lately suffered intimidation, threats and even attacks because of their work. In recent months, some members of these organizations have been targets of abduction followed by torture by individuals believed to be linked to the security forces. Even prominent members of the clergy involved in human rights defence have been threatened and attacked. On 29 June 1995, gunmen opened fire on Catholic bishop Arturo Lona Reyes, a well-known human rights defender and chairperson of the Tepeyac Human Rights Centre in Tehuantepec, state of Oaxaca. Samuel Ruiz, also a Catholic bishop, has also been persecuted because of his work on behalf of indigenous peasants in the state of Chiapas. In Honduras, many people involved directly or indirectly in the investigation of serious human rights violations committed in the past, both as representatives of civil society and of the investigative apparatus of the state, are constant targets of threats intimidation and attacks by members of the security forces. Members of the judiciary, such as the judges Mar�a Antonieta Mendoza de Castro and Roy Medina, have received death threats as a result of their role in bringing cases against members of the military. Prosecution lawyers in trials of military personnel, such as Linda Lizzy Rivera, the prosecuting lawyer in the trial of two officers eventually sentenced for the rape and murder of a 16-year old, have been the target of threats or attacks. Even the Commissioner for Human Rights, Leo Valladares, has received anonymous telephone calls, obliging him to take special measures to protect members of his family. In Guatemala, although there is currently no deliberate government policy of repression, information gathered by Amnesty International indicates that those working to end impunity - judges, lawyers, journalists, members of human rights organizations - are frequent victims of torture, extrajudicial executions, abductions and death threats by agents linked to the state�s security forces. According to the United Nations Independent Expert for Guatemala, Monica Pinto, the same situation is faced by "all organized sectors of civil society and those who support the peace process in general." Amnesty International maintains that these human rights violations are carried out with the consent or complicity of certain public officials. Practically all those involved in the investigation of the murder in 1990 of anthropologist Myrna Mack have been threatened or attacked in some way: the police commissioner in charge of the investigation was murdered in 1991; judge Mar�a Eugenia Villase�or, author of a book critical of the way the judiciary has handled the case, has received repeated threats and one of the police officers responsible for her protection was abducted and beaten. In 1996, those suspected of masterminding the killing were released on bail. In El Salvador, despite a decrease in the scale of human rights violations since the end of the civil conflict, people active in the defence of human rights continue to be subjected to threats, attacks and intimidation. The premises of the Salvadorean Women�s Movement, the Committee of Relatives of Victims of Human Rights Violations and FUNDASIDA, an organization dedicated to the care of those affected by AIDS, have been repeatedly raided and the organizations� members have often been threatened. The most dramatic incident was the May 1994 killing of Alexander Rodas Abarca, a guard at the offices of the Salvadorean Women�s Movement. In 1995, the director of the Human Rights Institute of the University of Central America, Benjamin Cuellar, was also attacked by unknown individuals immediately after taking part in an event commemorating the killing of six Jesuit priests by the security forces in 1989. Amnesty International highlights the emergence of groups dedicated to intimidation and the persistence of "death squads". Among the most notorious is the Roberto D�Aubuisson Nationalist Force, FURODA, whose first public statement in June 1996 threatened fifteen people with death, including several members of the Catholic church and the National Human Rights Procurator, Victoria Marina Vel�squez. In view of this situation, Amnesty International is calling on governments of the region explicitly to acknowledge the legitimacy and value of the work of human rights defenders and to adopt administrative and legal measures to prevent any restrictions on this work. The human rights organization is also urging greater cooperation and support by governments for United Nations staff involved in human rights monitoring in those countries where the UN has missions. Amnesty International also recommends that the Organization of American States (OAS) initiate the drafting of an Inter-American Declaration on the Protection of Human Rights Defenders at the next session of its General Assembly, and that it include a chapter on human rights defenders in its annual report.

The executions were described by a special representative of the 40-nation Council of Europe as barbaric and in defiance of the commitment Ukraine made to institute an immediate moratorium on executions on joining the Council of Europe in November 1995. "This is a shameful number of executions -- only China is known to have executed more prisoners this year," Amnesty International said today. The executions were disclosed at a news conference on Friday 29 November in Kiev, Ukraine, at the end of an international seminar on the death penalty organized by the Council of Europe. In a dramatic statement, Zsolt Nemeth, Council of Europe rapporteur on the honouring of obligations and commitments by Ukraine, told journalists he had just received the "shocking" information. He said that the executions could only be characterized as "barbarism" and called into question the credibility of Ukraine. "Ukraine must now institute an immediate moratorium on executions and provide a timetable for abolishing the death penalty," Zsolt Nemeth said."We cannot be satisfied with promises. We need to see concrete plans." Zsolt Nemeth called on the Ukrainian authorities to disclose the names of those executed -- under a 1993 law, information on the death penalty is a state secret. He said that executed prisoners were buried in unmarked graves and their families were not notified of the executions. After this disclosure Ukrainian Minister of Justice Serhiy Holovaty confirmed that 89 prisoners were executed in the first six months of 1996. He told the news conference he believed Ukraine must honour its commitment to stop executions. Eric Prokosch, an Amnesty International representative, told the news conference that Ukraine must take five steps to implement its commitment to the Council of Europe. First, there must be a political decision not to sign any more execution orders. Second, this decision must be formalized by the central government issuing an order to all prison governors that no further executions are to be carried out. These two steps should be taken immediately. Third, the government must begin to prepare public opinion to accept the abolition of the death penalty. Fourth, it must sign Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights, providing for the abolition of the death penalty in peacetime. Lastly, the government and parliament must prepare and enact legislation to remove the death penalty from the country's penal code. The number of executions disclosed by the Council of Europe rapporteur confirms reports received by Amnesty International that approximately 100 people were executed this year. Amnesty International has been able to confirm five of those executions, one in March, one in June, two in August and one in October. The organization has appealed to President Leonid Kuchma to grant clemency to all death penalty prisoners, but President Kuchma never replied to the appeals. Birger Hagard, Chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, said at the news conference it was hard to understand why this number of executions had happened. "Ukraine hurts itself by having these executions," he said. "Ukraine hurts its reputation as a free country with relations to the rest of Europe." According to Amnesty International, the relatives of Sergey Tekuchev, executed in October, have claimed that he was innocent and that his confession was obtained under duress. There are claims that the emergency services were called six times in October 1994 to treat him for injuries resulting from beatings in custody and that the prison authorities refused to pass to him medication from his relatives. BACKGROUND Ukraine committed itself on 26 September 1995 to sign Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights within one year of accession to the Council of Europe "and to put into place, with immediate effect from the day of accession, a moratorium on executions". It acceded to the Council of Europe on 9 November 1995. The Council of Europe is an intergovernmental organization comprising 40 western and eastern European states. Its Parliamentary Assembly adopted a policy in June 1996 that any new state joining the Council must stop executions immediately and indicate its willingness to abolish the death penalty.

Manuel Manriquez San Agustin is a musician and member ofthe Otomi indigenous community of Rancheria Piedra Blanca,Tutotepec in the State of Hidalgo. He was arbitrarily arrestedwithout warrant by the PJDF in Mexico City on 2 June 1990. Likemany Indian defendants in Mexico, he was allegedly detainedbecause of his ethnic and economic background, which the policeinterpreted as precluding his access to lawyers or complaintsmechanisms. Manuel Manriquez, who did not speak nor writeSpanish at the time remained incommunicado for four days underpolice custody and was brutally tortured with beatings; nearasphyxiation with plastic bags over his head; carbonated waterwith chilli forced into his nose (a method known as tehuacanazo,which takes it's name from a popular brand of mineral water)burns, and electric shocks to sensitive parts of his body andwas forced to "sign" papers he could not understand. He was accused of murder and brought before a judge who, based on the defendant's "signed confession" remanded Manuel Manriquez SanAgustin to the Reclusorio Preventivo Norte on charges of murder. Despite the illegality of his detention, the clear signs oftorture - which were later certified by a prison doctor - and thelack of evidence other than his signed statements without aninterpreter to support the charges was sentenced in July 1991to 24 years imprisonment. The sentence was confirmed on appealon February 1992, despite lack of any further evidence. His case was also presented before the National Human RightsCommission (CNDH) which has issued a statement on his behalfacknowledging his torture, to no avail. Since his arrest....has learnt to speak and read Spanish and, in September 1991,co-founded a human rights organisation with other indigenousprisoners: the Comision de Defensa Campesina e Indigena delComite Ricardo Lopez Juarez, which has actively campaignedon behalf of the rights of Indians and peasants imprisoned inthe Reclusorio Preventivo Norte and other prisons in Mexico. Manuel Manriquez has become increasingly involved in campaigningfor an end to torture and other human rights violations inMexico. For example, on the first of April 1993 he joined ahunger strike carried out in several Mexican prisons by morethan 50 prisoners. The inmates were calling for an end totorture and for fair and prompt trials in the Mexican criminaljustice system. In March 1994 a recurso de amparo was presented on his behalf, before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Federal District in order to contest the legality of his sentence. It was rejected in September 1994 and his sentence was confirmed. At the end of July 1994 Manuel Manriquez began his fourth hunger strike since imprisonment, calling for the release of scores of those reportedly under false charges in Mexican prisons and, in desperation at the repeated lack of effective response from the authorities, on 15 August 1994 he stitched his lips in protest and began a dry hunger strike refusing to take any liquids or solid foods for over a week. Hegave up his hunger strike on 23 august and was transferred tohospital where he received medical attention. In October 1994 Manuel Manriquez solicitor submitted another recurso de amparo on his behalf, which by September 1995 had not beenresponded to by the courts. On 11 November 1994 Manuel Manriquez was transferred, without any previous warning, from the prison in Mexico City. His transferral took place in the late hours of the night and he was deprived of his personal belongings. It was reportedly carried out in response to hispeaceful activism on behalf of prisoners' human rights . He washeld incommunicado for four days before being allowed to see hissolicitor. In January 1995 he was interviewed in prison by anAmnesty International delegate, who had visited him twice beforein 1992 and 1993. Amnesty International, who considers ManuelManriquez San Agustin to be a prisoner of conscience, continuesto call for his immediate and unconditional release.

(� Peter Jordan/Network) Successive Turkish governments have talked publicly of progress on human rights. In reality the security forces violate human rights with impunity. For 12 years a bloody conflict has raged between government forces and armed opposition groups, principally the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK). Both sides have committed gross human rights abuses. Many victims are civilians who took no part in the conflict. A wide range of "security" measures have been introduced on the grounds that they are necessary to defeat the armed opposition. The reality is that these brutal and repressive methods, which have failed to deliver public security, pose a serious threat to the personal security of the Turkish citizen. Torture and ill-treatment have long been widespread. The 1990s have seen an unprecedented wave of political killings and more than 100 "disappearances". Many members of Turkish civil society clearly think that it is time to set a new agenda. Ordinary people realise that, without proper safeguards, extraordinary "security" measures put everyone at risk of human rights violations. This campaign echoes their calls to defend human rights. The reforms which would bring Turkey into line with international human rights standards are neither complex nor expensive. On the contrary, they are no more than an extension of principles already recognised in Turkish law. They can be implemented now. Relatives of the "disappeared" protest every Saturday in Istanbul. (� S. Dayanan) WHAT GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT WISH TO BE SEEN AS A DEFENDER OF CHILDREN'S HUMAN RIGHTS? Opinion piece by Pierre San�, Secretary General, Amnesty International Just last year, Turkey made a very public pledge to uphold the right of all children not to be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Turkey ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This is the public face of the Turkish Government -- the one the Turkish politicians, diplomats and generals want your government to see. But that same government has another face. It is a face which your government would probably recognise, but has too often chosen to ignore. In the very same year that Turkey declared that the torture of children was not to be tolerated, five school students in Manisa reported that during their detention police blindfolded them, stripped them naked, hosed them with cold water and subjected them to electric shocks -- including to their genitalia. The boys were allegedly raped with truncheons, while the girls were also threatened with rape and forced gynaecological examinations. These students had been charged with membership in or connections with an illegal political organisation. None of them was older than 16 years of age. How can a government pledged to uphold the human rights of its children allow state agents to commit such shocking violations? One 14-year-old boy gave the following account of his ordeal: "I had to undress...They asked questions that were nothing to do with me; when I said I did not know, they twisted my testicles...Four of them held me by the hands and arms and gave electric shocks to my right thumb, to my sexual organs, to my arms and to my stomach...Afterwards I had no feeling in my right foot and sexual organ." This and other torture testimonies are supported by medical reports from the hospitals where the students were treated during their detention. In June 1996, 10 police officers were indicted for ill-treatment and using torture to extract confessions. So which is the true face of Turkey? The valued member of the international community which has promised to protect the human rights of all its citizens? Or the country where torture has long been endemic -- as documented by Amnesty International for more than three decades? The Turkish Government and your own government may well wish to focus on the first, more agreeable image. The one polished and sold in the corridors of Geneva, Strasbourg and Brussels by the skilful diplomats and the clever public relations agents. Better for NATO strategy, better for European geopolitical interests, better for business they might argue. They may even suggest that sometimes national security concerns have to come before human rights -- especially when you are facing a threat from armed opposition groups who are themselves frequently perpetrators of human rights abuses. But what about the security of the five students from Manisa? Of the elderly, the children, the women, the members of minority groups, the lawyers, doctors, and even members of parliament who are at risk of torture or ill-treatment in police custody in Turkey? Surely true security for any country must be based upon human rights guarantees for all its citizens. After all, human rights violations are criminal offences in Turkey. Torture, "disappearance" and political killings by the security forces are outlawed in Turkish domestic legislation and by international human rights treaties which Turkey is obliged to uphold. Yet these violations are committed on a gross scale. No government has ever made a systematic attempt to eradicate them. Amnesty International believes that this situation is not beyond remedy. In its current international campaign on Turkey, the organisation has proposed a program of practical, realistic reforms which the Turkish Government could implement at once given sufficient political will. Amnesty International believes that with the firm backing of the international community, this program could bring about an immediate improvement in the human rights of all Turkish citizens. Likewise, the human rights organisation is calling on armed opposition groups in the country to end human rights abuses for which they are responsible -- and to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law. Governments around the world must recognise that the time has come to end their reluctance to act decisively on Turkey human rights record. There can be no justification for the torture of the five students from Manisa -- or for the countless other Turkish citizens who have glimpsed the state's less public face behind locked doors. There can be no security without human rights.

The youngsters were there, they were blindfolded and some of them were naked." Sabri Erg�l, member of parliament for the Republican People's Party, reporting on his unannounced visit to Manisa Police Headquarters. D�NE TALUN, MAHIR G. AND HALIL IBRAHIM OKKALI D�ne Talun D�NE TALUN was just 12 years old when she was arrested in January 1995. Her crime? She was suspected of stealing bread. For five days she was illegally held at Ankara Police Headquarters without access to her family or a lawyer: "They tied me up and connected a wire to my fingers. Then one of them switched on the generator. They also gave me shocks to my face... One of them beat me with his walkie-talkie hard on the head". No one was prosecuted for torturing D�ne Talun. The system which propagates torture in Turkey had once again served to protect torturers. The trial of Mahir G. and 15 other young defendants allegedly tortured at Manisa Police Headquarters MAHIR G. was 14 years old when he and 15 other students and young people were detained in December 1995. The authorities claimed that they were members of the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front and accused them of writing slogans on walls, distributing leaflets and of starting a fire in a barber's shop - despite reports from the fire brigade that the fire appeared to be an accident. The students say that they were held in Manisa Police Headquarters and tortured for 10 days. Mahir's testimony shows what can happen when members of the security forces feel they are above the law. "...about 10 police fell upon me...They kept hitting my head and stomach...They forced me to undress and kept me under a cold shower...they twisted my testicles...Four of them held me by the hands and gave electric shocks to my right thumb, to my sexual organs, to my arms and to my stomach..." Halil Ibrahim Okkali with his mother HALIL IBRAHIM OKKALI, aged 12, was arrested on 27th November 1995 on suspicion of theft. When his father came to pick him up later that evening he was covered in bruises. He was subsequently treated in intensive care and had his arm put in plaster. Halil says that when he was taken to �inarli Police Station in Izmir two police officers interrogated him. They beat him repeatedly with their truncheons and kicked him when he fell down. A complaint was filed and a trial against two police officers was opened in March 1996. Children at riskNo one who finds themselves in a Turkish police station is safe from torture, not even a child. Children and young people, many arrested on suspicion of minor offences, are being tortured and ill-treated in police stations and denied the special protection which the law provides for them. Turkish law recognises that children need special safeguards. It states that those under 16 years old can only be interrogated by a prosecutor and in the presence of a lawyer. But these provisions are often flouted. Children from less advantaged backgrounds seem to be particularly at risk. So are children and young people charged under the Anti-Terror Law. For decades Amnesty International has been drawing attention to the underlying causes which allow torture and ill-treatment to persist: incommunicado police detention, the failure to investigate torture allegations and the failure to ensure that those responsible for torture and ill-treatment are brought to justice. Turkish law recognises that children are particularly vulnerable; in order to make these safeguards effective, the Turkish Government should not only prosecute and punish torturers but also impose strong penalties against police or gendarmerie officers who ignore proper custody procedures for children.

Next time we will kill you. And we will do it so that no one will find your body." ALI EKBER KAYA Ali Ekber Kaya Ali Ekber Kaya is one of the many courageous people who, at great personal risk, have spoken out in defence of human rights in Turkey. A civil servant and father of three, he was president of the Tunceli branch of the Human Rights Association (HRA), a politically independent organisation founded in 1986 which has outspokenly condemned violations of human rights. The Tunceli branch has now closed down as a result of threats and harassment. In March 1995 Ali Ekber Kaya was detained and taken to the Anti-Terror Branch of Tunceli Police Headquarters on suspicion of having links with an illegal organisation: "�I was taken to the �torture room�. I guess there were at least seven or eight police officers present. I had to sit down and they tied my arms to my legs. Then they hosed me with cold pressurised water. They pointed the water jet particularly at sensitive areas of the body such as the kidneys, genitals and rectum. They lifted me up so that my whole weight hung on my arms. While hanging in the air they gave me electric shocks through my fingers and genitals� Due to hard beating two of my ribs were broken� After I was released I visited a doctor who confirmed that my ribs had been broken� He was afraid to write a report because of possible risks." Ali Ekber Kaya made a formal complaint about his torture, but no decision has yet been taken to prosecute those responsible. He was released in May 1995 and has been cleared of all charges. But the threats and harassment against him, his family and other HRA activists continue. His torturers remain free: "I meet my torturers almost every day in the street or the market. Sometimes they say �hello� or invite me for a tea. They are not ashamed at all." A human rights worker from the Van branch of the HRA in southeast Turkey takes down the testimony of a victim of a forced village evacuation. The branch office later closed after members received death threats. Human rights defenders Human rights defenders in Turkey are under intense pressure from the authorities. Many have been threatened, imprisoned and tortured; some have paid for their commitment to human rights with their lives. Human rights defenders who document abuses against people suspected of belonging to armed groups are often accused of supporting these groups. In December 1994, for example, the General Director of Security, who later became the Minister of Justice, claimed that allegations of torture were only made with "the aim of undermining the police force�s struggle against terrorism". Such statements put human rights defenders at even greater risk. For decades Amnesty International has documented the widespread and systematic use of torture and ill-treatment in Turkey. The factors which contribute to this gross abuse of human rights remain unchanged. Principal among them are incommunicado detention, the failure of the judicial system to investigate allegations of torture, and the almost complete impunity enjoyed by members of the security forces who continue to be protected by high-ranking police and gendarmerie officers, prosecutors, courts and even Turkish law.

She is now totally dependent on her fellow prisoners to help her to eat and dress. Her right arm is paralysed and she has only limited movement in her left arm. She is often in severe pain and suffers from recurrent nightmares. The cause of her pain and nightmares lie in the 13 days she was detained at the Istanbul Police Headquarters before being brought before a judge. Here she describes how she was tortured during the first week of detention: "�I was seized in the street in Besiktas by plainclothes police. I was hit in front of passers-by and� pushed into an ordinary taxi� When we arrived at Security Headquarters in Aksaray, they dragged me inside by my hair� From then on I was blindfolded� they stripped me naked and started to hang me up. They bound my shoulders to a beam and hoisted me up� They held me under cold pressurised water� For days they subjected me to countless hanging sessions. They made an unsuccessful attempt to rape me� they did not let me sleep. For the first few days they did not even give me any water to drink�" The nightmare has not ended for G�lderen Baran. The same system which allowed her to be tortured continues to deny her the medical care she needs. She is receiving some physiotherapy for her injuries, but sometimes is not allowed to keep her appointments. On her way to hospital she is handcuffed, although doctors have expressly advised that handcuffs should not be used. G�lderen Baran is being tried under the Anti-Terror Law for membership of an illegal organisation and carrying out an armed attack on a police vehicle. She has lodged a complaint, but those who tortured her remain free. An interrogation room in a police station in Turkey. Council of Europe officials making unannounced visits to Turkish police stations have found equipment apparently used for torture. Widespread torture Torture is widespread and systematic in Turkey although domestic and international law forbid the torture of any detainee, no matter what the offence. Two intergovernmental organisations - the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (ECPT) and the UN Committee against Torture - have found that torture is widespread in Turkish police stations and that Turkish law provides insufficient safeguards against torture. The ECPT, which has unique powers to visit member countries and enter places of detention unannounced, reported in December 1992 that it had found equipment apparently used for the purpose of torturing detainees in police headquarters in Ankara, the capital, and Diyarbakir. The practices which facilitate torture - extended incommunicado detention, inadequate medical reports and official refusal to investigate allegations of torture - still exist. The basic safeguards against torture - the right of access to lawyers, doctors, friends and relatives - do not. Medical examinations often consist of no more than a quick glance at a fully clothed patient at the other end of a room by a doctor fearful of giving an accurate record of the patient�s injuries. The maximum detention period for people detained under the Anti-Terror Law is 15 days - 30 days in the provinces under a state of emergency. Detainees report that interrogation usually takes place only in the first few days. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that long periods of detention are designed primarily to allow time for the wounds inflicted to heal. In some cases the wounds may never heal. UPDATEA trial has been opened against five policemen of the Anti-Terror Department of the Istanbul Police Force in connection with the torture of G�lderen Baran. The policemen are believed to have been accused of violating Article 243 of the Turkish Penal Code, according to which a public official is forbidden to use torture or inhuman acts to force confessions from suspects.

At the entrance I was confronted by six or seven security personnel who blocked my way. Within seconds three military people with rifles came running from the direction of the office building." Kees Marges, special representative of the International Transport Workers' Federation visiting sacked transport workers in Turkey in July 1995. HALIL DIN� Halil Din� Halil Din� is the president of the Turkish transport workers� union, T�MTIS, in Izmir. On 22 December 1995 he joined a peaceful protest by about 100 members outside the headquarters of Nak-Kargo, a transport company. The T�MTIS members had gathered in solidarity with 43 workers at Nak-Kargo sacked for refusing to give up their union membership. The T�MTIS representatives asked for a meeting with the management of the company. The response was an attack by riot police which left Halil Din� with a head wound requiring seven stitches and injuries which kept him off work for seven days. "�anti-riot police and police from the local �amdibi police station� started to beat us without any warning although we had gathered peacefully. The anti-riot police beat us with truncheons. The chief of �amdibi police station beat me over the head with his walkie-talkie� While my head was bleeding the anti-riot police went on beating me with truncheons, especially on the head. They also punched and kicked me�" "�Only a few days after I received the head injury and was still wearing a bandage around my head, police beat me again on the head with their fists." When Halil Din� and seven other trade unionists went to the police station to complain about the beatings, they were detained for 24 hours. T�MTIS members continued to picket the Nak-Kargo offices every day - one of the many protests organised by Turkish workers in defence of their right to union organisation. Although the freedom to organise is recognised by the Turkish Constitution, trade union activities are often brutally repressed. Bulent Beci, a member of T�MTIS, was beaten by gendarmes during an industrial dispute in July 1995. Trade unionists under attack Hundreds of thousands of Turkish have joined in protests since April 1994 when the government of Prime Minister Tansu �iller introduced an economic "austerity package". A wave of anger spread across the country as inflation rose to 150 per cent and over 650,000 workers lost their jobs. Outside the militarised areas of the southeast, the state tolerates political debate in controlled environments such as newspapers and television. Politics on the street is another matter. Turkish citizens who air their grievances in public risk arrest and beatings. Turkish trade unionists have suffered brutal repression. They have been harassed, detained and beaten. Demonstrations have been violently dispersed by the police and union members have been prosecuted under the Anti-Terror Law for speeches made during union meetings. Employers have increasingly used private security guards, as well as the security forces, to intimidate workers. Turkish law imposes many restrictions on trade union rights. Most of the restrictions date from the period of military rule. In 1991 the government committed itself to bringing legislation into line with international standards, but little has been done to put this commitment into practice. The state continues to attack the right to organise, to freedom of association and freedom of expression.

Slogan on a wall poster produced by the Turkish Human Rights Association and banned by the governors of Istanbul and Ankara. FEHMI TOSUN Hanim Tosun, wife of Fehmi Tosun. Fehmi Tosun, a 36-year-old construction worker, was last seen in the custody of three plainclothes officers outside his home in the Avcilar district of Istanbul in October 1995. Hanim Tosun describes the last time she saw her husband: "�I went out on to the balcony. I saw two burly people holding Fehmi by the arms and dragging him towards a white Broadway car. Fehmi was shouting, �Help, they are taking me away to kill me� and struggling not to be put in the car. I ran down shouting. When I got there they had not yet put Fehmi in the car. He was shouting all the time. I ran towards the car, but it drove away at speed." Hanim Tosun�s appeals to the authorities for information have gone unanswered. She and her daughters do not know what has happened to him. The authorities have shown a callous lack of concern for the families of the "disappeared". Relatives who have tried to draw attention to their plight have faced further violations of their human rights. Kiymet Tekin said that she was kicked and insulted and called "a mother of a terrorist" when she went to inquire about her son Ahmet Tekin, who was detained while on a bus travelling from Diyarbakir to the village of Darakol on 7 May 1994. Ahmet was never seen again. Hurmuz Diril, an elder of Kovankaya village in Hakkari province was imprisoned when he went to Beyt�ssebab to make inquiries about Ilyas Edip Diril and Zeki Ercan Diril, two "disappeared" children of his village. Emine Ocak, mother of Hasan Ocak who "disappeared" in Istanbul in March 1995 and whose body was later found on vacant ground, was beaten by police at her son�s graveside in July 1995. Her daughter Maside was one of 42 people beaten, dragged along the ground and detained overnight after coming to pay their respects. Emine Ocak, shortly before being detained in Istanbul on 8 July 1995. She was among a group of families of the "disappeared" who had been demonstrating in Istanbul's Istiklal Street when police wielding truncheons broke up the protest. 'Disappearance': how to torture a whole family "Disappearances" are a new and disturbing development in Turkey. Ten years ago, people did not "disappear" in Turkey. In 1994 there were more than 50 reported "disappearances", the highest number in any country according to the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. For many years Amnesty International highlighted the factors which contribute to human rights abuses: long periods of incommunicado detention and interrogation; official refusal to investigate allegations of human rights violations; the almost complete impunity enjoyed by members of security forces responsible for violations; and a legal and judicial framework which sanctions these practices. These factors persist and are now contributing to the increasing incidence of "disappearances". "Disappearance" is a human rights violation inflicted not only upon the victims but also upon their families. The law as well as brute force has been used to suppress campaigns by the families of the "disappeared" to find out what happened to their loved ones and to bring those responsible to justice. Relatives who have attempted to draw public attention to their plight have been subjected to insults, beatings and detention by police.

We will bury you here and no one will ever find out.' I was terrified." MENSURE Y�KSEL ERDOHAN Mensure Y�ksel Erdohan Mensure Y�ksel Erdohan became editor-in chief of the newspaper �zg�r �lke (Free Land) after its offices were bombed in late 1994. The publication was closed by the authorities in February 1995. She was arrested and charged with more than 30 offences under Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, which imposes up to three years� imprisonment for allegedly "separatist" statements, even if non-violent. After five months in prison, and facing possibly decades of further imprisonment, Mensure Y�ksel Erdohan tried to leave the country. She was detained near the border on 24 September 1995, and later interrogated at Edirne and Istanbul Police Headquarters. She says she was sexually assaulted and subjected to electric shocks. Her requests to see a lawyer were ignored, and her family and lawyer�s applications to see her were rejected. "In detention at Istanbul Police Headquarters I was subjected to electric shocks�When my statement was being taken, my breasts were pulled out and fondled�They beat me until I fainted�They told me: 'We'll stick a dirty weapon in your hand and dump a whole lot of armed actions on you. You'll spend all your life in prison'." Mensure Y�ksel Erdohan was formally arrested on 5 October 1995, after 12 days in detention. She complained of torture both to the prosecutor and the judge. She claims that the judge deliberately prevented her complaint from being noted in the file by interrupting her, stopping the court recorder and changing the subject. While pressure on journalists is greatest in the southeast, reporters covering the activities of the security forces are at risk wherever they work. In Istanbul, Metin G�ktepe, a photographer, was covering the funeral of political prisoners who had been beaten to death in prison in early January 1996. Police stopped the funeral and detained hundreds of people. Metin G�ktepe's body was found on 8 January in the grounds of a sports centre where the detainees had been taken. He had been beaten to death. The Istanbul offices of the daily �zg�r �lke following a huge bomb explosion in December 1994. The attack followed a period of official harassment of the publication. Targeting journalistsTurkey is one of the most dangerous countries in the world in which to pursue a career in journalism. Fourteen journalists covering human rights issues in southeast Turkey have been killed or have "disappeared" at the hands of the security forces since 1992. Others have been imprisoned and tortured. Journalists throughout Turkey are at risk. A photographer for a national daily paper was allegedly beaten to death by police officers in Istanbul in January 1996. Officials have failed to condemn the killings of journalists, but have been quick to rebuke the newspapers for which they worked on the grounds that they propagate "separatist" opinions. A confidential government circular accused the newspaper �zg�r �lke of being "an important threat"; less than three days later, on 3 December 1994, the newspaper�s offices in Istanbul and Ankara were bombed, killing one employee and wounding 19. Turkey has a lively media sector. Turkish citizens now have more access to information and ideas in the news media than ever before. Yet the authorities enforce severe restrictions on freedom of expression when it comes to security issues or Kurdish "separatism". Freedom of expression is meaningless as long as journalists cannot report events without risking their liberty or their lives.

In short, we will be pulling out all the stops to put pressureon governments, inter-governmental organizations and the businesscommunity to take concrete action to bring about real changesin the human rights situation in China. In China, no-one is safe from human rights violations. The Chinese authorities have created swathes of repressive legislationto detain or intimidate political opponents, human rights defenders,members of religious and ethnic groups and others. And vague laws open to interpretation are used as a weapon toachieve the exact same ends. Unless this whole apparatus is overhauled, no one in China willbe safe." Extract from a statement by PIERRE SANÉ, SECRETARYGENERAL of AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL 15 MARCH 1996, HONG KONG CULTURAL CENTRE Victims of human rights violations in China are numberedin the hundreds of thousands. Torture is endemic. So is ill-treatment.Thousands of political prisoners are in jail, after trials atwhich the verdict was decided in advance. Countless numbers ofpeople are held in administrative detention without being charged.Each year thousands of people are sentenced to death. In 1994Amnesty International recorded three times as many executionsin China as in the rest of the world put together. No one is safe in China. Repressive legislation and the widespreadabuse of power mean that everyone - not just political dissidents- is at risk. Some violations are committed with the full backingof the law; others, such as torture, continue in breach of thelaw. China has undergone an economic revolution in recent times. Thishas significantly improved the quality of life for many people.However, economic reforms have not been matched by reform of alegal system that fosters gross human rights violations. Dissent and any activity perceived as a threat are repressed.Independent human rights organizations in China are suppressed.International human rights organizations are not permitted toinvestigate abuses in China. China's leaders stress the need to expand international cooperationas a step towards solving the world's problems. Such cooperationmust be extended to human rights issues. China was one of thegovernments which adopted, by consensus, the Vienna Declarationof the 1993 United Nations World Conference on Human Rights. TheDeclaration reaffirms that "the promotion and protectionof all human rights is a legitimate concern of the internationalcommunity". The world cannot ignore a fifth of its populationjust because they happen to live within China's borders.

Over thenext two days, the trio will transport the meeting back to a time,more than two decades ago, when their lives became inextricablylinked. São Paulo, Brazil, the night of 15 February1973; heavily armed military police force their way into the homeof Luiz Basilio Rossi, Professor of Brazilian History at SãoPaulo University, and without explanation, take him away intothe darkness. Now, more than 20 years on, he tells the gatheredUA coordinators how, "At the time, many people were beingarrested for political reasons and tortured to death or "disappeared",and I had a real fear that this would happen to me too." The security forces return to the house, surroundit and even nail boards across the front door to prevent the professor'swife, María José, and three young daughters fromtelling the world what has happened. "We couldn't getout of the house", recalls María José,"not even out to the street, so I had to write a noteto a neighbour without the police seeing." Via a backwindow and the neighbour's young daughter, the message is passedto a priest, who in turn passes it on to the Bishop of Lins. On the other side of the world - not yet "shrunk"by computers, faxes and e-mail - a small organization called AmnestyInternational has for some time been receiving disturbing reportsfrom Brazil telling of brutal state torture. The organization'sexisting action techniques - with their cautious concentrationon prisoners of conscience (POCs) - are beginning to seem hopelesslyinadequate in the face of these horror stories. Tracy Ulltveit-Moewas AI's Brazil researcher in 1973. She remembers: "Weinvited one of our Brazilian contacts, who was in Paris at thetime, to come to London and meet with myself and Martin Ennals,then Secretary General. We spent the entire weekend discussingthe problem and concluded that what we needed was a quick actionfor prisoners in danger, irrespective of the POC issue. I suggestedthe name "URGENT ACTION", and the title stuck."More than that - a technique which over the next 23 years andbeyond would spawn millions of appeals on behalf of thousandsof individuals in many countries, was born. By now the Rossi family's smuggled message has reachedLondon where it finds Tracy at AI. The case of the Brazilian professorabducted by the military in the middle of the night is set tobecome AI's first "Urgent Action". Details are typedup and, on 19 March 1973, using names selected from a "shoebox" of hand-written address cards, the UA is mailed out,requesting immediate appeals in order to save the professor fromtorture and possible "disappearance" or death. Two weeks later, María José receivesa telegram ordering her to come to the military police (DOPS)headquarters in Sao Paulo to "identify her husband's body".On arrival, however, she gets a glimpse of her husband alive!She is also shown a pile of letters. María Joséstill remembers how the DOPS Director told her "Your husbandmust be a more important person than we thought, because we'vegot all these letters from all over the world". She isforced to sign a letter stating that Luiz is alive and well andnot being tortured, and that the international action should stop.The authorities send the fake letter to AI in London. However, as María José now tells: "WhenI got home I immediately wrote another letter to AI, telling thereal story, that Luiz had been tortured, but that several hundredprotest letters had arrived which I believed had saved his life."Two decades on, she remains firmly convinced of this: "Inmy opinion, the intervention of AI was fundamental in saving Luizfrom further torture and worse. I got the impression from theDOPS Director that he and the authorities were feeling under greatpressure from AI - pressure to produce the prisoner, to show him,because he was getting so much publicity. Moreover, we were heartenedto know that people outside Brazil knew what was going on, thatthey cared, and that they were prepared to do something aboutit. It gave us great comfort and hope. I and my family felt lonelyand frightened and kindness from outsiders helped enormously." Tracy, too, recalls the events with clarity: "Ihave a very clear memory of the case - in AI they say you neverforget your first prisoner! When we received María José'ssecond letter, we were overjoyed and very emotional to think thatthe Urgent Action had worked and that Luiz was safe". Luiz himself believes that the international appealswere crucial: "The torturer aims to isolate you, to cutall your links with the outside world. But AI was able to breakthat isolation... Once the authorities know that other peopleknow you're there and what's happening to you, they are forcedto be more careful about how they treat you... When I saw my wife,I knew that my case had become public, I knew they could no longerkill me. Then the pressure on me decreased and conditions improved." After his release, the family left Brazil and eventuallysettled in Belgium. When they returned to Brazil years later, María Joséhelped to set up an AI Health Professional's Network and was afounding member of the AI group in Brasilia where they now live. São Paulo 10 December 1995, Human Rights Day:the latest chapter in the story of the first UA closes with ProfessorRossi, by now wearing an Amnesty International UA T-shirt, hugging everyonegoodbye as he leaves the meeting: "I am an example ofyour success and a symbol of the importance of continuing yourwork.

This will be open to all who are interested in participating in it (you do not haveto be a member of Amnesty International). Please read on if you would like to find out more... If you saw somebody drowning, would you just walk away? What is an Urgent Action? An Urgent Action (UA) is anappeal by Amnesty International (AI) for its members and friends to urgently write letters on behalfof an individual or individuals whose case has been adopted by AI. These cases invariably involvea danger of torture or death occurring to the individual(s) concerned. But what does writing letters achieve? Those who tortureor perform extrajudicial executions rely on secrecy to be able to do so. When letters startarriving from human rights activists around the world this element of secrecy is lost - they areaware that the world is watching them. Murder and torture are illegal acts in all countries, nomatter how poor their human rights records. So how do I get involved in the UAN? You will need toregister yourself as a participant (a contact address will be posted here early in January 1997).This is important, as we need to be able to monitor the activity of the UAN - we are talkingabout people's lives here! You can select the geographical areas which you are particularlyinterested in, and the frequency with which you wish to write appeals (usually one per week toone per month). AI Members: If you are a member of an AI Section other than the Irish Section you shouldcontact your Section's UAN Coordinator for approval before becoming involved in the On-Line UAN. NOTE: UAN members should not become involved in UAs within their country ofcitizenship or residence. How do I find out about current UAs? We will be placingUAs on Web pages on our site and also in a Usenet newsgroup. The UA case information will beavailable to all, but the contact addresses (to write appeals to) will only be available tomembers of the UAN. We will also post news updates on past UAs, so that you can see howeffective your efforts have been. Why not have a look at The First Urgent Action?

During 1995, 175 Bosnians arrived as programme refugeesinto Ireland. The policy of family re-unification means that thefigures for programme refugees are changing all the time. During1995, 53 Bosnians and 30 Vietnamese arrived in Ireland as a resultof family re-unification. A few programme refugees have returnedto their countries. During 1995, 12 Bosnians returned to Bosnia.Some programme refugees also emigrate to other countries. Theneeds of programme refugees are looked after by the Refugee Agency(15 Marlborough Court, Dublin. Tel: 01-8787200) LEGISLATION The basis of international refugee law is the 1951 Geneva Convention,together with its 1967 New York Protocol. Ireland signed the Genevaconvention in 1976. Article 33 of the Geneva Convention sets outthe principle of non-refoulement, which forbids a refugee beingdirectly or indirectly sent back to a country where his or herlife or freedom would be endangered, be it because of race, religion,nationality, membership of a particular social group, or politicalconvictions. It is this principle which underlies all refugeelaw. Up until 1996, Ireland had nothing on its statute books to regulateprocedures for dealing with asylum seekers to this country. Asylumapplications were dealt with by the Department of Justice, accordingto its own procedures. Following a long-running campaign in whichthe Irish section of Amnesty International was very heavily involved,the Refugee Bill 1995 finally became law in June 1996. Publishedas part of the Bill are the Geneva Convention, and also the DublinConvention, which Ireland will now become a signatory to. TheDublin Convention is an agreement made between the member statesof the EU to establish which country will deal with specific asylumapplications. It is the first EU country which an asylum seekerarrives in which has the responsibility, under this Convention,of hearing the application. Since standards of treatment for asylumseekers vary widely from country to country within the EU, thiscan have serious implications for some asylum seekers. Amnesty International welcomes the new Refugee Act. This Act,for the first time, lays down in law procedures for how asylumseekers to Ireland are to be treated, and it has many positiveaspects to it. These include a broadening of the definition ofa refugee to include those persecuted for their sexual orientation,and those persecuted for membership of a trade union. Asylum seekerswhose applications are turned down will be able to appeal thedecision, and there will also be an appeals process to the operationof the Dublin Convention. However, the new Act also gives the Minister the right to overridethe refugee determining process and to deport a recognised refugeeon the grounds of "public Policy". It remains to beseen how these powers will be used in practice. Information on international refugee law, and on the nationalrefugee case law of many countries, may be found inREFWORLD. SOCIAL WELFARE ENTITLEMENTS On arrival, all asylum seekers are entitled to emergency accommodationin the Red Cross Hostel, Youth Hostels, temporary flats, Bed &Breakfast, or sometimes hostels for homeless people. Asylum seekers without income are entitled to Supplementary WelfareAllowance, Rent Deposit and Allowance, Fuel Allowance, and discretionaryExceptional Needs Payments, such as Clothing Allowance, at thesame levels as Irish people receiving welfare benefits. Asylumseekers who are parents are entitled to claim Child Benefit forall children under 16, and those between 16 and 18 in full-timeeducation. Recognised refugees are entitled to work, and to family re-unification.They are also entitled to social welfare payments and educationgrants in line with the entitlements of similarly situated Irishcitizens. Those with Humanitarian Leave to Remain now also havethese rights. Those still seeking recognition of their refugeestatus do not have the right to work. Asylum seekers are entitled to a medical card, which gives themfree access to general practitioners in Ireland, and free hospitaland dental care. There are as yet no specific provisions for acomprehensive system of specialist health-care for asylum seekersand refugees, which would guarantee the expertise needed to understandtheir special situation. There is a need for appropriate servicesfor victims of torture, imprisonment, and warfare, who have sufferedsevere physical and psychological distress. There is provision by the Department of Education for a specialisteducational support service for children of primary school ageamong the programme refugees (Vietnamese and Bosnians). Asylumseekers have no right to language classes, education and trainingfunded by the state, but the Irish Refugee Council in Ennis doesreceive state funding for free English language classes for asylumseekers . There is, as yet, no similar scheme in Dublin.

This reportpresents worrying new evidence of torture, ill-treatment and the denial of medical care toprisoners in Kenya. The pattern of abuses documented by human rights groups throughout the 1980sand early 1990s appears to be continuing. Torture and ill-treatment by the security forces is widespread. Criminal suspects areroutinely tortured to extract confessions, as are some political prisoners. Well-known politicalprisoners are harassed and ill-treated. Defendants are frequently held in custody beyond thelegal limit and this is rarely challenged by the courts. Investigations into allegations oftorture by the police are rare -- prosecutions rarer still -- and many police officers appear toact with impunity. Those charged are held on remand, often for many years, in extremely harshconditions before coming to trial. Many prisoners suffer serious illness as a result of tortureor prison conditions but are often refused medical treatment or receive it very late. Doctors whoattempt to treat political prisoners are harassed by the police, prison officers and prisonmedical personnel. Torture methods are frequently very brutal, usually beating with sticks, fists, rungus(knobbed sticks), handles of hoes and gun butts on different parts of the body. The most commontorture is to beat the soles of the feet where bruises may disappear rapidly but where the paininflicted can remain for the rest of the person's life. Detainees are often tortured by beingsuspended upside down on a stick passed behind their knees and in front of their elbows and thenbeaten on the soles of their feet. One variation used is simultaneous blows to both ears, whichis extremely painful and can rupture the ear drums. Some political detainees have been tortured even more severely. Some have had theirfingernails and toenails pulled out. Cases of near-asphyxiation have also been reported whereprisoners have been submerged head first in dirty water. Some have been held in cells filledwith two inches of water for several days. Others have been taken to a forest at night, suspendedfrom the trees and then beaten. Both men and women have been subjected to violent forms of sexualhumiliation. Women have been raped and have had objects, such as bottles, inserted into theirvaginas. Men have been tortured by having their genitals pricked with large pins or tied withstring and pulled. In the past, the Kenyan government has responded to criticism of its human rights record bymaking largely cosmetic changes, with little lasting effect. Without significant internationalpressure Kenya is unlikely to prevent torture and police brutality in the future nor adequatelyaddress current allegations of human rights violations by the security forces. Many of theseviolations are being raised by Kenyan human rights activists and NGOs who need the protection ofthe international community if they are to continue to challenge their government's human rightsrecord. Without effective action serious human rights violations will continue. Amnesty International calls on the Kenyan government to implement the extensiverecommendations at the end of this report. The organization believes that, if effectivelyimplemented, these recommendations will help to end the pattern of human rights violations inKenya. This summarizes a 31-page document (12,879 words), Kenya: Torture, compounded by the denial ofmedical care (AI Index: AFR 32/18/95), issued by Amnesty International in December 1995.

The time has come to abolish the Death Penalty world-wide. Thecase for abolition becomes more compelling with each passing year. Nowhere has it been shown that the Death Penalty has any specialpower to reduce crime or political violence. In country aftercountry it is used disproportionately against the poor and againstracial and ethnic minorities. It is often used as a tool of politicalrepression. Its use is arbitrary and irrevocable. It is imposedand inflicted arbitrarily. It is an irrevocable punishment, resultinginevitably in the execution of people innocent of any crime. It is a violation of fundamental human rights. Whatever purpose is cited, the idea that a government can justifya punishment as cruel as death, conflicts with the very conceptof human rights. The significance of human rights is preciselythat some means may never be used to protect society because theiruse violates the very values which make society worth protecting. There are 38 states in the US which have the Death Penalty,along with the US Government and the US Military. As part of the IrishSection's fight against the Death Penalty there are four localgroups working on the State of Virginia, USA. These are Group34 (Dublin), the Limerick Group, the Schull Group and the CorkGroup. And now for some information on Virginia, and its very strange laws: Virginia currently has 57 inmates on Death Row. It has executed31 inmates since 1976, five of them in 1995. Another two havebeen executed this year already. Eleven States in the US forbidexecution of the mentally retarded, Virginia is NOTone of them. The methods of execution in VA are Lethal Injectionor Electrocution by choice, with Electrocution by default. THE CONTEMPORANEOUS OBJECTION RULE The C.O.R. states that when an objection is not raised in theoriginal trial, it cannot be considered in a direct or later appeal.EVERY state except Virginia waives the C.O.R. incapital cases, by statute or by case law. This rule bars AppealsCourts from hearing about even blatant mistakes in the trial andillegal procedures that can include jury selection, jury instructions,evidence prevented or withheld, witness testimony, and any otheraspect of the trial. These problems can, and do, affect the basicfairness and constitutionality of the trial. The issuenot objected to at the first trial is barred, even if it showsthe innocence of a person on Death Row. THE 21 DAY RULE The 21 Day Rule states that new evidence discovered more than21 days after the trial cannot be considered in State or FederalCourts, even if the evidence could prove the innocence of a convicteddefendant. The 21 Day Rule has created a situation wherea person can be legally executed despite new evidence that heis innocent. Please protest against this continued barbarism.

Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka, Minister for ForeignAffairs and International Co-operation 1. Introduction In recent years, Kenya's human rights record has come under increasing criticism both nationally and internationally. In July 1995 it was raised in a meeting with Kenya's donors in Paris. Many observers feel that any human rights improvements gained in the first few years of the multi-party era are rapidly losing ground. Torture in Kenya has been a subject of Amnesty International concerns for years. This report presents worrying new evidence of torture, ill-treatment and the denial of medical care to prisoners in Kenya. The pattern of abuses documented by human rights groups throughout the 1980s and early 1990s appears to be continuing. Since the December 1992 election Amnesty International has received numerous reports of police brutality, possible extrajudicial executions by the police -- over 43 alleged criminals have been killed, apparently deliberately, in the first six months of 1995 -- and torture and ill-treatment by police and security forces. Criminal suspects are routinely tortured to extract confessions, as are some political prisoners. Well-known political prisoners are harassed and ill-treated. Defendants are frequently held in custody beyond the legal limit and this is rarely challenged by the courts. Investigations into allegations of torture by the police are rare -- prosecutions rarer still -- and many police officers appear to act with impunity. Those charged are held on remand, often for many years, in extremely harsh conditions before coming to trial. Many prisoners suffer serious illness as a result of torture or prison conditions but are often refused medical treatment or receive it very late. Doctors who attempt to treat political prisoners are harassed by the police, prison officers and prison medical personnel. Amnesty International medical delegates visited Kenya in March 1995 and this report, which highlights torture and the denial of medical care in Kenya between December 1992 and October 1995, includes some of the findings of that visit. Amnesty International hopes this report will be widely read by Kenyans as well as people outside Kenya. The organisation calls on the Kenyan government to implement the extensive recommendations at the end of this report. Amnesty International believes that, if effectively implemented, these recommendations will help to end the pattern of human rights violations in Kenya. Kenya is due to hold its next election in 1997. Many Kenyans had hoped that democracy would bring a significant improvement in human rights. They are now looking to their government, opposition parties and the international community for that promise to be delivered. Amnesty International remains deeply concerned about the continuing reports of serious human rights violations in Kenya. Without firm and prompt action by the authorities, the pattern of abuse by police and security forces will continue. 2. Background Torture took place before the move to multi party politics and has continued since then. It will continue so long as the government uses torture and other human rights violations as a means of curbing political opposition. Since independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 Kenya has had two presidents: Jomo Kenyatta, former leader of the Kenya African National Union (KANU) who ruled until his death in 1978, and Daniel arap Moi who has been president since then. In 1982 the government changed the constitution and made Kenya a one-party state thereby prohibiting the formation of any political party other than the ruling KANU. This followed attempts by government critics to form an opposition party. In August 1982, an attempted coup by Kenyan Air Force personnel was violently put down and was followed by repression and intimidation. Over 1,000 airforce personnel were arrested and later convicted of treason, mutiny and other offences. In the mid 1980s there was a wave of arrests of suspected government opponents, the majority of whom were tortured. Ten people were detained under the Public Security Regulations, which allow detention for an indefinite period without charge or trial, and almost 100 were convicted of political offences in unfair trials and sentenced to up to five years' imprisonment. Hundreds of others were arbitrarily detained for weeks before being released without charge. Between 1989 and 1991 the campaign for multi-party democracy intensified. Hundreds of people were arrested because of their non-violent political activities; the majority were released within a short period but some were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. Several were detained without charge or trial under the public security legislation including former government ministers and human rights lawyers. Many of those arrested were tortured. After several years of fierce resistance to ending the one party state, President Daniel arap Moi agreed to do so in late 1991. This followed the decision by Kenya's main donors to suspend all aid to the country. The donors criticised the government for corruption and a lack of "good governance". In late December 1992, multi-party elections were held but were alleged to have been marked by electoral irregularities. President Moi and KANU returned to power but opposition parties won almost half the seats in Parliament. In 1992 the authorities released the remaining political detainees and, with one exception, all known political prisoners serving prison sentences. Since December 1991 over 1,500 people have been killed and more than 300,000 displaced in political violence between the Kalenjin community, President Moi's ethnic group, and the Kikuyu, Luo and Luhya communities. The government has blamed the violence on opposition parties, government critics, the church and the media. However, there is strong evidence that the violence is being instigated and manipulated by the government. In the last two years the level of violence has decreased significantly. 2.1 Human rights remain under threat Despite the move to multi-party politics, the pattern of harassment of human rights activists, opposition figures and journalists continues, particularly against those who have been attempting to investigate or report incidents of political violence in the Rift Valley or other parts of Kenya. Although opposition political parties operate openly and freely, many individual critics have been arrested in connection with peaceful demonstrations, speeches, publications or investigations into human rights abuses. The majority have been held for short periods and released without charge or charged with sedition or other political offences and released on bail after a few days or weeks. But recently the government has been using criminal charges which carry the death penalty, for which release on bail is not permitted, to detain non-violent critics of the government. Whole editions of newspapers and publications critical of government policy have been impounded, and printing presses have been put out of action. Public meetings, particularly those held in rural areas by opposition members of parliament or government critics, have been stopped, sometimes violently. Kenyan journalists reporting these actions have been detained for short periods; foreign nationals including journalists have been threatened with deportation for publicly criticising the government. Growing public awareness of human rights issues in Kenya has stimulated the growth of human rights non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Their work is not without risk. In 1995 NGOs involved in human rights activities have been harassed, their staff or board members threatened or attacked by people suspected of having connections with the authorities, and two NGOs have been banned. 3. Torture and Ill-Treatment Torture and ill-treatment are widespread in Kenya. In some cases such treatment has resulted in permanent disability or even death. The main purpose of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners appears to be to intimidate detainees and dissuade them from engaging in political activities, and to obtain (often false) admissions of guilt which can be used in court. Political prisoners are also tortured to obtain information about their activities. Torture generally happens at the moment of arrest or during the initial phases of interrogation in police custody when detainees are frequently held incommunicado beyond the legal limit of 24 hours -- or 14 days if the death penalty is applicable -- and moved between different police stations to prevent their whereabouts being discovered. Torture methods are frequently very brutal, usually beating with sticks, fists, rungus (knobbed sticks), handles of hoes and gun butts on different parts of the body. The most common torture is to beat the soles of the feet where bruises may disappear rapidly but where the pain inflicted can remain for the rest of the person's life. Detainees are often tortured by being suspended upside down on a stick passed behind their knees and in front of their elbows and then beaten on the soles of their feet. One variation used is simultaneous blows to both ears, which is extremely painful and can rupture the ear drums. Some political detainees have been tortured even more severely. Some have had their fingernails and toenails pulled out. Cases of near-asphyxiation have also been reported where prisoners have been submerged head first in dirty water. Some have been held in cells filled with two inches of water for several days. Others have been taken to a forest at night, suspended from the trees and then beaten. Both men and women have been subjected to violent forms of sexual humiliation. Women have been raped and have had objects, such as bottles, inserted into their vaginas. Men have been tortured by having their genitals pricked with large pins or tied with string and pulled. 3.1 The perpetrators Most political prisoners report that they were tortured by officers of the "Special Branch" officially known as the Directorate of Security Intelligence (DSI) or by officers of the police Criminal Intelligence Department (CID). The CID is reported to have a unit responsible for arresting, detaining and interrogating political prisoners. Special Branch officers, who prior to 1992 reported directly to the Office of the President and currently report to the Commissioner of Police, have also been accused of the torture of criminal suspects, as have the regular police, local administrative police and KANU Youth Wingers. Any person arrested by KANU Youth Wingers, often under the direction of a local administrative chief or assistant chief should, by law, be immediately transferred to the regular police force. However, Amnesty International has received reports of individuals detained and tortured by KANU Youth Wingers. 3.2 The victims The majority of people tortured in Kenya are alleged criminals who come from the poorest and least articulate sectors of society and lack the power to voice their complaints or the money to pay bribes to avoid torture. However, many of those severely tortured are political activists, or alleged activists, often from ethnic groups perceived as supporting the opposition parties. Well known government critics tend not to be physically tortured but are often subjected to harassment and ill-treatment by, for example, the denial of medical care. a. Criminal suspects People alleged to be criminal suspects are routinely tortured by the police to obtain a confession of guilt. They are frequently arrested arbitrarily, sometimes solely because they happen to be present when the police are investigating a complaint. Sometimes they are detained in large numbers. For example, on 30 January 1995 over 500 people were violently arrested in Eldoret town by police said to be looking for car thieves, pickpockets and vagabonds. Criminal suspects rarely have access to lawyers and are usually too frightened to come forward and report torture because they fear reprisals.Often torture only comes to light in court when injuries are detected or when prisoners report torture in the course of requesting medical treatment for their injuries. For example, Francis Mwangi alleged in court on 17 July 1995 that he had "a broken hand following police beatings". He requested medical treatment, to which the court agreed. On occasions the torture is very severe. David Mbugua Kabata was reportedly very badly tortured in August 1993. Between his arrest on 3 August and his appearance in court on 16 August 1993, when he was remanded on a charge of possessing illegal weapons, he was transferred eight times between six different police stations in Rift Valley Province. He was allegedly tortured at two of them and four times in nearby forests. He said:"I was threatened with death unless I agreed to sign some statements. I was fixed between two trees with my hands fastened each to a tree. I was then whipped and beaten with hoe handles all over my body. Then they tied my penile shaft with a string and started pulling until there was a crack which bled." His medical examination on 27 August 1993 revealed "multiple bruise marks, wounds and scars all over the body". His injuries included two fractures of the facial and skull bones, a circular peri-coronal ulcer on his penis, soft tissue injuries, and he was suffering from acute bronchitis. In his report the doctor stated, "it is my well-considered opinion that the amount of trauma David went through was enough to convince him that his life was in real danger". His trial, which began in mid 1995 is continuing. Amnesty International is not aware of any official investigation into his torture allegations. Criminal suspects have also been tortured by KANU Youth Wingers. Alex Owuor, a 22-year-old porter at Nakuru bus station, was arrested by five KANU Youth Wingers on 27 December 1994 and accused of stealing. The Youth Wingers then took him to their office near the bus station, where, he stated, he was kicked and beaten with clubs on the ribs, hands, knees and genitals. His injuries, which included a dislocated elbow and swollen genitals, required hospital treatment. Alex Owuor reported the incident to the police who took little action. One of the attackers was arrested but was released on police bond and no further investigation has been carried out. Amnesty International has received numerous similar reports. There have been similar reports of torture by administrative policemen. For example, in February 1995 administrative policemen reportedly detained a woman and her two children, and held them for two days without food or water at Godjope Chief's Camp in Coast Province. On 4 January 1995 at Kangaita Chief's Camp, Kirinyaga District, three administrative policemen reportedly tortured 84-year-old Daniel Waweru, his wife and daughter. All three were whipped and Daniel Waweru was held overnight in a cell several inches deep in water before being released without charge. b. Political prisoners Amnesty International has received reports of the severe torture of political prisoners which in some cases has resulted in permanent disability. In these cases the perpetrators have almost always been Special Branch officers. In 1995 over 40 people have been arrested on suspicion of membership of an illegal guerrilla movement called February Eighteenth Movement (FEM) or what is reported to be FEM's armed wing, the February Eighteenth Resistance Army (FERA), and held for several days before being charged or released. The authorities have linked FERA to criminal activity in Western Province. Many of those detained were reportedly tortured. On 22 September 1995 Wang'ondu Kariuki, a lawyer and former prisoner of conscience, was arrested and held incommunicado for seven days before being brought to court. He was stripped naked, repeatedly beaten and, for the first three days, denied food. He was released on bail and at the time of writing was awaiting trial on charges of membership of an illegal organisation. Robert Wafula Buke, a former University of Nairobi student leader, was arrested on 27 March and held until 13 May 1995 on suspicion of membership of FEM. He was reportedly badly tortured at Kawangware Chief's Camp. He was chained to a wall and beaten by a Special Branch inspector and two officers. He was later taken to Naivasha maximum security prison, where he was further tortured and denied food. In February 1995 four men were sentenced to between five and six years for membership of FEM. All four pleaded guilty at summary trials without legal representation. They had all been held in incommunicado detention prior to being brought to court. They were part of a group of at least 32 men arrested between late October 1994 and early February 1995 in Bungoma District, Western Kenya. Many if not all of the group were tortured shortly after their arrest. One, Joseph Baraza Wekesa, a 69-year-old retired teacher, said he was beaten repeatedly, had hot wax poured on his arms and was then threatened with torture to his genitals. After his conviction, Joseph Baraza Wekesa obtained legal representation, appealed against his conviction on the grounds he had been tortured, and applied for bail. His court-ordered medical report stated that: "[T]he effects of his assault are still there for all to see one month after the event and they are an indication of the severity of the injuries at the time he was assaulted". However, the report was accused of being biased and was heavily criticised, by the State Prosecutor, Bernard Chunga, and the High Court judge hearing the bail application subsequently refused to read it. Joseph Baraza Wekesa was refused bail on the grounds that he had pleaded guilty of his own volition. Two other men facing the same charge pleaded not guilty with the help of several lawyers and were given bail. The lawyers' action prevented any further summary trials from occurring. However, although the initial charge against them was dropped, the two men were not released but were transferred to Kakamega in Western Kenya, 320 kilometres from Nairobi, and charged with murder along with six others from the original group of 32. At least 18 other men were released. Amnesty International has received credible reports that at least five of these men held in Kakamega were severely tortured. They include Taiga Machenjie, a former Chairman, for Mount Elgon district, of the opposition party Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) - Kenya, who was reportedly so badly tortured that he urinated blood and lost his hearing. Another, Moses Murimi Mukour, alleged he was tortured four days after his arrest by Special Branch officers who stood on his chest and on a piece of wood that was placed across his legs. They also tied his penis and both testicles with string that was stretched and repeatedly hit. His allegations were supported by medical evidence. His medical report noted that, "[M]any of the injuries were invisible but there were residual scars of torture. Both legs are scarred and bruised from the injury described by the patient. There is a wound on the back". The doctor writing the report in the presence of the prison doctor, Dr Luusa, stated that, "[I]t is significant that Dr Luusa and the Prisons Attendant insisted on playing down the significance of this injury claiming that it was not due to police torture". Richard Wasilwa Wafula was also allegedly beaten. His medical report noted: "that this patient was harmed by being assaulted on 8.2.95 and three weeks later his injuries are still quite visible and quite marked". Four young men were permanently disabled by Special Branch officers who tied them to trees in Dundori forest, near Nakuru, and beat them in December 1994. The four were part of a group of 67 men who were accused of holding an illegal meeting. At least 17 of them were reportedly tortured. They were not given treatment for their injuries for six days. One of the four, Geoffrey Ndungu Gichuki, developed gangrene and, two days after he was taken to hospital, his arm was amputated. Amnesty International medical delegates who examined three of these men in March 1995 found that they had:"...suffered permanent damage to their bodies, mainly their arms. They all had pronounced impairment of function of their hands. Two of them were especially incapacitated: one of them lost his right arm, the other lost the function of his left hand, and they both had reduced function of the remaining hand. They all had pronounced ligature marks on their arms as unequivocal causes of the damage described above. Self-infliction of the lesions described above is not possible." In an apparent effort to avoid evidence of police torture being given in open court these four men were never charged. They were held in hospital under police guard for seven months then released in July 1995. The trial of the other 63 prisoners ended in October when 62 were convicted of unlawful assembly and one was acquitted. A number of them have alleged several times in the past year that they were tortured by prison warders. On 21 September 1995 the lawyer acting for all 63, stated in court that "prison warders had been stripping his clients and thrusting sticks in their bottoms". This allegation was reportedly denied by the prosecutor, on the grounds that there was no medical report to support their claims. The defence lawyer was prevented from responding to the prosecutor by the magistrate who said he was only ready to listen to the lawyer on "relevant matters relating to the case and not on anything else". In September 1995 all 63 were reportedly on hunger strike in protest against their treatment. They were said to have been moved a week earlier to a block occupied by people suffering from infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and scabies where conditions are appalling. Earlier in the year a Nakuru court ordered 18 of them to receive hospital treatment. They were suffering from malaria and diarrhoea due to poor prison conditions. Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki was one of several people arrested because of their family and political connections with Koigi wa Wamwere, a prominent human rights activist, former politician and former political prisoner. At the time of Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki's arrest in July 1994 Koigi wa Wamwere and three others were on trial for robbery with violence and facing the death penalty if convicted. In October 1995 Koigi wa Wamwere and two others were sentenced to four years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, the fourth man was acquitted. Canning is cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. The Human Rights Committee, the body which supervises implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Kenya acceded in May 1972, says that the prohibition of torture or cruel or degrading treatment or punishment under article 7 of the ICCPR "must extend to corporal punishment". The canning has not been carried out yet pending an appeal. Amnesty International has adopted all three as prisoners of conscience. Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki, a cousin of Koigi wa Wamwere, was reportedly beaten unconscious with rifle butts and batons by around eight plainclothes policemen when he was arrested at a private house in Nakuru on 9 July 1994. He was then held incommunicado for 10 days and reportedly tortured further. Following a habeas corpus application, filed because of fears for his life, he was brought to court on 19 July and charged with robbery with violence along with five others including Michael Kung'u and John Kinyanjui Njoroge who were also said to have been tortured. The defendants had initially been brought to court outside court hours the previous day. However, defence lawyers, who had not been allowed access to their clients, protested and the proceedings were delayed until the following day. Defence council told the court that their clients had been tortured and the magistrate ordered a medical examination. The doctor who examined the defendants on 20 July recommended that Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki, who had serious head injuries, receive a CT (computerised tomography) scan:"it is apparent that whatever Geoffrey went through in the recent past has left him mentally confused. The red eye and multiple facial bruise marks point to a recent exposure to trauma. The trauma must have been inflicted from blunt object(s) directed to the head." Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki had to wait nearly three months until this CT scan was undertaken on 14 October 1994. Following this initial CT scan, it was discovered that Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki was suffering from a subdural haematoma (accumulation of blood under the brain membrane). This requires immediate assessment by a neurosurgeon to decide whether medical intervention -- including possible surgery -- is necessary. A second scan in December 1994 was again not followed up by an immediate assessment by a neurosurgeon. In early February 1995, Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki's lawyer made an application for him to be allowed to see a neurosurgeon to ascertain if he was fit to stand trial. The magistrate postponed the hearing of this application, and on the day the application Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki was to be heard, Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki was transferred to Nyahururu where he was charged with further capital charges along with around 14 others. At the end of February, Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki eventually saw a neurosurgeon who recommended an operation, but not if Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki would be forced to return to prison to convalesce where the conditions could kill him. His lawyers appealed for his release on bail on medical grounds. He was eventually released in May 1995, when the charge against him was reduced to robbery which is bailable. Amnesty International is unaware of any investigation into his alleged torture. On a few occasions the evidence of torture is so compelling it has resulted in acquittals. On 10 June 1994 the case of six male political prisoners charged with robbery with violence was dismissed on the grounds that the confessions of all six had clearly been obtained as a result of torture, and the magistrate ruled that there was no evidence to warrant their standing trial. The six men had been arrested in November 1993 and initially charged with breaking into the Ndeiya Chief's Camp (they were subsequently referred to as the `Ndeiya Six') and stealing five guns, several rounds of ammunition and three tear-gas grenades, and with assisting a prisoner to escape. The wife of one of the accused, David Njenga Ngugi, an official of the opposition Democratic Party, was arrested at the same time and held for several days in the same cell as the accused men before she was released. The six were released on bail but were immediately re-arrested. On 16 November 1993 they were charged with robbery with violence and thereby prevented from obtaining bail which is not available for charges of a particularly grave nature. The earlier lesser charges against them were subsequently withdrawn. At the time of their arrest the six men were whipped, forced to walk on sharp objects and had their finger nails and toe nails removed. In his ruling in May 1994, the Nairobi Chief Resident Magistrate noted that David Njenga Ngugi "was so badly tortured to confess that today, eight months later, he still has to walk with the help of crutches. The soles of his feet still have deep black marks and [sores] and swellings are on his feet". The magistrate censured the police and directed the commissioner of police to take immediate action against these men responsible for the torture of the defendants, stating that "it would be good practice where matters of torture are apparent in [the] course of a trial to direct that investigations be conducted by the commissioner of police". The magistrate, who was reportedly criticized by President Moi for his ruling, has since been removed from Nairobi to Kitui, 130 kilometres east of Nairobi. Amnesty International is not aware of any investigation or arrests in connection with the torture of the Ndeiya Six. Since his release David Njenga Ngugi, who is still receiving medical treatment, has reportedly been harassed by the police. Two of the Ndeiya Six are currently suing the Attorney General for damages and costs. George Karuki Wanjau, a 65-year-old farmer, was reportedly tortured in the presence of the head of Nakuru Provincial CID. He was arrested on 7 November 1993 with his son, and taken to the provincial CID offices in Nakuru where he alleges that the Provincial CID officer slapped him twice on the cheeks and then ordered the police officers present to beat him. He was beaten by six police officers on his cheeks, head and body. He claimed he was ordered to implicate Koigi wa Wamwere in an alleged violent robbery on Bahati Police Station near Nakuru on 2 November 1993. He lost four teeth, his mouth and cheeks were swollen and his mouth bled. He was then held in Menengai police station for three days without receiving any medical attention. He was charged with robbery with violence with 11 others including Koigi wa Wamwere. His son was held in custody for 14 days and then released without charge. George Kariuki Wanjau was released in January 1994 when the charges against him were dropped. Amnesty International medical delegates who examined him in early 1995 stated that their findings were consistent with his allegations of torture. At least five men charged with George Kariuki Wanjau were reportedly tortured while they were held by the police in incommunicado detention. Three subsequently received hospital treatment for their injuries which included a burst ear drum, a ruptured bladder and a fractured leg. Amnesty International is unaware of any official investigation of these reports of torture. c. Women Victims Female political prisoners and women accused of common crimes have also been tortured by the police and Special Branch. For example, Alice Mariga Ashioya alleged in court on 17 January 1995 that she had been tortured by a woman police inspector who forced a bottle containing pepper into her vagina in an attempt to force her to admit to the murder of her husband. Another suspect in the same case alleged in court that he had been tortured by police who had taken him to Kambatia Forest and suspended him from a tree. They were both acquitted after the magistrate refused to accept their confessions on the grounds that they had been obtained through torture. Josephine Nyawira Ngengi, a prisoner of conscience and a member of the Release Political Prisoners (RPP), a non-violent campaigning group, and sister of G.G. Njuguna Ngengi, was arrested in May 1994 in Nakuru. She was held illegally and incommunicado for 22 days before being charged with robbery with violence, which carries the death penalty. Two other women, Ann Wambui Ng'ang'a and Tabitha Mumbi, and 16 men, were charged with the same offence. All three women and two other men allege that they were tortured while in police custody. Josephine Nyawira Ngengi stated that she was beaten and blunt objects were forced into her vagina until she bled. She said: "At one point, one officer got so incensed that he took a wooden plank and hit me hard on the head. I was then ordered to wipe the blood from the floor from the resulting wound with my tongue, which I did." Her case is continuing. Amnesty International is not aware of any investigation into the torture claims of these three women or of the men charged with them. Truphena Obwaka Shirako, aged 51 years, was accused of stealing 15,000 Kenyan shillings (Ksh) (US$150 equivalent) from her employer, an international NGO, and arrested in January 1994. She was tortured by four policemen at Langas police station, Uasin Gishu District. During her ordeal a bottle was pushed into her vagina and one of the policemen is also said to have put his hand in her vagina "to look for the money". She was beaten for five hours. She had extensive injuries and bleeding and was eventually taken to hospital. A senior provincial police officer said the "cruel and shameful" incident would be investigated. Two policemen were arrested and charged with "indecent assault and assault causing actual bodily harm". Both denied the charges and were released on bond. Their trial began in late 1994, but has been adjourned on a number of occasions and is still continuing. An eye-witness -- a pastor -- testified that he had heard one policeman say to the woman that she would be taken to the "slaughter house". d. Refugees Amnesty International has received a number of reports of refugees from Uganda, Somalia and Rwanda being harassed, ill-treated and even tortured by Kenyan security forces. However, because of the fear of the individuals involved, the organization has been unable to substantiate many of these reports. Frequently, refugees living in Nairobi appear to be illegally harassed for bribes and many of those unable to pay have reportedly been arrested and ill-treated. Amnesty International has received unconfirmed reports that young Somali men living in refugee camps in Eastern Province have been arrested and detained by police officers on charges of stealing. They are said to be held and tortured or threatened with torture until their relatives pay a bribe to release them. Amnesty International has also received reports that Ugandans have been arrested and accused of illegal entry or robbery with violence, and then coerced into pleading guilty and deported. On 8 May 1995, 75 Ugandans living in Nairobi were deported from Kenya. All had been convicted of vagrancy. They were taken to Madaraka court where they were "coerced to plead guilty to illegal entry into Kenya". The Ugandans claimed that they were accused by the Kenyan security forces of spying for the leader of the FEM. 4. Deaths in custody Nahashon Chege, an 18-year-old street boy, died at Pangani police station, reportedly on 1 April 1995, as a result of torture. Eyewitnesses stated that he had been beaten with gun butts as he lay on the floor after his arrest. Two other youths arrested with him were also reportedly beaten. These two and seven other street boys arrested at the same time were taken to Madaraka Court and bonded to keep the peace for two years. In response to press reports about the death of Nahashon Chege, the police stated that he had died at Kenyatta National Hospital two days after he had been arrested. Nahashon Chege was buried on 22 April 1995. Amnesty International does not know if an inquest has been carried out, or if there has been any subsequent investigation into his death. Lieutenant John Kubwana, a Ugandan army officer, died in Bungoma hospital in April 1995 where he had been admitted with severe injuries. Lieutenant John Kubwana had reportedly been kidnapped by Kenyan security agents from his home in Bukabayi village in Mbale district, Uganda, on 23 April. He was accused of having recruited and trained members of the FEM. According to his relatives, he is said to have received knife wounds and to have been battered with blunt objects. It is not known if there has been any inquiry or investigation into his death. Sergeant Martin Obwong died on 18 March 1995, on the day of his release from Makongeni police station, Nairobi. Sergeant Martin Obwong, a prison officer attached to Nairobi's Industrial Area Remand Prison, had been arrested the previous night following a quarrel with a police officer in a bar. He reportedly collapsed several times shortly after his release and was taken to the prison's clinic by his relatives with a swollen face and a mouth "full of blood". His son stated that his father told him he was beaten by police officers at the police station. An investigation is reportedly being carried out, but no one has yet been arrested. At least one woman has died in police custody as a result of torture. Rosemary Nyambura was reportedly beaten by up to seven police officers at Ruaraka police station, near Nairobi. She died as a result of her injuries on 10 May 1992. Police had stopped her early that morning as she returned from a nightclub with a friend. The police reportedly searched both women and demanded their identity cards. Rosemary Nyambura was unable to produce hers and the police reportedly searched her and took from her Ksh 6,000 (US$ 60 equivalent). Police corruption in Kenya is rife and there are regular reports of police taking money in this way. Rosemary Nyambura followed the police officers back to Ruaraka police station demanding the return of her money. At the police station she was arrested. The police later alleged that she had committed suicide, but the post-mortem report indicated she died of ruptured kidneys and spleen. Her family demanded an inquiry and the Federation of Women Lawyers-Kenya Branch (FIDA) took up the case, but it was over a year before an investigation started and as yet no police officer has been charged in connection with her death. 5. Why Torture Continues Amnesty International believes that the main reason that torture continues in Kenya is because of the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators. Investigations into complaints of torture and ill-treatment are rare or inadequate, as are prosecutions. Courts consistently fail to investigate complaints of torture and frequently do not examine the medical evidence or question the lack of medical treatment when a prisoner has alleged torture. Furthermore, courts rarely call the police to task when a prisoner has been detained beyond the legal limit. Torture and ill-treatment are clearly prohibited by Article 74 (1) of the Constitution of Kenya which states that "no persons shall be subject to torture or to inhuman or degrading or other treatment". Torture and ill-treatment are also prohibited by international standards, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) which Kenya ratified in 1992, and the ICCPR which Kenya ratified in 1972. Kenya has yet to ratify the United Nations (UN) Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Although the authorities at the highest levels have condemned torture and ill-treatment in the past, they frequently deny it exists. Senior police officers are clearly aware that torture occurs and appear to condone it, and some have reportedly participated in the torture of political prisoners. There appears to be a lack of political will to end torture and even direct interference in the work of those who do try. Lawyers who defend political prisoners who have been tortured have faced threats to their employment and received excessive income tax bills. There is also a lack of adequate safeguards to protect detainees and the safeguards that exist are inadequately enforced. For example, detainees are often held in police custody for long periods without charge. Without access to their relatives, lawyer and doctors, detainees are vulnerable. Under Kenyan law the police can hold alleged suspects for 24 hours or 14 days if they are investigating a capital charge. Detainees are frequently held beyond this period in incommunicado detention. Police have sought to justify illegal detention on the grounds that the detainee is "helping the police with their inquiries" but this is rarely challenged by the courts. Habeas corpus actions, which may be invoked to ensure a detainee is brought to court, are costly and only open to those whose relatives can afford a lawyer. Reports of torture are rarely investigated by the police and the courts fail to systematically look out for possible cases of coercion. It is very rare for a confession of guilt to be declared inadmissible by the magistrate on the grounds that it was obtained under torture. Magistrates usually find in favour of the police, even when there is evidence that torture has occurred. There is serious concern at the lack of independence of the judiciary in Kenya. The resources and training in investigative techniques given to the police is limited so many police officers appear to resort to torture in order to obtain confessions. They then compound this torture by denying or restricting the victims access to medical care and harassing doctors who are willing to treat victims of torture. As one doctor stated, "it is an open secret that the police have all along been attempting to influence what doctors write in their medical reports, especially when it is obvious a suspect has been tortured". 6. The restriction and denial of medical care Private doctors who attempt to treat prisoners frequently report difficulties in gaining access to their patients. Under rule 102 (3) of the prison rules, "An unconvicted prisoner on remand ... shall be allowed to see a registered medical practitioner appointed by himself or by his relatives ... on any weekday during working hours in the prison, in the sight, but not in the hearing, of the officer in charge or an officer detailed by him". However, the officer in charge of the prison usually insists on a court order to allow the doctor to examine the patient, which can take up to a week to obtain, and even then the doctor may be refused access unless the prison doctor is available which, given there are very few prison doctors, compounds delays. One doctor informed Amnesty International that despite the fact that the prison doctor and medical orderly were in the prison, both the doctor and a relative were kept waiting all afternoon without having access to their patient. The prison doctor informed them he was too busy. However, when the doctor asked to examine the patient in the presence of the medical orderly this was refused. Yet the following day the doctor was allowed to see the patient in the presence of the medical orderly. For private doctors, who have to close their clinics to make prison visits, visiting a patient in prison can be very time consuming and therefore difficult. When doctors finally get access to their patient, they report that this is usually in the hearing of the prison warders who reportedly intimidate the doctor. One doctor stated: "supposing, by the grace of God, you do finally gain access to the patient, the police will make sure they hear every word of what the patient is telling you. They will keep on interrupting during the interview. I have been asked [several times] why I was taking too many details about the injuries the patient sustained. At one time they even asked me whether I was recording statements or treating the patient ... If the suspect happens to have been arrested for political reasons, the police will openly accuse you of being politically orientated. You are bluntly reminded that association with such individuals will most surely land you into problems. Some CID officers asked me angrily at one time, "why do you have to take risks by treating such people?".... Many times I have been advised to stop writing medical reports on torture victims because as they would say, "you are making our work very hard, we can hardly pinch anybody because we fear you will write about it". (The doctor's name has been withheld for fear of reprisals.) The police and prison officials often refuse to take torture victims to hospital and frequently hold them in the police cells or prison. They may be eventually taken to hospital if it becomes apparent that their injuries will not heal without medical attention, by which time they may be extremely ill or be in danger of dying. This is apparently also true for prisoners suffering from illnesses not caused by torture or ill treatment. For example, an 81-year-old woman arrested on 24 April 1995 and charged with murder was ordered by a court on 3 May to receive medical treatment. However, 14 days later she still had not received any. The woman had diarrhoea and severe chest pains as a result of contracting pneumonia before she was arrested. In January 1995 Dr Lawali Oyondi, a veterinary surgeon and an opposition member of parliament, was reportedly removed from Nakuru provincial hospital by a police officer, denied medical treatment recommended by his doctor and returned to Nakuru prison. At the time Dr Lawali Oyondi was on remand charged with sedition following his arrest, with nine others, at a church service in Longonot held in memory of people recently killed in political violence. Two days later when his condition had seriously deteriorated 301 inmates reportedly staged a hunger strike and refused to return to their cells until he received hospital treatment. He was taken to hospital later that day. Another member of parliament, Njenga Mungai, who was detained with Dr Lawali Oyondi, suffered from a urinary condition which required surgery. He was taken to Nakuru hospital but the government doctors refused to treat him. They reportedly feared that, like some other government doctors, they could be forcibly evicted from their homes if they treated a political prisoner. Njenga Mungai was eventually taken to Nairobi for examination before being released after four months detention. While in hospital Njenga Mungai was chained to the bed at night. All prisoners in hospital are chained to their beds at night for 'security' purposes, and sometimes during the day as well. Doctors state that they do not have much control over the conditions in which prisoners are held in hospital. One professor noted, "we do not have much say on which patients should be handcuffed or not, but we maintain they be uncuffed when being examined and treated. We have no control of regulations from the prison side, but we hope that ethics will prevail in most cases." In December 1994 Koigi wa Wamwere was prevented from receiving adequate medical care after he had undergone a test under general anaesthetic in hospital to identify why he was urinating blood. Despite a medical recommendation that he remain in hospital for 24 hours for observation, he was returned to prison. Two hours later he was taken to court for the continuation of his trial. After representations by his lawyer and doctor to the court the magistrate ordered that he be referred to Nakuru provincial hospital. However, the hospital refused to admit him and he was returned to prison. When prisoners are finally taken to hospital their medical needs still do not appear paramount. On 18 August 1995 Elis Githeya was reportedly taken to hospital under heavy police escort after he had reported at Kiambu police station that he had been shot by two police officers for unknown reasons. However, police removed him from the hospital before he received any treatment. Police officers said their superior officer had asked them to take Elis Githeya to Nairobi central police station. He was later released on bail. A similar incident occurred in April 1995 when David Kimiti Chege who had been shot by police was removed from Kiambu District hospital. His lawyer alleged that his injuries were prodded by police during his interrogation. He returned to hospital for three weeks, following a court order, where he was handcuffed to the bed. There are almost 4,000 doctors in Kenya. Some 700 are employed in the public sector treating 80% of the population. In some districts with about 200,000 people there is only one doctor in charge, and very rarely more than two or three. Government doctors formed a union in 1994 and went on strike between July and November that year in an unsuccessful attempt to gain official recognition for their union and to call for improvement in their poor working conditions. Private doctors are also harassed and intimidated and at least one private doctor has been imprisoned for several days for writing medical reports on political prisoners. On 20 November 1993 Dr S. K. Mwangi, who had been giving medical treatment to political prisoners recently detained, was arrested. He was due to present a medical report to the court on Koigi wa Wamwere and four others, including Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki who was ill with typhoid, on 22 November. Dr S. K. Mwangi was held incommunicado for three days before being charged with sedition and possession of explosives and released on bail. He denied the charge and it was later dropped. Amnesty International believes that his arrest was really due to his attempts to arrange independent medical treatment for these prisoners. Another doctor, a human rights activist, had attempted to visit these prisoners shortly after their arrest and had been denied access and threatened by the police. The majority of private doctors are all members of the Kenya Medical Association (KMA) which is affiliated to the Commonwealth Medical Association. The KMA is a fairly weak body which acts mainly as a social organisation. It has not assisted members who have been harassed by the security forces for treating victims of torture or political prisoners. One member of the KMA Ethics Committee expressed apprehension about the KMA speaking out. He told Amnesty International "we would certainly give moral support, but the louder the words, the harder the hammer". At a symposium on human rights in 1993, one Kenyan doctor accused the KMA of being notably silent about doctors who were guilty of abetting torture. 6. Prison Conditions Conditions in Kenyan prisons are harsh. In September 1995 a Kenyan High Court judge described them as "death chambers" because of the high mortality rate. He noted that "going to prison these days has become a sure way for a death certificate". In October 1995 the Minister for Home Affairs, Francis Lotodo, announced that over 800 prisoners had died since the beginning of the year. The majority died from AIDS, meningitis, malaria and typhoid. Among the dead were 291 prisoners on remand and 528 convicted prisoners. Prisoners suffer from severe overcrowding, insanitary conditions and a lack of adequate food, clothing, blankets and basic sanitary requirements. In these conditions, infectious diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, tuberculosis and AIDS spread easily. Prison clinics lack medicines and many only have medical orderlies as there are few prison doctors. In July 1995 there were 37,066 inmates in Kenya's 78 prisons which have a capacity for only 21,000. On 10 October 1995 President Moi pardoned 10,898 prisoners, mostly petty offenders, which helped to reduce the overcrowding. 7. Possible extra-judicial executions, beatings and severe ill-treatment by security forces There is increasing concern about the number of alleged or suspected criminals shot dead by the police. Most cases seem to occur because the authorities have failed to ensure that all members of the police force respect the right to life and security of person and that they obey internationally recognised standards regarding the use of force. However, some killings appear to be extrajudicial executions. In the first eight months of 1995 more than 40 people had been killed by the police, including two employees of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company who were shot by two administrative police officers in Eldoret on 10 July 1995. Following a national outcry the two police officers were charged with murder. In August 1994 an administrative policeman was accused of shooting an unarmed 15-year-old street boy. He was arrested in September 1994 following widespread protests. This case came to trial in February 1995. He was found not guilty for lack of evidence but the magistrate criticised the police for inadequately investigating the shooting. The same policeman was accused of killing five street children in July 1994 and his trial for these other killings is continuing. The killing of three men in June 1995, which was investigated by the non-governmental Kenyan Human Rights Commission (KHRC), appears to have been a case of extrajudical execution. James Nomi Kangara, Abel Mwaura Kimani and Frances Njoroge Chiira, were reportedly shot dead in the Pangani area of Nairobi on 7 June 1995 as "suspected gangsters". According to press reports, on 6 June police took the men from the police station where they were being held to their "hideout". There, according to these reports, police shot the men as they attempted to fire on the police officers. However, the KHRC in a recent report said it had obtained credible evidence that all three men had been tortured after their arrest and when they were taken to their "hideout" their hands were handcuffed behind their backs and they were guarded by over 40 heavily armed police officers. In the report the KHRC concluded: "Even if we assume that the three victims were criminals with serious records, it is clear that this was not a case where guns should have been used. This was not only excessive, but completely unwarranted, as there was no threat of danger or escape. The shootings were deliberate and in cold blood. They amount to murder." In the period between April and June 1995, 32 people were reportedly killed by the police. As yet no inquest is known to have been held into any of these deaths. The Criminal Procedure Code requires that public inquests should be held into the death of anyone who dies in police custody, prison or in circumstances that are unclear. However, this provision is rarely enforced. Beatings and severe ill-treatment by police are common in Kenya. Demonstrations, public meetings and strikes have been violently broken up by the police using batons, tear gas and sometimes shooting into the crowd which has resulted in injury and sometimes death. On 10 June 1995, riot police reportedly beat two Kenyan opposition members of parliament with gun butts before detaining them, apparently in an attempt to stop them from attending a by-election in Mombasa. Otieno K'Opiyo and Otieno Mak'Onyango, both members of the FORD-Kenya Party, were taken to hospital where they were treated for chest and back injuries. On 1 June 1995 two East African Standard photographers, Jacob Waweru and Jacob Otieno, were beaten up by the police at Nyayo national stadium in Nairobi during celebrations marking Madaraka Day, the day Kenya attained self-governing status from the British Colonial Government. Jacob Waweru was beaten when he took photographs of plain clothes policemen beating up a man whom they had stripped naked reportedly for attempting to seek an audience with President Moi. While Jacob Waweru was being beaten up, Jacob Otieno took photographs. Police threatened Jacob Waweru with shooting because he had taken photographs of the policemen. Both had their films confiscated. Despite complaints from both journalists to senior police officers about the incident, no further action has been taken. In March 1992 a group of mothers, on hunger strike to campaign for the release of their sons who were political prisoners, was violently attacked by the General Services Unit (GSU), a paramilitary police unit. In response to the violence, some of the mothers, who were aged between 60 and 82, stripped naked in a traditional expression of protest causing the police to turn away and violence to be reduced. Plain clothes Special Branch officers and KANU Youth Wingers have also been responsible for violently attacking members of the public. On 10 August 1995 members of the opposition party, Safina (which has not yet been registered), were attacked outside Nakuru Magistrate's Court where they were waiting for two of Koigi wa Wamwere's lawyers before visiting him in Nakuru prison. Eye witnesses stated that plain clothes Special Branch officers threw eggs and then stones at Richard Leakey, Njeri Kabeberi and several other Safina officials and supporters. They were then assaulted by a group of men, said to be KANU Youth Wingers. Provincial CID officers reportedly threatened to shoot onlookers who tried to intervene. Richard Leakey was singled out and severely beaten and his car was badly damaged before he was able to leave Nakuru for Nairobi. After the incident a group of Safina supporters went to visit Koigi wa Wamwere. The group, including his lawyers, his mother and several journalists, were reportedly stopped at the prison by the prison riot squad who beat them with truncheons and sticks and chased them away from the prison into the arms of a group of up to 40 KANU Youth Wingers. A number of the group were seriously injured and subsequently hospitalized. Mirugi Kariuki, a human rights lawyer, suffered a broken collar bone and was badly bruised. Louise Tunbridge, a journalist for the British Daily Telegraph was also beaten and severely bruised. Following widespread condemnation of the assaults, police arrested three people who have been charged assault and are currently on bail. In January 1995, Zacharia Wakumu Njogu was attacked by six KANU Youth Wingers who beat him with a club all over his body and stole his identity card and Ksh 4,500 (�60). He was hospitalized for two weeks and had his right leg in plaster. However, although Zacharia Wakumu Njogu reported the attack, naming three of his assailants whom he had recognised, only one was detained briefly before being charged with assault and released on bail. No further action was taken despite the fact that Zacharia Wakumu Njogu visited the police station regularly to pursue the case. He informed Amnesty International representatives that: "This is a normal thing for the KANU Youth Wingers to attack people at the bus station, wherever you report to police the matter is dismissed". Killings, beatings and ill-treatment by the security forces which are not investigated leads to the impression that the authorities have no intention of curbing the security forces, which is tantamount to encouraging them in these acts. 8. Conclusions and recommendations As long as the Kenyan Government continues to allow the security forces to act with apparent impunity, its commitment to the effective protection of human rights must be called into question. In the past, the Kenyan government has responded to criticism of its human rights record by making largely cosmetic changes, with little lasting effect. Without significant international pressure Kenya is unlikely to prevent torture and police brutality in the future nor to adequately address current allegations of human rights violations by the security forces. Many of these violations are being raised by Kenyan human rights activists and NGOs who need the protection of the international community if they are to continue to challenge their government's human rights record. Without effective action serious human rights violations will continue. Amnesty International calls on the Kenyan Government to implement the following recommendations: 1. Prevention of arbitrary arrest No one should be arbitrarily arrested in accordance with Kenya's obligations under Article 9 (1) of the ICCPR and in terms of Article 6 of the ACHPR. All arrests should be carried out under strict judicial control and only by authorized law enforcement personnel. Arrests by KANU Youth Wingers should be declared illegal. Everyone should be informed, at the time of arrest, of the specific reasons for his or her arrest and all detainees should receive a clear oral and written explanation of how to avail themselves of their legal rights, including the right to lodge complaints of ill-treatment. The maximum legal period of 24 hours a detainee may be held by the police without being brought before a judge should be adhered to. Those facing possible capital charges should also be brought before a judge without delay. 2. Prevention of incommunicado detention The provisions of the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners pertaining to untried prisoners and the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment must be adhered to by the Kenyan authorities, in particular: All detainees should be held in an authorized and publicly known place of detention. Detainees should have access to relatives, lawyers and doctors from the moment of arrest and regularly throughout their detention or imprisonment. The government should provide free legal assistance to defendants without resources. Interpreters should be provided for non-Swahili speaking defendants where necessary. Relatives should be informed immediately of any arrest and should be kept informed of the detainees' whereabouts at all times. Habeas corpus petitions should be admissible from the moment of arrest. The cost of filing of habeas corpus petitions should be significantly reduced. Every detention centre and prison should be required to keep a detailed up-to-date record, bound with numbered pages, of those detained or imprisoned, as well as the time of arrest and the identities of those who carried out the arrest. The record should include the time the detainee appeared before the judicial authority. 3. Strict controls over interrogation procedures Interrogation should always take place in the presence of a lawyer. In addition to a lawyer, a female officer should be present during interrogation of women detainees. Children under 18-years-old should be questioned only in the presence of a parent or next of kin and a lawyer. The date, time and duration of each period of interrogation should be clearly recorded, as well as the names of all those present during interrogation. These records should be open to judicial scrutiny and to inspection by representatives of the Attorney General's Office, lawyers and relatives of detainees. The government should publish current guidelines of interrogation procedures incorporating the provisions of the ICCPR pertaining to access to a lawyer, the principles contained in the UN Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers and the specific provisions of the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment pertaining to access to legal counsel and interrogation. Both procedures and practices should be reviewed periodically, inviting submissions and recommendations from civil rights groups, defence lawyers, bar associations and other interested parties. 4. Separation of the authorities responsible for detention and interrogation There should be a clear and complete separation between the authorities responsible for detention and those responsible for the interrogation of detainees. This would allow an agency not involved in interrogation to supervise the welfare and physical security of detainees. 5. Prohibition of the use of confessions extracted under torture Confessions obtained as a result of torture or other ill-treatment should never be admitted in legal proceedings, except as evidence in proceedings against the perpetrators of torture and ill treatment. Article 14 (3) (g) of the ICCPR which stipulates that a defendant "not be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt" requires the courts to undertake prompt, thorough and impartial investigations of torture and ill-treatment in determining whether statements were voluntarily made. Defendants convicted on the basis of coerced confessions should have their convictions promptly reviewed. 6. Implementation of judicial safeguards Delays in criminal proceedings exceeding legal limits should be strictly prohibited and compensation paid if it occurs. Judges should be rigorous in examining the legality of detention and the physical condition of defendants, and in investigating all claims of torture. International standards pertaining to the judiciary, including those contained in the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, should be incorporated into Kenyan law and legal practice. 7. Ensuring an effective supervision of detention and imprisonment Kenya should ratify the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) Treaty and ensure that domestic law and practice should conform fully with international human rights treaties ratified by Kenya as well as international human rights standards, in particular, the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment and the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. The government should oversee the immediate and effective elimination of all cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, including caning, in all detention centres and prisons. Any form of detention or imprisonment and all measures affecting the human rights of a detainee or a prisoner should be subject to the effective control of the Attorney General's Office and the judicial authority, from the moment of detention. The Law Society of Kenya and bona fide human rights groups should be ensured immediate and effective access to any police station, detention centre or prison in the country. The government should take particular care to ensure the protection of detainees who are vulnerable for reasons of age or gender. The authorities should ensure that defendants awaiting trial remain separated from convicted criminals. All detention centres and prisons should be open to visits and regular inspections by representatives of an independent body such as the International Committee of the Red Cross according to their working principles. Any detainee or prisoner should have the right to communicate freely and in full confidentiality with the inspectors. The inspectors should have unrestricted access to all relevant records and be authorized to receive and deal with detainees complaints. The inspection body should prepare detailed reports of each visit, particularly about overcrowding and the health of the detainees, and should ensure that appropriate action is taken to remedy all shortcomings relating to the treatment of detainees and prisoners. The inspection body should make recommendations for improving conditions of detention in accordance with the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. These should be acted upon within a reasonable period. 8. Adequate medical safeguards An independent medical examiner's office should be established, with full administrative autonomy, to provide forensic expertise at a national level. Medical examinations should be regularly provided for detainees and prisoners and should be performed by independent professionals under the supervision of a professional association, in accordance with the following principles: - A medical examination should be carried out on each detainee promptly after arrest and before interrogation. - Detainees should be medically examined every 24 hours during the period of interrogation; on a frequent and regular basis throughout detention and imprisonment; and immediately before transfer or release. - The examinations should be performed by the authorized doctor, who should explain to the detainee the importance of having a full and contemporary record of his or her condition. - Detainees should be informed of the importance of these examinations in verbal and written notice of their rights. - Examinations should be carried out in private, exclusively by medical personnel. Special care should be taken to ensure that the examinations of women prisoners are carried out in an acceptable manner. - Each detainee should have access to a medical officer at any time on the basis of a reasonable request. - Detailed medical records on detainees should be kept and should include weight, state of nutrition, visible marks on the body, psychological state, and complaints about health or treatment received. - These records should be confidential but should be communicated, at the request of the detainee, to a legal adviser, his or her family, or the authorities charged with investigating the treatment of prisoners. - Each detainee should be entitled to private examinations by his or her own doctor at the request of the detainee or the detainee's lawyer or family. The medical examination of alleged victims of human rights abuses should be carried out by a doctor independent of the detaining and law enforcement agencies. The person alleging the abuse should have the right to be able to request the presence of independent witnesses including a health professional designated by the family, his/her legal representative or a professional designated by an independent medical association. Forensic doctors should be provided with the training and resources necessary for the diagnosis of all forms of torture and other human rights violations. 9. Investigation of all reports of gross human rights violations All reports of suspected torture, ill-treatment or extrajudicial executions should be promptly, thoroughly and impartially investigated in accordance with Kenya's obligations under national law and international law. When detainees allege that their confessions were extracted under torture, the authorities should ensure a prompt, full and impartial investigation by an independent body into such allegations. The investigating authority should have the power to obtain all information necessary to the inquiry; adequate financial and technical resources for effective investigation; and the authority to oblige those accused of torture to appear and testify. Any government official who suspects that torture has been committed should report it to the relevant authorities, which should fully investigate all such reports. The absence of a complaint by the victim or relatives should not deter investigation. The involvement or complicity of health professionals in the torture and ill- treatment of detainees should be thoroughly and impartially investigated. Disciplinary proceedings should be instituted against medical personnel found to have breached the UN Principles of Medical Ethics. In all cases of deaths in custody, forensic investigations should conform to international standards including the UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. Guidelines, incorporating the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, should be published and law enforcement officials should be trained in the application of such guidelines. The government should conduct prompt, thorough and impartial investigations into all allegations of extrajudicial execution; make the findings public; and bring perpetrators of extrajudicial execution to justice. The government should publicly issue orders making it clear that law enforcement personnel use force only when strictly necessary and only to the minimum extent required under the circumstances. Lethal force should not be used except when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life. 10. Bringing those responsible to justice Any law enforcement agent or person acting under the direction of law enforcement agents who is responsible for human rights violations, or for ordering, encouraging or condoning the practice of such abuses, should be brought to justice, and formal criminal proceedings should be immediately carried out into the allegations. Any law enforcement agent charged in connection with torture or other human rights violations should be immediately suspended from duties directly relating to arresting, guarding or interrogating detainees. If convicted, he or she should be automatically dismissed from duty, in addition to whatever punishment is imposed by the court. The crimes of torture and other gross human rights violations such as extra-judicial executions should not be subject to any statute of limitations. Any decision to suspend or dismiss security officials accused or convicted of human rights violations should be made public. 11. Protection of victims and witnesses The government should ensure that all necessary measures are taken to prevent attacks on or threats against victims of human rights violations and their relatives, witnesses to such abuses and human rights activists, and that all those responsible for such actions are brought to justice. 12. Compensation for victims and witnesses Legal reforms should be adopted to ensure that all victims of gross human rights violations receive medical treatment and rehabilitation where necessary, and financial compensation commensurate with the abuse inflicted. In cases where a detainee's death is shown to be the result of a gross human rights violation such as torture or extra-judicial execution, the victim's relatives should receive compensatory and exemplary damages. 13. Promoting respect for human rights An absolute prohibition of torture and ill-treatment as crimes under domestic law should be visibly displayed in every detention centre in the country. The government should adopt and publish a code of conduct for all law enforcement agents who exercise powers of detention and arrest. This code should conform to the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. In addition to categorically prohibiting the use of torture and ill-treatment, the Kenyan penal code should specify that law enforcement agents have the right and duty to oppose the practice of torture or any other human rights violation, and therefore should refuse to carry out orders to inflict abuses on detainees. They must report any such abuses of authority to their superior officers, and, where necessary, to the authorities vested with review or remedial powers. Breaches of the code should result in specified disciplinary sanctions and criminal prosecutions of the agents involved. The government should ensure that all law enforcement agents receive adequate training on human rights standards, both domestic and international, and on the means for their protection. That training should include training in preventing human rights violations, medical ethics and prisoners rights. It should also be given to all prison personnel, including medical personnel.

Joint development efforts result in new 7 axis robot for highly complex applications. Robot Simulations offers modelling and off-line programming as standard option in Workspace ®. Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Robot Simulations Ltd., has announced the successful completion of a unique joint development effort between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, RSL and the RSL Sales and Marketing dealers in Japan, Robotmation and the Marubeni Hitech. This has lead to the launch of the new PA-10 robot as standard within Workspace ® 4.0 for Windows ® 95. This robot has 7 axes, is lightweight, and is designed to perform many applications outside of the range or scope of traditional industrial robots. This is based on the improved degree of freedom and general useability. Industrial robots currently on market have five or six degrees of freedom. However in order to deal with the increasingly complex robot work, such as obstacle avoidance, confined space access etc. MHI have provided the solution by designing seven degrees of freedom (RPRPRPR R = Rotation, P = Pivot) After the technical development team at RSL had completed the kinematic modelling of this new robot in close co-operation with MHI, the controller language was developed. Much thought was put into the usability to maximise the off-line programming features of Workspace. With the future complexity of the tasks that the PA-10 will be utilised, off-line programming and simulation for cell layout will be an important element in the functionality of the robot. "We are happy to work with any robot manufacturer in the world to bring this type of joint technological innovation to the robotics industry", says Roger Verrall, Managing Director of RSL. "By bringing together the expertise of RSL and robot manufacturers we can help to move the industry to the higher levels that they seek".

It is fully compatible with Arla programmes created by Workspace and may be used as an alternative to using ABB software to download these text files to an S3 controller. The latest release of SPORT has the following capabilities: File compilation - Convert a robot program from ARLA to binary code. Task compilation - Convert all robot programs in a task from ARLA to binary code. Diskette Functions - Using diskette to transfer program between robot and PC. On Line Communication - Communication between robot and PC via serial link. File decompilation - Convert a robot program from binary code to ARLA robot language. Block decompilation - Convert a block of robot programs from binary code to ARLA. Program Editor - Creating robot programs and transfer position and orientation data via DDE to SPORT from AutoCAD. OLP-import - A file with .irb extension created in OLP3 (english or swedish) can be converted to SPORT standard. Printing - Print a file: File, Print, (notepad starts with the actual file), you may add comments to the file, Arkiv, Skriv ut. Possible to specify a Word processor (WinWord, Write, Notepad...). The word processor is started from the menu or by Ctrl+Enter in a .rpl-file or a selected .rpl-file in the task-file. If a file excedes 64kb the specified word processor will be started automatically. As a complement to task a new feature with block files (extension .IRB) has been introduced which is compatible with olp irb files. This version of SPORT has debugging capabilities. This application shows the current running line in the task by highlighting it. Prodebug.exe has DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) to the to sailserv.exe, a module for robot control. This version is shipped with the ADS aplication SAIL (Simulation AId for Link mechanisms). This is a general module for kinematic simulation in AutoCAD for Windows. Via DDE are the module SAILSERV and SAIL communicating and the model of the ABB2000 are automatically updated during the simulation. New Features in the latest release Release 1.51 adds new features to the SPORT system. TCP calibration - You are now able to measure the TCP and Basepoint of the robot and directlly update theTCP register of the controller. External axes are now supported both in the editor and in the communication part [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

Three cords extend from drums fixed in the cell in a triangle arrangement to meet at the end of the robot. The extensions of each cord is measured by optical encoder on the drum which report the rotation of the drum. Given the lengths of the three cords and the distances between the drums which is discovered during the self-calibration setup for Robotrak it is possible to calculate the true position of the endpoint of the robot. The software for setting up and using Robotrak is embedded in Workspace and compares measurements taken using Robotrak to the teachpoints for the same positions recorded by the robot. Workspace then extracts the errors in the nominal controller model of the robot to produce a filter which sits between the simulation and the robot and fools the inaccurate robot into achieving going accurately to the desired position. Parameters calibrated for Joint zero positions Link lengths Misalignment of successive joints Tool offset Position and orientation of the measuring system (Robotrak) Joint compliance due to weight of payload and links Other technical data Repeatability of Robotrak - 0.3mm Kinematic model used - 5 parameter DH model Repeatability of uncalibrated Robot - typically 0.1mm Accuracy of uncalibrated robot - between 15mm and 2mm Accuracy of calibrated robot - 1mm Overall time taken for setup and robot calibration - 30 to 60 minutes Calibration using Workspace and Robotrak in more detail [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts? Why are there colons in the message section when I try post a followup? Why didn't my post show up? Where can I get the scripts for this program? Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts? No. You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message. The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting. If they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in <>'s. If they allow it, your html markup will appear in the posting. It can't hurt to try. Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a followup? Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or disable the quoting of previous messages. Why didn't my post show up? Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the page, it simply pulled it out of cache. Please reload your browser and it should then appear. Where can I get the scripts for this program? The scripts are written in Perl and created by Matt Wright. They are free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other scripts at: http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/. Enjoy!

I suggest that you poll the com port for a change in the state of its flags before attempting to transmit the next command. This is because the controller is busy and loses the first few characters of the next command, thus causing a syntax error when it eventually starts to take notice of its serial port again. Alternatively, you could configure the port for an infinite number of retries from DOS but I am not certain if this will affect the operation of your .exe file.

They use very high pressure water jets varying in pressure from 40,000 to 55,000 psi depending on the type and width of the material to be cut. The distilled water is run through three filters (10, 1, and 0.5 micron thick) to filter out any particles and then passed through flexible metal tubing along the length of the robot to a nozzle attached as a tool to the end of the robot.Materials that can be cut in this way include fibre-glass, headliner material, carpet, plastic (hard and soft). With the addition of an abrasive named garnet (with the texture of sand) it becomes possible to cut sheet metal or even marble: RPT have developed workcells that can cut more than 3 inches of aluminium or 2 inches of steel. Water-jet cutting is very cost-efficient in comparison to other methods such as laser-jet cutting. It is particularly suitable for cutting soft fabrics, causes no heat-stress on the part (it is its own cooling system), and the water can be easily recycled or drained straight into the sewer. The Requirements The pelt to be cut is 27 millimetres thick. RPT were requested to make two cuts (see figure 1). The first cut would be at a 54 degree angle to the surface. There were additional specifications as to the length and width of the pelt, from cut line to cut line on the surface. There was also a radius in each corner of 10 millimetres on the surface. It was required that the 54 degree cut angle be maintained throughout the radius. The second cut was to be done at an 80 degree angle to the upper surface. This cut was to be made on the already existing 'slope' of the 54 degree cut. This would mean that the overall length and width of the part should be measured at its widest point on the 'peak' of the edges. Again there were specified lengths and widths for this 'peak' as well as the bottom surface cut line to cut line. Again there was a specific radius that had to maintain this 80 degree cut angle. There was also a specification that this 'peak' had to be 13 millimetres from the surface, and had to be maintained at this consistent height around the whole part, especially the corners. Angles needed to be maintained +/- 2 degrees. Dimensions needed to be maintained +/- 1 millimetre. Figure 1 - The part specification The Workcell The workcell is shown in figure 2. It consists of a Fanuc S500 robot using an S3 controller and the TP robot language. Four parts are cut from one pelt before the cut parts are unloaded and the next pelt placed in the workcell. The First Attempt: Manual Programming The first attempt to solve the problem involved teaching the robot by hand using the Fanuc teach-pendant. This required a great deal of time and patience to teach the hundreds of points required for each of the four cuts. Although the programmer could fine tune points taught by eye by entering numbers calculated using the mathematics of the part, it was still extremely difficult to ensure that the angle of the cuts was consistent. A further problem was that the cuts were not repeatable over the four parts. Because of the distortion in the robot envelope due to the geometric structure of the robot the points used to cut a part in one area of the pelt when transferred to another area of the pelt gave less consistent cuts. Water-jet cutting is a very demanding application because any deviation that the robot makes in its path, any change in velocity, any defect in the robot will show up in the final part. After about 40 hours of programming the parts being cut were still not of the quality required. The Solution:Simulation,Calibration and Offline Programming using Workspace/Robotrak RPT chose to use a robot simulation software package named Workspace to perform the simulation, calibration, and offline programming of the workcell. The key factors in this decision were as follows: 1. Workspace is integrated with the Robotrak robot and tool calibration system. This close integration means that robot and tool calibration (for both the tool offset and orientation) is quick and effective. 2. Workspace allow users to work in the robot's native language, in this case TP. This provides users with the entire power of the TP language, without the need for postprocessing of any kind. Offline programming is therefore a one-step process. 3. The Workspace CAD, simulation, and offline programming system is quick and easy to use. This enabled the workcell to be designed. 4. Workspace can run on any IBM-compatible PC. The cost of the hardware required for the simulation was therefore kept to a minimum, and existing PCs at present used for other purposes might be used. Workspace can also run on a notebook. This enables the engineers involved in modifications in the workcell to work on the shopfloor if required. 5. Robotrak is easy to set up and use, even in a clustered workcell, since the three base units that must be placed on the floor can be placed anywhere in the workcell. The Method First one part was modelled using the Workspace CAD system as a series of closed polylines (linked arcs and lines). The geometry points required along each polyline (representing the meeting point of the water-jet and the part) were taught within Workspace along the polyline. These geometry points are like robot teachpoints except that they are stored with the model and may therefore be easily moved in the model independently of the robot. The user defined only start and end geometry points on a given line or arc - Workspace then used interpolation to automatically create intermediate geometry points along the lines or arcs at a distance between each point defined by the programmer. This technique of over defining the path (using more points than might seem necessary) ensures that the robot follows the path more precisely. The part was then copied four times and placed within the workcell. This also copies and moves the geometry points four times so that they do not need to be redefined for each part. The Fanuc S500 robot model was loaded from the robot library and placed within the workcell. If the placing of the robot was such that any of the geometry points were unachievable then the geometry points were displayed in red. The robot could then be repositioned. Figure 2 shows the Workspace model of the workcell and Figure 3 shows the geometry points defined on a part. Figure 2 - The Workspace model of the workcell Figure 3 - Geometry points defined on a part The robot programme was defined from the Workspace menus in the TP language using movements to the geometry points and the necessary motion types, motion termination types, and velocities. If movement along the path caused the robot to hit a limit on one of the wrist joints, or when moving from one cut to the next cut, then an additional move was inserted to enable the wrist to re-orientate itself (known as an air move). After the robot programme was defined from the Workspace menus then the Workspace text editor was used to inspect and comment the different parts of the programme, as well as to add commands for turning the water jet on or off.The next stage was to calibrate the robot and tool (see Figure 4) using Robotrak. A special fitting had been designed that screwed the robotrak cords onto the end of the water-jet. The robot was then moved to 50 teachpoints all with different positions and orientations throughout the envelope, and Workspace automatically took an xyz measurement reading from Robotrak each time the robot paused between movements. Figure 4 - Robot and tool calibration using Robotrak The teachpoint file and the measurement file were then used in Workspace to instigate a search which in 1 minute found the joint angle offsets, errors in link lengths, misalignment of joint axes, tool xyz offset, and joint compliances, which together make up the signature of the robot. Two additional fittings were used to take two additional measurements using Robotrak and thereby find the true tool orientation (see Figure 5). Figure 5 - Robotrak fittings for end of water-jet tool (from left to right): for measuring 50 points; for measuring tool z-axis, for measuring tool x-axis; for teaching points on part. Robotrak was then disconnected from the robot and a pointer attached to the end of the water-jet tool. This pointer was used to teach three teachpoints which just touched each of the four pelts. By taking these teachpoints back into Workspace and comparing them with the geometry points taught on the pelts it was possible to update the model for the true position of the pelts. The robot programme was then downloaded to the robot using the Workspace Send to robot command. This converts all the geometry points in the programme into teachpoints, uses the robot and tool signature to correct the accuracy of the points, merges the teachpoint file and programme file and compiles it to a binary .TP file, and then copies the file into the robot subdirectory. The Results It took about 10 hours to complete the whole simulation, calibration and offline programme the 4 parts and their programmes, compared to the 40 hours plus for the programming alone. These programmes were then applied to the robot with the calibration package, the tooling was calibrated with a tool fixture, and the first cut proved more consistently accurate in terms of cut angle and position than any manually taught programme was able to achieve. The programme created using Workspace and Robotrak ran first time on the robot controller without any modifications. No touch up was required using the teach pendant. Summary Robot simulation, calibration, and offline programming produced parts that were cut to a higher accuracy than those cut using manually taught methods. The time taken to programme an accurate path was also reduced drastically. No manual touch up of the points was required primarily because the real-world had been accurately simulated using the Workspace/Robotrak robot, tool, and model calibration methods.

For many years they have installed coin-operated gas meters to meet the needs of certain customers. Because these meters hold coins, they have proved to be targets for vandalism and theft. British Gas Research and technology division have therefore developed several schemes for meters which use plastic keys, magnetic strip cards and smart cards as a credit medium. The challenge A test rig had to be implemented to assess the reliability of the payment schemes outlined above before embarking on a nation-wide installation programme. The test rig had to pick up the keys or cards from feeds, then insert and remove them from the meters. In the case of the cards, it was necessary to place each one into a card programming device first. All results were to be logged automatically on a PC. The solution The first step in the design of the test rig was to use Workspace to try out various layout ideas and compare the performance of different robots for the application. The robot, gas meter, card programmer, feeding mechanism and other components were all modelled using the simulation's integrated CAD system. then, several different industrial robots were placed in the Workspace computer model and tested. The most appropriate layout was quickly found by comparing the times for one complete test cycle. After evaluation on the simulator, an Alpha2 robot was chosen as the ideal robot. The robot was subsequently purchased and the test rig was built. British Gas' financial justification for Workspace Simulation using Workspace enabled different robots to be evaluated for the task before purchase. The test rig was built on a "right first time" basis. Workspace prevented costly mistakes during the development of the project. 1993 Robot Simulations Ltd.C.G.Ariss [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

The conventional approach for Glaxo is to take drawings of the design and use them to build "non-functional" models whose sole purpose is to illustrate the design concept. The next stage is to build a moving "proof of principle" model with which to investigate the functional capability of the system. Speed of development is a key issue, and Glaxo purchased Workspace to provide additional capability to their design department. The solution Glaxo's proposed solution is to install a completely new design of robotic storage and retrieval system. The arrangement was modelled on Workspace and moving devices simulated. Workspace enabled the BioEngineering department to check that the design achieved its specification. In addition, estimates of retrieval times were automatically calculated to judge the efficiency of the system. Using Workspace, the model can be changed effortlessly to experiment with alternative layouts. A moving animation of the design clearly communicated the concept to management and end users, promoting informed discussion and leading to the system's optimisation, acceptance and approval. The future Mike Duncan of Glaxo Group Research stated that, in future Workspace will be used as follows:- "Illustrate the proposed arrangements of automated systems; it will offer, in addition, the opportunity to experiment quickly and cheaply with alternative layouts." "Ensure that the physical layout of the system does not clash with the surrounding environment and related equipment either at rest or at any point in its operational cycle." "Optimise the functional design and operational procedure of the system during development to ensure that the first-off, which may be the only example, requires little or no modification to achieve the standard of structural integrity and behavioural refinement required for performance critical applications in a sophisticated science-oriented environment." "Workspace will reduce the need to build models and will provide a basis for 'right-first-time' development of special purpose laboratory automation." Glaxo's financial justification for Workspace Faster accomplishment of automation projects. Reduced requirement for rectification during system development prior to commissioning. Reduced requirement for physical models during the planning, design and development programme. 1993 Robot Simulations Ltd.

They specialise in the fabrication and installation of heavy steel structures, cranes and pressure vessels. They manufacture in the region of 24,000 tonnes of steel structures per year and have over 1800 employees. The challenge Cimtas arc weld large I-beams on their production line and have recently purchased both Fanuc Arcmate and REIS SRV12L robots to form part of their manufacturing system. fig.1fig.2 The I-beams are placed on a rotating table mechanism (D) which may be positioned manually along a linear track (C). by an operator (See fig.1). Once the beam is in place, the rotating overhead mechanism (A) swings the robot across into the appropriate position to start welding. Height of the robot above the floor may be adjusted manually at B. Before using Workspace, the robot program was generated entirely by using the teach pendant on the shop floor. Since 9 axes are used, it can be difficult for the operator to visualise all possible configurations. Due to the size of the I-beams, Cimtas have encountered many problems in getting the robots to achieve satisfactory welds without exceeding a robot joint limit or having the welding tool collide with the workpiece. It is possible to move the robot up and down along the vertical track B, but only by unbolting it and winching it into position. This makes it difficult to experiment with different heights above the floor. Project aims To experiment with different robot and table configurations to maximise the work envelope. To minimise the possibility of a collision when the robot re-orients itself during its task. To improve safety for the human operator. To reduce the need for teach pendant programming. To optimise the robot program and reduce cycle time. The solution A model of the workcell was created with Workspace and the SRV12L and Arcmate were compared for reachability. The Workspace facility to plot the working envelope was used to position the work piece optimally. It was immediately found that in this application, the Reis SRV12L robot allowed a greater working envelope, so this robot was chosen in place of the Arcmate for the workcell. By using Workspace it was possible to make the vertical track B a translational joint on the rotating column A. This allowed the height of the robot to be optimised by simply changing a variable in the simulation. Work then began on developing a set of teach points which the robot could follow without hitting a joint limit or colliding with the workpiece. It was found that repositioning the column A between welds enabled several particularly difficult moves to be achieved. Previously, Cimtas had simply placed the mechanism so that it was at right angles to the linear track C for the duration of the cycle. Collisions tended to arise if the robot was forced to reorient the wrist during a linear move along a welding seam. The simulation highlights any collisions and allows the user to abandon a move and immediately try another approach. Cimtas' financial justification for Workspace A complete set of teach points to perform the task was generated. These teach points were later used directly in a new program generated on Cimtas' text-based off line programming system. Time to develop the new program was reduced by over 40%. Development of the new program was achieved off-line while the robot was operating. A technical decision was made to use only Reis robots for the larger workpieces in Cimtas's manufacturing workcell. The risk of damage to personnel and equipment was eliminated. 1993 Robot Simulations Ltd.C.G.Ariss [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

The course has been developed to address the need for graduate engineers with a good knowledge of automated manufacturing systems. The challenge An essential theme in the course is that of practical "hands-on" experience of robots. The University currently has eleven small educational robots and an industrial ABB IRB1000. To date, students have had to work in teams, having access to the robots only during laboratory sessions. Clearly more industrial robots had to be made available to provide students with the necessary access to modern robotic hardware. An ideal solution would be to provide each student with their own robot, which they could use at any time in complete safety. The prohibitive cost of industrial robots is only the first barrier to the undertaking of such a course. Student safety is also a prime consideration. Additional staff would be needed to supervise laboratory sessions and access at other times would be impossible. The solution Combining practical laboratory sessions with Workspace provided the answer. The simulation system is now used as the foundations for all robotic modules on the course. Students may use Workspace to load a model of an industrial robot, create a workcell using the integrated CAD system and write robot programs. This can be done at any time of the day using one of the University's PCs. Students may even construct their own mechanisms in Workspace and experiment with different controller parameters, plotting graphs to show the effect on robot dynamics. Simulated robotic projects can be developed in complete safety. In addition, the newly introduced Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) features in Workspace have enabled the creation of interactive training exercises by course tutors. The University now intends to start an active Workspace users group which will pool CAL material world-wide from a wide range of institutions. Benefits Savings on robotic hardware allowed more students to enrol Use of simulation software made the course more attractive to prospective students Safety problems were overcome Students could apply newly learnt principles outside of laboratory sessions The University's financial justification for Workspace Establishment of the course would not have been possible without a simulation system Workspace provides the best possible price/performance ratio Academic staff were free to concentrate on teaching rather than safety supervision 1993 Robot Simulations Ltd.C.G.Ariss [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

Their production line is highly automated, using robots to improve quality in the construction of large, steel components. The challenge Komatsu needed to build a new workcell for a component that previously had to be welded by hand. The component has a number of difficult seams to weld, requiring the welding torch to fit into a confined space. The component is approximately 2m long and is constructed using steel plate. The welding seams must lie horizontally with the welding torch making an angle of 45 degrees between adjacent faces. The torch moves at about 15cm per minute, so the part must be positioned carefully for a good weld. The weld illustrated as A-B in the diagram opposite is a particularly difficult one since the welding torch must fit between two plates to get to the seam. Project Aims Weld at least 80% of the seams by robot Design and evaluate an appropriate positioning device Evaluate the robot's welding torch design Test for collisions The solution The Komatsu robot (KHY660) was modelled on Workspace and the component was imported in the form of a DXF file. Once this was done a model of a positioner was created. Originally, a positioner with 3 axes was to be built especially for this task. However, since this was expensive, Komatsu wished to evaluate a spare positioner they had at the plant. This NEI Thompson 2-axis positioner was left over from a previous job but did not appear to offer the same flexibility as the original positioner design. Workspace was used to test whether this positioner could place the component correctly for all welding seams. Here is a diagram of the final proposed workcell:- (Note that the clamps used to secure the part to the positioner are not shown.) The robot work envelope is shown hatched in the diagram to the right and the torch is shown on the weld A-B. On attempting to "weld" the part, Workspace demonstrated that part of the robot tool would collide with the component in the proposed layout. By interactively changing the positioner joint angles it was discovered that there was one position where the tool could perform the weld without collisions. The new design (using the 2-axis positioner) was proved to be more effective than the original proposal. All welds were found to be within reach, although the welding torch length was to be reduced to provide adequate clearance along seam A-B. The 2-axis positioner exceeded expectations, since it was also capable of carrying a different component for another task within the same workcell setup. Komatsu's financial justification for Workspace By recycling an unused positioner, cost savings in excess of �60,000 were made. Time to develop the system was significantly reduced. Komatsu kept full control over the design process. 1994 Robot Simulations Ltd.C.G.Ariss [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

This feature allows robots to be operated remotely, with the operator using Workspace to view the current robot status. The user first creates a model of the real work-cell using the Workspace CAD system (IGES/DXF data can be imported if so desired). The robot models they require to build this virtual world can be selected from a library of over 140 robots (they can alternatively create their own robots). Data from the real world is accessed via a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL). The user has access to the source code which creates the DLL and they insert their own software modules into the DLL to bring external data into the PC. This external data could for example, be joint encoder data from a real robot describing the positions of robot joints or robot auxiliary axes within the real work-cell. The code interface to the DLL from Workspace allows up to 9 robot models or mechanisms to be controlled by external data. When the telelmanipulation option is set in motion Workspace passes into the DLL either a robot's current position, a robot's current joint angles or a robot's current gripper status. This data is combined with the external data in a user definable way to provide a set of demanded positions (or joint angles) which are then passed back into Workspace for the robot models to achieve. The viewing mode can be either wire-frame, hidden-line or solid-shade. With more complex viewing modes like solid-shade the refresh speed for the graphical display decreases. Wire-frame has the quickest refresh rate. To modify the DLL the user needs a software compiler capable of creating Workspace compatible DLLs. The code we supply to create the telemanipulation DLL is designed for use with Borland Pascal v7.0. DLLs can also be generated using C and we can supply C code for Borland C v4.0 to create compatible DLLs.

Many new robot languages are now available as options for Workspace including: ABB Rapid, Yaskawa/Motoman Inform1 and Inform2, Sankyo and IBM AML2, PSI. The commands for editing GP paths have been improved, as have the commands for editing geometry points, editing several geometry points at once (multiple GPs), and editing teachpoints. The commands for editing several geometry points should save the user some time over the old GP edit methods. Many of the new commands for editing teachpoints are useful in reverse engineering and re-engineering workcells, and for last minute touch-ups of robot programs during offline programming. The user-interface and the efficiency of the robot and tool calibration have been improved, while the Robotrak setup procedures have been altered to increase their reliability even when used by inexperienced users. In general, the changes in 3.5 reflect the past few years' accumulated experience from both within RSL and close contact with industrial customers of simulating and offline programming complex workcells using Workspace and Robotrak These features now give the customer an affordable, user friendly tool to carry out the most complex of tasks at shop floor level with confidence. New and changed commands MODEL MENU 1. Load object into model: when a model has been selected the objects displayed will be only those with no parents. 2. Set project directory : now sets the Ready for robot directory to projectdir/ROBOT. 3. Make directory : copies a file to a path (which is relative to the WS3 directory). CREATE MENU Create GPs submenu 1. The Create Gps on polyline submenu now has the additional command Between two polylines which creates GPs along the current polyline in the direction of the nearest point on the other polyline. This is useful if the GPs are being defined on part whose geometry is represented by two parallel polylines. 2. Create Gps over entire polyline and Create Gps over entire surface boundary: the commands on these menus work in a similar way to the Create GPs on polyline and the Create Gps over surface boundary except that by default the first GP is at the beginnings of the polyline and the second GP is at the end of the polyline. 3. Align axes with tangent: when this flag is on then when GPs are created along a polyline or a surface boundary their default position has the normal vector normal to the tangent (as was the case in Workspace 3.4), whereas when the flag is off the normal vector of the GPs is not normal to the tangent. 4.Create exact GP path on polyline: this is the Exact GP path command renamed. LAYOUT MENU Edit object submenu 1. Information: colour, view, and non-joint axes added. Edit robot submenu 1. Approach vector: moved from Options menu - now saved with the robot model. Used to decide orientation when creating GPs relative to an object feature. Edit tools submenu 1. Attach tool: moves the current object so that its base frame coincides with the coordinate frame of the end link of the robot. A base frame may be defined for an object using the Add tool base frame command. 2. Load and attach tool: same as attach tool except that it also loads the tool object from a model file. Loads an object and then positions the object so that its base frame coincides with the coordinate frame of the end link of the robot. A base frame may be defined for an object using the Add tool base frame command. The user can create models containing tools as a library for this command. To create a library of tools simply create a model containing all the tools and then save the model. 3. Dispose of tool: allows the user to select and delete one of the objects (and its descendants) attached to the end link of the robot. 4. Add tool base frame: adds a coordinate frame to the current object. This may be edited using the Move axes and Turn axes commands (on the Edit joint menu). The frame is used when automatically positioning a tool on the end of the robot (see Attach tool). 5. Gripper of interest: specify which of several grippers on a robot is being referred to. when setting gripper parameters on this menu. 6. Time to open gripper: sets the time taken to open or close the gripper of interest during a simulation. 6. Spot weld gun of interest: specify which of several spot weld guns on a robot is being referred to when setting gun parameters on this menu. 7. Spot weld duration: set the duration of a spot weld (when the gun is closed) by the gun of interest during a simulation. 8. Gun closed to semi-open time: set the time taken for the spot weld gun of interest to go from closed to semi-open during a simulation. 9. Gun semi-open to open time: set the time taken for the spot weld gun of interest to go from semi-open to full open during a simulation. Edit current pointer/Edit geometry point/Edit teachpoint submenus 1. Move/Turn CP/TP/GP: Several commands have been renamed so that phrase approach vector is used instead of z-axis:- Move along approach vector, Approach vector up, Approach vector down, Reverse approach vector, Approach vector away from base, Drag approach vector. Edit geometry point submenu Some options have been moved onto the Edit multiple GP submenu. Edit multiple geometry points submenu Almost all the commands on this menu operate on a group of GPs selected using the multiple object selection side bar. 1. Create Tps from Gps submenu (contains Create TPs from multiple GPs, Create Tps from all GPs). 2. Change Gps approach vector: changes the approach vector for the selected GPs. Options are Arla to TP (converts GPs created in the ARLA language assuming an x-axis approach vector into GPs suitable for use in the TP language where a z-axis approach vector is assumed) and TP to Arla These options may be used with other languages which have similar approach vectors to TP and Arla. 3. Remove tool from GPs: removes the current tool frame from the GPs. This is useful if the GPs were created from teachpoints using an active tool frame but the user wishes to view the GPs as though they were representing the position of the faceplate of the robot at each teachpoint. (see also Add tool to GPs). 4. Add tool to Gps: removes the current tool frame from the GPs. This is useful if the GPs were created from teachpoints using a nil tool frame so that they represent the position of the faceplate of the robot, but the user wishes to view the GPs as though they were representing the position of the end of the robot tool at each teachpoint. (see also Remove tool from GPs). 5. Turn GPs about own x-axis: turn all the GPs about their own x-axis. 6. Turn GPs about own y-axis: turn all the GPs about their own y-axis. 7. Turn GPs about own z-axis: turn all the GPs about their own z-axis. 8. Autoturn GPs about approach vector:attempts to find a suitable angle to turn all the GPs about their approach vector such that all the GPs become achievable by the current robot, then performs the turn. Edit teachpoint submenu Some options have been moved onto the Edit all teachpoints submenu. 1. Autoturn TP about approach vector: allows the user to interactively turn the teachpoint about its approach vector, showing as it is turned the position of the robot with its tool moved to the teachpoint. Edit all teachpoints submenu 1. Create Gps from all TPs: creates a geometry point for each teachpoint. If the user wishes then the GPs may also store the teachpoint configuration, or if auxiliary axes are present the GPs may store the auxiliary axes positions. 2. Reflect all TPs using joints: reflects all the teachpoints by adjusting the joint angles. Joint angles 1, 4, and 6 are reversed for each teachpoint. The effect of this on most revolute robots is to reflect the coordinate frames of each teachpoint through a plane passing through joint 1 and its zero position. By reflecting in this way instead of reflecting the coordinate frames of the teachpoints the user ensures that the reflected teachpoints also reflect the robot configurations of the original points. The user is prompted for the name of the robot onto which the new teachpoint file is to be reflected. 3. Adjust all TPs for different TCP: removes the current tool frame from the teachpoints (so that they represent the position of the faceplate of the robot) and adds in a tool frame selected by the user (so that the teachpoints now represent the position of the end of the new robot tool). 4. Turn all TPs about approach vector: turns all the teachpoints about their approach vectors. 5. Move all TPs: moves all the teachpoints through an x,y,z offset relative to the base frame of the robot. 6. Move all TPs using 1 point shift: moves all the teachpoints through a transform defined by the desired position and the old position of a teachpoint. The user first teaches a teachpoint on the robot to represent the desired position of a teachpoint, saves this in the same file as the old teachpoints, brings the file to Workspace, then issues the command and selects the new teachpoint and the old teachpoint. 7. Adjust all TPs for bent tool: changes the tcp value (while adjusting the teachpoints so that the position of the faceplate of the robot at each point does not change) using a transform defined by the desired position and old position of a teachpoint. The user first teaches a teachpoint on the robot to represent the desired position of a teachpoint with the bent or changed tool, saves this in the same file as the old teachpoints, brings the file to Workspace, then issues the command and selects the new teachpoint and the old teachpoint. Edit GP path submenu 1.GP path application: sets the application for which the user is using the GP path. The Edit GP path as menu will only allow the user to select Tool actions which are appropriate for the application. Possible applications are waterjet, spot welding, arc welding, paint spraying, material handling, sealant, laser cutting, and deburring. The user may change the application at any time and then start selecting tool states for the new application. 2. Edit current GP as menu: allows the user to change the properties of a particular node on a GP path, the node being the one containing the current GP object. Each node contains a GP object, various motion properties used to approach that GP from the previous GP node, various actions (including tool actions) which are to be implemented once the robot reaches the GP. The properties of a GP node are described in more detail below: GP object name - name of a geometry point object; Motion type - the type of motion (joint, circular, or linear); Termination type - the type of termination at the point expressed as a percentage (0 indicates stop at the point, 100 indicates move through or near the point without stopping); Velocity - percentage of the maximum velocity to use when moving towards the GP; Acceleration - percentage of the maximum acceleration to use when moving towards the GP; P>Wait time - time for the robot to wait (be stationary) after reaching the GP; Routine to call - the name of a routine which is to be called once the GP is reached; Signal - the type of signal ling to do once the GP is reached - options are No signal, EnterInterferenceZone (wait for a signal from another robot saying that the other robot has left a zone of interference, then once it is received send a signal to the other robot saying that it has entered the zone of intereference), LeaveInterferenceZone (send a signal to another robot saying that it has left a zone of interference). Note that interference zones in this context do not need to have their physical bounds described but are defined by when on the GP path the signals are sent; Tool action - the tool action to be performed after the robot reaches the GP. Possible values are defined by the application (see GP path application) but examples are ArcOn and ArcOff (for arc welding) and PaintSprayOn and PaintSprayOff (for paint spraying). Different tool graphics are displayed during a simulation of the robot following the GP path as each action is executed. 3. Edit current GP path as menu: performs the same task as Edit current GP as menu except that it brings up all the GPs on the path at once. 4. Edit GP path as text: Allows the user to edit a GP path as though it were a text file. Note that the GP path is really an object which is saved with the model in the model file. When the user uses the Edit GP path as text command Workspace converts the path into a text file temporarily, then converts it back from a text file to a GP object when the user exits from the edit. Parts of GP paths may be easily cut and pasted between different GP paths using the text edit commands (control-k b to mark the beginning of a block, control-k k to mark the end of a block, control-k w to write a block to a file, control-k r to read a block from a file). 5. Append GP path: appends a GP path to the current GP path. 6. Break GP path before GP: Breaks a GP path just before the current GP. 7. Reverse GP path: reverses the current GP path. 8. Insert GP at start: inserts a GP at the start of the current GP path. 9. Insert GP after current GP: inserts a GP into a GP path just after the current GP. 10. Delete GP: Deletes a GP node from the current GP path (note that the GP is only deleted from the GP path - the GP object itself is not deleted). 11. Move GP to start of path: moves a GP node to the beginnings of the current GP path. 12. Move GP to after current GP: moves a GP to after the current GP in the GP path. 13. Scale all speeds: scales the speeds of all the GP nodes in the current path using a scaling factor. A scaling factor of 1 indicates no change. 14. Change all termination types: sets the termination types for all the GP nodes on the current GP path to a value entered by the user. A termination type of 0 indicates that the robot is to stop at all the points, while a termination type of 100 indicates that the robot is to move through or near all the points without stopping. 15. Change all motion types: changes the motion type (joint, linear or circular) for all the GP nodes on the current GP path to a new setting. 16. Remove all tool action: removes all the tool actions from a GP path (e.g. ArcOn, ArcOff). Simulate menu 1. Replay track and create geometry path: replays a track while creating a geometry path which represents the movement of the robot during the track and any tool actions during the track. This command may be used to create geometry paths from a robot program written in one robot language which is then converted using the Follow GP path command into a robot program written in another robot language. 2. Replay track and record sweep: replays a track while creating lines to represent the sweep of the tool attached to the end of the robot as the robot moves. Enables the user to quickly see if the tool interferes with any fixtures. 3. Send to robot and receive from robot have been implemented for a wider range of robots. Note that the Calibration filter is used only when converting between GPs and TPs (e.g. when GPs are converted to TPs during a Send to robot), or when using the Recalibrate tool or Calibrate model submenu commands. The calibration filter is not used on teachpoints which are Sent to robot or Received from robot under any other circumstances. 4. Edit any file: allows the user to edit any text file. Options menu 1. The Paintshade option has been removed. Shade should be used instead. Picture submenu 1. Hiddenline mode: Full indicates that the hiddenline removal will still be rigorous even when the user zooms in or out on a workcell, whereas Clipped means that hiddenline removal is not performed for objects which are completely off the screen. Clipped may be slightly faster than Full for large and complex workcells but if Clipped is on and the user zooms out then the picture of the workcell may no longer have the outer hidden lines removed correctly. Robot options submenu 1. Autoplace robot using TPs: attempts to find a suitable position to place the robot that will allow all the teachpoints to be achievable. The search is conducted in the plane parallel to the screen which passes through the current pointer. During the search a cross is drawn at each position which would be suitable for placing the robot, and at the end of the search the user has the option of placing the robot at a suitable position. 2. Autoplace robot using multiple GPs: works in a similar way to the Autoplace robot using TPs command except that the search is for a position for placing the robot that will make the selected geometry points achievable. 3. Label current robot: when this flag is on then the current robot will be labelled on the screen with its name. This is useful when working with several robots in one workcell. 4. Robot tool path: when this flag is on then the path taken during an arc-weld or a laser cut or a water jet cut will be displayed as a series of lines. TP and GP option submenu 1. Geometry path display: when this flag is on then geometry paths will be displayed as a dotted line between geometry points with arrows indicating the direction of movement along the geometry path. Calibrate robot submenu The Calibrate robot submenus have been reorganised so that the user can follow step by step what to do next during a calibration. After each step in the setup Workspace checks that the encoder units have returned to zero and that the repeatability has not degraded. 1. The Robotrak setup menu has been reorganised as follows (note that some commands have been moved to the Robotrak special options submenu): Exact length of bar: Set all zero positions: Check repeatabilities: it is important to check that when the cords are pulled away from the Robotrak units then returned to their zero position that the repeatability of the zero reading is good. This command displays the readings for all three encoders on the screen so that the user can pull each cord out (at least 2m) then return the cord to its zero (for at least 0.5 of a second) until the colour of the reading changes from red to black and a beep is heard (indicating that three successive zero readings were within three encoder counts of each other). If there are three people available to do the set up then all three cords can be checked for repeatability at once. Set encoder bar length (timed): This sets the encoder bar length for each bar in turn. The user has 15 seconds from the issue of this command to place the bar on encoder unit 1. After 15 seconds a reading is taken. The user then has 15 seconds to prepare for a reading from encoder unit 2, and a further 15 seconds to prepare for the reading from encoder unit 3. The command is structured this way so that one person can set up Robotrak without assistance. Set distance between bases: The user can either set the distance between the bases one at a time as in Workspace 3.4, or set the distances between all three bases all at once (not recommended for accurate work because the sharp angles of the cords can degrade the repeatability of the measurements and setting all distances at once forces the user to pull the cord over sharp angles). Length of top part of cord 1: Length of top part of cord 2: Length of top part of cord 3: Continuous cord reading: Continuous measurement reading: Auto-setup: auto-setup runs through all the above commands one at a time in succession without the user having to select the command. 2. Check teachpoints suitable: checks that the current teachpoint file contains teachpoints which provide an adequate range of joint values for each joint to ensure a good calibration (the joint 4 wrist must be flipped for a good calibration), and that the teachpoints are not too close to the plane of Robotrak since that would degrade the accuracy of the measurements. 3. Auto-record Robotrak measurements: 4. Extract errors from measurements: 5. The new Robotrak special options submenu is organised as follows: Card base address: Card version: Record Robotrak measurements: Test calibrated robot: Test using box: Calibrate tool z-axis: Calibrate tool x-axis: Record trajectory: Turn Robotrak display off: Calibrated robot: XYZ teachpoint filter: Parameters to calibrate: 1. At least four teachpoints are now recommended when recalibrating a tool (instead of 3 which were recommended in 3.4). Pendant menu Joint zero: sets all the joints of the current robot or mechanism to their zero position. Other Changes 1. The cycles times obtained with Fanuc robots are now more accurate than before since they use the same trajectory generation algorithms that are used on Fanuc controllers. The accuracy of the cycle times for other robot languages should also be improved. 2. The tool actions described under Geometry Paths are also available from the action menu. 3. The Workspace signaldef input directive can now take just a robotname as a parameter (though the old signaldef command which took the parameters trackname and external track signal number is still valid). The Workspace signaldef output directive is no longer required, but would still be valid is used. 4. The multiple object selection sidebar which is used with many commands contains a new option: Path. When this is selected then the user chooses a name of a geometry point path and all the geometry points on that path are selected. 5. The Weldpos and Deburrpos functions are now available for use in a Joint expression. They work in a similar way to the Grippos function. The Weldpos varies from 0 to 100 as a spot weld gun goes from full-open to closed, while the deburr function varies 0 to 360 and then returns to zero and repeats all the time that deburring is on. 6. Macros may now be created using the programme structure and variables of the Karel2 language. Create a macro by starting a track and then issuing commands from several other menus. As each command is issued it is stored in the track, and if the track is replayed then the commands are executed from the track. Not all the commands on the menus are available for use in Macros at present. [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

A typical repeatability is about 0.1mm while a typical world accuracy is of the order of 10mm or worse. This is not a problem when programming a robot on-line using a hand-held teach-pendant and the human eye. Here it is only repeatability that is an issue. However, when programming a robot using some off-line system to generate the robot locations numerically the accuracy of the robot becomes all important. In theory, it is possible to improve the accuracy so that it is as good as the repeatability. The reason that the accuracy of robots is so bad is because there are manufacturing tolerances involved in the production of each robot that are not taken into account within the robot controller. Each robot therefore has its own individual 'signature'. The most significant sources of error are discrepancies in the robot link lengths, in the zero position of each joint, in the alignment of joint axes, and in the joint compliance (a torsional spring effect dur to the effect of the weight of the payload on the gear transmission). These errors together can account for more than 95% of the overall positional error. What is required is a system that will take measurements of the xyz position of the robot's end effector, compare this with the robot's own estimate of its position, and thereby find estimates for these errors and model these errors to improve the accuracy obtained when off-line programming the robot. An overview of Robotrak Robotrak is an optional measuring system for Workspace that is used to calibrate the robot. It is capable of measuring static positions or motion paths to an accuracy greater than 0.2mm in three dimensions. The Robotrak 3D measurement system One person can set up Robotrak and perform a calibration within 30 minutes. Compared to other calibration systems Robotrak is simple, rugged, and extremely cost-effective. The ability of Workspace to calculate the correct position and orientation of the Robotrak measuring units relative to the robot as part of the calibration means that Robotrak may be mounted at any unknown position in the workcell. The Robotrak measuring system consists of the following:- Three Encoder Measuring Units incorporating 2500 pulses per revolution quadrature encoders. Please note that because each encoder unit contains fragile precision components it should not be dropped or treated roughly. Three Calibration Fixtures (machined brass fork and steel locating plate assembly used for accurately setting the cord exit point on the measuring unit). A Robot Tool Flange Attachment Assembly for connection to the robot under test. A 'Standard Length' Calibration Bar for accurately setting the encoder counts per millimetre. An Encoder Interface Card for linking the Robotrak hardware to an IBM compatible PC. Cables and connectors for use with above items. A menu within Workspace used for setting up Robotrak, recording measurements, and performing robot calibration. The Encoder Measuring Unit Internal View Of Encoder Measuring Unit Robot Tool Flange Attachment Assembly Calibration Fixture Calibration Bar The three encoder units are placed at the corners of an approximately equilateral triangle within the robot workcell. They may be mounted on the ground, on the ceiling, on a wall, or even on a fixture. They should be roughly 2 metres apart from each other, and must be fixed so that they will not move during the calibration. A small, constant, restoring force is applied by each encoder unit to the measurement cord. As each Dynema cord is extended from the encoder unit a drum rotates and an encoder measures the rotation of the drum, thereby measuring the extension of the cord. A constant torque is applied to the drum by means of a torsional spring, thus tensioning the cord. The encoder counts, representing cord extension are passed to Workspace through the encoder interface card, which must be installed in the PC running Workspace. The calibration bar is used during the setting up of Robotrak to determine the scaling factor of encoder counts to the cord extension in millimetres. Once calibrated the Robotrak measuring units themselves then provide a convenient way of measuring the relative distance between each other. This is done by extending the cord from one unit to the next and accurately locating the cord attachment fitting in the calibration fixture of the next measuring unit: thus determining the distance between the two units. This procedure is repeated for all three units in turn operating in an anticlockwise direction. When the set-up is complete, the robot may be calibrated. All three cords are fixed at a single point on the end of the robot tool or faceplate using the robot tool flange attachment assembly. By monitoring the extension of the cords Workspace can calculate the xyz position of the end of the robot tool, either when the robot is stationary or when it is moving. An overview of the Workspace calibration software Workspace makes extensive use of the Robotrak measuring system for calibration. Robotrak is part of the Workspace system, and is used to calibrate robots prior to off-line programming. The software for the calibration is an integral part of Workspace and all the calibration options are available from Workspace menus. The main advantages to the user of a calibration system integrated with the simulation system are that the user interface is greatly simplified and that the price is low compared with discrete calibration and simulation systems. This is the first time that such close integration has been achieved. Robot simulation, calibration, and off-line programming may therefore be seen as a seamless process, in which robot programmes may be transferred to and from each stage with out any problem as is often required during the cell design process. Errors which may be detected and modelled by Workspace and Robotrak include: The zero position of each joint (the position of the joint where the value of the joint variable is 0), The length of each link and the distance offset at each link, The orientation of each joint axis, The compliance at each joint (each joint may be modelled as a torsional spring due to the compliance in the gearing and transmission for the joint), The xyz tool offset from the mounting plate to the end of the tool and the tool axis orientation, The position and orientation of the measuring system co-ordinate frame relative to the robot base co-ordinate frame. Workspace extracts these errors from the physical measurements made by Robotrak and the teachpoints reported by the robot by trying to find a robot model that would best fit the measured characteristics. The Workspace kinematic model of the robot is then modified accordingly. Points generated within Workspace during the course of a simulation are then passed through a filter which alters the points in such a way that the uncalibrated real robot will be fooled in to moving to the point we really wanted it to move to by asking it to move to another, slightly different point. It is necessary to work this way since the real robot can have no knowledge of its physical inadequacies. With Robotrak measuring points to an absolute accuracy of 0.2mm it is possible to obtain results from the calibration such that the accuracy of an industrial robot such as the ABB IRB6000 during off-line programming is improved from 10 to 20 mm to better than 1mm. Note that Robotrak may also be used for measuring the position of the robot while it is moving along a path, for the purpose of checking the accuracy of paths generated on the robot controller. These paths may then be automatically displayed in 3D using Workspace and compared with that generated during a simulation; thus giving a dynamic assessment capability. The Calibration Filter It is important to understand when and how the calibration filters are used. Otherwise confusion will arise as to the correctness of any display. Teachpoints that are displayed on the screen are always unfiltered. The only situations where teachpoints pass through the filter are shown below. The output filter is used when preparing points generated in the simulation for the robot in the following situations:- During a Send to robot command when the track contains geometry points which are being automatically converted to teachpoints; Writing a position in a Jetware VR file at any time; Converting a geometry point to a teachpoint using the Layout menu. The input filter (which works in the opposite way to the output filter) is used as follows:- During a Calibrate model menu command when three Datum teachpoints are imported from the robot into the simulation. During a Recalibrate tool menu command when four teachpoints are imported from the robot into the simulation. Reading a position from a Jetware VR file at any time. Converting a teachpoint to a geometry point using the Layout menu. Installing the Robotrak interface card Before using Robotrak, the encoder interface card will need to be installed in the PC. First of all, the PC must be disconnected from the mains and its cover removed. From above, the computer should look something like this. PC motherboard The encoder interface board is a half-length 8-bit card. To install it, an available 8-bit or 16-bit slot must be found in the PC. Installing the card The blanking plate for the slot should be removed from the case of the PC, keeping the securing screw in a safe place. The interface card should be aligned with the slot and pressed down until it is fully home. The securing screw should be replaced so that the interface card is fixed into the PC. Once the card is installed, the PC must be moved to a suitable position outside of the robot's envelope ready to connect up the encoder units. WARNING! It is important that the tension in the cords from the encoder units is maintained at all times. This is so that the cord will always wrap tightly around the drum. If the tension is not maintained the repeatability of Robotrak will be degraded. Therefore the cords should be moved slowly (at the speed of 'walking on the moon') when moving them towards the encoder unit.Always return the cords to the encoder units slowly. Installing the encoder units Now you can install the encoder units in the workcell, near the robot. Place the encoder units at the corners of an approximate equilateral triangle whose sides are roughly 2m in length. Bear in mind that when taking robot measurements using Robotrak the measured points should not be too close to the plane containing the encoder units, and that very large variations in the extension of one cord compared to the other cords should be avoided. This should help you decide the optimum positions for the encoder units relative to the working volume of the robot. Note that the encoders do not need to be mounted on the floor. The only configuration you must not use is to have the three encoder units in a line. Also, there must be a clear line of sight from one encoder unit to the next so that it is possible to use the cords to measure the distance between the units. The precise position of the encoders relative to the robot does not need to be known since this is calculated as part of the calibration process. This flexibility of positioning Robotrak within the workcell is one of the great advantages of this system. When you have secured the encoder units, use the electrical cables supplied with them to connect the encoders to the interface card on the PC. Each plug is marked with the encoder units number, this should be inserted into the correspondingly marked port on the interface card. N.B. Care should be taken not to accidentally connect the 15 way 'density and a half' D-type plug from a VGA monitor into one of the input channels of the interface card as damage may result. WARNING! Whenever pulling a cord away from its base always grasp it firmly so that it does not slip, since the tension in the torsional spring will cause the cord to shoot back towards its base at high speed. This can damage the Robotrak components. For a similar reason, the cords should be checked every now and then for signs of breaking. The Workspace Robotrak Setup menu This menu is used to setup Robotrak. Issue each command in turn from the top to the bottom of the menu. 1. Run Workspace and go to the Options/Calibrate Robot sub-menu. Pull down the Robotrak setup sub-menu. 2. Use the Exact length of bar command to enter the number in mm written on the side of the calibration bar. 3. The aluminium attachment fittings should be at rest on top of each of the three encoder measuring units. This is the zero position for the cord. Use the Set all zero positions command. Answer yes to the question 'Are all the cords in their bases?'. 4. The repeatability of Robotrak depends to some extent on the repeatability of its zero position, which can be improved by allowing the zero position to 'settle'. Use the Check repeatabilities command. The readings from the three encoders are displayed on the screen. Initially the numbers will be red. Pull a cord away from its base (at least two metres) and then return the cord to the base and leave in the base for at least half a second. An audible click will be heard from the computer. If you do not hear a click then pull the cord out further. Do not pull the cord out too far - always leave a few winds of the cord on the drum (remove the cover of the encoder unit to see the drum if you are not sure). Repeat this until the displayed reading for the encoder turns from black to red. This will only happen after three consecutive zero readings for the cord have been with three encoder counts of each other. Do this for all three cords (if there is more than one person available then the repeatability of all three cords can be checked at the same time by each parson working on one cord). Once all three encoder readings have changed from red to black then press escape to exit. The encoders will be zeroed again. 5. Now use the Set encoder length bar length for each base (timed). This command allows a single user to set each encoder bar length in turn in a single operation without assistance. When the command is called the user has 15 seconds to carefully place the wedge shaped end of the calibration bar flat against the cord exit point on the first encoder unit. The cord should then be drawn out and the base of the aluminium attachment fitting allowed to rest in the slot at the other end of the calibration bar. After 15 seconds a reading is taken and Workspace now calculates the scaling factor of encoder counts to length of extension in mm for that encoder unit. The user then has 15 seconds to repeat this operation for the second unit and a further 15 seconds for the third unit. 6. Use the Set distance for each base command. The use has the choice of finding the distances between all three bases one at a time or all together. It is recommended that the user finds the distances one at a time. Find the two specified encoder units (they must always be numbered anticlockwise looking in "Plan" from the robot down onto the Robotrak units). Take the calibration fixture (machined brass fork and steel locating plate) which has the same number as the second encoder unit. Insert the pin of the brass fitting into the plate if not already assembled. Insert the two locating pins from the steel plate into the top of the encoder unit near where the cord leaves the unit. Extend the cord from the first unit to the second encoder unit with the calibration fixture, and place in the calibration fixture. Press escape next base. Workspace now calculates the distance between the two units. Repeat for all three encoder units. 7. Use the Continous cord reading command to inspect the readings from each encoder unit and check that they are now working correctly. Connecting Robotrak to the robot Attach the robot tool flange attachment assembly to the robot tool flange (faceplate of the robot tool attachment point). This is usually done by means of four cap screws screwed into the robot tool flange. If the holes on your robot are not to the ISO Series 1 preferred sizes (e.g. Fanuc robots) then suitable holes will need to be drilled in the robot tool flange attachment assembly to align with these holes. The aluminium attachment fittings at the end of each cord coming from the encoder units should be screwed onto the corresponding attachments on the cords coming from the robot tool flange attachment assembly. Use a pair of calipers to measure the length from where the cord from the encoder unit enters the assembled aluminium attachment fittings to where cord from the robot enters the triple fitting on the robot tool flange attachment assembly. Enter the measured length of the top part of the cord in millimetres, after issuing the command Length of top part of cord 1. Repeat for cords 2 and 3. WARNING! When the Robotrak cords are connected to the robot the user should watch any robot movement to avoid the cords becoming entangled in the robot tool. The robot should always be moved slowly for this reason as well as to maintain the tension in the cords. Always move the robot slowly. Use the Continuous measurement reading command to display the xyz position of where the cords meet on the robot. Move the robot to check that this value changes as would be expected. The origin of the measurement system is at encoder unit 1, the x-axis is from unit 1 to unit 2. and the y-axis is at right angles to the x-axis in the plane of the 3 units, on the unit 3 side of the x-axis. The z-axis is perpendicular to the x,y plane and passes through the origin. The Robotrak Co-ordinate Frame Recording a set of calibration measurements Make a note of the tool frame, as well as the robot base frame as reported on the controller. The tool offset can be nil during calibration, or any value ( as long as that value is noted down). It is probably easiest if both the tool and the base frame are nil. The true physical tool offset values are parameters that will revealed as part of the calibration process. Teach 50 different positions and orientations throughout the robot's working envelope using the robot teach pendant. These positions and orientations should vary as widely as possible throughout the robot envelope. Remember always to move the robot slowly when the Robotrak cords are connected (see above warning). If creating a program to cycle through the positions a pause of at least one second should be inserted between subsequent moves (this is particularly important when using with the Auto-record feature of Workspace). Workspace can calibrate a robot with 25 positions, however more points give greater accuracy in the calibration. When teaching the points it is recommended that the plane of the end connector where the cords meet is kept at the same angle to the cords in all the recorded positions. Or to put it another way the average vector of the cords should be the same as the approach vector of the tool. So if all the cords are forming a roughly 30 degree angle to the vertical (a fairly extreme position) then the tool should be rotated so that the end of the connector is at 90 degrees to all the cords, or (imagining a two cord Robotrak) if one cord is roughly horizontal and the other is roughly vertical that the tool should be rotated so that the end of the connector is 45 degrees to both. Use the Check teachpoints suitable command to check the suitability of the teachpoints. There are two methods available within Workspace to take the readings from Robotrak. The Record Robotrak measurements command on the Robotrak special options menu requires input from the user when Workspace is required to take a measurement. The Auto-record Robotrak measurements command automatically senses when a reading should be taken, and is the recommended method. Write a robot programme to move to each teachpoint in turn, pausing at the point for at least a second. Start the robot program. Workspace will then take readings whenever the readings from Robotrak settle for 0.5 of a second. Pressing escape or a mouse button will terminate the process. The measurements are stored in a file with the extension EXT. Running the robot calibration software Load the model containing the robot that is to be calibrated into Workspace. Set the robot model tool frame and base frame to the same values as were noted from the robot controller. Use the Simulate/Simulate options/Teachpoint file option to select the teachpoint file that was used to record the measurement file. Use the Options/Calibrate using Robotrak/Extract errors from measurements command. This will compare the teachpoint file and the measurement file and find the errors in the robot structure and the relative position of Robotrak and the robot that would have created the values in the files. This should take about 30 seconds, depending on the speed of the PC. Interpreting the Calibration search data Several pages of data are generated during execution of the Extract errors from measurements command. PAGE 1 The search to find errors in the robot model has two stages: searching for the approximate position and orientation of the measuring system and the approximate physical tool offset, then searching for all kinematic and compliance errors (this final stage also finds the exact position and orientation of the measuring system and the exact physical tool offset). The first stage is necessary to find good initial values for some of the variables that we are seeking in the final stage. Good initial values ensure that the search finds the correct local minimum. During each stage the following lines are displayed: Stage: (the current stage of the search) Iteration: (the number of iterations in this stage of the search so far) Error: (the average positional error between the end of the robot calculated using the robot model and the measurements taken by Robotrak). At the end of the two stages the error displayed on the screen gives a measure of the accuracy of the calibration in millimetres. PAGE 2 The kinematic errors detected during the search are now formally displayed. First the modified DH parameters are displayed along with the tool offset and the position and orientation of the co-ordinate frame at joint 1 relative to the measuring system co-ordinate frame, then the errors between the modified values and the uncalibrated robot model are displayed. Finally the statement 'The error between the positions measured and the reported positions may be reduced as follows by changing the kinematics of the model' is followed by the average and maximum errors without the modifications, and the average and maximum errors with the modifications. It is these values that are of greatest importance in deciding if the calibration has been successful. Many applications require the error in the position of the tool to be within a certain value relative to the position demanded by the off-line programming system. It should be remembered when interpreting these values that they refer to the absolute accuracy. Many applications require only relative accuracy, for example machining a piece of metal. Many other applications can be made to rely on relative accuracy by careful design of the workcell. Because the remaining errors are often systematic in nature the relative accuracy can often be considerably better than the absolute accuracy. For a similar reason, the accuracy can be improved by restricting the movement of the robot to a small volume within the overall envelope. The user has the option of saving the results as a bitmap. PAGES 3 and 4 Histograms showing the spread of the positional errors before and after calibration are displayed. This gives useful information that cannot be obtained by looking at the average and maximum values alone. The user may decide on the basis of the results obtained either to use the results to modify the existing robot model or to discard the results. If the user decides to modify the existing model then the user may also decide whether or not to use a filter to modify any teachpoints that are generated using the calibrated robot model so that they may be used on the uncalibrated robot (note that calibration calibrates the robot model not the robot itself). When a calibrated model is being used then 'Calibrated' will also be displayed above the robots name. At the end of the calibration Workspace will display a model of the Robotrak cords going from each measuring unit to the endpoint of the robot. This may be turned off by using the Options/Calibrate using Robotrak/Robotrak special options/Turn Robotrak off command. How the calibrated robot model is used The calibration results are used to improve the simulated robot model so that it matches more exactly the way that the real robot moves. Any joint-co-ordinate teachpoints which are subsequently generated off-line on the simulation may then be downloaded to the robot controller and the robot will move to the position that is required. However, it is important to understand that the robot controller has no knowledge of the errors in its understanding of the real robots kinematics. Therefore, before Cartesian co-ordinate teachpoints are downloaded to the robot controller the simulation must somehow fool the robot into moving to the true position that we require by asking it to move to another slightly different position. For example: Suppose that we wish the end of the robot tool to move to the xyz position 1000,1000,1000. If we ask the robot to move to this position it might move to 1002,1001,1001. Instead, we ask the robot to move to 998,999,999. The robot then moves to what it thinks is 998,999,999 but which is in reality 1000,1000,1000. To fool the robot into going to the correct Cartesian teachpoint positions we pass every geometry point through a filter before writing it to a teachpoint file. Similarly, when a teachpoint is loaded from a teachpoint file and converted to a geometry point it passes through the reverse filter (see above). Recalibrating tool values Options on the Options/Recalibrate tool sub menu can be used to correct tool information after damage has occured. The commands are intended for use by users who damage the tool, perhaps bending it slightly due to a collision, and need to know the new tool offset and orientation without using robotrak. It can also be used to calibrate the tool precisely if it was not possible to place the three cords accurately at the end of the tool during the calibration procedure. The commands can be more accurate than the same methods used on robot controllers because they make full use of the calibrated robot model, if such a model is available. Note that it is not necessary to use these commands if the correct tool offset and orientation have already been identified using Robotrak and no collision or tool alteration has occured. To recalibrate the tool offset the following must be done. Move the real robot to a point which is fixed in the workcell and save the point as a teachpoint in a new teachpoint file. Change the orientation of the robot and move the robot to the same point, again save the teachpoint. Repeat this several times for diferent orientations around the same point sacving each in the teach point file (at least 4 are required and it is recommended that the teachpoint orientations are varied considerably - see the Recalibrate tool menu for more information).Then issue the Recalibrate tool/Recalibrate tool offset command. Workspace will use the robot model to calculate the tool offset. The tool offset must be recalibrated before the x and z axis are recalibrated. To recalibrate the x-axis, move the robot in the direction of the tool x-axis away from the point used in the recalibrate tool offset command to another point and save that point as a teachpoint. Then issue the Recalibrate tool/Recalibrate x-axis command. To recalibrate the z-axis, move the robot in the direction of the tool y-axis away from the point used in the recalibrate tool offset command to another point and save that point as a teachpoint. Then issue the Recalibrate tool/Recalibrate z-axis command. Note that the recalibrate tool menu commands will give more accurate tool values if the robot is first calibrated. Calibrating the tool orientation Once a robot has been calibrated then Robotrak may be used to find the tool orientation. At the end of a successful calibration remove the standard Robotrak tool attachment and replace it with an identical assembly designed by the user in which the point at which the three cords meet has been moved a short distance along a direction parallel to the desired tool z axis. Then use the Options/Calibrate robot/Robotrak special options/Calibrate tool z-axis command. Workspace calculates from this an appropriate tool orientation. A similar procedure may be used with the calibrate tool x-axis command. Calibrating the workcell fixtures Once the robot has been calibrated and its off-line programming accuracy improved to a suitable level then the robot may itself be used as a measuring device to find the true position of the fixtures in the workcell relative to the robot (note that the xyz offset of the end of the robot tool or pointer must be found beforehand - possibly by using the Recalibrate tool offset command). This is an important issue since without knowing these positions accurately the off-line generated robot programmes would be unusable. Another method of measuring the position of fixtures is by disconnecting Robotrak from the robot and moving Robotrak to several points on the fixture (any measurements taken after calibration are adjusted by Workspace so that they are expressed relative to the robot base). This however, requires the use of an additional stylus unit fitted to Robotrak in place of the robot tool flange attachment assembly. A third method is to use theodolites to measure the position of the robot base and all important points on the fixture. However, this method involves a great deal of time and expense. Once the position of the fixtures relative to the robot is known then the position of the models of the fixtures in the simulation package can be adjusted, enabling the simulation to generate accurate robot paths relative to the fixtures and the parts held in the fixtures. Two commands are available within Workspace that aid workcell set-up. The command Options/Calibrate model/Reposition object using 3 points command can be used to accurately place an object relative to the robot. The method for using this command is as follows. 3 geometry points should be created on the object at known location on the object, the geometry points must be named DATUM1, DATUM2 and DATUM3. Using the robot, teachpoints should be created relative to the object in the workcell at the same positions on the object as the teachpoints, again these need to be named DATUM1, DATUM2 and DATUM3. Workspace can then match the geometry points to the teachpoints thus positioning the object correctly relative to the robot. The command Options/Calibrate model/Reposition robot using 3 points command, has a similar effect as the Reposition object using 3 points command. Except in this case the object remains fixed and the robot is repositioned. Recording robot trajectories using Robotrak Robotrak may also be used for measuring the position of the robot while it is moving along a path to check the accuracy of paths generated by the robot controller. These paths may then be automatically displayed in 3D using Workspace and compared with that generated during a simulation. Use the Options/Calibrate robot/Robotrak special options/Record trajectory command to start recording a trajectory using Robotrak. At the end of the recording the trajectory is displayed on the screen. The relative position of this trajectory will only be correct if Workspace already knows the position of Robotrak (the robot calibration process derives this from the calibration measurements and teachpoints). Use the Simulate/Replay track and log trajectory command to log a trajectory of a robot moving along a path specified by the track file. At the end of this command the trajectory is displayed and may be compared with that recorded using Robotrak from the real robot. Troubleshooting Problems with the repeatability of the encoder zero positions: If the Continuous cord reading reports larger than expected differences (more than 20) in the values reported when the cord is at the zero position (where the value ideally should be zero) then this suggests that the cord is not wrapping tightly around the drum. There may also be a problem if the cord starts to overlap the cord already wrapped around the drum - remove the unit side cover and this will be immediately apparent. The cord should be extended and then returned to the drum very slowly so that the tension is maintained enabling the cord to wrap neatly and tightly around the drum. The very first couple of times the cord wraps around the drum care should be taken to avoid overlapping - if necessary guide the cord using a finger. In normal operation of Robotrak this is not necessary because the cord never becomes completely unwound from the drum. If the Continuous cord reading reports large differences (more than 1000) in the values reported when the cord is at the zero position (where the value ideally should be zero) then this suggests that the interface card may be faulty and further advice should be sought from the supplier. Problems with obtaining calibration results: If the Extract errors from measurements command returns robot calibration results which report an average error after calibration, of over 3mm, or if the search does not finish and no results are reported, there may be several possible causes. Problems with obtaining average errors less than 3mm may be caused by bad repeatability of the encoder zero positions (see above). It may be that the robot model is not performing the inverse kinematics correctly. Check that the Cartesian positions and corresponding joint co-ordinates reported on the robot controller are the same as the Cartesian position and joint co-ordinates reported by the simulated robot model. If there are any discrepancies then fax these to Robot Simulations who will correct your robot model. If the point where Robotrak is attached to the robot or the encoder measuring units are moved slightly during the calibration then it will invalidate the measurement data. Make certain that everything is securely fixed and cannot move during robot motion. The robot world frame and the tool frame on the robot controller and on Workspace may be different. If the teachpoint file used with the robot stores the teachpoints as Cartesian (xyz and orientation) values rather than joint angles then these teachpoints will only be interpreted by Workspace correctly if Workspace uses the same robot world frame and tool frame as was used on the robot controller when the points were recorded. Note that the true physical tool offset will be calculated by Workspace as part of the calibration so it is not important that the tool frame on the robot controller matches the physical length of the tool. It is possible that the non-geometric errors in the real robot are more significant than expected. This is unlikely with most standard industrial revolute robots.

Robot calibration is a means whereby a robot can be made to move more accurately to a given xyz position and orientation by creating an improved mathematical model of the robot kinematics. What is the difference between accuracy and repeatability? It is important that we understand the difference between accuracy and repeatability. Repeatability is a measure of the ability to move back to the same position over and over again, whereas accuracy is the ability to move to a given position. As an analogy, consider somebody throwing darts at a board. If all the darts go into roughly the same place then the repeatability is good, though it may not be the position that the thrower was aiming at, in which case the accuracy would be bad. If all the darts hit the position the thrower was aiming at then the accuracy and the repeatability are good. Which physical errors cause robots to be inaccurate? The difference between the physical joint zero position of the robot and the zero position reported by the robot controller usually has the biggest effect on the robot's accuracy. Common sense suggests that errors in the zero position of joints 1, 2, and 3 will have a bigger effect on the robot positional error than joints 4, 5, and 6. We can ignore the effect of joint 1 since it is compensated for using the model calibration (see later). Additionally, experience suggests that joint 2 and 3 often have the largest zero position error because at some point in the robot's life it will have been crashed into the floor - throwing out the zero position by up to a degree. The error in the robot zero position is often responsible for 90% of the robot positional error. The length of the robot links usually has the second biggest effect on the robot's accuracy. When the links are manufactured there is inevitably some variation in their dimensions from one robot to the next, as well as a variation in the orientation of the joints. Within each robot controller is a mathematical model of the robot which assumes that the links on one robot are the same length as the links on another robot of the same type, and that the relative orientations of the joints on one robot are the same as on another robot of the same type. This is not true, and this causes the robot to estimate incorrectly where its endpoint is given a set of joint angles. It is unlikely on most industrial robots that the variation in link lengths would be more than a couple of millimetres. The next most significant factor in the robot positional error is joint compliance. This may be though of as factor representing the torsional spring effect at each joint which responds to the effect of gravity each link. How are these physical errors represented? The robot kinematic structure is often represented by mathematicians using DH parameters. These are simply a compact representation of the position and orientation of each joint relative to the previous joint. There are four numbers for each joint: d, a, theta, and alpha. D and a represent distances and theta and alpha represent angles. Joint zero errors for a rotational joint are stored as theta values. Link length and distance offset errors are stored as d and a values. Relative joint orientation errors are stored as alpha values. An additional parameter beta is introduced for two joints which are parallel to represent any slight misalignment. Why do we calibrate robots for offline programming but not for teach-pendant programming? Most robots are designed to be very repeatable (typically within 0.1mm) but have a low accuracy (typically between 5 and 15mm). The robot-programmer using a teach-pendant is not usually concerned with the accuracy of the robot, only its repeatability.Consider a spot-welding workcell. The user uses the teach-pendant and his eye to guide the robot to a chalk mark on the metal parts where the spot-weld is to be placed. The user doesn't care whether this xyz position is (1500,800,700) or (1505,795,695). He/she will only be concerned that when he looks at the robot tool that it looks as though it is close to the chalk mark. However, if the same robot programme is written offline using a geometric model of the part to define the spot-welds then the accuracy of the robot will become very important, since it is only the numbers from the offline programme which define the robot movement and there is no visual correction by the robot-programmer. By calibrating the robot before downloading a robot programme written offline it might therefore be possible to avoid the need to touch up the teachpoints visually using the teach pendant. Is there an alternative to calibrating the robot? Yes. Instead of calibrating the robot to improve the accuracy of the offline programmed points the robot-programmer can use the teach-pendant to touch up the points. Since the robot positional error for an uncalibrated robot is at worst of the order of 15mm then all that is required to correct the programme is jogging each teachpoint using the teach-pendant a very small distance until the point looks to be correct. How long does robot calibration take? The first stage of robot calibration is to take the necessary measurements of the robot position for a number of teachpoints. If the teachpoints have been previously defined then the whole process of placing a Robotrak measurement device in a workcell, performing the set-up procedure for Robotrak, and recording measurements for 50 teachpoints takes about 30 minutes. The teachpoint file and the measurements can then be used within Workspace running on a PC to procedure a calibrated model within a few seconds. When is robot calibration cost-effective? Robot calibration is cost-effective when touching up offline programmed teachpoints is undesirable for some reason. It may be that the act of touching up points manually introduces an undesirable element of subjective judgment into an otherwise objective Computer Integrated Manufacturing environment. The overall accuracy of the position in a robotic workcell which uses a robot programme generated offline would in this situation be dependent on the accuracy of the robot programmer, which would inevitably vary with fatigue and ability. This is the justification used by many car companies to justify calibration of all the robots on an offline programmed re-spot line. When is robot calibration not necessary? Robot calibration is not required for teach-pendant programming of a robot (unless the poor accuracy of the robot has a significant effect on the quality of linear and circular trajectories). Robot calibration might not be necessary where the working volume of the robot is very small. The robot can be said to have a good relative accuracy over this small volume.Robot calibration might also be unnecessary if the robot is very accurate before calibration. A good test of the accuracy of the robot is the quality of the tool calibration performed using a fixed pointer and several teachpoints with different orientations. This figure is reported by the Workspace Recalibrate tool command. What methods for calibrating robots exist? Any 3d measurement system can be used to obtain measurements which are subsequently used to create a calibrated robot model. Workspace uses its own Robotrak three-cord measurement device (accurate to within 0.2mm), but other devices can also be used with Workspace such as the Leica Smart automatic theodolite (which has an accuracy measured in microns). There is even a method for calibrating robots that does not use a measurement device but instead moves the robot to a fixed pointer using different orientations (similar to the standard method for calibrating tools) though its accuracy is not as good as that measurement based calibrations. How does robot calibration work? Most methods of robot calibration work by comparing teachpoint positions for a robot to measurements of the end of the tool relative to an independent 3d measuring device. A search method is used to find which changes in the mathematical model of the robot would allow the distance between where the robot thinks it is and where the robot actually is to be minimised. The search method is contained within the Workspace software and the Workspace robot model is updated with the changes. Where is the calibration data stored? The calibration data obtained using Workspace is stored in the model of the robot and the workcell. To use this robot in a different workcell without recalibrating it is only necessary to use the calibrated robot model. Note that the robot controller and the robot itself have no knowledge of the fact that Workspace has calibrated the robot. What is the difference between remastering and robot calibration? Remastering is where the position of each joint at which it reports itself as being zero is changed so that it coincides with the physical zero position of the joint. Some robots (for example the Fanus S10) use a special fixture to define the robot physical zero position. Other robots use a mark on each link to define the robot physical zero position. To remaster the robot the user jogs the robot using the teach-pendant to the physical zero position for each joint and then issues a command to the robot controller to use this position as the new zero position. This improves the accuracy of the robot in a similar way to robot calibration, though robot calibration goes further in that it not only corrects errors in the zero position but also in the link lengths and offsets. Therefore robot calibration should provide slightly better accuracy than remastering. Is remastering the robot an alternative to robot calibration? Yes, if the user is able to remaster the robot accurately and if the small additional accuracy provided by robot calibration is not required. Remastering a robot will frequently improve the accuracy of offline programming in the same way that robot calibration will. However, remastering will make any existing robot programmes on the robot controller no longer accurate, unlike robot calibration which does not change the parameters of the robot controller. In some situations the user may wish to use robot calibration to suggest changes to the robot zero position to be used in remastering. Why don't robot manufacturers calibrate their robots? Most industrial robot manufactures remaster their robots before they leave the factory. This effectively removes errors in the joint zero positions. However, it is very rare that a robot manufacturer calibrates to compensate for the true link lengths of each individual robot. Traditional method of programming are teach-pendant based and do not require robots to be calibrated. As more and more users start to use offline methods which require calibrated robots then it is likely that the maufacturers will place a greater emphasis on calibrating the robot before it is shipped to the customer. Once the robot is installed in a production environment it is likely that it will suffer collisions which will cause the joints to loose their accuracy, so that robot calibration will again be required. What is the difference between a three-point touch and robot calibration? Three-point touch is a term used to describe model calibration. The robot is used as a measuring device to determine where the fixture is relative to the robot by touching three datum points on the fixture. These points are then brought back into the simulation model of the workcell and used to update the position of the model of the fixture in the simulation. Though the three-point touch does correct for any errors in the zero position of joint 1 it does not correct for any other factors influencing the robot's accuracy. Therefore it may be that for some workcells all that is required is a three-point touch whereas for other workcells a robot calibration and a three-point touch is required. What is tool calibration? Tool calibration is the process whereby the true xyz offset from the mounting faceplate of the robot to the end of the tool may be found. It is important that the correct offset is used in the offline simulation so that robot programme it generates is accurate on the real robot. Some applications require that the orientation of the tool should also be found. How can tools be calibrated? Some robot controllers allow a user to calibrate a tool by moving its tip to the end of a fixed pointer in several different orientations. Workspace uses the same method for its Recalibrate tool command, though it can obtain more accurate tool offsets than the robot controller because it can use a calibrated robot model (if a robot calibration has been performed previously). In some situations the Robotrak measuring device may be fitted to the tip of the tool. This allows Workspace to calibrate the robot and the tool in one step. Does tool and model calibration require use of a measuring system? Neither tool nor model calibration require use of a measuring system. How does calibration and offline programming all fit together To understand how these techniques all fit together here is a description of several differing offline programming sequences. A) Calibration of the robot and the tool in one step. The measuring device is attached to the end of the tool. This will only be possible if the end of the tool is easily accessible. 1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell. 2. The robot and tool are calibrated in one step (by moving the robot to 50 teachpoints and taking a measurement at each step). 3. The model is calibrated (by moving the robot so that the tip of its tool touches each of three datum points in turn) and the fixture repositioned within the simulation. 4. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme. B) Calibration of the robot and tool in separate steps. In this situation the measuring device is attached to a point on the tool which is accessible but which is not the end of the tool. 1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell. 2. The robot is calibrated. 3. The tool is calibrated. 4. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation. 5. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme. C) Use of a special pointer tool for model calibration In this situation the tool is unwieldy and so we replace it during robot and model calibration with a special pointer tool. 1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell. 2. The special pointer tool is attached to the robot. The robot and the special pointer tool are calibrated in one step. 3. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation. 4. Special pointer tool is removed from the robot and replaced with the real tool. 5. The tool is calibrated. 6. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme. D) No robot calibration Here we assume that the robot is relatively accurate over the its working volume in the workcell. 1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell. 2. The tool is calibrated. 3. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation. 4. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme. E) Remastering of the robot Suppose that offline programming has been attempted without robot calibration and that the robot was found to be inaccurate. The robot is then remastered. 1. The robot is remastered using the manufacturer's remastering procedure. 2. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell. 3. The tool is calibrated. 4. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation. 5. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme.

In North America the 'big three' car makers are Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. Based in Detroit and elsewhere in the continent these companies have spent the past five years investing heavily in robot simulation and offline programming. The urgency exerted by an unexpected demand for the most popular models as well as a large upturn in consumer spending on cars has created a pressure-cooker atmosphere in Detroit. Here production lines are designed and built and running in weeks or months and every offline programming technique is examined closely for potential improvements in set-up time or production rate. One of the major issues here is the move towards more and more accurate spot and arc welding techniques. The 2mm car (where every robot weld is within 2mm of the intended position on every car that rolls of the production line) is talked of as a kind of Holy Grail of car production - and some people even talk in hushed tones of eventually pushing the barrier even further to achieve the 1mm car. This has focused attention on those techniques, especially robot calibration and fixture calibration, that will lead to a higher accuracy of offline programming. Current practice involves several stages from simulation to offline programming. First the car is modelled in the company-wide CAD system, often a sophisticated mainframe based CAD package like CATIA which can handle models of the complete car and all the parts that make up the car. Then the fixtures are designed which are to present the parts to the welding robots in a repeatable and predictable manner. It is usually a requirement that the fixtures, which are created by specialist tooling companies under contract, are 'certified'. This means that points on the fixture which are to clamp the part, or the blocks against which the part are clamped, must be measured very precisely using a 3-d co-ordinate measuring device. These measurements are referred to a co-ordinate frame on the centreline of the car using three datum points on the fixture. These three datum points give the position (x, y, z,), orientation (a, b, c), and scaling factor associated with the fixture. The measurements are usually recorded using two manual theodolites and standard theodolite triangulation. Another alternative technique that promises even higher accuracies than those achieved using theodolites is named photogrammetry. Photogrammetry uses several very high resolution electronic 'photographs' of a target attached to the fixture taken from different angles together with standard image-processing techniques to derive the 3-d position of the target. It has a technique that has long been used in terrain mapping using aerial photography and advanced stereo vision but is only now finding an application down on the shop floor. The first fixture is then installed on the production line, and from this the position of the first robot is defined, again using theodolites. The position of the first fixture then defines the position of the second fixture, and so on, all the way down the production line. The simulation of the robot programmes has usually been completed by this stage using models imported from the CAD system and off-the-shelf robot models purchased from the simulation vendor. More and more of the simulation functionality is available on the CAD system: for example co-ordinate frames representing the position and orientation of spot-welds and approach points and 'weld-schedules' indicating the motion type and speed between points can be defined in CATIA before exporting the model to the simulation. The simulation is used to check that the robots can reach all the required positions. The wrist joint limits of the robot often limit the orientations that are achievable and the simulation user must work creatively to position the robot base and the robot tool. A particular position and orientation may not be achievable in a given robot configuration, for example with the wrist pointing down or with the elbow pointing up. The configuration of the robot model can be changed by driving the robot using joint motion into a different configuration before attempting the movement. The simulation enables the user to plan collision free paths around the clamps holding the part using via points which must be created in such a way that they do not add excessively to the overall cycle time. This is the reason that is so important to derive reasonably accurate cycle times from the simulation. Unfortunately, the robot companies consider the motion algorithms used by their robot controllers to be of such commercial value that they will always refuse to release these to the simulation vendors. A compromise position has been reached between the simulation vendors and the robot vendors (thanks to the strong encouragement of the car companies in America and in Germany) where 'black boxes' (unreadable parts of the robot controller software) are interfaced to the robot simulation to give accurate cycle times. Once the cycle times are accurate the user may also have reasonable confidence that the trajectories between points shown by the simulation are accurate, and therefore that the collision and near-miss information provided by the simulation is reliable - a key issue if simulation is to be trusted by those on the shop-floor. Downloading the robot programmes (sometimes called 'tracks') from the simulation to the robot controller involves taking a disc containing the programme, teachpoint, and tool frame files from the air-conditioned offices where the CAD and simulation specialist work down onto the much harsher and unforgiving environment of the factory. It is here that most advocates of simulation and offline have a rude awakening. Programmes that work fine in the 'virtual reality' environment of the robot simulation seldom work in the uncertain and unpredictable and subtly different real world. Robots are designed to be extremely repeatable but not all that accurate (repeatabilities of 0.1mm and accuracies of 10mm or worse are not unusual). To understand the difference between repeatability and accuracy imagine a darts game. The first player is playing with new darts and so aims for a triple 20 but instead puts all the darts in the number 6, with all three darts close together. The darts are repeatable but not very accurate. The second darts player, playing with his own tried and tested set of darts, throws three treble 20s. His darts are not only repeatable, but they are also accurate. To increase the accuracy of the robot towards the same order as its repeatability it must be calibrated. Each robot has its own individual signature created by the manufacturing tolerances involved in making robots and by the wear and tear of crashing the robot into fixtures (an all to regular occurrence) and worse. This signature can be detected by measuring the 3d co-ordinates of the robot over a range of positions and orientations throughout its envelope and then using calibration software to produce a more accurate custom model of the robot. The measuring devices used on the shop floor for robot calibration must be cheap and relatively easy and quick to use, since up to 50 measurements may be required for each robot. Robotrak consist of three drums which may be placed anywhere in the workcell from which three cords are extended to meet at the endpoint of the robot. The length of the cord is indicated by the rotation of the drum, and from the three lengths the x, y, z position of the endpoint of the robot may be calculated and recorded to within a repeatability of 0.3mm. If a higher accuracy is required then a laser-tracker named Smart may be used. Smart is the next generation of theodolite: it tracks targets automatically without any manual intervention. The key to Smart is a laser interferometer that measures distance very precisely so that together with the two angles representing the direction that Smart is pointing itself it is possible to calculate the x, y, z position of a point instead of having to use 2 conventional theodolites and triangulation. Smart is accurate to about 0.025mm though this degrades to 0.050mm under shop floor conditions of temperature change, vibration, and large vehicles trundling past. Robot Simulations Ltd, who offer Robotrak and Smart for use with their Workspace robot simulation, calibration, and offline programming software suggest that customers requiring accuracies circa. 1mm should use Robotrak, while customers requiring accuracies much lower than 1mm should use Smart. Once the robot has been calibrated it can be used with a pointer of known length as an accurate measuring device to record the position of the fixture datum points. This '3-point touch-up' is often mistaken for robot calibration, but is really only used for positioning the model of the fixture correctly relative to the robot model within the simulation and thereby avoiding one of the pitfalls of offline programming. Finally, the correct tool offset must be defined on the robot controller and on the robot simulation. If the dimensions of the tool are well known then this is a straightforward process, but if the tool dimensions are unknown or if the tool is slightly bent because of a collision that has occurred on the shop floor then a tool calibration must be carried out. The robot programme created by the simulation is really only ready for downloading to the robot once all the above procedures are complete. If one of these steps is ignored or badly implemented then the resulting programme can be anything from 2 inches to a foot out, depending on the seriousness of the mistakes involved. This is where most of the horror stories involving robot simulation and offline programming originate: 'we took a programme from .... and downloaded it to the robot and the robot drove straight into the fixture' or 'we created 120 offline programmes for the whole production line and not one worked first time - they all needed to be touched up by hand'. The final source of error in offline programming is a simple logistic one: by the time the simulation is finished and ready for offline programming the real workcell may been redesigned, turntables have been introduced or removed, additional robots have been inserted. Only now its too late to go back and simulate because the simulation office is working on simulations for the next production line. The simplest way to avoid this situation is to make certain of the following: 1. One person is responsible for the simulation from start to finish (the finish being when the production line is up and running smoothly and there are no more changes); 2. The simulation goes down onto the shop floor with the offline programme where last minute changes can be immediately introduced into the simulation. Microcomputer based robot simulation packages which can run on notebooks mean that nobody has an excuse for leaving the simulation up in the design office instead of taking it down onto the shop floor where it is really needed. So with all these potential pitfalls and inaccuracies in robot simulation and offline programming, is it really worth attempting? If you want the answer, come to Detroit. The car companies will not spend money on any technology that doesn't produce savings that can be measured in Dollars and Cents, and they see robot simulation and offline programming as the revolutionary technology that will enable them to build more cars, quicker and at a lower cost than ever before. What the Big Three are using today, the rest of us in manufacturing will be implementing tomorrow.

This product group is the result of research carried out by John Owens for his Ph.D. in Robotics, Simulation, Advanced Languages and Control. The first version to be introduced was WORKSPACE 1.0, which was the first 3D robot simulation to run on a PC, in the world. As with all new products feedback from customers was essential in identifying possible areas of improvement, leading to, in 1991, the release of WORKSPACE 2.0. This received much greater recognition within the robotics establishment and was gradually accepted within higher education and industry as a valuable teaching, training and learning tool. Robot Simulations Limited (RSL) was incorporated in December 1992, when Roger Verrall came in as Managing Director, allowing John Owens to concentrate on finalising WORKSPACE 3.0. This is a product for industry as well as education. The features that were incorporated brought PC based software ever closer to workstation systems as a very much more cost effective alternative. Full factory lay-outs with unlimited number of robots and mechanisms can be designed, calibrated, simulated and programmed, as one model. Apart from robot and model calibration there is inverse kinematics, robot languages, over 100 industrial and educational robot models, DXF/IGES interface, 3D graphics in SuperVGA (256 colours), computer aided learning files all on a standard modern PC. This increases the number of companies who can now afford to automate, without incurring the high cost of workstation hardware/software. In July 1994 RSL linked with Robot Dynamics to market the Robotrak measuring system. This is an electro-mechanical set of units that can when linked with WORKSPACE 3+ (latest version) produce accurate calibration for off-line programming. This process is the subject of a patent application. RSL is based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has a policy of employing graduates with either computing or engineering disciplines. With increased staff levels, the ongoing development of the new WORKSPACE versions and other systems is well underway. To keep ahead of the field RSL develops products of quality with speed. The emphasis on quality and customer support has led to RSL doubling its turnover each year to reach 6 figures in just 3 years. Sales have increased to UK. colleges and export markets on each continent. The Japanese and the USA have recognised the value of PC based simulation systems and development work is underway with major blue chip companies worldwide. Experience has shown the value of good agents with ability to recognise the value of WORKSPACE in the long term, not for the quick return. RSL is a totally independent company, with no outside shareholders or venture capital. WORKSPACE is an in-house development, suitable for both robot manufacturers and users, each receiving equal service and confidentiality.

The WORKSPACE PC-based robot simulation system and the ROBOTRAK three cable measuring system for calibration are introduced as examples and compared to other commercial systems, and a calibration case study presented. The problem The repeatability of most industrial robots (the ability to return repeatedly to a given position) is usually much better than the accuracy (the ability to move to a specified xyz value in space). Typical repeatabilities are about 0.5mm while typical accuracies are of the order of 10mm or worse. This is not a problem when programming a robot using a hand-help teach-pendant and the human eye. Here it is only repeatability that is an issue. However, when programming a robot using some offline system to generate the robot locations numerically the accuracy of the robot becomes all important. In theory, it is possible to improve the accuracy so that it is as good as the repeatability. The reason that the accuracy of robots is so bad is because there are manufacturing tolerances involved in the production of each robot. The two most significant sources of error are discrepancies in the robot link lengths and in the zero position of each joint. What is required is a system that will take measurements of the xyz position of the end of the robot, compare them with the robot's own estimate of its position, and thereby find estimates for the errors and model these errors to improve the accuracy of offline programming. Measuring systems Systems for measuring robot position divide into two basic categories. The first includes all optical systems which use non-contact line-of-sight methods. The second includes all cable driven systems. An example of an optical system is the SPACE theodolite system developed by the Fraunhofer Institute (IPK) in Berlin, where a 3D target location on the end of the robot is determined by optical triangulation. Two or more motor-driven theodolites with power-focus and electronic imaging are used to obtain information on target direction via image processing software. This information drives the theodolites to track the moving target. The target must be visible from all directions, so a 6mm self-illuminated ceramic sphere is used [1]. This system has been developed and tested in collaboration with Volkswagen (VW), KUKA, and Leica. The same group have also tested a system named SMART which uses a single tracking laser interferometer to locate the 3D position of a reflector by measuring polar coordinates (two angles and one distance). This is the favoured measuring device of the group because of its operational simplicity.A group at Surrey University have developed a 2 laser system named Optotrac. A reflective target is attached to the end of the robot and used to reflect the 2 beams. If the target is not hit in the centre by the beams then the reflections are offset, and these offsets are used to track the target[2]. A low-cost approach was adopted by a group from Amsterdam University. A CCD camera mounted on the robot-hand is pointed at a flat plate on which a pattern of circles is printed. While not able to achieve the accuracy of other measuring systems, this system might provide a cheap means for partial recalibration after repair [3]. The Compugage two cable system developed by Dynalog has been used extensively in calibration [4]. While more rugged and therefore more appropriate to shop-floor use than optical systems, the set up and measurement procedure is lengthy and cumbersome. Even with extensive training the entire process can take 6 hours or more to calibrate an individual robot. An error at any stage leads to inaccurate results. The Chrysler Motor company, who have used this system, say that each minute of down-time on a production line costs them 20,000 dollars. The time taken for calibration is therefore a critical factor in choosing the right system. The shop-floor environment does not lend itself to complex or lengthy operations. What is required is a system that is accurate yet simple and quick to operate. Robotrak is a 3-cable mechanical system for measuring the x,y,z position of the endpoint of the robot to within 0.2mm. One person is capable of performing the entire setup in 20 minutes, with the total calibration completed in less than an hour. Compared to other calibration systems Robotrak is simple, rugged, and extremely cost-effective. Robotrak consists of three cables which extend from drums which are fixed at the corners of a roughly equilateral triangle somewhere within the robot workcell. The distance between the drums is typically 2 metres, but may be varied with the size of the robot to be measured. The cables meet at a fixture which is attached to the robot faceplate or tool. The length of the cables at any moment during the movement of the robot is calculated form the number of rotations of the drums and read into an IBM microcomputer. In this way the x,y,z position of the robot logged may be measured. Setting up and using Robotrak Robotrak is set up in coordination with the WORKSPACE robot simulation package as follows: 1. Place the three cable drums in a roughly equilateral triangle pattern of side approximately 2m somewhere within the workcell. Note that this can be on the floor, on a fixture, on a wall, on the ceiling, or at any angle to the robot. The position of the drums relative to the robot does not need to be known since this is calculated as part of the calibration process. This flexibility of positioning Robotrak within the workcell is one of the great advantages of this system. 2. Insert the Robotrak interface card into an IBM PC compatible microcomputer which runs the WORKSPACE robot simulation. 3. The encoders measuring the number of rotations of the drums and thereby indicating the extension of the cable are zeroed (with the cables at zero extension) by pressing a button within WORKSPACE. 4. Each cable is then extended to the end of a metal robot of known length and another button pressed. This enables WORKSPACE to calculate the ratio of encoder counts to length of extension in mm. 5. Cable 1 is extended to a known point on drum 2, cable 2 to drum 3, and cable 3 to drum 1. A button is pressed in WORKSPACE and the encoder counts at the drums are automatically recorded and converted to lengths. The relative position of all the drums is now known. 6. The cables are now extended to meet at the robot endpoint. The cables meet inside a small metal fitting that can be clamped either precisely at the end of the tool (if the tool is to be calibrated at the same time as the robot) or at any unknown point on the end link or tool of the robot. Robotrak can now provide a continuous reading of the xyz position of the end of the robot relative to an arbitrary coordinate frame fixed at one of the drums. 7. The robot is moved to 25 different positions and orientations throughout its working envelope. At each position the robot teach pendant is used to store a teachpoint on the robot controller, and a button is pressed in WORKSPACE to record an xyz measurement of the position end of the robot. 8. The teachpoint file is then copied from the robot controller onto the IBM PC compatible microcomputer and loaded into WORKSPACE. WORKSPACE then compares the teachpoint file with the measurements and searches for changes in the physical structure of the robot model within the simulation that would enable it to behave in the same way as the real robot. The WORKSPACE calibration softwareWORKSPACE is a PC-based robot simulation software package that makes extensive use of the Robotrak measuring system for calibration. Robotrak is part of the WORKSPACE system, and is used to calibrate robots prior to offline programming. The software for the calibration is an integral part of WORKSPACE and all the calibration options are available from WORKSPACE menus. The main advantages to the user of a calibration system integrated with the simulation system are that the user interface is greatly simplified and that the price is low compared with discrete calibration and simulation systems. This is the first time that such close integration has been achieved. Robot simulation, calibration, and offline programming may therefore be seen as a seamless process, in which robot programmes may be transferred to and from each stage with out any problem as is often required during the cell design process. Errors which may be detected and modelled by WORKSPACE and Robotrak include: (a) The zero position of each joint (the position of the joint where the value of the joint variable is 0), (b) The length of each link and the distance offset at each link, (c) The compliance at each joint (the sag of the arm at the joint due to the weight of the robot links when the robot is in a particular position), (d) The xyz tool offset from the mounting plate to the end of the tool, (e) The position and orientation of the measuring system coordinate frame relative to the robot base coordinate frame. The ability of WORKSPACE to calculate the correct position and orientation of the Robotrak drums relative to the robot as part of the calibration means that Robotrak may be mounted at any unknown position in the workcell. By taking one additional measurement on the tool axis using Robotrak the orientation of the approach vector of the tool may be calculated. WORKSPACE extracts these errors from the physical measurements and teachpoints by trying to find a robot model that would best fit the measured characteristics. The WORKSPACE kinematic model of the robot is then modified accordingly. Any points generated within WORKSPACE during the course of a simulation are then passed through a filter which alters the points in such a way that the uncalibrated real robot will be fooled in to moving to the point we really wanted it to move to by asking it to move to another, slightly different point. It is necessary to work this way since the real robot can have no knowledge of its physical inadequacies. Another filter may then be used when taking teachpoints back from the uncalibrated robot into calibrated model. With Robotrak measuring points to an absolute accuracy of 0.2mm it is possible to obtain results from the calibration such that the accuracy of an industrial robot such as the ABB IRB6000 during offline programming is improved from 10 to 20 mm to better than 1mm. Note that ROBOTRACK may also be used for measuring the position of the robot while it is moving along a path, for the purpose of checking the accuracy of paths generated on the robot controller. These paths may then be automatically displayed in 3D using WORKSPACE and compared with that generated during a simulation. Calibrating the workcell fixturesOnce the robot has been calibrated and its offline programmed accuracy improved to a suitable level then the robot may itself be used as a measuring device to find the true position of the fixtures in the workcell relative to the robot. This is an important issue since without knowing these positions accurately the offline generated robot programmes would be unusable. Another method measuring the position of fixtures is by using Robotrak itself (any measurements taken after calibration are adjusted by WORKSPACE so that they are expressed relative to the robot base). A third method is to use theodolites to measure the position of the robot base and all important points on the fixture. However, this method involves a great deal of time and expense. Once the position of the fixtures relative to the robot is known then the position of the models of the fixtures in the simulation package can be adjusted, enabling the simulation to accurate robot paths relative to the fixtures and the parts held in the fixtures. Conclusions If the accuracy required by a robot application of the order of 1mm and the robot programme is to be generated by an offline software package such as a graphical robot simulation then it is necessary to calibrate the robot first. Robots have no in-built knowledge of their own manufacturing tolerances and therefore the calibration results must be used at the offline stage to fool the robot into moving to a desired position by asking it to move to a slightly different position. Though many calibration systems exist, their worth should be measured by how effectively they coordinate with robot simulation software to improve the accuracy of robot programmes generated offline. In the future we can expect more and more companies to follow the lead of Reis Robots in providing partial calibration of the robot before supplying the robot to the customer, though the customer will still need to calibrate the robot tool, calibrate for zero position drift, and calibrate after the replacement of robot components. The next generation of robot controllers will be designed to be robot simulation friendly in their ability to take account of errors detected by calibration. 21st September 1994 References [1] S.Kyle, Leica, 'Measuring Systems for Complete Calibration', in 'Calibration Applied to Quality Control and Maintenance in Robot Production', Esprit Project CAR-5220, Edited by K.Schroer, IPK Franhofer-Institut fur Produktionsanlagen und Konstruktionstechnik, Berlin, Germany, p.28-35.

Introduction Simulation is a tool that is readily accepted within education and industry as a means to see, by computer design, the futures requirements. Every University sets a project to produce a simulation system, there are many systems on the market today each with benefits suitable for individual requirements, but few that can be called truly commercial. Robot Simulations Ltd., have developed the first PC based robotics simulation system that can compete with main frame and graphics work station systems at a fraction of the cost. The aim is to bring the applications of robotics to the student, the trainee, the designer and, in fact, any type of user. 2. The need for simulation. The designing of efficient work cells is a difficult task. The need to predict robot movement, to avoid interference between robots and determine the optimum placement for maximum reach is essential for the workcell design engineer. The ability to design within confined spaces where there is a high risk of collision together with identification of possible production bottlenecks is of the utmost importance and then, to know how long each process within a cycle will take. The changing of an existing workcell means down-time. Studies indicate that it can take more than 60 working hours to redesign a single robot manufacturing cell. Time is money and the cost of robot ownership must be kept to a minimum as the diagram (fig. 1) shows. fig.1 When a new design is to be incorporated, the concepts must be clearly communicated to all team members. A 3D system is preferred, as a 2D system can be misinterpreted. Simulation allows the planning of safety factors because operating robots can carry a risk of injury. Safety equipment can be placed in accordance with regulations and the training of robot operators can be supervised without risk to either trainer or trainee. The benefits of using simulation can easily be measured. With a faster design of new work cell layouts, the engineering effort is reduced creating less pressure on the team. Faster redesign means reduced down-time in line shutdowns for on-line programming. New ideas can be tested on the computer, eliminating costly mistakes. Cycle times can be reset to produce optimum schedules by verifying robot reach and collision detection. More importantly optimisation of the workcell can be achieved off-line, allowing the robot to continue operating during the planning phase. Off-line programming is available for similar reasons, and can be downloaded to the robot controller. The potential applications of simulation are varied. In the automotive industry there is Arc and Spot welding, Paint spraying, adhesives, sealants and more. In the machine tool industry there is CNC machine loading and unloading, deburring and others. Recently new applications such as remote telemanipulation, nuclear decommissioning, deep sea robotics and space research are all using simulation as the tool to bring the projects to maturity. What tools are needed to enable the user to get the best out of a simulation package? Firstly we must look at the needs of the user. The obvious first requirement is powerful user friendly software. To run the system, powerful computer hardware, recent advances in computer technology have made such systems available on a PC's either on Desk-top or Lap-top. Within the software there must be a comprehensive CAD system and a data exchange format. Accurate models of real industrial robots must be easily accessed together with mechanical modelling tools. the simulation language must be sophisticated in order to service the full requirements of the program and the user. As we are specifically dealing in robot simulation, there must be robot placement tools to test robot reach, check tool orientation and highlight any changes of configuration. A robot does not work alone, other devices such as conveyors, part feeders, CNC machines, ROV's can be simulated. A calibration facility to ensure that each model matches the real world workcell is imperative. Again collision detection must be a feature included in the software. 3. Introducing WORKSPACE(tm) Having listed the requirements of a professional industrial simulation system, WORKSPACE 3 can be introduced. WS3.2 is the world's most advanced PC based robot simulation system, using a standard PC compatible microcomputer. Let us look at the benefits of a PC based system and the features that are available. Firstly the features: High quality 3D graphics in Super VGA gives workstation quality on-screen shaded imaging. An off-line programming capability operated by a mouse driven draw-down menu method gives the system user flexibility. A library of standard industrial robots such as ABB, KUKA, Fanuc, Nachi, Kawasaki, Adept, Unimation and others gives the user more options to choose from, incorporating the visual design and simulation with a consistent user-friendly interface. 4. WORKSPACE Features. The sophisticated industrial standard 3D CAD system contains a library of standard primitives, Constructive Solid Geometry, B�zier surfaces, easy to use CAD editor, dimensioning and an industrial standard DXF and IGES interface. All models can be in wireframe, hidden-line or shaded. With a kinematics and inverse kinematics modeller for serial and parallel joint mechanisms, visual editing of the robot dimensions is possible and parameters such as joint limits, velocities and accelerations are easily set by the user. The simulation language also incorporates an advanced robot language to enable such programming routines as variables, sub-routines, loop structures, logic structures and sophisticated logic commands. Programmes are created visually by using the menu interface. This allows any number and brand of robots, mechanisms, conveyors, parts feeders and AGV's to be programmed and run concurrently. There are other robot language options available. Within the programming facility there is a text editor which acts as an integral editor for program files. A "trace" function is installed to assist in the creation of error free robot programmes. Another interactive text and simulation system is the CAL (Computer Aided Learning) system. This allows training exercises to be mixed with text giving multi-option questions and answers. Simulation is an ideal teaching tool, students can work on accurate industrial models in complete safety, the need for full time supervision is reduced allowing quality teaching. Finally simulation eliminates the need for expensive robotics hardware until the students and trainees are more capable and knowledgeable of the subject. The open architecture of WORKSPACE allows the import of external simulation routines and it will allow the user to modify or add inverse kinematics solutions. WS3.2 also contains a complete robot and workcell calibration system which is necessary for off-line programming. General mechanisms can be simulated, with either serial or branch models and with translational and rotational joints, as can parallelograms. The mechanisms can be controlled independently or as an auxiliary axis. This feature allows complex grippers to be modelled. To determine the movement of slave joints arithmetic expressions are used. Dynamics are shown to analyse demand, torque, forces, actual trajectory and joint error. The user can go into the section of relevant source code and modify the algorithms to suit other dynamics requirements using the "Userdyn" command. The controller parameters are adjustable and all results can be graphically displayed. The open architecture of WORKSPACE has many advantages, the Dynamic Linked Library allows the integration of user defined Pascal, C and C++ routines. "Usercall" permits special functions to be added to a track language by the user. "Autoexec" is a feature that can control WORKSPACE by an external script generated by another program. The number of robot languages within workspace is increasing all the time. Currently installed are Karel(tm) 2 & 3.06, ABB ARLA(tm), VAL(tm), VAL II(tm), V/V+(tm) and AS. Others to be implemented are RAL 10-II(tm), DARL(tm), ROBOSTAR(tm), AML3(tm) and others. One of the unique features of the WORKSPACE integrated system is the off-line programming facility. The programmes are written in the native controller language that can either be downloaded by floppy disk or RS interface and are compatible with other programming protocols. Calibration of robots within WS3 gives the differences between the ideal robot and real-world robot affected by manufacturing tolerances. This can be extended to the calibration of the workcell, giving accurate placement of objects and devices. The physical link between the robot and the controller can be adapted. Floppy disk transfer is possible but most controllers support serial connection with either an RS 232 interface or RS 422. It may be necessary to have a patchbox for correct wiring. The distance from the computer to the controller can be overcome by simply installing WS3.2 on to a portable PC, thus taking the simulation to the factory floor. (see fig.2). WORKSPACE can also read from the controller back to the PC. fig.2 WORKSPACE 3 has only recently been released but already it is solving real problems in both industry and education. 5. Case studies. Case Study 1. Cimtas, Turkey. Cimtas are a forward looking company in the manufacture of large steel structures for the construction industry. The application was the arc welding of large steel "I" beams. They needed a 10 axes movement of the workcell simulated as it was difficult to visualise all the movements. It was not possible to confirm the choice of robot before purchase and it was impossible to test ideas on the factory floor. Because of the orientation problems there was a high chance of collisions at the extremes of the robot envelope. (See fig.3) fig.3 First a model workcell was built in WORKSPACE, as in fig. 3, this contained 1 overhead robot fixed to a rotating table, in turn bolted to an extended overhead gantry, a track mounted rotating table at 90� from horizontal plane. The two chosen robots were tested in the simulation environment. The movement of the auxiliary axes was optimised to give maximum working envelope and minimise the risk of collisions. Then the exact height was obtained for the robot above floor level to avoid exceeding joint limits during welds. WORKSPACE helped the system become operational within a few weeks and eliminated the ongoing problems. A choice of robot was made, the optimum height was fixed, potential collisions eradicated and considerable time and money saved. Case Study 2. University of Plymouth, UK. Plymouth needed a software system which enabled students as much time as possible dealing in "real world" robotics. The problems encountered were: (i) The cost of robots to meet the demands of the robotics group. (ii) The cost of existing software running on workstations. (iii) The number within the group had to be reduced in order to provide effective supervision and teaching. The solution was for Robot Simulations Ltd., in discussions with the University, to provide various features that could be used specifically for teaching. Several features in WS3 were already being implemented for industrial applications such as , Userdyn, Dynamic Linked Libraries, Usercall and Autoexec which could be adapted for education. Each of these features allows the lecturer to set individual course work for an increased number of students. The result of this development was a B.Sc (Hons) course in Robotics and Automation which started in September 1993, with WS3 as the core software for the full 4 year course. The savings in both robotics and computer hardware/software gave greater flexibility to the budget allowing more students to enroll ( +60%), more 1 to 1 teaching, upgrading of existing equipment and purchase of new robots from basic educational units through various standards to main brand industrial types to enable industrial level project work.

The opportunities, says Managing Director Roger Verrall, are almost limitless. With 20,000 educational potential users around the world and some 500,000 industrial robots, the world is our oyster. Developed by ex-Newcastle University Dr. John Owens ( now Technical Director ), WORKSPACE has already been bought by many UK and European companies and colleges and also USA, Taiwan, Korea, Turkey, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Brasil and has attracted enthusiastic response from the Japanese and USA Robotics Associations. A distributor covering the whole of North America has recently been appointed with an identified user base of 20,000 industrial sites. Closer to home RSL are working with Pilkington Glass and Estil ( one of the leading UK automotive system integrators ). Plymouth University was the first in the UK to use WORKSPACE as the core software for its new BSc. (Hons) course in Robotics and Factory Automation with Liverpool John Moore, Leeds Metropolitan and Middlesex Universities are among many that are using it as a major learning tool. Paul Robinson, senior lecturer at Plymouth University's School of Electronics, Communications and Engineering joined Robot Simulations to develop a user friendly learning manual for WORKSPACE, the placement, the first of it's kind, being made through the DTI Senior Academics in Industry Scheme (SAIS) managed by the much vaunted Cranfield Institute of Technology who are also co-operating with RSL on important research projects. Locally, Komatsu have been working with RSL to help design a new workcell within their Birtley Plant. This contact is seen as very important as Komatsu, being a major international company could use WS on a world-wide basis. Major US car maker invites RSL to demonstrate WS at their new production facility near Detroit. US Waterjet cutting company have bought WS for their new process. Major Swedish furniture manufacture bought after a student now employed at the company recommended WS. Roger Verrall sees potential in almost every area of industry and the growing service robotics market.

WORKSPACE has been developed by a team led by the Author as the world's first industrial robot simulation software package. Since its commercial release in 1989 it has undergone many revisions. With the latest software release (version 3.2) WORKSPACE is in use on over 500 industrial and educational sites world-wide as both a graphic simulation system and a means of off-line programming a robot workcell. Creating and simulating robot programmes. WORKSPACE is a software package which will create and simulate robot programmes in the native language of the robot. For example, users of Fanuc robots may write robot programmes in Karel, ABB robot users may write robot programmes in ARLA. There is therefore no need for postprocessors to translate from a simulation language to the robot language: the full power of the robot language is available to the user through off-line programming. It is also possible to transfer existing robot programmes from the robot controller back into WORKSPACE for optimisation. Off-line programming is therefore a two-way process using WORKSPACE. is This particularly facilitated by the use of portable microcomputers which may be taken down onto the factory floor and used next to a robot workcell. The user first selects the target robot language required. To create a robot programme the user clicks the mouse on robot commands on a pull-down menu. These commands are immediately written to an ASCII text file. In this way a robot programme is created without the necessity for typing the command words, though the user may also use an in-built text editor if desired. As each command is written to the file it is simulated graphically on the computer screen in colour 3d solid graphics. Programmes may be debugged by tracing through line by line seeing at each line what is happening in the simulation. The value of variables may be watched or examined throughout. If an error occurs at any point then the user will immediately be placed in the WORKSPACE text editor at the position in the robot programme where the error occurred, enabling the error to be promptly corrected. Figure 1 - Off-line programming is a two-way process using WORKSPACE The full structure of the robot languages is implemented, including typed variables, teachpoints, subroutines, looping, branching on condition, signals, and condition handler interrupts. Several robots working in co-ordination, each under the control of a separate robot programme, may be simulated to produce one animation.During the simulation of the robot programme any collisions that occur between any objects in the workcell may be automatically reported, and a clock indicates the time taken for the overall sequence of movements. The 3D volume of the envelope may be plotted, or 2D slices through the envelope displayed on the screen. All the main industrial and educational robot languages are implemented, and a library of over 140 robot models is available to the user (though it is also possible for users to create their own robots). The 3D CAD system and kinematics modeller. 3D solid objects (including combinations created using Constructive Solid Geometry) or surfaces (including Bspline, Parametric, or Bezier surfaces) may be created using WORKSPACE's own 3D CAD system, or else imported into WORKSPACE form an external CAD system using the DXF file format (common amongst microcomputer based CAD systems such as AUTOCAD) or the IGES file format (common amongst graphics workstation based CAD systems such as CATIA). The use of an unlimited number of layers for storing different levels of detail makes it possible to turn off the display of object irrelevant to the current task, or display them in wireframe for speed. The movement of any mechanism may be modelled using a kinematics modeller. The mechanism may have any number of joints in any serial or tree-structure combination. Conveyors, automatic vehicles, and other independently moving objects may also be modelled. Defining positions Positions and paths for the robot tool to move to may be defined in several ways. A software emulation of a teach pendant is available to move the robot either by stepping individual joint angles or by stepping the xyz Cartesian position of the tool relative to the robot world co-ordinate frame. Positions may be saved as teachpoints for use later in a robot programme. These are displayed on the screen graphically as co-ordinate frames. If the robot is placed in a different position in the workcell then the teachpoints will change colour if they are no longer achievable due to the limits on the joints of the robot or due to the limited reach of the robot. Positions may also be defined by clicking the mouse at different positions on the computer screen (changing the view if necessary to define a 3D position). Orientations may be defined in many different ways: for example by dragging the approach vector of the teachpoint co-ordinate frame in a particular direction using the mouse. Geometry Points The easiest and most powerful way of defining robot positions is to use the geometry of objects. Points may be defined along the seam between two surfaces in such a way that the position of the point on the seam, the distance of the point from the seam, the lean of the approach vector of the tool towards the seam, or the angle between the adjacent surfaces and the tool approach vector is set by the user. This is of use in applications such as arc-welding. Figure 2 - Defining Geometry points normal to a surface Points may also be defined normal to a surface so that the position on the surface and the distance form the surface to the point is set by the user. As the point is moved over the surface the point is always maintained normal to the surface. This is of use in applications such as spot-welding. Paths to follow a 2D curve may be defined automatically. Straight line and segments of the curve are translated directly into linear and circular motions for the robot tool to follow. This is of use in applications such as water-jet cutting. Calibration Calibration is an important issue in off-line programming and simulation because the resulting robot programme is only as accurate as the model of the workcell. WORKSPACE supports three types of calibration. Calibration of the robot tool involves finding the xyz offset that must be added onto the kinematics of the robot to account for the tool attached to the end of the robot. This uses a procedure in which the robot and tool is moved repeatedly to a fixed location and the resulting teachpoints taken from the robot controller back into WORKSPACE. A multivariable search technique is then used to calculate the tool offset. This procedure may need to be repeated if the tool is knocked out of alignment during use. A similar technique may be used to find the true zero position of the robot. This is necessary since the zero position every joint of the robot is subject to drift during use. The resulting offsets are used to produce a more accurate robot model than the kinematics used on the robot controller itself. Finally, the true position of objects in the workcell may be measured using the robot as a measuring device, and the resulting teachpoints taken back into WORKSPACE and either used to define planes whose intersection redefines vertices or else used to redefine known positions within the model. In the future it is hoped that WORKSPACE will be integrated with a mechanical calibration system for measuring 3D positions within the workcell independently of the robot. Replaying simulations in real-time Simulations may be replayed within WORKSPACE in real-time, but recent advances in animation technology enable even more realistic playback. WORKSPACE simulations may be translated into the FLC file format used by AUTODESK Animator and replayed using a utility at speeds up to 50 frames a second. The resulting full screen animations are so realistic, even on a medium range 486 colour notebook, that it is like looking through a window onto the factory floor. The utility for replaying FLC files will be bundled with the WORKSPACE software. Simulation of Dynamics It is possible to simulate the dynamics of a robot using WORKSPACE for a defined sequence of movements. The equations relating the torques and accelerations at each joint and their interactions for a 6-axis robot are modelled using numerical integration. Two type of controller equation may be used: classical and discrete-time control. The constant multipliers in the controller equations may be modified and the resulting effect on the trajectory examined. The effect of attaching a payload to the end of the robot may also be examined. However, until it is possible to obtain accurate estimates for the mass, inertia matrices, centre of gravity, and controller constants at each joint, dynamics simulation is only of use in demonstrating general principles and obtaining qualitative not quantitative information. The Future For many years robot companies have not been co-operative in providing the information required to accurately simulate the paths generated by the robot controller when moving through via points. Without this information it is difficult for a simulation to provide precise cycle-times. Now, the large Automotive robot users, many of whom have committed themselves irrevocably to off-line programming, are beginning to make it a condition of future robot orders that this information is provided as a black box to the simulation companies. However, simulation and off-line programming will only become widely accepted if there is a change in attitude within the simulation companies, who at present seem unwilling to get involved on the factory floor. Simulation is often carried out on the other side of the factory, or in some cases on the other side of the country. The resulting programmes are then taken down onto the factory floor This is where the problems for the people on the factory floor begin. Reality is seldom the same as a simulation, and the robot programmes usually require modification, but by this time the simulation is being used on the next project. This gap between the factory floor and the simulation is one that WORKSPACE is designed to close, by enabling a portable microcomputer to be taken down onto the factory flood and the simulation to be used next to the robot controller, and by allowing robot programmes to be shuffled backwards and forwards between the simulation and the robot controller as many times as required.

Conclusions 1. Introduction Due to the ever increasing demands placed upon the industrial robot in terms of application requirements involving precise path following, both robot manufacturers and industrial end users require to know the dynamic behaviour of the robotics system. In particular it is becoming critically important to know the precise trajectory taken by the robot tool point ( Ref.1 ). Hence there is a need for a measuring system capable of tracking a selected tool point. The system should be portable have good world accuracy capability, be flexible in its use in terms of velocity range, acceleration range and data capture period, and above all, be affordable. This paper presents such a measuring system which has been the subject of three years intense research conducted by the author and his associates both academic and industrial. fig. 1 2.0 System Concept and Overview. The robot tracking system, ROBOTRAK, utilises three wires, the lengths of which are continually measured over a fast time base using three measuring units placed at known locations in space. A calibration triangle is used to set the location of the measuring units and to set the origin of ROBOTRAK relative to the world co-ordinate system of the robot under test. Knowing the accurate positions of the measuring units relative to each other and the instantaneous position of the robot point can be calculated ( Ref. 2. ) in a Cartesian co-ordinate system based in the measuring unit positions, ( Fig. 1 ). The system equations derived by considering the geometry of the three wires and measuring unit are:- Px = Bx� + Ra� - Rb� 2Bx Py = Cy� + Ra� - Rc� 2Cy Pz� = Ra� - Px� - Py� where : Px, Py and Pz are the instantaneous co-ordinates of the tool point relative to the origin; measuring unit (1). All variables are shown in Fig. 1. Digital signals from the three measuring units are fed to an electronic interface unit which is connected to a PC for data reduction and analysis. The results are presented graphically with hard copies available from a four colour pen plotter. Time histories of position, velocity and acceleration are produced and path plots of any two position axes from the three available generated. ROBOTRAK may be considered to consist of three basic sub-systems ; the measuring units, the electronic interface unit and the computer hardware/software system. ( Ref. 3 ). 3.0 Measuring Units. The three measuring units consist of a storage drum, a pulley fitted with an incremental encoder and a wire guide. All three parts are mounted on a single plate. The storage drum is used as a take up spool for the tensator spring, it is supported on a needle roller bearing and is free to slide on the shaft. The main pulley and encoder unit is assembled on a single turned component which bolts onto the mounting plate. A shaft bolts directly onto the encoder shaft and is supported by the bearing in the encoder and a ball bearing at the pulley end of the shaft. The tensator spring is bolted onto the pulley to supply the drive. Wire is wrapped around the pulley and fed out through the wire guide. It is terminated using a swivel jointed clip. Fig 2. Shows an assembly design drawing of the measuring units used. 4.0 Electronic Interface Unit. The interface unit is a three channel device complete with its own power supply. Three decoding circuits are used to process data from the encoders and input 16 bit values, on request, to a PC through a 1MHz communications bus. The decoding circuit cards are slot mounted in a standard 19 inch rack which also houses the power supply. 4.1. Decoding Circuits. These circuits consist of essentially 4 I.C's. a) LS 2000 Direction discriminator b) LS 373 Octal D type latches. c) LS 138 Decoders/multiplexor. d) LS 14 Hex Schmitt-trigger inverters The outputs to the circuits are connected to the 1 MHz bus. Operation is relatively simple. The LS 2000 keeps track of the encoder value. On receiving the correct signal on the 1 MHz bus (fed through the LS 138 multiplexor ) the value is latched by the LS 373 and can be read by the PC. The circuit is an 8 bit circuit so that two " reads " are needed to get a complete 16 bit encoder value. The latching of all circuits is performed when encoder 1 is read. This ensures that all three values are taken at the same time. The values can then be read into the PC. Reading the following addresses; in the PC performs the following :- Address &FCOO Latches all lsb and reads lsb enc. 1. &FCO1 Reads lsb enc. 2. &FCO2 Reads lsb enc. 3. &FCO4 Latches all msb and reads msb enc. 1. &FCO5 Reads msb enc. 2. &FCO6 Reads msb enc. 3. A line diagram of the circuit is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. 5.0 Computer Hardware/Software. The function of this sub-system is to receive 16 bit numbers from the 3 channel electronic interface unit. To pre-process, store and data reduce this information and produce graphical output in a usable format. 5.1 Computer Hardware. An IBM PC compatible 386 with 40MB hard disk and 2 MB of RAM 5.2 System Software. The system software consists of a suite of programmes in Windows(tm) used to run and calibrate ROBOTRAK. The software is menu driven and functions are selected by either a mouse or user defined function keys. Fig. 4. shows the menu selection flowchart. On start up, the system automatically selects the Introduction menu. Introduction Menu Three options are presented :- 1. Set up Parameters. - This option is used to define the test routine to be used and under what filename the data is to be stored. On selection a Parameter Menu is entered. 2. Perform Test. - This option is used to actually record the data. The test routine being defined as previously defined in the Parameter menu. The user is given the option to Rezero the encoders prior to the test routine being performed. If it is suspected that the counters have been reset while the wires have been connected to the robot at any stage, this option must be followed. ( Pressing the Break key resets the 1 MHz bus and hence the counters to zero ). The test routine is then performed and a Testing Menu offered on completion of the test. 3. Analyse the Results. - This option is for processing the stored data and selecting the output required. Parameter Menu ( Set up Parameters ). This menu allows the operator to set the following test parameters. 1. Filename. - The filename for storing results. A maximum of 5 characters will be accepted. 2. Sample Rate. - The data sampling rate can be set within the range of 200 to 1000 readings per second. 3. Test Length. - Up to a maximum of 4000 points can be recorded. The maximum allowable time in seconds for the chosen sampling rate is displayed. 4. Start Mode. - Three start modes are available : M - manual mode starts on pressing the spacebar of the computer. A - Automatic mode starts when motion of the robot is sensed. E - External mode utilises an external trigger connected to the User Port of the Microcomputer to trigger the recording. 5. Comments. - A string of up to 30 characters can be added to define the test. These can be printed by the plotter if required. Once all the parameters have been set the user can change them simply by pressing the appropriate function key and re-entering the data. When the parameters are correct F6 returns the user to the Introductions Menu. Testing Menu( Perform Test ) This is entered by selecting the second option of the Introduction Menu. The user is first given the option to reset the counters and then the test is performed. On completion of the test, three options are available :- 1. Redo - Allows the operator to re-run the test. 2. Save - Validates the date, calculates the Cartesian co-ordinates of the end effector of the robot and stores the results in the file name specified by the parameter Menu. This procedure takes approximately 60 seconds/250 points. 3. Quit. - Returns the user to the introduction menu without saving the data. Plot Menu Selection This menu is entered on selecting the third option of the introduction menu if no previous screen are available for analysis. It is used to define the starting screen for the analysis. The first menu offers two options :- 1. Time - Plots against time 2. Plane - Plots views of the Cartesian planes. On selecting the Time option the following options are available :- 1. X-T X position against time 2. Y-T Y position against time 3. Z-T Z position against time 4. V-T Velocity against time 5. A-T Acceleration against time On selecting the Plane option the following views are offered:- 1. X-Y 2. Y-Z 3. Z-X On completion of the selection the axes are plotted and the user is returned to the Control Menu. Control Menu( Analyse the Results ) This is the main menu for the analysis of the data. It allows the operator to define files to plot graphs, to draw and scaling of axes. Five options are available :- 1. Windo - Allows one to change the graph shown, either to a different scale or to different axes. 2. Hcopy - Gives a hard copy of the results. Copy Menu is presented. 3. Nwfil - Defines filenames to be plotted. Inputting * and tapping "Shift" will scroll through the filenames currently available on disk. 4. Erase - Deletes one of the currently selected files. 5. Quit - Returns to the Introduction Menu. Window Menu 1. Draw - A box can be drawn around any part of the plot to be enlarged. 2. Specify - The axes range can be specified numerically. 3. Reset - Resets the axes scales to the default sizes. 4. Plane - Selects a new graph to be plotted. See Plot Selection Menus. 5. Quit - Returns to the Control Menu and replots the data without changing the data. This can be used in the event of a system failure to return to the previously plotted screen. Copy Menu 1. Print - Dumps the current screen to a printer. 2. Plot - Selects output for a colour plotter. Two further options are given in this mode: 1. New - Sets the plotter for a paper change. 2. Old - Plots over the old graph. On selecting New any sheet in the plotter will be ejected and the user prompted to insert a new sheet. 6.0 Measured Performance Specification In order to validate the output results from ROBOTRAK, performance trials were conducted. Particular trajectories of known velocity and acceleration were set up under laboratory conditions and the ROBOTRAK system used to measure these. The output from ROBOTRAK was then compared against these known values. From these trials ROBOTRAK was found to conform to the following performance specifications. Static repeatability Better than �0.2mm within 2m x 2m x 1.2m Variable path �0.32mm within 2m x 2m x 0.7m Dynamic repeatability Same path same speed �0.5mm with 2m� Same path variable velocity �0.7mm within 2m� Maximum allowable velocity = 4m/s Maximum allowable acceleration = 10m/s� 7.0 Robot Test Examples. Representative test data obtained during trials on a Unimation Puma 560 are shown in Figs 5 - 11. A simple rectangle path was programmed by teaching the Puma Robot four points. The plane of the rectangle was set perpendicular to the x - y plane of ROBOTRAK, and at 45 degrees to the x axis. The Puma program was set for continuous motion, with no delay or settling times set at the taught points, with the exception of the start / stop point. This was chosen to show the effect of tracking around smooth corner radii. Plots of x against z, y against z and x against y are shown in Figs 5, 6 and 7 respectively. Time histories of x against T and y against T were also plotted and can be seen in Figs 8 and 9 respectively. Both velocity and acceleration profile plots were produced and are shown in Figs 10 and 11. These two plots show clearly the effect of tracking the corner radii, with the larger peak representing the start / stop point. 8.0 Conclusions The ROBOTRAK, robot dynamic tracking system presented here has been extensively used for the assessing the performance characteristics of industrial robots both within the GRAG laboratory at Cranfield and "on-site" at various industrial establishments.

With the introduction of WORKSPACE 3.0, these pre-requisites can be achieved with considerable savings to the small and medium sized customer, without sacrificing quality, but achieving economy of scale. We will show how the use of simulation can aid each step of the process from the development of an idea to the programming of the final choice of robot. In each instance an example from a case study will be shown from a number of applications and questions may be asked. The need for Simulation The techniques of computer aided design (CAD) have found extensive use in improving or replacing the process of engineering drawing, architectural drawing and many other applications. However, an engineering process involving many more moving parts can only be fully understood through the process of simulation. Early developments in this field have involved the computer controlled machining centres using existing CAD systems. Additional software is used to take the original CAD engineering drawing of a machined part and analyse a path across its surface. An animated simulation of the movements a machining centre must go through to create the part from a "raw" block is then displayed. As well as providing a visualisation of the process, a file can be created containing the required instructions to the machining centre. The file can then be executed to create the part. This extension of computer aided design to computer aided manufacture is highly applicable to industrial robotics. Simulation provides an efficient interactive graphical environment in which to improve the way industrial robots are programmed. Ever-increasing numbers of robot installations are now being planned using computer simulation. Only a few years ago the cost of technology to achieve these aims was prohibitive for all but the largest organisations. However, as with CAD before it, simulation, calibration and programming of industrial robots is possible even on a standard low-cost PC compatible computer. A software package called WORKSPACE, conceived, designed and developed by the UK company Robot Simulations Ltd., can be used to create a robot installation at a fraction of the cost of existing systems. This talk uses WORKSPACE as an example to show how simulation , calibration and programming can assist the implementation of an automation project. Using a Robot Simulation WORKSPACE was primarily intended as a visualisation aid for those engineers and managers involved in the process of designing and debugging new or existing robot installations. Benefits such as the ability to detect off-line collisions between robots and objects, and ability to evaluate and optimise the time taken for a sequence of movements off-line have proved major incentives for the investment in robot simulation. The core of WORKSPACE and the more expensive systems is the 3D CAD modeller. A workcell or even a full manufacturing facility containing a number of work cells can be effectively drawn on the screen, or object geometry's may be imported from a commercial CAD package ( AutoCad ) via a standard graphics Data Exchange File ( DXF ). The next step is to install a robot or robots into the model. A library of over 100 industrial and educational robots is available for WORKSPACE, thus allowing an engineer to experiment with different configurations in the prototype workcell by simply loading a robot from a disk. A standard robot may be selected from the library and placed in position. The user may also design their own, new robot modelling the "flesh" with the CAD system and defining the mechanical linkages. WORKSPACE then creates the kinematics model for the new robot. Operating parameters such as actual scale size, velocities, accelerations and joint limits are all simulated. A robot program can then be created, simulated and downloaded. Robot programmes are created by selecting the required operating language from the pull down menu system and interaction with the model using the mouse pointer. The graphical interface is considerably more intuitive than most numerically based robot operating systems. For example, it is possible to define a robot position relative to the model by pointing at a position with the mouse. The robot tool might then be automatically reorientated so that it is normal to the plain of the object face - a feature which is particularly useful in surface type applications. Commands are also available to carry out more complex tasks at the click of the mouse cursor. Some examples include paint spraying or applying glue evenly over a given surface , welding along seams or grasping an object. By using these commands it is possible to write a program very quickly. These progammes are then used firstly to move a robot in the model to produce a realistic animation, in shading of the 3D objects due to an arbitrary light source. Features such as conveyors, robots mounted on traverse units, carousels, AGV's, and machine tools may also be simulated. There is no limit to the number of programmes to be run concurrently on any number of robots or their associated machinery. The resulting command information will be combined by the software to produce one complete integrated simulation. Collision between objects in the work cell are reported as they occur, a critically important feature from the safety point of view. WORKSPACE calculates the time taken for each event within the model and displays the total as a "cycle time ". By rearranging the work cell or experimenting with different robots and end effectors on the simulation, this cycle time can be reduced to a minimum, thereby maximising the number of production cycles that may be achieved during a working day. Once the robot program has been defined and evaluated using WORKSPACE it can be down loaded direct to the robot controller without the need to use a postprocessor. Traditional methods of re-programming a robot would inevitably mean that production in that cell must stop for a considerable time. In addition, programming may have been by a teach pendant, involving an unacceptable degree of human error. By first simulating then downloading, downtime can be reduced to the time it takes to load a new program onto the controller from disk. This is one of the major benefits of robot simulation. Robot Simulation: Problems and Solutions The kinematics involved in robot movement is far more complex that those related to XYZ machining centres, and the relationship between the curves swept by the robot end - effector and the joint variables is not straightforward. Additionally, for a robot simulation to be of general use it must be capable of simulating a wide variety of robot types and configurations. Perhaps because of this the most beneficial simulations are not those that are originally drafted by using a CAD system with additional "robot kinematics" software but those that are specifically designed to cope with the demands of complex robot structures. To calculate the position of the joints required to achieve a given tool position and orientation it is necessary to use a complex mathematical algorithm. Most simulations provide algorithms for the major robot types. Unfortunately these algorithms do not always function in an identical way to those used on the robot controller ( for example, in the selection of when to point an elbow up or down, or how to deal with degenerate cases when axes are aligned ). Robot manufacturers tend to be reluctant to release information like this (if they know themselves) to a third party simulation company, even under a non-disclosure agreement. This can mean that a robot program can appear satisfactory when simulated on screen can have an occasional unforeseen change of configuration when implemented in the real world. The answer to this that any computer simulation cannot be a substitute for acting with caution the first time a robot cycle is implemented in a work cell, as safety is a primary concern. "Off-line" Programming WORKSPACE now provides the user with a unique facility for translating from a simulation system language to a robot language. This process is not a simple task. Usually the user would need a post processor to translate not only the simple structures such as movement commands, but also more complex structures such as condition handlers, repeat until, while do,subroutines and variables. There are very few established standards, as the robot manufacturers are fiercely loyal to their own operating systems over those of their competitors. WORKSPACE uses a highly sophisticated robot simulation language in order to create a compact efficient program. This language contains all the important program structures mentioned above plus a large number of functions and routines which are specific to manipulating robots. For example it is possible to perform a pick and place task by simply naming the object to be moved, specifying the position you wish to place it and calling a routine to calculate all the intermediate moves. WORKSPACE has a number of robot languages in a library, as with the robots, when performing the simulation and at the start of programming the correct robot language for the model is drawn from the menu and the translation is carried out simultaneously. To transfer the program files from the PC computer running the simulation to the robot controller it is necessary to use a communication link or by copying the files onto a disk compatible with the robot controller. Again, this is an area which has few standards. Even the "standard" RS232 serial port poses problems of electrical wiring and protocol methods. However, once a link has been established it is possible to receive information from the controller and translate into the simulation language without the need of a preprocessor, thus allowing the robot program to be evaluated and improved. Model Accuracy It must be remembered that a simulation of a robot work cell is only as accurate as the model of the workcell. Careful measurements of objects in the real world must be made, before entering the parameters to the CAD model. One way further of improving the accuracy of a simulation is to use the robot as a measuring device. A probe is attached to the robot endpoint and moved to corners of key positions in the workcell. The datum or calibration points could then be loaded into the model and used to reposition objects in the model relative to the robot. Production Time When planning a factory lay-out, robot simulation is only part of the story. The values for cycle times given in a workcell assumes that there are no bottlenecks elsewhere in the production process. Scheduling simulations are available to allow the whole flow of materials to be modelled, through modelling robot workcells as "black box" components. What is needed is the complete integration of scheduling and robot simulation, so that ever more accurate figures for average production time may be obtained. WORKSPACE has allowed for this in its'. "User CAll" facility. Future Developments Simulation has now a major impact on the type of software supplied with robots to users, with most major manufacturers taking a strong interest in marketing their own branded simulations or off-line programming systems. The graphical interface and user friendliness of WORKSPACE has highlighted the inadequacy of todays user-hostile text based robot operating systems. WORKSPACE is capable of running many different robots from different suppliers in the same workcell. It is now possible to use a graphical simulation system used as a robot operating system with a simple "point and click" selection of robot target positions. New robot tasks can be programmed in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks. The promise of flexible automation is yet to be fully realised, but the expectation of the user for simulation software as reliable as the software used for word processing is the target that Robot Simulations Limited set and is achieving.

Joint development efforts result in new 7 axis robot for highly complex applications. Robot Simulations offers modelling and off-line programming as standard option in Workspace ®. Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Robot Simulations Ltd., has announced the successful completion of a unique joint development effort between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, RSL and the RSL Sales and Marketing dealers in Japan, Robotmation and the Marubeni Hitech. This has lead to the launch of the new PA-10 robot as standard within Workspace ® 4.0 for Windows ® 95. This robot has 7 axes, is lightweight, and is designed to perform many applications outside of the range or scope of traditional industrial robots. This is based on the improved degree of freedom and general useability. Industrial robots currently on market have five or six degrees of freedom. However in order to deal with the increasingly complex robot work, such as obstacle avoidance, confined space access etc. MHI have provided the solution by designing seven degrees of freedom (RPRPRPR R = Rotation, P = Pivot) After the technical development team at RSL had completed the kinematic modelling of this new robot in close co-operation with MHI, the controller language was developed. Much thought was put into the usability to maximise the off-line programming features of Workspace. With the future complexity of the tasks that the PA-10 will be utilised, off-line programming and simulation for cell layout will be an important element in the functionality of the robot. "We are happy to work with any robot manufacturer in the world to bring this type of joint technological innovation to the robotics industry", says Roger Verrall, Managing Director of RSL. "By bringing together the expertise of RSL and robot manufacturers we can help to move the industry to the higher levels that they seek".

It is fully compatible with Arla programmes created by Workspace and may be used as an alternative to using ABB software to download these text files to an S3 controller. The latest release of SPORT has the following capabilities: File compilation - Convert a robot program from ARLA to binary code. Task compilation - Convert all robot programs in a task from ARLA to binary code. Diskette Functions - Using diskette to transfer program between robot and PC. On Line Communication - Communication between robot and PC via serial link. File decompilation - Convert a robot program from binary code to ARLA robot language. Block decompilation - Convert a block of robot programs from binary code to ARLA. Program Editor - Creating robot programs and transfer position and orientation data via DDE to SPORT from AutoCAD. OLP-import - A file with .irb extension created in OLP3 (english or swedish) can be converted to SPORT standard. Printing - Print a file: File, Print, (notepad starts with the actual file), you may add comments to the file, Arkiv, Skriv ut. Possible to specify a Word processor (WinWord, Write, Notepad...). The word processor is started from the menu or by Ctrl+Enter in a .rpl-file or a selected .rpl-file in the task-file. If a file excedes 64kb the specified word processor will be started automatically. As a complement to task a new feature with block files (extension .IRB) has been introduced which is compatible with olp irb files. This version of SPORT has debugging capabilities. This application shows the current running line in the task by highlighting it. Prodebug.exe has DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) to the to sailserv.exe, a module for robot control. This version is shipped with the ADS aplication SAIL (Simulation AId for Link mechanisms). This is a general module for kinematic simulation in AutoCAD for Windows. Via DDE are the module SAILSERV and SAIL communicating and the model of the ABB2000 are automatically updated during the simulation. New Features in the latest release Release 1.51 adds new features to the SPORT system. TCP calibration - You are now able to measure the TCP and Basepoint of the robot and directlly update theTCP register of the controller.

Three cords extend from drums fixed in the cell in a triangle arrangement to meet at the end of the robot. The extensions of each cord is measured by optical encoder on the drum which report the rotation of the drum. Given the lengths of the three cords and the distances between the drums which is discovered during the self-calibration setup for Robotrak it is possible to calculate the true position of the endpoint of the robot. The software for setting up and using Robotrak is embedded in Workspace and compares measurements taken using Robotrak to the teachpoints for the same positions recorded by the robot. Workspace then extracts the errors in the nominal controller model of the robot to produce a filter which sits between the simulation and the robot and fools the inaccurate robot into achieving going accurately to the desired position. Parameters calibrated for Joint zero positions Link lengths Misalignment of successive joints Tool offset Position and orientation of the measuring system (Robotrak) Joint compliance due to weight of payload and links Other technical data Repeatability of Robotrak - 0.3mm Kinematic model used - 5 parameter DH model Repeatability of uncalibrated Robot - typically 0.1mm Accuracy of uncalibrated robot - between 15mm and 2mm Accuracy of calibrated robot - 1mm Overall time taken for setup and robot calibration - 30 to 60 minutes Calibration using Workspace and Robotrak in more detail [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts? Why are there colons in the message section when I try post a followup? Why didn't my post show up? Where can I get the scripts for this program? Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts? No. You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message. The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting. If they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in <>'s. If they allow it, your html markup will appear in the posting. It can't hurt to try. Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a followup? Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or disable the quoting of previous messages. Why didn't my post show up? Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the page, it simply pulled it out of cache. Please reload your browser and it should then appear. Where can I get the scripts for this program? The scripts are written in Perl and created by Matt Wright. They are free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other scripts at: http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/. Enjoy!

I suggest that you poll the com port for a change in the state of its flags before attempting to transmit the next command. This is because the controller is busy and loses the first few characters of the next command, thus causing a syntax error when it eventually starts to take notice of its serial port again. Alternatively, you could configure the port for an infinite number of retries from DOS but I am not certain if this will affect the operation of your .exe file.

Workspace can be used to simulate both serial and tree type mechanisms. They are defined by modelling the joints that make up the mechanism. Each joint can be either rotational or translational, each joint is defined between its parent object and its child object, and its motion is governed by user defined equations.

They use very high pressure water jets varying in pressure from 40,000 to 55,000 psi depending on the type and width of the material to be cut. The distilled water is run through three filters (10, 1, and 0.5 micron thick) to filter out any particles and then passed through flexible metal tubing along the length of the robot to a nozzle attached as a tool to the end of the robot.Materials that can be cut in this way include fibre-glass, headliner material, carpet, plastic (hard and soft). With the addition of an abrasive named garnet (with the texture of sand) it becomes possible to cut sheet metal or even marble: RPT have developed workcells that can cut more than 3 inches of aluminium or 2 inches of steel. Water-jet cutting is very cost-efficient in comparison to other methods such as laser-jet cutting. It is particularly suitable for cutting soft fabrics, causes no heat-stress on the part (it is its own cooling system), and the water can be easily recycled or drained straight into the sewer. The Requirements The pelt to be cut is 27 millimetres thick. RPT were requested to make two cuts (see figure 1). The first cut would be at a 54 degree angle to the surface. There were additional specifications as to the length and width of the pelt, from cut line to cut line on the surface. There was also a radius in each corner of 10 millimetres on the surface. It was required that the 54 degree cut angle be maintained throughout the radius. The second cut was to be done at an 80 degree angle to the upper surface. This cut was to be made on the already existing 'slope' of the 54 degree cut. This would mean that the overall length and width of the part should be measured at its widest point on the 'peak' of the edges. Again there were specified lengths and widths for this 'peak' as well as the bottom surface cut line to cut line. Again there was a specific radius that had to maintain this 80 degree cut angle. There was also a specification that this 'peak' had to be 13 millimetres from the surface, and had to be maintained at this consistent height around the whole part, especially the corners. Angles needed to be maintained +/- 2 degrees. Dimensions needed to be maintained +/- 1 millimetre. Figure 1 - The part specification The Workcell The workcell is shown in figure 2. It consists of a Fanuc S500 robot using an S3 controller and the TP robot language. Four parts are cut from one pelt before the cut parts are unloaded and the next pelt placed in the workcell. The First Attempt: Manual Programming The first attempt to solve the problem involved teaching the robot by hand using the Fanuc teach-pendant. This required a great deal of time and patience to teach the hundreds of points required for each of the four cuts. Although the programmer could fine tune points taught by eye by entering numbers calculated using the mathematics of the part, it was still extremely difficult to ensure that the angle of the cuts was consistent. A further problem was that the cuts were not repeatable over the four parts. Because of the distortion in the robot envelope due to the geometric structure of the robot the points used to cut a part in one area of the pelt when transferred to another area of the pelt gave less consistent cuts. Water-jet cutting is a very demanding application because any deviation that the robot makes in its path, any change in velocity, any defect in the robot will show up in the final part. After about 40 hours of programming the parts being cut were still not of the quality required. The Solution:Simulation,Calibration and Offline Programming using Workspace/Robotrak RPT chose to use a robot simulation software package named Workspace to perform the simulation, calibration, and offline programming of the workcell. The key factors in this decision were as follows: 1. Workspace is integrated with the Robotrak robot and tool calibration system. This close integration means that robot and tool calibration (for both the tool offset and orientation) is quick and effective. 2. Workspace allow users to work in the robot's native language, in this case TP. This provides users with the entire power of the TP language, without the need for postprocessing of any kind. Offline programming is therefore a one-step process. 3. The Workspace CAD, simulation, and offline programming system is quick and easy to use. This enabled the workcell to be designed. 4. Workspace can run on any IBM-compatible PC. The cost of the hardware required for the simulation was therefore kept to a minimum, and existing PCs at present used for other purposes might be used. Workspace can also run on a notebook. This enables the engineers involved in modifications in the workcell to work on the shopfloor if required. 5. Robotrak is easy to set up and use, even in a clustered workcell, since the three base units that must be placed on the floor can be placed anywhere in the workcell. The Method First one part was modelled using the Workspace CAD system as a series of closed polylines (linked arcs and lines). The geometry points required along each polyline (representing the meeting point of the water-jet and the part) were taught within Workspace along the polyline. These geometry points are like robot teachpoints except that they are stored with the model and may therefore be easily moved in the model independently of the robot. The user defined only start and end geometry points on a given line or arc - Workspace then used interpolation to automatically create intermediate geometry points along the lines or arcs at a distance between each point defined by the programmer. This technique of over defining the path (using more points than might seem necessary) ensures that the robot follows the path more precisely. The part was then copied four times and placed within the workcell. This also copies and moves the geometry points four times so that they do not need to be redefined for each part. The Fanuc S500 robot model was loaded from the robot library and placed within the workcell. If the placing of the robot was such that any of the geometry points were unachievable then the geometry points were displayed in red. The robot could then be repositioned. Figure 2 shows the Workspace model of the workcell and Figure 3 shows the geometry points defined on a part. Figure 2 - The Workspace model of the workcell Figure 3 - Geometry points defined on a part The robot programme was defined from the Workspace menus in the TP language using movements to the geometry points and the necessary motion types, motion termination types, and velocities. If movement along the path caused the robot to hit a limit on one of the wrist joints, or when moving from one cut to the next cut, then an additional move was inserted to enable the wrist to re-orientate itself (known as an air move). After the robot programme was defined from the Workspace menus then the Workspace text editor was used to inspect and comment the different parts of the programme, as well as to add commands for turning the water jet on or off.The next stage was to calibrate the robot and tool (see Figure 4) using Robotrak. A special fitting had been designed that screwed the robotrak cords onto the end of the water-jet. The robot was then moved to 50 teachpoints all with different positions and orientations throughout the envelope, and Workspace automatically took an xyz measurement reading from Robotrak each time the robot paused between movements. Figure 4 - Robot and tool calibration using Robotrak The teachpoint file and the measurement file were then used in Workspace to instigate a search which in 1 minute found the joint angle offsets, errors in link lengths, misalignment of joint axes, tool xyz offset, and joint compliances, which together make up the signature of the robot. Two additional fittings were used to take two additional measurements using Robotrak and thereby find the true tool orientation (see Figure 5). Figure 5 - Robotrak fittings for end of water-jet tool (from left to right): for measuring 50 points; for measuring tool z-axis, for measuring tool x-axis; for teaching points on part. Robotrak was then disconnected from the robot and a pointer attached to the end of the water-jet tool. This pointer was used to teach three teachpoints which just touched each of the four pelts. By taking these teachpoints back into Workspace and comparing them with the geometry points taught on the pelts it was possible to update the model for the true position of the pelts. The robot programme was then downloaded to the robot using the Workspace Send to robot command. This converts all the geometry points in the programme into teachpoints, uses the robot and tool signature to correct the accuracy of the points, merges the teachpoint file and programme file and compiles it to a binary .TP file, and then copies the file into the robot subdirectory. The Results It took about 10 hours to complete the whole simulation, calibration and offline programme the 4 parts and their programmes, compared to the 40 hours plus for the programming alone. These programmes were then applied to the robot with the calibration package, the tooling was calibrated with a tool fixture, and the first cut proved more consistently accurate in terms of cut angle and position than any manually taught programme was able to achieve. The programme created using Workspace and Robotrak ran first time on the robot controller without any modifications. No touch up was required using the teach pendant. Summary Robot simulation, calibration, and offline programming produced parts that were cut to a higher accuracy than those cut using manually taught methods. The time taken to programme an accurate path was also reduced drastically. No manual touch up of the points was required primarily because the real-world had been accurately simulated using the Workspace/Robotrak robot, tool, and model calibration methods.

For many years they have installed coin-operated gas meters to meet the needs of certain customers. Because these meters hold coins, they have proved to be targets for vandalism and theft. British Gas Research and technology division have therefore developed several schemes for meters which use plastic keys, magnetic strip cards and smart cards as a credit medium. The challenge A test rig had to be implemented to assess the reliability of the payment schemes outlined above before embarking on a nation-wide installation programme. The test rig had to pick up the keys or cards from feeds, then insert and remove them from the meters. In the case of the cards, it was necessary to place each one into a card programming device first. All results were to be logged automatically on a PC. The solution The first step in the design of the test rig was to use Workspace to try out various layout ideas and compare the performance of different robots for the application. The robot, gas meter, card programmer, feeding mechanism and other components were all modelled using the simulation's integrated CAD system. then, several different industrial robots were placed in the Workspace computer model and tested. The most appropriate layout was quickly found by comparing the times for one complete test cycle. After evaluation on the simulator, an Alpha2 robot was chosen as the ideal robot. The robot was subsequently purchased and the test rig was built. British Gas' financial justification for Workspace Simulation using Workspace enabled different robots to be evaluated for the task before purchase. The test rig was built on a "right first time" basis. Workspace prevented costly mistakes during the development of the project. 1993 Robot Simulations Ltd.C.G.Ariss [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

They are based in Hertfordshire, England and have large research laboratories there. Their BioEngineering unit is engaged in research to develop automated systems in support of innovative laboratory procedures to improve effectiveness, quality, safety and productivity in development of ethical pharmaceuticals. The challenge Skilled laboratory staff currently spend 25% of their time performing the tedious and repetitive job of accessing the company's large reference collection of pharmaceutical compounds. Installing an automated storage and retrieval system would free those laboratory staff to concentrate on other work. Before an installation can take place, the design under consideration must be "proven" to work. The conventional approach for Glaxo is to take drawings of the design and use them to build "non-functional" models whose sole purpose is to illustrate the design concept. The next stage is to build a moving "proof of principle" model with which to investigate the functional capability of the system. Speed of development is a key issue, and Glaxo purchased Workspace to provide additional capability to their design department. The solution Glaxo's proposed solution is to install a completely new design of robotic storage and retrieval system. The arrangement was modelled on Workspace and moving devices simulated. Workspace enabled the BioEngineering department to check that the design achieved its specification. In addition, estimates of retrieval times were automatically calculated to judge the efficiency of the system. Using Workspace, the model can be changed effortlessly to experiment with alternative layouts. A moving animation of the design clearly communicated the concept to management and end users, promoting informed discussion and leading to the system's optimisation, acceptance and approval. The future Mike Duncan of Glaxo Group Research stated that, in future Workspace will be used as follows:- "Illustrate the proposed arrangements of automated systems; it will offer, in addition, the opportunity to experiment quickly and cheaply with alternative layouts." "Ensure that the physical layout of the system does not clash with the surrounding environment and related equipment either at rest or at any point in its operational cycle." "Optimise the functional design and operational procedure of the system during development to ensure that the first-off, which may be the only example, requires little or no modification to achieve the standard of structural integrity and behavioural refinement required for performance critical applications in a sophisticated science-oriented environment." "Workspace will reduce the need to build models and will provide a basis for 'right-first-time' development of special purpose laboratory automation." Glaxo's financial justification for Workspace Faster accomplishment of automation projects. Reduced requirement for rectification during system development prior to commissioning. Reduced requirement for physical models during the planning, design and development programme. 1993 Robot Simulations Ltd.

They specialise in the fabrication and installation of heavy steel structures, cranes and pressure vessels. They manufacture in the region of 24,000 tonnes of steel structures per year and have over 1800 employees. The challenge Cimtas arc weld large I-beams on their production line and have recently purchased both Fanuc Arcmate and REIS SRV12L robots to form part of their manufacturing system. fig.1fig.2 The I-beams are placed on a rotating table mechanism (D) which may be positioned manually along a linear track (C). by an operator (See fig.1). Once the beam is in place, the rotating overhead mechanism (A) swings the robot across into the appropriate position to start welding. Height of the robot above the floor may be adjusted manually at B. Before using Workspace, the robot program was generated entirely by using the teach pendant on the shop floor. Since 9 axes are used, it can be difficult for the operator to visualise all possible configurations. Due to the size of the I-beams, Cimtas have encountered many problems in getting the robots to achieve satisfactory welds without exceeding a robot joint limit or having the welding tool collide with the workpiece. It is possible to move the robot up and down along the vertical track B, but only by unbolting it and winching it into position. This makes it difficult to experiment with different heights above the floor. Project aims To experiment with different robot and table configurations to maximise the work envelope. To minimise the possibility of a collision when the robot re-orients itself during its task. To improve safety for the human operator. To reduce the need for teach pendant programming. To optimise the robot program and reduce cycle time. The solution A model of the workcell was created with Workspace and the SRV12L and Arcmate were compared for reachability. The Workspace facility to plot the working envelope was used to position the work piece optimally. It was immediately found that in this application, the Reis SRV12L robot allowed a greater working envelope, so this robot was chosen in place of the Arcmate for the workcell. By using Workspace it was possible to make the vertical track B a translational joint on the rotating column A. This allowed the height of the robot to be optimised by simply changing a variable in the simulation. Work then began on developing a set of teach points which the robot could follow without hitting a joint limit or colliding with the workpiece. It was found that repositioning the column A between welds enabled several particularly difficult moves to be achieved. Previously, Cimtas had simply placed the mechanism so that it was at right angles to the linear track C for the duration of the cycle. Collisions tended to arise if the robot was forced to reorient the wrist during a linear move along a welding seam. The simulation highlights any collisions and allows the user to abandon a move and immediately try another approach. Cimtas' financial justification for Workspace A complete set of teach points to perform the task was generated. These teach points were later used directly in a new program generated on Cimtas' text-based off line programming system. Time to develop the new program was reduced by over 40%. Development of the new program was achieved off-line while the robot was operating. A technical decision was made to use only Reis robots for the larger workpieces in Cimtas's manufacturing workcell. The risk of damage to personnel and equipment was eliminated. 1993 Robot Simulations Ltd.C.G.Ariss [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

The course has been developed to address the need for graduate engineers with a good knowledge of automated manufacturing systems. The challenge An essential theme in the course is that of practical "hands-on" experience of robots. The University currently has eleven small educational robots and an industrial ABB IRB1000. To date, students have had to work in teams, having access to the robots only during laboratory sessions. Clearly more industrial robots had to be made available to provide students with the necessary access to modern robotic hardware. An ideal solution would be to provide each student with their own robot, which they could use at any time in complete safety. The prohibitive cost of industrial robots is only the first barrier to the undertaking of such a course. Student safety is also a prime consideration. Additional staff would be needed to supervise laboratory sessions and access at other times would be impossible. The solution Combining practical laboratory sessions with Workspace provided the answer. The simulation system is now used as the foundations for all robotic modules on the course. Students may use Workspace to load a model of an industrial robot, create a workcell using the integrated CAD system and write robot programs. This can be done at any time of the day using one of the University's PCs. Students may even construct their own mechanisms in Workspace and experiment with different controller parameters, plotting graphs to show the effect on robot dynamics. Simulated robotic projects can be developed in complete safety. In addition, the newly introduced Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) features in Workspace have enabled the creation of interactive training exercises by course tutors. The University now intends to start an active Workspace users group which will pool CAL material world-wide from a wide range of institutions. Benefits Savings on robotic hardware allowed more students to enrol Use of simulation software made the course more attractive to prospective students Safety problems were overcome Students could apply newly learnt principles outside of laboratory sessions The University's financial justification for Workspace Establishment of the course would not have been possible without a simulation system Workspace provides the best possible price/performance ratio Academic staff were free to concentrate on teaching rather than safety supervision 1993 Robot Simulations Ltd.C.G.Ariss [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

Their production line is highly automated, using robots to improve quality in the construction of large, steel components. The challenge Komatsu needed to build a new workcell for a component that previously had to be welded by hand. The component has a number of difficult seams to weld, requiring the welding torch to fit into a confined space. The component is approximately 2m long and is constructed using steel plate. The welding seams must lie horizontally with the welding torch making an angle of 45 degrees between adjacent faces. The torch moves at about 15cm per minute, so the part must be positioned carefully for a good weld. The weld illustrated as A-B in the diagram opposite is a particularly difficult one since the welding torch must fit between two plates to get to the seam. Project Aims Weld at least 80% of the seams by robot Design and evaluate an appropriate positioning device Evaluate the robot's welding torch design Test for collisions The solution The Komatsu robot (KHY660) was modelled on Workspace and the component was imported in the form of a DXF file. Once this was done a model of a positioner was created. Originally, a positioner with 3 axes was to be built especially for this task. However, since this was expensive, Komatsu wished to evaluate a spare positioner they had at the plant. This NEI Thompson 2-axis positioner was left over from a previous job but did not appear to offer the same flexibility as the original positioner design. Workspace was used to test whether this positioner could place the component correctly for all welding seams. Here is a diagram of the final proposed workcell:- (Note that the clamps used to secure the part to the positioner are not shown.) The robot work envelope is shown hatched in the diagram to the right and the torch is shown on the weld A-B. On attempting to "weld" the part, Workspace demonstrated that part of the robot tool would collide with the component in the proposed layout. By interactively changing the positioner joint angles it was discovered that there was one position where the tool could perform the weld without collisions. The new design (using the 2-axis positioner) was proved to be more effective than the original proposal. All welds were found to be within reach, although the welding torch length was to be reduced to provide adequate clearance along seam A-B. The 2-axis positioner exceeded expectations, since it was also capable of carrying a different component for another task within the same workcell setup. Komatsu's financial justification for Workspace By recycling an unused positioner, cost savings in excess of �60,000 were made. Time to develop the system was significantly reduced. Komatsu kept full control over the design process. 1994 Robot Simulations Ltd.C.G.Ariss [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

What is Workspace®? Workspace is a sophisticated 3D graphical simulation software system for robotics and mechanisms. Running on a PC, Workspace offers features previously found only on high specification graphics workstations. It is a productivity tool designed to make the implementation of advanced manufacturing systems as simple and economical as possible. Why Simulation? Automation system are increasing in complexity to a level where industry requires sophisticated tools to assist in the design and implementation of the manufacturing process. Visualising how a multiple-axis device will move in 3D space is a difficult task, especially when such factors such as reachability, collision detection and avoidance, cycle times and production levels have to be taken into consideration. Workspace can increase your productivity and reduce system down-time. System programming, before robot installation can take place or while an existing workcell is in operation. Complex layouts can be tested in complete safety either in an office environment or on the shop floor. Simulation highlights potential problems before they happen, allowing quick and easy modifications. The New Design concept 3D Simulation has revolutionised the ways that engineers can work. Workspace lets you add equipment to a workcell, delete or move objects for the most complex of robotics applications, reducing development time and ensuring a complete solution. Is Workspace easy to learn? The user interface has been designed with clarity, simplicity and ease of use in mind. The system uses menus and windows driven by either keyboard or mouse. Related commands are grouped together to make them easy to find. Context sensitive help minimises the need to refer continuously to the manuals. However: a large format manual in the form of a reference manual, user guide and guided tour is supplied. The friendly nature of the Workspace's operation is reflected in the number of Educational and Training establishment around the world who are already using the system.

This feature allows robots to be operated remotely, with the operator using Workspace to view the current robot status. The user first creates a model of the real work-cell using the Workspace CAD system (IGES/DXF data can be imported if so desired). The robot models they require to build this virtual world can be selected from a library of over 140 robots (they can alternatively create their own robots). Data from the real world is accessed via a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL). The user has access to the source code which creates the DLL and they insert their own software modules into the DLL to bring external data into the PC. This external data could for example, be joint encoder data from a real robot describing the positions of robot joints or robot auxiliary axes within the real work-cell. The code interface to the DLL from Workspace allows up to 9 robot models or mechanisms to be controlled by external data. When the telelmanipulation option is set in motion Workspace passes into the DLL either a robot's current position, a robot's current joint angles or a robot's current gripper status. This data is combined with the external data in a user definable way to provide a set of demanded positions (or joint angles) which are then passed back into Workspace for the robot models to achieve. The viewing mode can be either wire-frame, hidden-line or solid-shade. With more complex viewing modes like solid-shade the refresh speed for the graphical display decreases. Wire-frame has the quickest refresh rate. To modify the DLL the user needs a software compiler capable of creating Workspace compatible DLLs. The code we supply to create the telemanipulation DLL is designed for use with Borland Pascal v7.0. DLLs can also be generated using C and we can supply C code for Borland C v4.0 to create compatible DLLs.

The applications include spot welding, arc welding, paint spraying, material handling, sealant, laser cutting, water jet and deburring. Once the geometry path has been created and saved with the model the user can issue a Follow GP path command to automatically create and simulate the robot programme in whatever robot language is currently selected. Tool graphics have been designed to simulate each tool action. Many new robot languages are now available as options for Workspace including: ABB Rapid, Yaskawa/Motoman Inform1 and Inform2, Sankyo and IBM AML2, PSI. The commands for editing GP paths have been improved, as have the commands for editing geometry points, editing several geometry points at once (multiple GPs), and editing teachpoints. The commands for editing several geometry points should save the user some time over the old GP edit methods. Many of the new commands for editing teachpoints are useful in reverse engineering and re-engineering workcells, and for last minute touch-ups of robot programs during offline programming. The user-interface and the efficiency of the robot and tool calibration have been improved, while the Robotrak setup procedures have been altered to increase their reliability even when used by inexperienced users. In general, the changes in 3.5 reflect the past few years' accumulated experience from both within RSL and close contact with industrial customers of simulating and offline programming complex workcells using Workspace and Robotrak These features now give the customer an affordable, user friendly tool to carry out the most complex of tasks at shop floor level with confidence. New and changed commands MODEL MENU 1. Load object into model: when a model has been selected the objects displayed will be only those with no parents. 2. Set project directory : now sets the Ready for robot directory to projectdir/ROBOT. 3. Make directory : copies a file to a path (which is relative to the WS3 directory). CREATE MENU Create GPs submenu 1. The Create Gps on polyline submenu now has the additional command Between two polylines which creates GPs along the current polyline in the direction of the nearest point on the other polyline. This is useful if the GPs are being defined on part whose geometry is represented by two parallel polylines. 2. Create Gps over entire polyline and Create Gps over entire surface boundary: the commands on these menus work in a similar way to the Create GPs on polyline and the Create Gps over surface boundary except that by default the first GP is at the beginnings of the polyline and the second GP is at the end of the polyline. 3. Align axes with tangent: when this flag is on then when GPs are created along a polyline or a surface boundary their default position has the normal vector normal to the tangent (as was the case in Workspace 3.4), whereas when the flag is off the normal vector of the GPs is not normal to the tangent. 4.Create exact GP path on polyline: this is the Exact GP path command renamed. LAYOUT MENU Edit object submenu 1. Information: colour, view, and non-joint axes added. Edit robot submenu 1. Approach vector: moved from Options menu - now saved with the robot model. Used to decide orientation when creating GPs relative to an object feature. Edit tools submenu 1. Attach tool: moves the current object so that its base frame coincides with the coordinate frame of the end link of the robot. A base frame may be defined for an object using the Add tool base frame command. 2. Load and attach tool: same as attach tool except that it also loads the tool object from a model file. Loads an object and then positions the object so that its base frame coincides with the coordinate frame of the end link of the robot. A base frame may be defined for an object using the Add tool base frame command. The user can create models containing tools as a library for this command. To create a library of tools simply create a model containing all the tools and then save the model. 3. Dispose of tool: allows the user to select and delete one of the objects (and its descendants) attached to the end link of the robot. 4. Add tool base frame: adds a coordinate frame to the current object. This may be edited using the Move axes and Turn axes commands (on the Edit joint menu). The frame is used when automatically positioning a tool on the end of the robot (see Attach tool). 5. Gripper of interest: specify which of several grippers on a robot is being referred to. when setting gripper parameters on this menu. 6. Time to open gripper: sets the time taken to open or close the gripper of interest during a simulation. 6. Spot weld gun of interest: specify which of several spot weld guns on a robot is being referred to when setting gun parameters on this menu. 7. Spot weld duration: set the duration of a spot weld (when the gun is closed) by the gun of interest during a simulation. 8. Gun closed to semi-open time: set the time taken for the spot weld gun of interest to go from closed to semi-open during a simulation. 9. Gun semi-open to open time: set the time taken for the spot weld gun of interest to go from semi-open to full open during a simulation. Edit current pointer/Edit geometry point/Edit teachpoint submenus 1. Move/Turn CP/TP/GP: Several commands have been renamed so that phrase approach vector is used instead of z-axis:- Move along approach vector, Approach vector up, Approach vector down, Reverse approach vector, Approach vector away from base, Drag approach vector. Edit geometry point submenu Some options have been moved onto the Edit multiple GP submenu. Edit multiple geometry points submenu Almost all the commands on this menu operate on a group of GPs selected using the multiple object selection side bar. 1. Create Tps from Gps submenu (contains Create TPs from multiple GPs, Create Tps from all GPs). 2. Change Gps approach vector: changes the approach vector for the selected GPs. Options are Arla to TP (converts GPs created in the ARLA language assuming an x-axis approach vector into GPs suitable for use in the TP language where a z-axis approach vector is assumed) and TP to Arla These options may be used with other languages which have similar approach vectors to TP and Arla. 3. Remove tool from GPs: removes the current tool frame from the GPs. This is useful if the GPs were created from teachpoints using an active tool frame but the user wishes to view the GPs as though they were representing the position of the faceplate of the robot at each teachpoint. (see also Add tool to GPs). 4. Add tool to Gps: removes the current tool frame from the GPs. This is useful if the GPs were created from teachpoints using a nil tool frame so that they represent the position of the faceplate of the robot, but the user wishes to view the GPs as though they were representing the position of the end of the robot tool at each teachpoint. (see also Remove tool from GPs). 5. Turn GPs about own x-axis: turn all the GPs about their own x-axis. 6. Turn GPs about own y-axis: turn all the GPs about their own y-axis. 7. Turn GPs about own z-axis: turn all the GPs about their own z-axis. 8. Autoturn GPs about approach vector:attempts to find a suitable angle to turn all the GPs about their approach vector such that all the GPs become achievable by the current robot, then performs the turn. Edit teachpoint submenu Some options have been moved onto the Edit all teachpoints submenu. 1. Autoturn TP about approach vector: allows the user to interactively turn the teachpoint about its approach vector, showing as it is turned the position of the robot with its tool moved to the teachpoint. Edit all teachpoints submenu 1. Create Gps from all TPs: creates a geometry point for each teachpoint. If the user wishes then the GPs may also store the teachpoint configuration, or if auxiliary axes are present the GPs may store the auxiliary axes positions. 2. Reflect all TPs using joints: reflects all the teachpoints by adjusting the joint angles. Joint angles 1, 4, and 6 are reversed for each teachpoint. The effect of this on most revolute robots is to reflect the coordinate frames of each teachpoint through a plane passing through joint 1 and its zero position. By reflecting in this way instead of reflecting the coordinate frames of the teachpoints the user ensures that the reflected teachpoints also reflect the robot configurations of the original points. The user is prompted for the name of the robot onto which the new teachpoint file is to be reflected. 3. Adjust all TPs for different TCP: removes the current tool frame from the teachpoints (so that they represent the position of the faceplate of the robot) and adds in a tool frame selected by the user (so that the teachpoints now represent the position of the end of the new robot tool). 4. Turn all TPs about approach vector: turns all the teachpoints about their approach vectors. 5. Move all TPs: moves all the teachpoints through an x,y,z offset relative to the base frame of the robot. 6. Move all TPs using 1 point shift: moves all the teachpoints through a transform defined by the desired position and the old position of a teachpoint. The user first teaches a teachpoint on the robot to represent the desired position of a teachpoint, saves this in the same file as the old teachpoints, brings the file to Workspace, then issues the command and selects the new teachpoint and the old teachpoint. 7. Adjust all TPs for bent tool: changes the tcp value (while adjusting the teachpoints so that the position of the faceplate of the robot at each point does not change) using a transform defined by the desired position and old position of a teachpoint. The user first teaches a teachpoint on the robot to represent the desired position of a teachpoint with the bent or changed tool, saves this in the same file as the old teachpoints, brings the file to Workspace, then issues the command and selects the new teachpoint and the old teachpoint. Edit GP path submenu 1.GP path application: sets the application for which the user is using the GP path. The Edit GP path as menu will only allow the user to select Tool actions which are appropriate for the application. Possible applications are waterjet, spot welding, arc welding, paint spraying, material handling, sealant, laser cutting, and deburring. The user may change the application at any time and then start selecting tool states for the new application. 2. Edit current GP as menu: allows the user to change the properties of a particular node on a GP path, the node being the one containing the current GP object. Each node contains a GP object, various motion properties used to approach that GP from the previous GP node, various actions (including tool actions) which are to be implemented once the robot reaches the GP. The properties of a GP node are described in more detail below: GP object name - name of a geometry point object; Motion type - the type of motion (joint, circular, or linear); Termination type - the type of termination at the point expressed as a percentage (0 indicates stop at the point, 100 indicates move through or near the point without stopping); Velocity - percentage of the maximum velocity to use when moving towards the GP; Acceleration - percentage of the maximum acceleration to use when moving towards the GP; P>Wait time - time for the robot to wait (be stationary) after reaching the GP; Routine to call - the name of a routine which is to be called once the GP is reached; Signal - the type of signal ling to do once the GP is reached - options are No signal, EnterInterferenceZone (wait for a signal from another robot saying that the other robot has left a zone of interference, then once it is received send a signal to the other robot saying that it has entered the zone of intereference), LeaveInterferenceZone (send a signal to another robot saying that it has left a zone of interference). Note that interference zones in this context do not need to have their physical bounds described but are defined by when on the GP path the signals are sent; Tool action - the tool action to be performed after the robot reaches the GP. Possible values are defined by the application (see GP path application) but examples are ArcOn and ArcOff (for arc welding) and PaintSprayOn and PaintSprayOff (for paint spraying). Different tool graphics are displayed during a simulation of the robot following the GP path as each action is executed. 3. Edit current GP path as menu: performs the same task as Edit current GP as menu except that it brings up all the GPs on the path at once. 4. Edit GP path as text: Allows the user to edit a GP path as though it were a text file. Note that the GP path is really an object which is saved with the model in the model file. When the user uses the Edit GP path as text command Workspace converts the path into a text file temporarily, then converts it back from a text file to a GP object when the user exits from the edit. Parts of GP paths may be easily cut and pasted between different GP paths using the text edit commands (control-k b to mark the beginning of a block, control-k k to mark the end of a block, control-k w to write a block to a file, control-k r to read a block from a file). 5. Append GP path: appends a GP path to the current GP path. 6. Break GP path before GP: Breaks a GP path just before the current GP. 7. Reverse GP path: reverses the current GP path. 8. Insert GP at start: inserts a GP at the start of the current GP path. 9. Insert GP after current GP: inserts a GP into a GP path just after the current GP. 10. Delete GP: Deletes a GP node from the current GP path (note that the GP is only deleted from the GP path - the GP object itself is not deleted). 11. Move GP to start of path: moves a GP node to the beginnings of the current GP path. 12. Move GP to after current GP: moves a GP to after the current GP in the GP path. 13. Scale all speeds: scales the speeds of all the GP nodes in the current path using a scaling factor. A scaling factor of 1 indicates no change. 14. Change all termination types: sets the termination types for all the GP nodes on the current GP path to a value entered by the user. A termination type of 0 indicates that the robot is to stop at all the points, while a termination type of 100 indicates that the robot is to move through or near all the points without stopping. 15. Change all motion types: changes the motion type (joint, linear or circular) for all the GP nodes on the current GP path to a new setting. 16. Remove all tool action: removes all the tool actions from a GP path (e.g. ArcOn, ArcOff). Simulate menu 1. Replay track and create geometry path: replays a track while creating a geometry path which represents the movement of the robot during the track and any tool actions during the track. This command may be used to create geometry paths from a robot program written in one robot language which is then converted using the Follow GP path command into a robot program written in another robot language. 2. Replay track and record sweep: replays a track while creating lines to represent the sweep of the tool attached to the end of the robot as the robot moves. Enables the user to quickly see if the tool interferes with any fixtures. 3. Send to robot and receive from robot have been implemented for a wider range of robots. Note that the Calibration filter is used only when converting between GPs and TPs (e.g. when GPs are converted to TPs during a Send to robot), or when using the Recalibrate tool or Calibrate model submenu commands. The calibration filter is not used on teachpoints which are Sent to robot or Received from robot under any other circumstances. 4. Edit any file: allows the user to edit any text file. Options menu 1. The Paintshade option has been removed. Shade should be used instead. Picture submenu 1. Hiddenline mode: Full indicates that the hiddenline removal will still be rigorous even when the user zooms in or out on a workcell, whereas Clipped means that hiddenline removal is not performed for objects which are completely off the screen. Clipped may be slightly faster than Full for large and complex workcells but if Clipped is on and the user zooms out then the picture of the workcell may no longer have the outer hidden lines removed correctly. Robot options submenu 1. Autoplace robot using TPs: attempts to find a suitable position to place the robot that will allow all the teachpoints to be achievable. The search is conducted in the plane parallel to the screen which passes through the current pointer. During the search a cross is drawn at each position which would be suitable for placing the robot, and at the end of the search the user has the option of placing the robot at a suitable position. 2. Autoplace robot using multiple GPs: works in a similar way to the Autoplace robot using TPs command except that the search is for a position for placing the robot that will make the selected geometry points achievable. 3. Label current robot: when this flag is on then the current robot will be labelled on the screen with its name. This is useful when working with several robots in one workcell. 4. Robot tool path: when this flag is on then the path taken during an arc-weld or a laser cut or a water jet cut will be displayed as a series of lines. TP and GP option submenu 1. Geometry path display: when this flag is on then geometry paths will be displayed as a dotted line between geometry points with arrows indicating the direction of movement along the geometry path. Calibrate robot submenu The Calibrate robot submenus have been reorganised so that the user can follow step by step what to do next during a calibration. After each step in the setup Workspace checks that the encoder units have returned to zero and that the repeatability has not degraded. 1. The Robotrak setup menu has been reorganised as follows (note that some commands have been moved to the Robotrak special options submenu): Exact length of bar: Set all zero positions: Check repeatabilities: it is important to check that when the cords are pulled away from the Robotrak units then returned to their zero position that the repeatability of the zero reading is good. This command displays the readings for all three encoders on the screen so that the user can pull each cord out (at least 2m) then return the cord to its zero (for at least 0.5 of a second) until the colour of the reading changes from red to black and a beep is heard (indicating that three successive zero readings were within three encoder counts of each other). If there are three people available to do the set up then all three cords can be checked for repeatability at once. Set encoder bar length (timed): This sets the encoder bar length for each bar in turn. The user has 15 seconds from the issue of this command to place the bar on encoder unit 1. After 15 seconds a reading is taken. The user then has 15 seconds to prepare for a reading from encoder unit 2, and a further 15 seconds to prepare for the reading from encoder unit 3. The command is structured this way so that one person can set up Robotrak without assistance. Set distance between bases: The user can either set the distance between the bases one at a time as in Workspace 3.4, or set the distances between all three bases all at once (not recommended for accurate work because the sharp angles of the cords can degrade the repeatability of the measurements and setting all distances at once forces the user to pull the cord over sharp angles). Length of top part of cord 1: Length of top part of cord 2: Length of top part of cord 3: Continuous cord reading: Continuous measurement reading: Auto-setup: auto-setup runs through all the above commands one at a time in succession without the user having to select the command. 2. Check teachpoints suitable: checks that the current teachpoint file contains teachpoints which provide an adequate range of joint values for each joint to ensure a good calibration (the joint 4 wrist must be flipped for a good calibration), and that the teachpoints are not too close to the plane of Robotrak since that would degrade the accuracy of the measurements. 3. Auto-record Robotrak measurements: 4. Extract errors from measurements: 5. The new Robotrak special options submenu is organised as follows: Card base address: Card version: Record Robotrak measurements: Test calibrated robot: Test using box: Calibrate tool z-axis: Calibrate tool x-axis: Record trajectory: Turn Robotrak display off: Calibrated robot: XYZ teachpoint filter: Parameters to calibrate: 1. At least four teachpoints are now recommended when recalibrating a tool (instead of 3 which were recommended in 3.4). Pendant menu Joint zero: sets all the joints of the current robot or mechanism to their zero position. Other Changes 1. The cycles times obtained with Fanuc robots are now more accurate than before since they use the same trajectory generation algorithms that are used on Fanuc controllers. The accuracy of the cycle times for other robot languages should also be improved. 2. The tool actions described under Geometry Paths are also available from the action menu. 3. The Workspace signaldef input directive can now take just a robotname as a parameter (though the old signaldef command which took the parameters trackname and external track signal number is still valid). The Workspace signaldef output directive is no longer required, but would still be valid is used. 4. The multiple object selection sidebar which is used with many commands contains a new option: Path. When this is selected then the user chooses a name of a geometry point path and all the geometry points on that path are selected. 5. The Weldpos and Deburrpos functions are now available for use in a Joint expression. They work in a similar way to the Grippos function. The Weldpos varies from 0 to 100 as a spot weld gun goes from full-open to closed, while the deburr function varies 0 to 360 and then returns to zero and repeats all the time that deburring is on. 6. Macros may now be created using the programme structure and variables of the Karel2 language. Create a macro by starting a track and then issuing commands from several other menus. As each command is issued it is stored in the track, and if the track is replayed then the commands are executed from the track. Not all the commands on the menus are available for use in Macros at present. [ Return to Home Page ] Workspace and Robotrak are registered trademarks of Robot Simulations Ltd.

A typical repeatability is about 0.1mm while a typical world accuracy is of the order of 10mm or worse. This is not a problem when programming a robot on-line using a hand-held teach-pendant and the human eye. Here it is only repeatability that is an issue. However, when programming a robot using some off-line system to generate the robot locations numerically the accuracy of the robot becomes all important. In theory, it is possible to improve the accuracy so that it is as good as the repeatability. The reason that the accuracy of robots is so bad is because there are manufacturing tolerances involved in the production of each robot that are not taken into account within the robot controller. Each robot therefore has its own individual 'signature'. The most significant sources of error are discrepancies in the robot link lengths, in the zero position of each joint, in the alignment of joint axes, and in the joint compliance (a torsional spring effect dur to the effect of the weight of the payload on the gear transmission). These errors together can account for more than 95% of the overall positional error. What is required is a system that will take measurements of the xyz position of the robot's end effector, compare this with the robot's own estimate of its position, and thereby find estimates for these errors and model these errors to improve the accuracy obtained when off-line programming the robot. An overview of Robotrak Robotrak is an optional measuring system for Workspace that is used to calibrate the robot. It is capable of measuring static positions or motion paths to an accuracy greater than 0.2mm in three dimensions. The Robotrak 3D measurement system One person can set up Robotrak and perform a calibration within 30 minutes. Compared to other calibration systems Robotrak is simple, rugged, and extremely cost-effective. The ability of Workspace to calculate the correct position and orientation of the Robotrak measuring units relative to the robot as part of the calibration means that Robotrak may be mounted at any unknown position in the workcell. The Robotrak measuring system consists of the following:- Three Encoder Measuring Units incorporating 2500 pulses per revolution quadrature encoders. Please note that because each encoder unit contains fragile precision components it should not be dropped or treated roughly. Three Calibration Fixtures (machined brass fork and steel locating plate assembly used for accurately setting the cord exit point on the measuring unit). A Robot Tool Flange Attachment Assembly for connection to the robot under test. A 'Standard Length' Calibration Bar for accurately setting the encoder counts per millimetre. An Encoder Interface Card for linking the Robotrak hardware to an IBM compatible PC. Cables and connectors for use with above items. A menu within Workspace used for setting up Robotrak, recording measurements, and performing robot calibration. The Encoder Measuring Unit Internal View Of Encoder Measuring Unit Robot Tool Flange Attachment Assembly Calibration Fixture Calibration Bar The three encoder units are placed at the corners of an approximately equilateral triangle within the robot workcell. They may be mounted on the ground, on the ceiling, on a wall, or even on a fixture. They should be roughly 2 metres apart from each other, and must be fixed so that they will not move during the calibration. A small, constant, restoring force is applied by each encoder unit to the measurement cord. As each Dynema cord is extended from the encoder unit a drum rotates and an encoder measures the rotation of the drum, thereby measuring the extension of the cord. A constant torque is applied to the drum by means of a torsional spring, thus tensioning the cord. The encoder counts, representing cord extension are passed to Workspace through the encoder interface card, which must be installed in the PC running Workspace. The calibration bar is used during the setting up of Robotrak to determine the scaling factor of encoder counts to the cord extension in millimetres. Once calibrated the Robotrak measuring units themselves then provide a convenient way of measuring the relative distance between each other. This is done by extending the cord from one unit to the next and accurately locating the cord attachment fitting in the calibration fixture of the next measuring unit: thus determining the distance between the two units. This procedure is repeated for all three units in turn operating in an anticlockwise direction. When the set-up is complete, the robot may be calibrated. All three cords are fixed at a single point on the end of the robot tool or faceplate using the robot tool flange attachment assembly. By monitoring the extension of the cords Workspace can calculate the xyz position of the end of the robot tool, either when the robot is stationary or when it is moving. An overview of the Workspace calibration software Workspace makes extensive use of the Robotrak measuring system for calibration. Robotrak is part of the Workspace system, and is used to calibrate robots prior to off-line programming. The software for the calibration is an integral part of Workspace and all the calibration options are available from Workspace menus. The main advantages to the user of a calibration system integrated with the simulation system are that the user interface is greatly simplified and that the price is low compared with discrete calibration and simulation systems. This is the first time that such close integration has been achieved. Robot simulation, calibration, and off-line programming may therefore be seen as a seamless process, in which robot programmes may be transferred to and from each stage with out any problem as is often required during the cell design process. Errors which may be detected and modelled by Workspace and Robotrak include: The zero position of each joint (the position of the joint where the value of the joint variable is 0), The length of each link and the distance offset at each link, The orientation of each joint axis, The compliance at each joint (each joint may be modelled as a torsional spring due to the compliance in the gearing and transmission for the joint), The xyz tool offset from the mounting plate to the end of the tool and the tool axis orientation, The position and orientation of the measuring system co-ordinate frame relative to the robot base co-ordinate frame. Workspace extracts these errors from the physical measurements made by Robotrak and the teachpoints reported by the robot by trying to find a robot model that would best fit the measured characteristics. The Workspace kinematic model of the robot is then modified accordingly. Points generated within Workspace during the course of a simulation are then passed through a filter which alters the points in such a way that the uncalibrated real robot will be fooled in to moving to the point we really wanted it to move to by asking it to move to another, slightly different point. It is necessary to work this way since the real robot can have no knowledge of its physical inadequacies. With Robotrak measuring points to an absolute accuracy of 0.2mm it is possible to obtain results from the calibration such that the accuracy of an industrial robot such as the ABB IRB6000 during off-line programming is improved from 10 to 20 mm to better than 1mm. Note that Robotrak may also be used for measuring the position of the robot while it is moving along a path, for the purpose of checking the accuracy of paths generated on the robot controller. These paths may then be automatically displayed in 3D using Workspace and compared with that generated during a simulation; thus giving a dynamic assessment capability. The Calibration Filter It is important to understand when and how the calibration filters are used. Otherwise confusion will arise as to the correctness of any display. Teachpoints that are displayed on the screen are always unfiltered. The only situations where teachpoints pass through the filter are shown below. The output filter is used when preparing points generated in the simulation for the robot in the following situations:- During a Send to robot command when the track contains geometry points which are being automatically converted to teachpoints; Writing a position in a Jetware VR file at any time; Converting a geometry point to a teachpoint using the Layout menu. The input filter (which works in the opposite way to the output filter) is used as follows:- During a Calibrate model menu command when three Datum teachpoints are imported from the robot into the simulation. During a Recalibrate tool menu command when four teachpoints are imported from the robot into the simulation. Reading a position from a Jetware VR file at any time. Converting a teachpoint to a geometry point using the Layout menu. Installing the Robotrak interface card Before using Robotrak, the encoder interface card will need to be installed in the PC. First of all, the PC must be disconnected from the mains and its cover removed. From above, the computer should look something like this. PC motherboard The encoder interface board is a half-length 8-bit card. To install it, an available 8-bit or 16-bit slot must be found in the PC. Installing the card The blanking plate for the slot should be removed from the case of the PC, keeping the securing screw in a safe place. The interface card should be aligned with the slot and pressed down until it is fully home. The securing screw should be replaced so that the interface card is fixed into the PC. Once the card is installed, the PC must be moved to a suitable position outside of the robot's envelope ready to connect up the encoder units. WARNING! It is important that the tension in the cords from the encoder units is maintained at all times. This is so that the cord will always wrap tightly around the drum. If the tension is not maintained the repeatability of Robotrak will be degraded. Therefore the cords should be moved slowly (at the speed of 'walking on the moon') when moving them towards the encoder unit.Always return the cords to the encoder units slowly. Installing the encoder units Now you can install the encoder units in the workcell, near the robot. Place the encoder units at the corners of an approximate equilateral triangle whose sides are roughly 2m in length. Bear in mind that when taking robot measurements using Robotrak the measured points should not be too close to the plane containing the encoder units, and that very large variations in the extension of one cord compared to the other cords should be avoided. This should help you decide the optimum positions for the encoder units relative to the working volume of the robot. Note that the encoders do not need to be mounted on the floor. The only configuration you must not use is to have the three encoder units in a line. Also, there must be a clear line of sight from one encoder unit to the next so that it is possible to use the cords to measure the distance between the units. The precise position of the encoders relative to the robot does not need to be known since this is calculated as part of the calibration process. This flexibility of positioning Robotrak within the workcell is one of the great advantages of this system. When you have secured the encoder units, use the electrical cables supplied with them to connect the encoders to the interface card on the PC. Each plug is marked with the encoder units number, this should be inserted into the correspondingly marked port on the interface card. N.B. Care should be taken not to accidentally connect the 15 way 'density and a half' D-type plug from a VGA monitor into one of the input channels of the interface card as damage may result. WARNING! Whenever pulling a cord away from its base always grasp it firmly so that it does not slip, since the tension in the torsional spring will cause the cord to shoot back towards its base at high speed. This can damage the Robotrak components. For a similar reason, the cords should be checked every now and then for signs of breaking. The Workspace Robotrak Setup menu This menu is used to setup Robotrak. Issue each command in turn from the top to the bottom of the menu. 1. Run Workspace and go to the Options/Calibrate Robot sub-menu. Pull down the Robotrak setup sub-menu. 2. Use the Exact length of bar command to enter the number in mm written on the side of the calibration bar. 3. The aluminium attachment fittings should be at rest on top of each of the three encoder measuring units. This is the zero position for the cord. Use the Set all zero positions command. Answer yes to the question 'Are all the cords in their bases?'. 4. The repeatability of Robotrak depends to some extent on the repeatability of its zero position, which can be improved by allowing the zero position to 'settle'. Use the Check repeatabilities command. The readings from the three encoders are displayed on the screen. Initially the numbers will be red. Pull a cord away from its base (at least two metres) and then return the cord to the base and leave in the base for at least half a second. An audible click will be heard from the computer. If you do not hear a click then pull the cord out further. Do not pull the cord out too far - always leave a few winds of the cord on the drum (remove the cover of the encoder unit to see the drum if you are not sure). Repeat this until the displayed reading for the encoder turns from black to red. This will only happen after three consecutive zero readings for the cord have been with three encoder counts of each other. Do this for all three cords (if there is more than one person available then the repeatability of all three cords can be checked at the same time by each parson working on one cord). Once all three encoder readings have changed from red to black then press escape to exit. The encoders will be zeroed again. 5. Now use the Set encoder length bar length for each base (timed). This command allows a single user to set each encoder bar length in turn in a single operation without assistance. When the command is called the user has 15 seconds to carefully place the wedge shaped end of the calibration bar flat against the cord exit point on the first encoder unit. The cord should then be drawn out and the base of the aluminium attachment fitting allowed to rest in the slot at the other end of the calibration bar. After 15 seconds a reading is taken and Workspace now calculates the scaling factor of encoder counts to length of extension in mm for that encoder unit. The user then has 15 seconds to repeat this operation for the second unit and a further 15 seconds for the third unit. 6. Use the Set distance for each base command. The use has the choice of finding the distances between all three bases one at a time or all together. It is recommended that the user finds the distances one at a time. Find the two specified encoder units (they must always be numbered anticlockwise looking in "Plan" from the robot down onto the Robotrak units). Take the calibration fixture (machined brass fork and steel locating plate) which has the same number as the second encoder unit. Insert the pin of the brass fitting into the plate if not already assembled. Insert the two locating pins from the steel plate into the top of the encoder unit near where the cord leaves the unit. Extend the cord from the first unit to the second encoder unit with the calibration fixture, and place in the calibration fixture. Press escape next base. Workspace now calculates the distance between the two units. Repeat for all three encoder units. 7. Use the Continous cord reading command to inspect the readings from each encoder unit and check that they are now working correctly. Connecting Robotrak to the robot Attach the robot tool flange attachment assembly to the robot tool flange (faceplate of the robot tool attachment point). This is usually done by means of four cap screws screwed into the robot tool flange. If the holes on your robot are not to the ISO Series 1 preferred sizes (e.g. Fanuc robots) then suitable holes will need to be drilled in the robot tool flange attachment assembly to align with these holes. The aluminium attachment fittings at the end of each cord coming from the encoder units should be screwed onto the corresponding attachments on the cords coming from the robot tool flange attachment assembly. Use a pair of calipers to measure the length from where the cord from the encoder unit enters the assembled aluminium attachment fittings to where cord from the robot enters the triple fitting on the robot tool flange attachment assembly. Enter the measured length of the top part of the cord in millimetres, after issuing the command Length of top part of cord 1. Repeat for cords 2 and 3. WARNING! When the Robotrak cords are connected to the robot the user should watch any robot movement to avoid the cords becoming entangled in the robot tool. The robot should always be moved slowly for this reason as well as to maintain the tension in the cords. Always move the robot slowly. Use the Continuous measurement reading command to display the xyz position of where the cords meet on the robot. Move the robot to check that this value changes as would be expected. The origin of the measurement system is at encoder unit 1, the x-axis is from unit 1 to unit 2. and the y-axis is at right angles to the x-axis in the plane of the 3 units, on the unit 3 side of the x-axis. The z-axis is perpendicular to the x,y plane and passes through the origin. The Robotrak Co-ordinate Frame Recording a set of calibration measurements Make a note of the tool frame, as well as the robot base frame as reported on the controller. The tool offset can be nil during calibration, or any value ( as long as that value is noted down). It is probably easiest if both the tool and the base frame are nil. The true physical tool offset values are parameters that will revealed as part of the calibration process. Teach 50 different positions and orientations throughout the robot's working envelope using the robot teach pendant. These positions and orientations should vary as widely as possible throughout the robot envelope. Remember always to move the robot slowly when the Robotrak cords are connected (see above warning). If creating a program to cycle through the positions a pause of at least one second should be inserted between subsequent moves (this is particularly important when using with the Auto-record feature of Workspace). Workspace can calibrate a robot with 25 positions, however more points give greater accuracy in the calibration. When teaching the points it is recommended that the plane of the end connector where the cords meet is kept at the same angle to the cords in all the recorded positions. Or to put it another way the average vector of the cords should be the same as the approach vector of the tool. So if all the cords are forming a roughly 30 degree angle to the vertical (a fairly extreme position) then the tool should be rotated so that the end of the connector is at 90 degrees to all the cords, or (imagining a two cord Robotrak) if one cord is roughly horizontal and the other is roughly vertical that the tool should be rotated so that the end of the connector is 45 degrees to both. Use the Check teachpoints suitable command to check the suitability of the teachpoints. There are two methods available within Workspace to take the readings from Robotrak. The Record Robotrak measurements command on the Robotrak special options menu requires input from the user when Workspace is required to take a measurement. The Auto-record Robotrak measurements command automatically senses when a reading should be taken, and is the recommended method. Write a robot programme to move to each teachpoint in turn, pausing at the point for at least a second. Start the robot program. Workspace will then take readings whenever the readings from Robotrak settle for 0.5 of a second. Pressing escape or a mouse button will terminate the process. The measurements are stored in a file with the extension EXT. Running the robot calibration software Load the model containing the robot that is to be calibrated into Workspace. Set the robot model tool frame and base frame to the same values as were noted from the robot controller. Use the Simulate/Simulate options/Teachpoint file option to select the teachpoint file that was used to record the measurement file. Use the Options/Calibrate using Robotrak/Extract errors from measurements command. This will compare the teachpoint file and the measurement file and find the errors in the robot structure and the relative position of Robotrak and the robot that would have created the values in the files. This should take about 30 seconds, depending on the speed of the PC. Interpreting the Calibration search data Several pages of data are generated during execution of the Extract errors from measurements command. PAGE 1 The search to find errors in the robot model has two stages: searching for the approximate position and orientation of the measuring system and the approximate physical tool offset, then searching for all kinematic and compliance errors (this final stage also finds the exact position and orientation of the measuring system and the exact physical tool offset). The first stage is necessary to find good initial values for some of the variables that we are seeking in the final stage. Good initial values ensure that the search finds the correct local minimum. During each stage the following lines are displayed: Stage: (the current stage of the search) Iteration: (the number of iterations in this stage of the search so far) Error: (the average positional error between the end of the robot calculated using the robot model and the measurements taken by Robotrak). At the end of the two stages the error displayed on the screen gives a measure of the accuracy of the calibration in millimetres. PAGE 2 The kinematic errors detected during the search are now formally displayed. First the modified DH parameters are displayed along with the tool offset and the position and orientation of the co-ordinate frame at joint 1 relative to the measuring system co-ordinate frame, then the errors between the modified values and the uncalibrated robot model are displayed. Finally the statement 'The error between the positions measured and the reported positions may be reduced as follows by changing the kinematics of the model' is followed by the average and maximum errors without the modifications, and the average and maximum errors with the modifications. It is these values that are of greatest importance in deciding if the calibration has been successful. Many applications require the error in the position of the tool to be within a certain value relative to the position demanded by the off-line programming system. It should be remembered when interpreting these values that they refer to the absolute accuracy. Many applications require only relative accuracy, for example machining a piece of metal. Many other applications can be made to rely on relative accuracy by careful design of the workcell. Because the remaining errors are often systematic in nature the relative accuracy can often be considerably better than the absolute accuracy. For a similar reason, the accuracy can be improved by restricting the movement of the robot to a small volume within the overall envelope. The user has the option of saving the results as a bitmap. PAGES 3 and 4 Histograms showing the spread of the positional errors before and after calibration are displayed. This gives useful information that cannot be obtained by looking at the average and maximum values alone. The user may decide on the basis of the results obtained either to use the results to modify the existing robot model or to discard the results. If the user decides to modify the existing model then the user may also decide whether or not to use a filter to modify any teachpoints that are generated using the calibrated robot model so that they may be used on the uncalibrated robot (note that calibration calibrates the robot model not the robot itself). When a calibrated model is being used then 'Calibrated' will also be displayed above the robots name. At the end of the calibration Workspace will display a model of the Robotrak cords going from each measuring unit to the endpoint of the robot. This may be turned off by using the Options/Calibrate using Robotrak/Robotrak special options/Turn Robotrak off command. How the calibrated robot model is used The calibration results are used to improve the simulated robot model so that it matches more exactly the way that the real robot moves. Any joint-co-ordinate teachpoints which are subsequently generated off-line on the simulation may then be downloaded to the robot controller and the robot will move to the position that is required. However, it is important to understand that the robot controller has no knowledge of the errors in its understanding of the real robots kinematics. Therefore, before Cartesian co-ordinate teachpoints are downloaded to the robot controller the simulation must somehow fool the robot into moving to the true position that we require by asking it to move to another slightly different position. For example: Suppose that we wish the end of the robot tool to move to the xyz position 1000,1000,1000. If we ask the robot to move to this position it might move to 1002,1001,1001. Instead, we ask the robot to move to 998,999,999. The robot then moves to what it thinks is 998,999,999 but which is in reality 1000,1000,1000. To fool the robot into going to the correct Cartesian teachpoint positions we pass every geometry point through a filter before writing it to a teachpoint file. Similarly, when a teachpoint is loaded from a teachpoint file and converted to a geometry point it passes through the reverse filter (see above). Recalibrating tool values Options on the Options/Recalibrate tool sub menu can be used to correct tool information after damage has occured. The commands are intended for use by users who damage the tool, perhaps bending it slightly due to a collision, and need to know the new tool offset and orientation without using robotrak. It can also be used to calibrate the tool precisely if it was not possible to place the three cords accurately at the end of the tool during the calibration procedure. The commands can be more accurate than the same methods used on robot controllers because they make full use of the calibrated robot model, if such a model is available. Note that it is not necessary to use these commands if the correct tool offset and orientation have already been identified using Robotrak and no collision or tool alteration has occured. To recalibrate the tool offset the following must be done. Move the real robot to a point which is fixed in the workcell and save the point as a teachpoint in a new teachpoint file. Change the orientation of the robot and move the robot to the same point, again save the teachpoint. Repeat this several times for diferent orientations around the same point sacving each in the teach point file (at least 4 are required and it is recommended that the teachpoint orientations are varied considerably - see the Recalibrate tool menu for more information).Then issue the Recalibrate tool/Recalibrate tool offset command. Workspace will use the robot model to calculate the tool offset. The tool offset must be recalibrated before the x and z axis are recalibrated. To recalibrate the x-axis, move the robot in the direction of the tool x-axis away from the point used in the recalibrate tool offset command to another point and save that point as a teachpoint. Then issue the Recalibrate tool/Recalibrate x-axis command. To recalibrate the z-axis, move the robot in the direction of the tool y-axis away from the point used in the recalibrate tool offset command to another point and save that point as a teachpoint. Then issue the Recalibrate tool/Recalibrate z-axis command. Note that the recalibrate tool menu commands will give more accurate tool values if the robot is first calibrated. Calibrating the tool orientation Once a robot has been calibrated then Robotrak may be used to find the tool orientation. At the end of a successful calibration remove the standard Robotrak tool attachment and replace it with an identical assembly designed by the user in which the point at which the three cords meet has been moved a short distance along a direction parallel to the desired tool z axis. Then use the Options/Calibrate robot/Robotrak special options/Calibrate tool z-axis command. Workspace calculates from this an appropriate tool orientation. A similar procedure may be used with the calibrate tool x-axis command. Calibrating the workcell fixtures Once the robot has been calibrated and its off-line programming accuracy improved to a suitable level then the robot may itself be used as a measuring device to find the true position of the fixtures in the workcell relative to the robot (note that the xyz offset of the end of the robot tool or pointer must be found beforehand - possibly by using the Recalibrate tool offset command). This is an important issue since without knowing these positions accurately the off-line generated robot programmes would be unusable. Another method of measuring the position of fixtures is by disconnecting Robotrak from the robot and moving Robotrak to several points on the fixture (any measurements taken after calibration are adjusted by Workspace so that they are expressed relative to the robot base). This however, requires the use of an additional stylus unit fitted to Robotrak in place of the robot tool flange attachment assembly. A third method is to use theodolites to measure the position of the robot base and all important points on the fixture. However, this method involves a great deal of time and expense. Once the position of the fixtures relative to the robot is known then the position of the models of the fixtures in the simulation package can be adjusted, enabling the simulation to generate accurate robot paths relative to the fixtures and the parts held in the fixtures. Two commands are available within Workspace that aid workcell set-up. The command Options/Calibrate model/Reposition object using 3 points command can be used to accurately place an object relative to the robot. The method for using this command is as follows. 3 geometry points should be created on the object at known location on the object, the geometry points must be named DATUM1, DATUM2 and DATUM3. Using the robot, teachpoints should be created relative to the object in the workcell at the same positions on the object as the teachpoints, again these need to be named DATUM1, DATUM2 and DATUM3. Workspace can then match the geometry points to the teachpoints thus positioning the object correctly relative to the robot. The command Options/Calibrate model/Reposition robot using 3 points command, has a similar effect as the Reposition object using 3 points command. Except in this case the object remains fixed and the robot is repositioned. Recording robot trajectories using Robotrak Robotrak may also be used for measuring the position of the robot while it is moving along a path to check the accuracy of paths generated by the robot controller. These paths may then be automatically displayed in 3D using Workspace and compared with that generated during a simulation. Use the Options/Calibrate robot/Robotrak special options/Record trajectory command to start recording a trajectory using Robotrak. At the end of the recording the trajectory is displayed on the screen. The relative position of this trajectory will only be correct if Workspace already knows the position of Robotrak (the robot calibration process derives this from the calibration measurements and teachpoints). Use the Simulate/Replay track and log trajectory command to log a trajectory of a robot moving along a path specified by the track file. At the end of this command the trajectory is displayed and may be compared with that recorded using Robotrak from the real robot. Troubleshooting Problems with the repeatability of the encoder zero positions: If the Continuous cord reading reports larger than expected differences (more than 20) in the values reported when the cord is at the zero position (where the value ideally should be zero) then this suggests that the cord is not wrapping tightly around the drum. There may also be a problem if the cord starts to overlap the cord already wrapped around the drum - remove the unit side cover and this will be immediately apparent. The cord should be extended and then returned to the drum very slowly so that the tension is maintained enabling the cord to wrap neatly and tightly around the drum. The very first couple of times the cord wraps around the drum care should be taken to avoid overlapping - if necessary guide the cord using a finger. In normal operation of Robotrak this is not necessary because the cord never becomes completely unwound from the drum. If the Continuous cord reading reports large differences (more than 1000) in the values reported when the cord is at the zero position (where the value ideally should be zero) then this suggests that the interface card may be faulty and further advice should be sought from the supplier. Problems with obtaining calibration results: If the Extract errors from measurements command returns robot calibration results which report an average error after calibration, of over 3mm, or if the search does not finish and no results are reported, there may be several possible causes. Problems with obtaining average errors less than 3mm may be caused by bad repeatability of the encoder zero positions (see above). It may be that the robot model is not performing the inverse kinematics correctly. Check that the Cartesian positions and corresponding joint co-ordinates reported on the robot controller are the same as the Cartesian position and joint co-ordinates reported by the simulated robot model. If there are any discrepancies then fax these to Robot Simulations who will correct your robot model. If the point where Robotrak is attached to the robot or the encoder measuring units are moved slightly during the calibration then it will invalidate the measurement data. Make certain that everything is securely fixed and cannot move during robot motion. The robot world frame and the tool frame on the robot controller and on Workspace may be different. If the teachpoint file used with the robot stores the teachpoints as Cartesian (xyz and orientation) values rather than joint angles then these teachpoints will only be interpreted by Workspace correctly if Workspace uses the same robot world frame and tool frame as was used on the robot controller when the points were recorded. Note that the true physical tool offset will be calculated by Workspace as part of the calibration so it is not important that the tool frame on the robot controller matches the physical length of the tool. It is possible that the non-geometric errors in the real robot are more significant than expected. This is unlikely with most standard industrial revolute robots.

Robot calibration is a means whereby a robot can be made to move more accurately to a given xyz position and orientation by creating an improved mathematical model of the robot kinematics. What is the difference between accuracy and repeatability? It is important that we understand the difference between accuracy and repeatability. Repeatability is a measure of the ability to move back to the same position over and over again, whereas accuracy is the ability to move to a given position. As an analogy, consider somebody throwing darts at a board. If all the darts go into roughly the same place then the repeatability is good, though it may not be the position that the thrower was aiming at, in which case the accuracy would be bad. If all the darts hit the position the thrower was aiming at then the accuracy and the repeatability are good. Which physical errors cause robots to be inaccurate? The difference between the physical joint zero position of the robot and the zero position reported by the robot controller usually has the biggest effect on the robot's accuracy. Common sense suggests that errors in the zero position of joints 1, 2, and 3 will have a bigger effect on the robot positional error than joints 4, 5, and 6. We can ignore the effect of joint 1 since it is compensated for using the model calibration (see later). Additionally, experience suggests that joint 2 and 3 often have the largest zero position error because at some point in the robot's life it will have been crashed into the floor - throwing out the zero position by up to a degree. The error in the robot zero position is often responsible for 90% of the robot positional error. The length of the robot links usually has the second biggest effect on the robot's accuracy. When the links are manufactured there is inevitably some variation in their dimensions from one robot to the next, as well as a variation in the orientation of the joints. Within each robot controller is a mathematical model of the robot which assumes that the links on one robot are the same length as the links on another robot of the same type, and that the relative orientations of the joints on one robot are the same as on another robot of the same type. This is not true, and this causes the robot to estimate incorrectly where its endpoint is given a set of joint angles. It is unlikely on most industrial robots that the variation in link lengths would be more than a couple of millimetres. The next most significant factor in the robot positional error is joint compliance. This may be though of as factor representing the torsional spring effect at each joint which responds to the effect of gravity each link. How are these physical errors represented? The robot kinematic structure is often represented by mathematicians using DH parameters. These are simply a compact representation of the position and orientation of each joint relative to the previous joint. There are four numbers for each joint: d, a, theta, and alpha. D and a represent distances and theta and alpha represent angles. Joint zero errors for a rotational joint are stored as theta values. Link length and distance offset errors are stored as d and a values. Relative joint orientation errors are stored as alpha values. An additional parameter beta is introduced for two joints which are parallel to represent any slight misalignment. Why do we calibrate robots for offline programming but not for teach-pendant programming? Most robots are designed to be very repeatable (typically within 0.1mm) but have a low accuracy (typically between 5 and 15mm). The robot-programmer using a teach-pendant is not usually concerned with the accuracy of the robot, only its repeatability.Consider a spot-welding workcell. The user uses the teach-pendant and his eye to guide the robot to a chalk mark on the metal parts where the spot-weld is to be placed. The user doesn't care whether this xyz position is (1500,800,700) or (1505,795,695). He/she will only be concerned that when he looks at the robot tool that it looks as though it is close to the chalk mark. However, if the same robot programme is written offline using a geometric model of the part to define the spot-welds then the accuracy of the robot will become very important, since it is only the numbers from the offline programme which define the robot movement and there is no visual correction by the robot-programmer. By calibrating the robot before downloading a robot programme written offline it might therefore be possible to avoid the need to touch up the teachpoints visually using the teach pendant. Is there an alternative to calibrating the robot? Yes. Instead of calibrating the robot to improve the accuracy of the offline programmed points the robot-programmer can use the teach-pendant to touch up the points. Since the robot positional error for an uncalibrated robot is at worst of the order of 15mm then all that is required to correct the programme is jogging each teachpoint using the teach-pendant a very small distance until the point looks to be correct. How long does robot calibration take? The first stage of robot calibration is to take the necessary measurements of the robot position for a number of teachpoints. If the teachpoints have been previously defined then the whole process of placing a Robotrak measurement device in a workcell, performing the set-up procedure for Robotrak, and recording measurements for 50 teachpoints takes about 30 minutes. The teachpoint file and the measurements can then be used within Workspace running on a PC to procedure a calibrated model within a few seconds. When is robot calibration cost-effective? Robot calibration is cost-effective when touching up offline programmed teachpoints is undesirable for some reason. It may be that the act of touching up points manually introduces an undesirable element of subjective judgment into an otherwise objective Computer Integrated Manufacturing environment. The overall accuracy of the position in a robotic workcell which uses a robot programme generated offline would in this situation be dependent on the accuracy of the robot programmer, which would inevitably vary with fatigue and ability. This is the justification used by many car companies to justify calibration of all the robots on an offline programmed re-spot line. When is robot calibration not necessary? Robot calibration is not required for teach-pendant programming of a robot (unless the poor accuracy of the robot has a significant effect on the quality of linear and circular trajectories). Robot calibration might not be necessary where the working volume of the robot is very small. The robot can be said to have a good relative accuracy over this small volume.Robot calibration might also be unnecessary if the robot is very accurate before calibration. A good test of the accuracy of the robot is the quality of the tool calibration performed using a fixed pointer and several teachpoints with different orientations. This figure is reported by the Workspace Recalibrate tool command. What methods for calibrating robots exist? Any 3d measurement system can be used to obtain measurements which are subsequently used to create a calibrated robot model. Workspace uses its own Robotrak three-cord measurement device (accurate to within 0.2mm), but other devices can also be used with Workspace such as the Leica Smart automatic theodolite (which has an accuracy measured in microns). There is even a method for calibrating robots that does not use a measurement device but instead moves the robot to a fixed pointer using different orientations (similar to the standard method for calibrating tools) though its accuracy is not as good as that measurement based calibrations. How does robot calibration work? Most methods of robot calibration work by comparing teachpoint positions for a robot to measurements of the end of the tool relative to an independent 3d measuring device. A search method is used to find which changes in the mathematical model of the robot would allow the distance between where the robot thinks it is and where the robot actually is to be minimised. The search method is contained within the Workspace software and the Workspace robot model is updated with the changes. Where is the calibration data stored? The calibration data obtained using Workspace is stored in the model of the robot and the workcell. To use this robot in a different workcell without recalibrating it is only necessary to use the calibrated robot model. Note that the robot controller and the robot itself have no knowledge of the fact that Workspace has calibrated the robot. What is the difference between remastering and robot calibration? Remastering is where the position of each joint at which it reports itself as being zero is changed so that it coincides with the physical zero position of the joint. Some robots (for example the Fanus S10) use a special fixture to define the robot physical zero position. Other robots use a mark on each link to define the robot physical zero position. To remaster the robot the user jogs the robot using the teach-pendant to the physical zero position for each joint and then issues a command to the robot controller to use this position as the new zero position. This improves the accuracy of the robot in a similar way to robot calibration, though robot calibration goes further in that it not only corrects errors in the zero position but also in the link lengths and offsets. Therefore robot calibration should provide slightly better accuracy than remastering. Is remastering the robot an alternative to robot calibration? Yes, if the user is able to remaster the robot accurately and if the small additional accuracy provided by robot calibration is not required. Remastering a robot will frequently improve the accuracy of offline programming in the same way that robot calibration will. However, remastering will make any existing robot programmes on the robot controller no longer accurate, unlike robot calibration which does not change the parameters of the robot controller. In some situations the user may wish to use robot calibration to suggest changes to the robot zero position to be used in remastering. Why don't robot manufacturers calibrate their robots? Most industrial robot manufactures remaster their robots before they leave the factory. This effectively removes errors in the joint zero positions. However, it is very rare that a robot manufacturer calibrates to compensate for the true link lengths of each individual robot. Traditional method of programming are teach-pendant based and do not require robots to be calibrated. As more and more users start to use offline methods which require calibrated robots then it is likely that the maufacturers will place a greater emphasis on calibrating the robot before it is shipped to the customer. Once the robot is installed in a production environment it is likely that it will suffer collisions which will cause the joints to loose their accuracy, so that robot calibration will again be required. What is the difference between a three-point touch and robot calibration? Three-point touch is a term used to describe model calibration. The robot is used as a measuring device to determine where the fixture is relative to the robot by touching three datum points on the fixture. These points are then brought back into the simulation model of the workcell and used to update the position of the model of the fixture in the simulation. Though the three-point touch does correct for any errors in the zero position of joint 1 it does not correct for any other factors influencing the robot's accuracy. Therefore it may be that for some workcells all that is required is a three-point touch whereas for other workcells a robot calibration and a three-point touch is required. What is tool calibration? Tool calibration is the process whereby the true xyz offset from the mounting faceplate of the robot to the end of the tool may be found. It is important that the correct offset is used in the offline simulation so that robot programme it generates is accurate on the real robot. Some applications require that the orientation of the tool should also be found. How can tools be calibrated? Some robot controllers allow a user to calibrate a tool by moving its tip to the end of a fixed pointer in several different orientations. Workspace uses the same method for its Recalibrate tool command, though it can obtain more accurate tool offsets than the robot controller because it can use a calibrated robot model (if a robot calibration has been performed previously). In some situations the Robotrak measuring device may be fitted to the tip of the tool. This allows Workspace to calibrate the robot and the tool in one step. Does tool and model calibration require use of a measuring system? Neither tool nor model calibration require use of a measuring system. How does calibration and offline programming all fit together To understand how these techniques all fit together here is a description of several differing offline programming sequences. A) Calibration of the robot and the tool in one step. The measuring device is attached to the end of the tool. This will only be possible if the end of the tool is easily accessible. 1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell. 2. The robot and tool are calibrated in one step (by moving the robot to 50 teachpoints and taking a measurement at each step). 3. The model is calibrated (by moving the robot so that the tip of its tool touches each of three datum points in turn) and the fixture repositioned within the simulation. 4. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme. B) Calibration of the robot and tool in separate steps. In this situation the measuring device is attached to a point on the tool which is accessible but which is not the end of the tool. 1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell. 2. The robot is calibrated. 3. The tool is calibrated. 4. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation. 5. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme. C) Use of a special pointer tool for model calibration In this situation the tool is unwieldy and so we replace it during robot and model calibration with a special pointer tool. 1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell. 2. The special pointer tool is attached to the robot. The robot and the special pointer tool are calibrated in one step. 3. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation. 4. Special pointer tool is removed from the robot and replaced with the real tool. 5. The tool is calibrated. 6. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme. D) No robot calibration Here we assume that the robot is relatively accurate over the its working volume in the workcell. 1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell. 2. The tool is calibrated. 3. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation. 4. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme. E) Remastering of the robot Suppose that offline programming has been attempted without robot calibration and that the robot was found to be inaccurate. The robot is then remastered. 1. The robot is remastered using the manufacturer's remastering procedure. 2. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell. 3. The tool is calibrated. 4. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation. 5. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme.

In North America the 'big three' car makers are Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. Based in Detroit and elsewhere in the continent these companies have spent the past five years investing heavily in robot simulation and offline programming. The urgency exerted by an unexpected demand for the most popular models as well as a large upturn in consumer spending on cars has created a pressure-cooker atmosphere in Detroit. Here production lines are designed and built and running in weeks or months and every offline programming technique is examined closely for potential improvements in set-up time or production rate. One of the major issues here is the move towards more and more accurate spot and arc welding techniques. The 2mm car (where every robot weld is within 2mm of the intended position on every car that rolls of the production line) is talked of as a kind of Holy Grail of car production - and some people even talk in hushed tones of eventually pushing the barrier even further to achieve the 1mm car. This has focused attention on those techniques, especially robot calibration and fixture calibration, that will lead to a higher accuracy of offline programming. Current practice involves several stages from simulation to offline programming. First the car is modelled in the company-wide CAD system, often a sophisticated mainframe based CAD package like CATIA which can handle models of the complete car and all the parts that make up the car. Then the fixtures are designed which are to present the parts to the welding robots in a repeatable and predictable manner. It is usually a requirement that the fixtures, which are created by specialist tooling companies under contract, are 'certified'. This means that points on the fixture which are to clamp the part, or the blocks against which the part are clamped, must be measured very precisely using a 3-d co-ordinate measuring device. These measurements are referred to a co-ordinate frame on the centreline of the car using three datum points on the fixture. These three datum points give the position (x, y, z,), orientation (a, b, c), and scaling factor associated with the fixture. The measurements are usually recorded using two manual theodolites and standard theodolite triangulation. Another alternative technique that promises even higher accuracies than those achieved using theodolites is named photogrammetry. Photogrammetry uses several very high resolution electronic 'photographs' of a target attached to the fixture taken from different angles together with standard image-processing techniques to derive the 3-d position of the target. It has a technique that has long been used in terrain mapping using aerial photography and advanced stereo vision but is only now finding an application down on the shop floor. The first fixture is then installed on the production line, and from this the position of the first robot is defined, again using theodolites. The position of the first fixture then defines the position of the second fixture, and so on, all the way down the production line. The simulation of the robot programmes has usually been completed by this stage using models imported from the CAD system and off-the-shelf robot models purchased from the simulation vendor. More and more of the simulation functionality is available on the CAD system: for example co-ordinate frames representing the position and orientation of spot-welds and approach points and 'weld-schedules' indicating the motion type and speed between points can be defined in CATIA before exporting the model to the simulation. The simulation is used to check that the robots can reach all the required positions. The wrist joint limits of the robot often limit the orientations that are achievable and the simulation user must work creatively to position the robot base and the robot tool. A particular position and orientation may not be achievable in a given robot configuration, for example with the wrist pointing down or with the elbow pointing up. The configuration of the robot model can be changed by driving the robot using joint motion into a different configuration before attempting the movement. The simulation enables the user to plan collision free paths around the clamps holding the part using via points which must be created in such a way that they do not add excessively to the overall cycle time. This is the reason that is so important to derive reasonably accurate cycle times from the simulation. Unfortunately, the robot companies consider the motion algorithms used by their robot controllers to be of such commercial value that they will always refuse to release these to the simulation vendors. A compromise position has been reached between the simulation vendors and the robot vendors (thanks to the strong encouragement of the car companies in America and in Germany) where 'black boxes' (unreadable parts of the robot controller software) are interfaced to the robot simulation to give accurate cycle times. Once the cycle times are accurate the user may also have reasonable confidence that the trajectories between points shown by the simulation are accurate, and therefore that the collision and near-miss information provided by the simulation is reliable - a key issue if simulation is to be trusted by those on the shop-floor. Downloading the robot programmes (sometimes called 'tracks') from the simulation to the robot controller involves taking a disc containing the programme, teachpoint, and tool frame files from the air-conditioned offices where the CAD and simulation specialist work down onto the much harsher and unforgiving environment of the factory. It is here that most advocates of simulation and offline have a rude awakening. Programmes that work fine in the 'virtual reality' environment of the robot simulation seldom work in the uncertain and unpredictable and subtly different real world. Robots are designed to be extremely repeatable but not all that accurate (repeatabilities of 0.1mm and accuracies of 10mm or worse are not unusual). To understand the difference between repeatability and accuracy imagine a darts game. The first player is playing with new darts and so aims for a triple 20 but instead puts all the darts in the number 6, with all three darts close together. The darts are repeatable but not very accurate. The second darts player, playing with his own tried and tested set of darts, throws three treble 20s. His darts are not only repeatable, but they are also accurate. To increase the accuracy of the robot towards the same order as its repeatability it must be calibrated. Each robot has its own individual signature created by the manufacturing tolerances involved in making robots and by the wear and tear of crashing the robot into fixtures (an all to regular occurrence) and worse. This signature can be detected by measuring the 3d co-ordinates of the robot over a range of positions and orientations throughout its envelope and then using calibration software to produce a more accurate custom model of the robot. The measuring devices used on the shop floor for robot calibration must be cheap and relatively easy and quick to use, since up to 50 measurements may be required for each robot. Robotrak consist of three drums which may be placed anywhere in the workcell from which three cords are extended to meet at the endpoint of the robot. The length of the cord is indicated by the rotation of the drum, and from the three lengths the x, y, z position of the endpoint of the robot may be calculated and recorded to within a repeatability of 0.3mm. If a higher accuracy is required then a laser-tracker named Smart may be used. Smart is the next generation of theodolite: it tracks targets automatically without any manual intervention. The key to Smart is a laser interferometer that measures distance very precisely so that together with the two angles representing the direction that Smart is pointing itself it is possible to calculate the x, y, z position of a point instead of having to use 2 conventional theodolites and triangulation. Smart is accurate to about 0.025mm though this degrades to 0.050mm under shop floor conditions of temperature change, vibration, and large vehicles trundling past. Robot Simulations Ltd, who offer Robotrak and Smart for use with their Workspace robot simulation, calibration, and offline programming software suggest that customers requiring accuracies circa. 1mm should use Robotrak, while customers requiring accuracies much lower than 1mm should use Smart. Once the robot has been calibrated it can be used with a pointer of known length as an accurate measuring device to record the position of the fixture datum points. This '3-point touch-up' is often mistaken for robot calibration, but is really only used for positioning the model of the fixture correctly relative to the robot model within the simulation and thereby avoiding one of the pitfalls of offline programming. Finally, the correct tool offset must be defined on the robot controller and on the robot simulation. If the dimensions of the tool are well known then this is a straightforward process, but if the tool dimensions are unknown or if the tool is slightly bent because of a collision that has occurred on the shop floor then a tool calibration must be carried out. The robot programme created by the simulation is really only ready for downloading to the robot once all the above procedures are complete. If one of these steps is ignored or badly implemented then the resulting programme can be anything from 2 inches to a foot out, depending on the seriousness of the mistakes involved. This is where most of the horror stories involving robot simulation and offline programming originate: 'we took a programme from .... and downloaded it to the robot and the robot drove straight into the fixture' or 'we created 120 offline programmes for the whole production line and not one worked first time - they all needed to be touched up by hand'. The final source of error in offline programming is a simple logistic one: by the time the simulation is finished and ready for offline programming the real workcell may been redesigned, turntables have been introduced or removed, additional robots have been inserted. Only now its too late to go back and simulate because the simulation office is working on simulations for the next production line. The simplest way to avoid this situation is to make certain of the following: 1. One person is responsible for the simulation from start to finish (the finish being when the production line is up and running smoothly and there are no more changes); 2. The simulation goes down onto the shop floor with the offline programme where last minute changes can be immediately introduced into the simulation. Microcomputer based robot simulation packages which can run on notebooks mean that nobody has an excuse for leaving the simulation up in the design office instead of taking it down onto the shop floor where it is really needed. So with all these potential pitfalls and inaccuracies in robot simulation and offline programming, is it really worth attempting? If you want the answer, come to Detroit. The car companies will not spend money on any technology that doesn't produce savings that can be measured in Dollars and Cents, and they see robot simulation and offline programming as the revolutionary technology that will enable them to build more cars, quicker and at a lower cost than ever before. What the Big Three are using today, the rest of us in manufacturing will be implementing tomorrow.

This product group is the result of research carried out by John Owens for his Ph.D. in Robotics, Simulation, Advanced Languages and Control. The first version to be introduced was WORKSPACE 1.0, which was the first 3D robot simulation to run on a PC, in the world. As with all new products feedback from customers was essential in identifying possible areas of improvement, leading to, in 1991, the release of WORKSPACE 2.0. This received much greater recognition within the robotics establishment and was gradually accepted within higher education and industry as a valuable teaching, training and learning tool. Robot Simulations Limited (RSL) was incorporated in December 1992, when Roger Verrall came in as Managing Director, allowing John Owens to concentrate on finalising WORKSPACE 3.0. This is a product for industry as well as education. The features that were incorporated brought PC based software ever closer to workstation systems as a very much more cost effective alternative. Full factory lay-outs with unlimited number of robots and mechanisms can be designed, calibrated, simulated and programmed, as one model. Apart from robot and model calibration there is inverse kinematics, robot languages, over 100 industrial and educational robot models, DXF/IGES interface, 3D graphics in SuperVGA (256 colours), computer aided learning files all on a standard modern PC. This increases the number of companies who can now afford to automate, without incurring the high cost of workstation hardware/software. In July 1994 RSL linked with Robot Dynamics to market the Robotrak measuring system. This is an electro-mechanical set of units that can when linked with WORKSPACE 3+ (latest version) produce accurate calibration for off-line programming. This process is the subject of a patent application. RSL is based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has a policy of employing graduates with either computing or engineering disciplines. With increased staff levels, the ongoing development of the new WORKSPACE versions and other systems is well underway. To keep ahead of the field RSL develops products of quality with speed. The emphasis on quality and customer support has led to RSL doubling its turnover each year to reach 6 figures in just 3 years. Sales have increased to UK. colleges and export markets on each continent. The Japanese and the USA have recognised the value of PC based simulation systems and development work is underway with major blue chip companies worldwide. Experience has shown the value of good agents with ability to recognise the value of WORKSPACE in the long term, not for the quick return. RSL is a totally independent company, with no outside shareholders or venture capital. WORKSPACE is an in-house development, suitable for both robot manufacturers and users, each receiving equal service and confidentiality.

The WORKSPACE PC-based robot simulation system and the ROBOTRAK three cable measuring system for calibration are introduced as examples and compared to other commercial systems, and a calibration case study presented. The problem The repeatability of most industrial robots (the ability to return repeatedly to a given position) is usually much better than the accuracy (the ability to move to a specified xyz value in space). Typical repeatabilities are about 0.5mm while typical accuracies are of the order of 10mm or worse. This is not a problem when programming a robot using a hand-help teach-pendant and the human eye. Here it is only repeatability that is an issue. However, when programming a robot using some offline system to generate the robot locations numerically the accuracy of the robot becomes all important. In theory, it is possible to improve the accuracy so that it is as good as the repeatability. The reason that the accuracy of robots is so bad is because there are manufacturing tolerances involved in the production of each robot. The two most significant sources of error are discrepancies in the robot link lengths and in the zero position of each joint. What is required is a system that will take measurements of the xyz position of the end of the robot, compare them with the robot's own estimate of its position, and thereby find estimates for the errors and model these errors to improve the accuracy of offline programming. Measuring systems Systems for measuring robot position divide into two basic categories. The first includes all optical systems which use non-contact line-of-sight methods. The second includes all cable driven systems. An example of an optical system is the SPACE theodolite system developed by the Fraunhofer Institute (IPK) in Berlin, where a 3D target location on the end of the robot is determined by optical triangulation. Two or more motor-driven theodolites with power-focus and electronic imaging are used to obtain information on target direction via image processing software. This information drives the theodolites to track the moving target. The target must be visible from all directions, so a 6mm self-illuminated ceramic sphere is used [1]. This system has been developed and tested in collaboration with Volkswagen (VW), KUKA, and Leica. The same group have also tested a system named SMART which uses a single tracking laser interferometer to locate the 3D position of a reflector by measuring polar coordinates (two angles and one distance). This is the favoured measuring device of the group because of its operational simplicity.A group at Surrey University have developed a 2 laser system named Optotrac. A reflective target is attached to the end of the robot and used to reflect the 2 beams. If the target is not hit in the centre by the beams then the reflections are offset, and these offsets are used to track the target[2]. A low-cost approach was adopted by a group from Amsterdam University. A CCD camera mounted on the robot-hand is pointed at a flat plate on which a pattern of circles is printed. While not able to achieve the accuracy of other measuring systems, this system might provide a cheap means for partial recalibration after repair [3]. The Compugage two cable system developed by Dynalog has been used extensively in calibration [4]. While more rugged and therefore more appropriate to shop-floor use than optical systems, the set up and measurement procedure is lengthy and cumbersome. Even with extensive training the entire process can take 6 hours or more to calibrate an individual robot. An error at any stage leads to inaccurate results. The Chrysler Motor company, who have used this system, say that each minute of down-time on a production line costs them 20,000 dollars. The time taken for calibration is therefore a critical factor in choosing the right system. The shop-floor environment does not lend itself to complex or lengthy operations. What is required is a system that is accurate yet simple and quick to operate. Robotrak is a 3-cable mechanical system for measuring the x,y,z position of the endpoint of the robot to within 0.2mm. One person is capable of performing the entire setup in 20 minutes, with the total calibration completed in less than an hour. Compared to other calibration systems Robotrak is simple, rugged, and extremely cost-effective. Robotrak consists of three cables which extend from drums which are fixed at the corners of a roughly equilateral triangle somewhere within the robot workcell. The distance between the drums is typically 2 metres, but may be varied with the size of the robot to be measured. The cables meet at a fixture which is attached to the robot faceplate or tool. The length of the cables at any moment during the movement of the robot is calculated form the number of rotations of the drums and read into an IBM microcomputer. In this way the x,y,z position of the robot logged may be measured. Setting up and using Robotrak Robotrak is set up in coordination with the WORKSPACE robot simulation package as follows: 1. Place the three cable drums in a roughly equilateral triangle pattern of side approximately 2m somewhere within the workcell. Note that this can be on the floor, on a fixture, on a wall, on the ceiling, or at any angle to the robot. The position of the drums relative to the robot does not need to be known since this is calculated as part of the calibration process. This flexibility of positioning Robotrak within the workcell is one of the great advantages of this system. 2. Insert the Robotrak interface card into an IBM PC compatible microcomputer which runs the WORKSPACE robot simulation. 3. The encoders measuring the number of rotations of the drums and thereby indicating the extension of the cable are zeroed (with the cables at zero extension) by pressing a button within WORKSPACE. 4. Each cable is then extended to the end of a metal robot of known length and another button pressed. This enables WORKSPACE to calculate the ratio of encoder counts to length of extension in mm. 5. Cable 1 is extended to a known point on drum 2, cable 2 to drum 3, and cable 3 to drum 1. A button is pressed in WORKSPACE and the encoder counts at the drums are automatically recorded and converted to lengths. The relative position of all the drums is now known. 6. The cables are now extended to meet at the robot endpoint. The cables meet inside a small metal fitting that can be clamped either precisely at the end of the tool (if the tool is to be calibrated at the same time as the robot) or at any unknown point on the end link or tool of the robot. Robotrak can now provide a continuous reading of the xyz position of the end of the robot relative to an arbitrary coordinate frame fixed at one of the drums. 7. The robot is moved to 25 different positions and orientations throughout its working envelope. At each position the robot teach pendant is used to store a teachpoint on the robot controller, and a button is pressed in WORKSPACE to record an xyz measurement of the position end of the robot. 8. The teachpoint file is then copied from the robot controller onto the IBM PC compatible microcomputer and loaded into WORKSPACE. WORKSPACE then compares the teachpoint file with the measurements and searches for changes in the physical structure of the robot model within the simulation that would enable it to behave in the same way as the real robot. The WORKSPACE calibration softwareWORKSPACE is a PC-based robot simulation software package that makes extensive use of the Robotrak measuring system for calibration. Robotrak is part of the WORKSPACE system, and is used to calibrate robots prior to offline programming. The software for the calibration is an integral part of WORKSPACE and all the calibration options are available from WORKSPACE menus. The main advantages to the user of a calibration system integrated with the simulation system are that the user interface is greatly simplified and that the price is low compared with discrete calibration and simulation systems. This is the first time that such close integration has been achieved. Robot simulation, calibration, and offline programming may therefore be seen as a seamless process, in which robot programmes may be transferred to and from each stage with out any problem as is often required during the cell design process. Errors which may be detected and modelled by WORKSPACE and Robotrak include: (a) The zero position of each joint (the position of the joint where the value of the joint variable is 0), (b) The length of each link and the distance offset at each link, (c) The compliance at each joint (the sag of the arm at the joint due to the weight of the robot links when the robot is in a particular position), (d) The xyz tool offset from the mounting plate to the end of the tool, (e) The position and orientation of the measuring system coordinate frame relative to the robot base coordinate frame. The ability of WORKSPACE to calculate the correct position and orientation of the Robotrak drums relative to the robot as part of the calibration means that Robotrak may be mounted at any unknown position in the workcell. By taking one additional measurement on the tool axis using Robotrak the orientation of the approach vector of the tool may be calculated. WORKSPACE extracts these errors from the physical measurements and teachpoints by trying to find a robot model that would best fit the measured characteristics. The WORKSPACE kinematic model of the robot is then modified accordingly. Any points generated within WORKSPACE during the course of a simulation are then passed through a filter which alters the points in such a way that the uncalibrated real robot will be fooled in to moving to the point we really wanted it to move to by asking it to move to another, slightly different point. It is necessary to work this way since the real robot can have no knowledge of its physical inadequacies. Another filter may then be used when taking teachpoints back from the uncalibrated robot into calibrated model. With Robotrak measuring points to an absolute accuracy of 0.2mm it is possible to obtain results from the calibration such that the accuracy of an industrial robot such as the ABB IRB6000 during offline programming is improved from 10 to 20 mm to better than 1mm. Note that ROBOTRACK may also be used for measuring the position of the robot while it is moving along a path, for the purpose of checking the accuracy of paths generated on the robot controller. These paths may then be automatically displayed in 3D using WORKSPACE and compared with that generated during a simulation. Calibrating the workcell fixturesOnce the robot has been calibrated and its offline programmed accuracy improved to a suitable level then the robot may itself be used as a measuring device to find the true position of the fixtures in the workcell relative to the robot. This is an important issue since without knowing these positions accurately the offline generated robot programmes would be unusable. Another method measuring the position of fixtures is by using Robotrak itself (any measurements taken after calibration are adjusted by WORKSPACE so that they are expressed relative to the robot base). A third method is to use theodolites to measure the position of the robot base and all important points on the fixture. However, this method involves a great deal of time and expense. Once the position of the fixtures relative to the robot is known then the position of the models of the fixtures in the simulation package can be adjusted, enabling the simulation to accurate robot paths relative to the fixtures and the parts held in the fixtures. Conclusions If the accuracy required by a robot application of the order of 1mm and the robot programme is to be generated by an offline software package such as a graphical robot simulation then it is necessary to calibrate the robot first. Robots have no in-built knowledge of their own manufacturing tolerances and therefore the calibration results must be used at the offline stage to fool the robot into moving to a desired position by asking it to move to a slightly different position. Though many calibration systems exist, their worth should be measured by how effectively they coordinate with robot simulation software to improve the accuracy of robot programmes generated offline. In the future we can expect more and more companies to follow the lead of Reis Robots in providing partial calibration of the robot before supplying the robot to the customer, though the customer will still need to calibrate the robot tool, calibrate for zero position drift, and calibrate after the replacement of robot components. The next generation of robot controllers will be designed to be robot simulation friendly in their ability to take account of errors detected by calibration. 21st September 1994 References [1] S.Kyle, Leica, 'Measuring Systems for Complete Calibration', in 'Calibration Applied to Quality Control and Maintenance in Robot Production', Esprit Project CAR-5220, Edited by K.Schroer, IPK Franhofer-Institut fur Produktionsanlagen und Konstruktionstechnik, Berlin, Germany, p.28-35.

Robot Simulations Ltd. Article taken from Japanese Industrial Robot Association Newsletter Robot Simulations Ltd., is the designer of the WORKSPACE range of robotic simulation software. The development started in 1985 by the Technical Director Dr. John Owens. The latest version WS3.3 will be released in October 1994 as the first seamless industrial PC based system on the market. Roger Verrall is the Managing Director of Robot Simulations. Table of Contents 1. Introduction 2. The need for simulation 3. Introducing WORKSPACE. 4. WORKSPACE Features. 5. Case Studies. 1. Introduction Simulation is a tool that is readily accepted within education and industry as a means to see, by computer design, the futures requirements. Every University sets a project to produce a simulation system, there are many systems on the market today each with benefits suitable for individual requirements, but few that can be called truly commercial. Robot Simulations Ltd., have developed the first PC based robotics simulation system that can compete with main frame and graphics work station systems at a fraction of the cost. The aim is to bring the applications of robotics to the student, the trainee, the designer and, in fact, any type of user. 2. The need for simulation. The designing of efficient work cells is a difficult task. The need to predict robot movement, to avoid interference between robots and determine the optimum placement for maximum reach is essential for the workcell design engineer. The ability to design within confined spaces where there is a high risk of collision together with identification of possible production bottlenecks is of the utmost importance and then, to know how long each process within a cycle will take. The changing of an existing workcell means down-time. Studies indicate that it can take more than 60 working hours to redesign a single robot manufacturing cell. Time is money and the cost of robot ownership must be kept to a minimum as the diagram (fig. 1) shows. fig.1 When a new design is to be incorporated, the concepts must be clearly communicated to all team members. A 3D system is preferred, as a 2D system can be misinterpreted. Simulation allows the planning of safety factors because operating robots can carry a risk of injury. Safety equipment can be placed in accordance with regulations and the training of robot operators can be supervised without risk to either trainer or trainee. The benefits of using simulation can easily be measured. With a faster design of new work cell layouts, the engineering effort is reduced creating less pressure on the team. Faster redesign means reduced down-time in line shutdowns for on-line programming. New ideas can be tested on the computer, eliminating costly mistakes. Cycle times can be reset to produce optimum schedules by verifying robot reach and collision detection. More importantly optimisation of the workcell can be achieved off-line, allowing the robot to continue operating during the planning phase. Off-line programming is available for similar reasons, and can be downloaded to the robot controller. The potential applications of simulation are varied. In the automotive industry there is Arc and Spot welding, Paint spraying, adhesives, sealants and more. In the machine tool industry there is CNC machine loading and unloading, deburring and others. Recently new applications such as remote telemanipulation, nuclear decommissioning, deep sea robotics and space research are all using simulation as the tool to bring the projects to maturity. What tools are needed to enable the user to get the best out of a simulation package? Firstly we must look at the needs of the user. The obvious first requirement is powerful user friendly software. To run the system, powerful computer hardware, recent advances in computer technology have made such systems available on a PC's either on Desk-top or Lap-top. Within the software there must be a comprehensive CAD system and a data exchange format. Accurate models of real industrial robots must be easily accessed together with mechanical modelling tools. the simulation language must be sophisticated in order to service the full requirements of the program and the user. As we are specifically dealing in robot simulation, there must be robot placement tools to test robot reach, check tool orientation and highlight any changes of configuration. A robot does not work alone, other devices such as conveyors, part feeders, CNC machines, ROV's can be simulated. A calibration facility to ensure that each model matches the real world workcell is imperative. Again collision detection must be a feature included in the software. 3. Introducing WORKSPACE(tm) Having listed the requirements of a professional industrial simulation system, WORKSPACE 3 can be introduced. WS3.2 is the world's most advanced PC based robot simulation system, using a standard PC compatible microcomputer. Let us look at the benefits of a PC based system and the features that are available. Firstly the features: High quality 3D graphics in Super VGA gives workstation quality on-screen shaded imaging. An off-line programming capability operated by a mouse driven draw-down menu method gives the system user flexibility. A library of standard industrial robots such as ABB, KUKA, Fanuc, Nachi, Kawasaki, Adept, Unimation and others gives the user more options to choose from, incorporating the visual design and simulation with a consistent user-friendly interface. 4. WORKSPACE Features. The sophisticated industrial standard 3D CAD system contains a library of standard primitives, Constructive Solid Geometry, B�zier surfaces, easy to use CAD editor, dimensioning and an industrial standard DXF and IGES interface. All models can be in wireframe, hidden-line or shaded. With a kinematics and inverse kinematics modeller for serial and parallel joint mechanisms, visual editing of the robot dimensions is possible and parameters such as joint limits, velocities and accelerations are easily set by the user. The simulation language also incorporates an advanced robot language to enable such programming routines as variables, sub-routines, loop structures, logic structures and sophisticated logic commands. Programmes are created visually by using the menu interface. This allows any number and brand of robots, mechanisms, conveyors, parts feeders and AGV's to be programmed and run concurrently. There are other robot language options available. Within the programming facility there is a text editor which acts as an integral editor for program files. A "trace" function is installed to assist in the creation of error free robot programmes. Another interactive text and simulation system is the CAL (Computer Aided Learning) system. This allows training exercises to be mixed with text giving multi-option questions and answers. Simulation is an ideal teaching tool, students can work on accurate industrial models in complete safety, the need for full time supervision is reduced allowing quality teaching. Finally simulation eliminates the need for expensive robotics hardware until the students and trainees are more capable and knowledgeable of the subject. The open architecture of WORKSPACE allows the import of external simulation routines and it will allow the user to modify or add inverse kinematics solutions. WS3.2 also contains a complete robot and workcell calibration system which is necessary for off-line programming. General mechanisms can be simulated, with either serial or branch models and with translational and rotational joints, as can parallelograms. The mechanisms can be controlled independently or as an auxiliary axis. This feature allows complex grippers to be modelled. To determine the movement of slave joints arithmetic expressions are used. Dynamics are shown to analyse demand, torque, forces, actual trajectory and joint error. The user can go into the section of relevant source code and modify the algorithms to suit other dynamics requirements using the "Userdyn" command. The controller parameters are adjustable and all results can be graphically displayed. The open architecture of WORKSPACE has many advantages, the Dynamic Linked Library allows the integration of user defined Pascal, C and C++ routines. "Usercall" permits special functions to be added to a track language by the user. "Autoexec" is a feature that can control WORKSPACE by an external script generated by another program. The number of robot languages within workspace is increasing all the time. Currently installed are Karel(tm) 2 & 3.06, ABB ARLA(tm), VAL(tm), VAL II(tm), V/V+(tm) and AS. Others to be implemented are RAL 10-II(tm), DARL(tm), ROBOSTAR(tm), AML3(tm) and others. One of the unique features of the WORKSPACE integrated system is the off-line programming facility. The programmes are written in the native controller language that can either be downloaded by floppy disk or RS interface and are compatible with other programming protocols. Calibration of robots within WS3 gives the differences between the ideal robot and real-world robot affected by manufacturing tolerances. This can be extended to the calibration of the workcell, giving accurate placement of objects and devices. The physical link between the robot and the controller can be adapted. Floppy disk transfer is possible but most controllers support serial connection with either an RS 232 interface or RS 422. It may be necessary to have a patchbox for correct wiring. The distance from the computer to the controller can be overcome by simply installing WS3.2 on to a portable PC, thus taking the simulation to the factory floor. (see fig.2). WORKSPACE can also read from the controller back to the PC. fig.2 WORKSPACE 3 has only recently been released but already it is solving real problems in both industry and education. 5. Case studies. Case Study 1. Cimtas, Turkey. Cimtas are a forward looking company in the manufacture of large steel structures for the construction industry. The application was the arc welding of large steel "I" beams. They needed a 10 axes movement of the workcell simulated as it was difficult to visualise all the movements. It was not possible to confirm the choice of robot before purchase and it was impossible to test ideas on the factory floor. Because of the orientation problems there was a high chance of collisions at the extremes of the robot envelope. (See fig.3) fig.3 First a model workcell was built in WORKSPACE, as in fig. 3, this contained 1 overhead robot fixed to a rotating table, in turn bolted to an extended overhead gantry, a track mounted rotating table at 90� from horizontal plane. The two chosen robots were tested in the simulation environment. The movement of the auxiliary axes was optimised to give maximum working envelope and minimise the risk of collisions. Then the exact height was obtained for the robot above floor level to avoid exceeding joint limits during welds. WORKSPACE helped the system become operational within a few weeks and eliminated the ongoing problems. A choice of robot was made, the optimum height was fixed, potential collisions eradicated and considerable time and money saved. Case Study 2. University of Plymouth, UK. Plymouth needed a software system which enabled students as much time as possible dealing in "real world" robotics. The problems encountered were: (i) The cost of robots to meet the demands of the robotics group. (ii) The cost of existing software running on workstations. (iii) The number within the group had to be reduced in order to provide effective supervision and teaching. The solution was for Robot Simulations Ltd., in discussions with the University, to provide various features that could be used specifically for teaching. Several features in WS3 were already being implemented for industrial applications such as , Userdyn, Dynamic Linked Libraries, Usercall and Autoexec which could be adapted for education. Each of these features allows the lecturer to set individual course work for an increased number of students. The result of this development was a B.Sc (Hons) course in Robotics and Automation which started in September 1993, with WS3 as the core software for the full 4 year course. The savings in both robotics and computer hardware/software gave greater flexibility to the budget allowing more students to enroll ( +60%), more 1 to 1 teaching, upgrading of existing equipment and purchase of new robots from basic educational units through various standards to main brand industrial types to enable industrial level project work.

The opportunities, says Managing Director Roger Verrall, are almost limitless. With 20,000 educational potential users around the world and some 500,000 industrial robots, the world is our oyster. Developed by ex-Newcastle University Dr. John Owens ( now Technical Director ), WORKSPACE has already been bought by many UK and European companies and colleges and also USA, Taiwan, Korea, Turkey, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Brasil and has attracted enthusiastic response from the Japanese and USA Robotics Associations. A distributor covering the whole of North America has recently been appointed with an identified user base of 20,000 industrial sites. Closer to home RSL are working with Pilkington Glass and Estil ( one of the leading UK automotive system integrators ). Plymouth University was the first in the UK to use WORKSPACE as the core software for its new BSc. (Hons) course in Robotics and Factory Automation with Liverpool John Moore, Leeds Metropolitan and Middlesex Universities are among many that are using it as a major learning tool. Paul Robinson, senior lecturer at Plymouth University's School of Electronics, Communications and Engineering joined Robot Simulations to develop a user friendly learning manual for WORKSPACE, the placement, the first of it's kind, being made through the DTI Senior Academics in Industry Scheme (SAIS) managed by the much vaunted Cranfield Institute of Technology who are also co-operating with RSL on important research projects. Locally, Komatsu have been working with RSL to help design a new workcell within their Birtley Plant. This contact is seen as very important as Komatsu, being a major international company could use WS on a world-wide basis. Major US car maker invites RSL to demonstrate WS at their new production facility near Detroit. US Waterjet cutting company have bought WS for their new process. Major Swedish furniture manufacture bought after a student now employed at the company recommended WS. Roger Verrall sees potential in almost every area of industry and the growing service robotics market.

WORKSPACE has been developed by a team led by the Author as the world's first industrial robot simulation software package. Since its commercial release in 1989 it has undergone many revisions. With the latest software release (version 3.2) WORKSPACE is in use on over 500 industrial and educational sites world-wide as both a graphic simulation system and a means of off-line programming a robot workcell. Creating and simulating robot programmes. WORKSPACE is a software package which will create and simulate robot programmes in the native language of the robot. For example, users of Fanuc robots may write robot programmes in Karel, ABB robot users may write robot programmes in ARLA. There is therefore no need for postprocessors to translate from a simulation language to the robot language: the full power of the robot language is available to the user through off-line programming. It is also possible to transfer existing robot programmes from the robot controller back into WORKSPACE for optimisation. Off-line programming is therefore a two-way process using WORKSPACE. is This particularly facilitated by the use of portable microcomputers which may be taken down onto the factory floor and used next to a robot workcell. The user first selects the target robot language required. To create a robot programme the user clicks the mouse on robot commands on a pull-down menu. These commands are immediately written to an ASCII text file. In this way a robot programme is created without the necessity for typing the command words, though the user may also use an in-built text editor if desired. As each command is written to the file it is simulated graphically on the computer screen in colour 3d solid graphics. Programmes may be debugged by tracing through line by line seeing at each line what is happening in the simulation. The value of variables may be watched or examined throughout. If an error occurs at any point then the user will immediately be placed in the WORKSPACE text editor at the position in the robot programme where the error occurred, enabling the error to be promptly corrected. Figure 1 - Off-line programming is a two-way process using WORKSPACE The full structure of the robot languages is implemented, including typed variables, teachpoints, subroutines, looping, branching on condition, signals, and condition handler interrupts. Several robots working in co-ordination, each under the control of a separate robot programme, may be simulated to produce one animation.During the simulation of the robot programme any collisions that occur between any objects in the workcell may be automatically reported, and a clock indicates the time taken for the overall sequence of movements. The 3D volume of the envelope may be plotted, or 2D slices through the envelope displayed on the screen. All the main industrial and educational robot languages are implemented, and a library of over 140 robot models is available to the user (though it is also possible for users to create their own robots). The 3D CAD system and kinematics modeller. 3D solid objects (including combinations created using Constructive Solid Geometry) or surfaces (including Bspline, Parametric, or Bezier surfaces) may be created using WORKSPACE's own 3D CAD system, or else imported into WORKSPACE form an external CAD system using the DXF file format (common amongst microcomputer based CAD systems such as AUTOCAD) or the IGES file format (common amongst graphics workstation based CAD systems such as CATIA). The use of an unlimited number of layers for storing different levels of detail makes it possible to turn off the display of object irrelevant to the current task, or display them in wireframe for speed. The movement of any mechanism may be modelled using a kinematics modeller. The mechanism may have any number of joints in any serial or tree-structure combination. Conveyors, automatic vehicles, and other independently moving objects may also be modelled. Defining positions Positions and paths for the robot tool to move to may be defined in several ways. A software emulation of a teach pendant is available to move the robot either by stepping individual joint angles or by stepping the xyz Cartesian position of the tool relative to the robot world co-ordinate frame. Positions may be saved as teachpoints for use later in a robot programme. These are displayed on the screen graphically as co-ordinate frames. If the robot is placed in a different position in the workcell then the teachpoints will change colour if they are no longer achievable due to the limits on the joints of the robot or due to the limited reach of the robot. Positions may also be defined by clicking the mouse at different positions on the computer screen (changing the view if necessary to define a 3D position). Orientations may be defined in many different ways: for example by dragging the approach vector of the teachpoint co-ordinate frame in a particular direction using the mouse. Geometry Points The easiest and most powerful way of defining robot positions is to use the geometry of objects. Points may be defined along the seam between two surfaces in such a way that the position of the point on the seam, the distance of the point from the seam, the lean of the approach vector of the tool towards the seam, or the angle between the adjacent surfaces and the tool approach vector is set by the user. This is of use in applications such as arc-welding. Figure 2 - Defining Geometry points normal to a surface Points may also be defined normal to a surface so that the position on the surface and the distance form the surface to the point is set by the user. As the point is moved over the surface the point is always maintained normal to the surface. This is of use in applications such as spot-welding. Paths to follow a 2D curve may be defined automatically. Straight line and segments of the curve are translated directly into linear and circular motions for the robot tool to follow. This is of use in applications such as water-jet cutting. Calibration Calibration is an important issue in off-line programming and simulation because the resulting robot programme is only as accurate as the model of the workcell. WORKSPACE supports three types of calibration. Calibration of the robot tool involves finding the xyz offset that must be added onto the kinematics of the robot to account for the tool attached to the end of the robot. This uses a procedure in which the robot and tool is moved repeatedly to a fixed location and the resulting teachpoints taken from the robot controller back into WORKSPACE. A multivariable search technique is then used to calculate the tool offset. This procedure may need to be repeated if the tool is knocked out of alignment during use. A similar technique may be used to find the true zero position of the robot. This is necessary since the zero position every joint of the robot is subject to drift during use. The resulting offsets are used to produce a more accurate robot model than the kinematics used on the robot controller itself. Finally, the true position of objects in the workcell may be measured using the robot as a measuring device, and the resulting teachpoints taken back into WORKSPACE and either used to define planes whose intersection redefines vertices or else used to redefine known positions within the model. In the future it is hoped that WORKSPACE will be integrated with a mechanical calibration system for measuring 3D positions within the workcell independently of the robot. Replaying simulations in real-time Simulations may be replayed within WORKSPACE in real-time, but recent advances in animation technology enable even more realistic playback. WORKSPACE simulations may be translated into the FLC file format used by AUTODESK Animator and replayed using a utility at speeds up to 50 frames a second. The resulting full screen animations are so realistic, even on a medium range 486 colour notebook, that it is like looking through a window onto the factory floor. The utility for replaying FLC files will be bundled with the WORKSPACE software. Simulation of Dynamics It is possible to simulate the dynamics of a robot using WORKSPACE for a defined sequence of movements. The equations relating the torques and accelerations at each joint and their interactions for a 6-axis robot are modelled using numerical integration. Two type of controller equation may be used: classical and discrete-time control. The constant multipliers in the controller equations may be modified and the resulting effect on the trajectory examined. The effect of attaching a payload to the end of the robot may also be examined. However, until it is possible to obtain accurate estimates for the mass, inertia matrices, centre of gravity, and controller constants at each joint, dynamics simulation is only of use in demonstrating general principles and obtaining qualitative not quantitative information. The Future For many years robot companies have not been co-operative in providing the information required to accurately simulate the paths generated by the robot controller when moving through via points. Without this information it is difficult for a simulation to provide precise cycle-times. Now, the large Automotive robot users, many of whom have committed themselves irrevocably to off-line programming, are beginning to make it a condition of future robot orders that this information is provided as a black box to the simulation companies. However, simulation and off-line programming will only become widely accepted if there is a change in attitude within the simulation companies, who at present seem unwilling to get involved on the factory floor. Simulation is often carried out on the other side of the factory, or in some cases on the other side of the country. The resulting programmes are then taken down onto the factory floor This is where the problems for the people on the factory floor begin. Reality is seldom the same as a simulation, and the robot programmes usually require modification, but by this time the simulation is being used on the next project. This gap between the factory floor and the simulation is one that WORKSPACE is designed to close, by enabling a portable microcomputer to be taken down onto the factory flood and the simulation to be used next to the robot controller, and by allowing robot programmes to be shuffled backwards and forwards between the simulation and the robot controller as many times as required.

Conclusions 1. Introduction Due to the ever increasing demands placed upon the industrial robot in terms of application requirements involving precise path following, both robot manufacturers and industrial end users require to know the dynamic behaviour of the robotics system. In particular it is becoming critically important to know the precise trajectory taken by the robot tool point ( Ref.1 ). Hence there is a need for a measuring system capable of tracking a selected tool point. The system should be portable have good world accuracy capability, be flexible in its use in terms of velocity range, acceleration range and data capture period, and above all, be affordable. This paper presents such a measuring system which has been the subject of three years intense research conducted by the author and his associates both academic and industrial. fig. 1 2.0 System Concept and Overview. The robot tracking system, ROBOTRAK, utilises three wires, the lengths of which are continually measured over a fast time base using three measuring units placed at known locations in space. A calibration triangle is used to set the location of the measuring units and to set the origin of ROBOTRAK relative to the world co-ordinate system of the robot under test. Knowing the accurate positions of the measuring units relative to each other and the instantaneous position of the robot point can be calculated ( Ref. 2. ) in a Cartesian co-ordinate system based in the measuring unit positions, ( Fig. 1 ). The system equations derived by considering the geometry of the three wires and measuring unit are:- Px = Bx� + Ra� - Rb� 2Bx Py = Cy� + Ra� - Rc� 2Cy Pz� = Ra� - Px� - Py� where : Px, Py and Pz are the instantaneous co-ordinates of the tool point relative to the origin; measuring unit (1). All variables are shown in Fig. 1. Digital signals from the three measuring units are fed to an electronic interface unit which is connected to a PC for data reduction and analysis. The results are presented graphically with hard copies available from a four colour pen plotter. Time histories of position, velocity and acceleration are produced and path plots of any two position axes from the three available generated. ROBOTRAK may be considered to consist of three basic sub-systems ; the measuring units, the electronic interface unit and the computer hardware/software system. ( Ref. 3 ). 3.0 Measuring Units. The three measuring units consist of a storage drum, a pulley fitted with an incremental encoder and a wire guide. All three parts are mounted on a single plate. The storage drum is used as a take up spool for the tensator spring, it is supported on a needle roller bearing and is free to slide on the shaft. The main pulley and encoder unit is assembled on a single turned component which bolts onto the mounting plate. A shaft bolts directly onto the encoder shaft and is supported by the bearing in the encoder and a ball bearing at the pulley end of the shaft. The tensator spring is bolted onto the pulley to supply the drive. Wire is wrapped around the pulley and fed out through the wire guide. It is terminated using a swivel jointed clip. Fig 2. Shows an assembly design drawing of the measuring units used. 4.0 Electronic Interface Unit. The interface unit is a three channel device complete with its own power supply. Three decoding circuits are used to process data from the encoders and input 16 bit values, on request, to a PC through a 1MHz communications bus. The decoding circuit cards are slot mounted in a standard 19 inch rack which also houses the power supply. 4.1. Decoding Circuits. These circuits consist of essentially 4 I.C's. a) LS 2000 Direction discriminator b) LS 373 Octal D type latches. c) LS 138 Decoders/multiplexor. d) LS 14 Hex Schmitt-trigger inverters The outputs to the circuits are connected to the 1 MHz bus. Operation is relatively simple. The LS 2000 keeps track of the encoder value. On receiving the correct signal on the 1 MHz bus (fed through the LS 138 multiplexor ) the value is latched by the LS 373 and can be read by the PC. The circuit is an 8 bit circuit so that two " reads " are needed to get a complete 16 bit encoder value. The latching of all circuits is performed when encoder 1 is read. This ensures that all three values are taken at the same time. The values can then be read into the PC. Reading the following addresses; in the PC performs the following :- Address &FCOO Latches all lsb and reads lsb enc. 1. &FCO1 Reads lsb enc. 2. &FCO2 Reads lsb enc. 3. &FCO4 Latches all msb and reads msb enc. 1. &FCO5 Reads msb enc. 2. &FCO6 Reads msb enc. 3. A line diagram of the circuit is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. 5.0 Computer Hardware/Software. The function of this sub-system is to receive 16 bit numbers from the 3 channel electronic interface unit. To pre-process, store and data reduce this information and produce graphical output in a usable format. 5.1 Computer Hardware. An IBM PC compatible 386 with 40MB hard disk and 2 MB of RAM 5.2 System Software. The system software consists of a suite of programmes in Windows(tm) used to run and calibrate ROBOTRAK. The software is menu driven and functions are selected by either a mouse or user defined function keys. Fig. 4. shows the menu selection flowchart. On start up, the system automatically selects the Introduction menu. Introduction Menu Three options are presented :- 1. Set up Parameters. - This option is used to define the test routine to be used and under what filename the data is to be stored. On selection a Parameter Menu is entered. 2. Perform Test. - This option is used to actually record the data. The test routine being defined as previously defined in the Parameter menu. The user is given the option to Rezero the encoders prior to the test routine being performed. If it is suspected that the counters have been reset while the wires have been connected to the robot at any stage, this option must be followed. ( Pressing the Break key resets the 1 MHz bus and hence the counters to zero ). The test routine is then performed and a Testing Menu offered on completion of the test. 3. Analyse the Results. - This option is for processing the stored data and selecting the output required. Parameter Menu ( Set up Parameters ). This menu allows the operator to set the following test parameters. 1. Filename. - The filename for storing results. A maximum of 5 characters will be accepted. 2. Sample Rate. - The data sampling rate can be set within the range of 200 to 1000 readings per second. 3. Test Length. - Up to a maximum of 4000 points can be recorded. The maximum allowable time in seconds for the chosen sampling rate is displayed. 4. Start Mode. - Three start modes are available : M - manual mode starts on pressing the spacebar of the computer. A - Automatic mode starts when motion of the robot is sensed. E - External mode utilises an external trigger connected to the User Port of the Microcomputer to trigger the recording. 5. Comments. - A string of up to 30 characters can be added to define the test. These can be printed by the plotter if required. Once all the parameters have been set the user can change them simply by pressing the appropriate function key and re-entering the data. When the parameters are correct F6 returns the user to the Introductions Menu. Testing Menu( Perform Test ) This is entered by selecting the second option of the Introduction Menu. The user is first given the option to reset the counters and then the test is performed. On completion of the test, three options are available :- 1. Redo - Allows the operator to re-run the test. 2. Save - Validates the date, calculates the Cartesian co-ordinates of the end effector of the robot and stores the results in the file name specified by the parameter Menu. This procedure takes approximately 60 seconds/250 points. 3. Quit. - Returns the user to the introduction menu without saving the data. Plot Menu Selection This menu is entered on selecting the third option of the introduction menu if no previous screen are available for analysis. It is used to define the starting screen for the analysis. The first menu offers two options :- 1. Time - Plots against time 2. Plane - Plots views of the Cartesian planes. On selecting the Time option the following options are available :- 1. X-T X position against time 2. Y-T Y position against time 3. Z-T Z position against time 4. V-T Velocity against time 5. A-T Acceleration against time On selecting the Plane option the following views are offered:- 1. X-Y 2. Y-Z 3. Z-X On completion of the selection the axes are plotted and the user is returned to the Control Menu. Control Menu( Analyse the Results ) This is the main menu for the analysis of the data. It allows the operator to define files to plot graphs, to draw and scaling of axes. Five options are available :- 1. Windo - Allows one to change the graph shown, either to a different scale or to different axes. 2. Hcopy - Gives a hard copy of the results. Copy Menu is presented. 3. Nwfil - Defines filenames to be plotted. Inputting * and tapping "Shift" will scroll through the filenames currently available on disk. 4. Erase - Deletes one of the currently selected files. 5. Quit - Returns to the Introduction Menu. Window Menu 1. Draw - A box can be drawn around any part of the plot to be enlarged. 2. Specify - The axes range can be specified numerically. 3. Reset - Resets the axes scales to the default sizes. 4. Plane - Selects a new graph to be plotted. See Plot Selection Menus. 5. Quit - Returns to the Control Menu and replots the data without changing the data. This can be used in the event of a system failure to return to the previously plotted screen. Copy Menu 1. Print - Dumps the current screen to a printer. 2. Plot - Selects output for a colour plotter. Two further options are given in this mode: 1. New - Sets the plotter for a paper change. 2. Old - Plots over the old graph. On selecting New any sheet in the plotter will be ejected and the user prompted to insert a new sheet. 6.0 Measured Performance Specification In order to validate the output results from ROBOTRAK, performance trials were conducted. Particular trajectories of known velocity and acceleration were set up under laboratory conditions and the ROBOTRAK system used to measure these. The output from ROBOTRAK was then compared against these known values. From these trials ROBOTRAK was found to conform to the following performance specifications. Static repeatability Better than �0.2mm within 2m x 2m x 1.2m Variable path �0.32mm within 2m x 2m x 0.7m Dynamic repeatability Same path same speed �0.5mm with 2m� Same path variable velocity �0.7mm within 2m� Maximum allowable velocity = 4m/s Maximum allowable acceleration = 10m/s� 7.0 Robot Test Examples. Representative test data obtained during trials on a Unimation Puma 560 are shown in Figs 5 - 11. A simple rectangle path was programmed by teaching the Puma Robot four points. The plane of the rectangle was set perpendicular to the x - y plane of ROBOTRAK, and at 45 degrees to the x axis. The Puma program was set for continuous motion, with no delay or settling times set at the taught points, with the exception of the start / stop point. This was chosen to show the effect of tracking around smooth corner radii. Plots of x against z, y against z and x against y are shown in Figs 5, 6 and 7 respectively. Time histories of x against T and y against T were also plotted and can be seen in Figs 8 and 9 respectively. Both velocity and acceleration profile plots were produced and are shown in Figs 10 and 11. These two plots show clearly the effect of tracking the corner radii, with the larger peak representing the start / stop point. 8.0 Conclusions The ROBOTRAK, robot dynamic tracking system presented here has been extensively used for the assessing the performance characteristics of industrial robots both within the GRAG laboratory at Cranfield and "on-site" at various industrial establishments.

With the introduction of WORKSPACE 3.0, these pre-requisites can be achieved with considerable savings to the small and medium sized customer, without sacrificing quality, but achieving economy of scale. We will show how the use of simulation can aid each step of the process from the development of an idea to the programming of the final choice of robot. In each instance an example from a case study will be shown from a number of applications and questions may be asked. The need for Simulation The techniques of computer aided design (CAD) have found extensive use in improving or replacing the process of engineering drawing, architectural drawing and many other applications. However, an engineering process involving many more moving parts can only be fully understood through the process of simulation. Early developments in this field have involved the computer controlled machining centres using existing CAD systems. Additional software is used to take the original CAD engineering drawing of a machined part and analyse a path across its surface. An animated simulation of the movements a machining centre must go through to create the part from a "raw" block is then displayed. As well as providing a visualisation of the process, a file can be created containing the required instructions to the machining centre. The file can then be executed to create the part. This extension of computer aided design to computer aided manufacture is highly applicable to industrial robotics. Simulation provides an efficient interactive graphical environment in which to improve the way industrial robots are programmed. Ever-increasing numbers of robot installations are now being planned using computer simulation. Only a few years ago the cost of technology to achieve these aims was prohibitive for all but the largest organisations. However, as with CAD before it, simulation, calibration and programming of industrial robots is possible even on a standard low-cost PC compatible computer. A software package called WORKSPACE, conceived, designed and developed by the UK company Robot Simulations Ltd., can be used to create a robot installation at a fraction of the cost of existing systems. This talk uses WORKSPACE as an example to show how simulation , calibration and programming can assist the implementation of an automation project. Using a Robot Simulation WORKSPACE was primarily intended as a visualisation aid for those engineers and managers involved in the process of designing and debugging new or existing robot installations. Benefits such as the ability to detect off-line collisions between robots and objects, and ability to evaluate and optimise the time taken for a sequence of movements off-line have proved major incentives for the investment in robot simulation. The core of WORKSPACE and the more expensive systems is the 3D CAD modeller. A workcell or even a full manufacturing facility containing a number of work cells can be effectively drawn on the screen, or object geometry's may be imported from a commercial CAD package ( AutoCad ) via a standard graphics Data Exchange File ( DXF ). The next step is to install a robot or robots into the model. A library of over 100 industrial and educational robots is available for WORKSPACE, thus allowing an engineer to experiment with different configurations in the prototype workcell by simply loading a robot from a disk. A standard robot may be selected from the library and placed in position. The user may also design their own, new robot modelling the "flesh" with the CAD system and defining the mechanical linkages. WORKSPACE then creates the kinematics model for the new robot. Operating parameters such as actual scale size, velocities, accelerations and joint limits are all simulated. A robot program can then be created, simulated and downloaded. Robot programmes are created by selecting the required operating language from the pull down menu system and interaction with the model using the mouse pointer. The graphical interface is considerably more intuitive than most numerically based robot operating systems. For example, it is possible to define a robot position relative to the model by pointing at a position with the mouse. The robot tool might then be automatically reorientated so that it is normal to the plain of the object face - a feature which is particularly useful in surface type applications. Commands are also available to carry out more complex tasks at the click of the mouse cursor. Some examples include paint spraying or applying glue evenly over a given surface , welding along seams or grasping an object. By using these commands it is possible to write a program very quickly. These progammes are then used firstly to move a robot in the model to produce a realistic animation, in shading of the 3D objects due to an arbitrary light source. Features such as conveyors, robots mounted on traverse units, carousels, AGV's, and machine tools may also be simulated. There is no limit to the number of programmes to be run concurrently on any number of robots or their associated machinery. The resulting command information will be combined by the software to produce one complete integrated simulation. Collision between objects in the work cell are reported as they occur, a critically important feature from the safety point of view. WORKSPACE calculates the time taken for each event within the model and displays the total as a "cycle time ". By rearranging the work cell or experimenting with different robots and end effectors on the simulation, this cycle time can be reduced to a minimum, thereby maximising the number of production cycles that may be achieved during a working day. Once the robot program has been defined and evaluated using WORKSPACE it can be down loaded direct to the robot controller without the need to use a postprocessor. Traditional methods of re-programming a robot would inevitably mean that production in that cell must stop for a considerable time. In addition, programming may have been by a teach pendant, involving an unacceptable degree of human error. By first simulating then downloading, downtime can be reduced to the time it takes to load a new program onto the controller from disk. This is one of the major benefits of robot simulation. Robot Simulation: Problems and Solutions The kinematics involved in robot movement is far more complex that those related to XYZ machining centres, and the relationship between the curves swept by the robot end - effector and the joint variables is not straightforward. Additionally, for a robot simulation to be of general use it must be capable of simulating a wide variety of robot types and configurations. Perhaps because of this the most beneficial simulations are not those that are originally drafted by using a CAD system with additional "robot kinematics" software but those that are specifically designed to cope with the demands of complex robot structures. To calculate the position of the joints required to achieve a given tool position and orientation it is necessary to use a complex mathematical algorithm. Most simulations provide algorithms for the major robot types. Unfortunately these algorithms do not always function in an identical way to those used on the robot controller ( for example, in the selection of when to point an elbow up or down, or how to deal with degenerate cases when axes are aligned ). Robot manufacturers tend to be reluctant to release information like this (if they know themselves) to a third party simulation company, even under a non-disclosure agreement. This can mean that a robot program can appear satisfactory when simulated on screen can have an occasional unforeseen change of configuration when implemented in the real world. The answer to this that any computer simulation cannot be a substitute for acting with caution the first time a robot cycle is implemented in a work cell, as safety is a primary concern. "Off-line" Programming WORKSPACE now provides the user with a unique facility for translating from a simulation system language to a robot language. This process is not a simple task. Usually the user would need a post processor to translate not only the simple structures such as movement commands, but also more complex structures such as condition handlers, repeat until, while do,subroutines and variables. There are very few established standards, as the robot manufacturers are fiercely loyal to their own operating systems over those of their competitors. WORKSPACE uses a highly sophisticated robot simulation language in order to create a compact efficient program. This language contains all the important program structures mentioned above plus a large number of functions and routines which are specific to manipulating robots. For example it is possible to perform a pick and place task by simply naming the object to be moved, specifying the position you wish to place it and calling a routine to calculate all the intermediate moves. WORKSPACE has a number of robot languages in a library, as with the robots, when performing the simulation and at the start of programming the correct robot language for the model is drawn from the menu and the translation is carried out simultaneously. To transfer the program files from the PC computer running the simulation to the robot controller it is necessary to use a communication link or by copying the files onto a disk compatible with the robot controller. Again, this is an area which has few standards. Even the "standard" RS232 serial port poses problems of electrical wiring and protocol methods. However, once a link has been established it is possible to receive information from the controller and translate into the simulation language without the need of a preprocessor, thus allowing the robot program to be evaluated and improved. Model Accuracy It must be remembered that a simulation of a robot work cell is only as accurate as the model of the workcell. Careful measurements of objects in the real world must be made, before entering the parameters to the CAD model. One way further of improving the accuracy of a simulation is to use the robot as a measuring device. A probe is attached to the robot endpoint and moved to corners of key positions in the workcell. The datum or calibration points could then be loaded into the model and used to reposition objects in the model relative to the robot. Production Time When planning a factory lay-out, robot simulation is only part of the story. The values for cycle times given in a workcell assumes that there are no bottlenecks elsewhere in the production process. Scheduling simulations are available to allow the whole flow of materials to be modelled, through modelling robot workcells as "black box" components. What is needed is the complete integration of scheduling and robot simulation, so that ever more accurate figures for average production time may be obtained. WORKSPACE has allowed for this in its'. "User CAll" facility. Future Developments Simulation has now a major impact on the type of software supplied with robots to users, with most major manufacturers taking a strong interest in marketing their own branded simulations or off-line programming systems. The graphical interface and user friendliness of WORKSPACE has highlighted the inadequacy of todays user-hostile text based robot operating systems. WORKSPACE is capable of running many different robots from different suppliers in the same workcell. It is now possible to use a graphical simulation system used as a robot operating system with a simple "point and click" selection of robot target positions. New robot tasks can be programmed in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks. The promise of flexible automation is yet to be fully realised, but the expectation of the user for simulation software as reliable as the software used for word processing is the target that Robot Simulations Limited set and is achieving.

These cover levels are not available with budget family plans.Any child covered through Child Care may, on reaching their 20th birthday, convert their plan into an adult plan. The benefit of this facility, is that all conditions that have occurred during their period of cover under Child Care, will now be covered by their adult plan. Designed for the family who require comprehensive protection for their children.On reaching their 20th birthday, convert their plan into an adult plan with all existing conditions covered. How Does It Work? You will receive a contract of cover, together with a list of selected hospitals, abooklet on how to make a claim, and a MEDICUS Identity Card. Keep these in a safe place as you will need this documentation when making a claim. Medical treatment cover will only be valid if you first call a counsellor and pre-authorise your claim. As soon as your GP recommends specialist treatment or consultation or even hospitalisation, you must speak to a counsellor. If you wish to claim for a cash payment, this must also be authorised in advance of treatment. So must the covering of parental accommodation. Remember that your children cannot be covered for a pre-existing or congenital condition or any condition arising from pre-existing or congenital conditions. Chronic conditions are also excluded. This plan does not cover cosmetic, dental or fertility treatment nor does it cover treatment relating to child birth. (For the full list of exclusions, refer to the Certificate Wording) Remember that treatment must take place in a selected hospital unless you have received special pre-authorisation to the contrary. This authorisation is only granted for reason of medical necessity. What does it cover? Please refer to the Benefit Schedule overleaf for a full description of benefits. What does it cost? The monthly premium for insuring one child is �20.50. The cost is halved to �10.25 for the second and any subsequent children.

Select the most suitable Plan for your needs. Remember if applying on behalf of your family that each individual member can select a different plan. As a guide to the benefit schedule the plans available are listed on the page headed 'The MEDICUS Range of Plans', which should be read carefully before making your choice. Check the Premium Schedule for the rate appropriate to your age. You will note that there are two Premium Schedules for each Plan. The first is headed 'Rates for Individuals' and the second 'Membership Rates'. Rates for Individuals indicate the monthly premium for the plan you select. Membership Rates enable you to reduce the overall cost of your plan, however, to qualify for the membership rates you must pay an annual membership premium in the first month of each year as indicated on the rate chart, followed by reduced monthly premiums. This annual premium will automatically be deducted by Direct Debit in the first month of every year of your plan. If you prefer, in the initial year of joining, payment of the membership premium may be made by cheque payable to Medicus Family Care Ltd. Membership reduces the overall cost of insurance over the course of twelve months BUT IS NOT REFUNDABLE. The CHILD CARE plan, available for parents wishing to cover only their children, has just two rates: �20.50 per month for the first child and �10.25 per month for the second and any subsequent children. Add together the monthly premiums selected for each member of your family to determine your total monthly premium. Remember that the direct debit deductions in the first month of each full year of cover will include the annual premium for membership if this option is chosen. (Annual membership premiums may be paid by cheque in the first year).

Different plans offer widely differing ranges of protection. The cheapest premiums often indicate very limited cover. It can lead to financial disaster to imagine you are fully covered only to find out too late that you are not. We suggest the following questions should always be asked when considering Private Medical Insurance. Q. When I have a legitimate claim do I have to pay any part of that claim myself ? A. Some companies ask you to pay the first part of each and every claim. Some companies place limits on the amount you can claim for any particular form of treatment or condition. Although these restrictions will bring down the cost of your insurance, MEDICUS believes this to be the wrong approach and places no limit on claims for eligible treatment and charges no excess on eligible claims. We prefer to control costs by efficient and effective administrative procedures. Q. Am I covered for costs both in and out of hospital ? A. Some plans exclude cover unless you are actually in hospital. Some only cover you for treatment that leads to hospitalisation. Although you may be able to afford to pay your own consultancy fees, you should remember that you will probably visit a consultant or have out patient treatment far more often than you are likely to be admitted to hospital. MEDICUS believes out patient specialist consultations and out patient treatment to be a major part of full medical cover and puts no limits on the amount you can claim for eligible treatment in these areas. Q. Do I qualify for private cover if the NHS can treat me quickly ? A. With some plans you do and with some you do not. Many plans only offer cover if the NHS cannot treat you within six weeks. This inevitably means that the more serious conditions tend to be treated by the NHS and your cover does not come into effect. MEDICUS believes that private treatment offers both speed and greater comfort and privacy. When we are seriously ill, that comfort and privacy becomes even more important. Speed of treatment is always important, but full cover should also guarantee private treatment for every eligible condition. MEDICUS covers you for every eligible condition whether or not the NHS can treat you quickly. Q. What is eligible treatment ? A. All plans exclude certain conditions. These include chronic illnesses, cosmetic treatment, treatment by a General Practitioner and treatment for self imposed conditions. In these respects, MEDICUS is much in line with other plans. We, naturally, have to exclude a condition that existed prior to application. Most plans place you in a hospital �band�. If you want treatment available in the most expensive hospitals you will be asked to pay higher premiums. Many plans exclude the most expensive hospitals altogether. If you choose, or need to be treated in a hospital outside your band, you will be expected to pay the difference in cost yourself. Where your condition is best treated in a hospital outside your band this can produce a serious dilemma. You will have either to pay the difference, settle for another hospital or rely on the NHS. MEDICUS entitles you to treatment in over 100 nominated hospitals countrywide (seepage 6 for full explanation). The only restriction on the consultant you use is that he must be prepared to use one of our Preferred Hospitals. However, if your condition requires you to go to a hospital outside this list, for medical reasons, then subject to prior authorisation, you are fully covered and you pay nothing yourself. We believe this system offers greater protection than the banded system. As long as you understand and use the system correctly you will never have to pay one penny for an eligible claim with PRIORITY CARE, even if your condition requires treatment in the most expensive hospital. Q. When I need treatment, how can I be sure I am covered ? A. Experience has shown that with some plans the answer is that you cannot be sure. Once you have had the treatment and made a claim, there is often little you can do if you discover that for some reason your claim is not eligible. MEDICUS, through our administrators, offer a counselling service to help with this problem. You must speak to one of our counsellors as soon as your General Practitioner recommends treatment or consultation. In this way your claim is authorised in advance and there is never any chance of unexpected bills. Q. What happens in the case of a dispute ? A. Unlike most plans, with MEDICUS your contract is directly with Lloyd�s Underwriters. This means that should you not agree with any decision made, you have direct access to the Insurance Ombudsman. Of course we hope and believe this will never happen, but it is always comforting to know your rights are independently protected in this way at all times.

Certificate of Insurance Should you wish a specimen copy will be made available prior to purchase. Please read this document carefully as it contains the full details of what is and is not covered and the conditions of the cover. Your certificate will be issued upon receipt of the appropriate premium. Conditions, Exclusions and Warranties These limit or restrict the cover provided. Some apply to all sections of the insurance whilst others only apply to specific sections. Health The insurance contains conditions that relate to your health and that of others not necessarily travelling with you but upon whose well being the trip may depend. In particular pre-existing medical problems may not always be covered. Claims for Personal Baggage The insurance does not provide cover on a 'new for old basis'. This means that claims will be paid on the basis of the value of your property at the time of the loss. Sums Insured or Limits All sections of the insurance have a limit on the amount the Insurer will pay. Some sections have internal limits such as the amount the Insurer will pay for any one item or the total amount for all valuables (including photographic equipment). You are advised to check these limits if you intend taking expensive items with you. Excesses Under most sections of the insurance, claims will be subject to an excess. This means that you will be responsible for paying part of the claim. The amount you have to pay is the excess. Reasonable Care You are required to take all reasonable care to protect yourself and your property and to act at all times as though you are not insured. High Risk Activities The insurance may not cover you when you take part in certain sports or activities where there is a high risk of injury. You must check that the insurance covers your requirements. Complaints The insurance contains a procedure which tells you what steps to take should you wish to make a complaint. Jurisdiction The insurance will be subject to English Law unless you and your Insurers agree otherwise. 'Cooling Off Period' If the insurance does not meet your requirements you may return the documentation within 14 days of purchase or prior to travel if this is sooner and provided no claim has been made, obtain a refund The Insurers of this Plan are selected syndicates at Lloyd's of London.

MEDICUS administrators, Managed Care Consultants Ltd., negotiate procedural price limits with leading Private Hospitals throughout the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. These hospitals are selected on the basis of the quality of their medical facilities, accommodation and their geographical suitability. A MEDICUS client will normally be within easy reach of a Preferred Hospital. This pricing co-operation from the hospitals concerned greatly assists in controlling premium levels. Under normal circumstances a client will attend one of these "Preferred Hospitals", which number over 100 but this will not be mandatory if the client has genuine medical reasons for needing to attend another hospital not on our list, providing that authorisation has been obtained from Managed Care Consultants Ltd. Apart from reducing premium levels, the use of Preferred Hospitals allows our client the benefit of direct billing and the assurance of quality accommodation and medical services. The use of Preferred Hospitals ensures our clients receive both the highest levels of comfort associated with private care, together with access to specialised medical centres when medical circumstances make this necessary. It enables us to give our clients better value for money today and help to control costs in the future. This system also allows access, without inpatient limits, to any hospital in the country on the basis of medical necessity.

To increase the deductible please reduce the premium applicable to each insured person by the following percentages: To increase the deductible to $250 - reduce the premium by 5% To increase the deductible to $500 - reduce the premium by 10% To increase the deductible to $1,000 - reduce the premium by 25% BUDGET PLAN Coverage per person MEDICAL EXPENSES up to $150,000 PERSONAL ACCIDENT up to $10,000. Covers costs and expenses incurred in the USA or Canada only. This plan is ideally suited to those persons who are temporarily based in the USA/Canada and/or have family who remain in the country for which passports are held but in any event for those persons who have continued to pay national/state contributions or who have medical expense arrangements in the country for which they hold a passport. This is an important aspect of the Budget Plan as when medically necessary an injured or sick person will be compulsorily repatriated. Repatriation shall be deemed necessary if a qualified medical practitioner estimates that hospitalisation shall be in excess of four weeks. Following repatriation medical expense reimbursement shall cease under the plan. If however a full recovery is made during the period of cover, as certified by a qualified medical practitioner, this plan shall pay the cost of one economy class transportation back to the USA/Canada whereupon coverage may be reinstated. STANDARD PLAN Coverage per person MEDICAL EXPENSES up to $750,000 PERSONAL ACCIDENT up to $15,000 Cover as per BUDGET PLAN but including costs and expenses incurred anywhere in the world excluding the country for which a passport is held. Compulsory repatriation is not a condition of cover under the STANDARD PLAN. SUPER PLAN Coverage per person MEDICAL EXPENSES up to $1,500,000 PERSONAL ACCIDENT up to $20,000 Cover as STANDARD PLAN plus 90 days HOMECOVER (up to $75,000) whilst temporarily in the country for which a passport is held.

Which educational program taught entirely by robots got a Presidential Award at the White House? Which robot attended more than 80 colleges without once turning in a paper on time? What company has operated robots for TV, museums, tradeshows, shopping malls and events since 1979? The fact is that hundreds of schools, corporations, colleges, malls and museums already use robots to teach, entertain and market. This site is about robots called Electronic Personalities or EPs. But unlike robots in science fiction movies, EP robots are real. And all the robots you�ll see here (with one exception!) are available for your special applications now, anywhere in the world. What are Electronic Personalities (EPs)? If you�re new to RoboMedia, we recommend starting here. EP robots are the ultimate multi-media communication tools. Not to mention good looking! But don�t take our word for it, you�ll find info on EP capabilities, designs, customization and more here. Who uses Electronic Personalities (EPs)? If you�ve already had a "close encounter" with EP robots, this is the next stop. Since 1979, millions of people have personally met EPs and thousands of corporations, schools, foundations and individuals have used these fully interactive robotic characters to educate, market and entertain. We hope you�re next! Quick Index! If you�re looking for something specific at our site, this fast-loading list of features and topics will get you there pronto! Copyright 1996, GoWell & Kent, Inc.

"Hi! It�s me, PJ, your personal tour guide! You�re about to find out about the most amazing robotic multi-media communication tools in the world; Electronic Personalities or EPs for short. This medium was developed by more than 17 years of field experience. The high-tech robotic characters that you�ll see here actually have high-touch personalities that give them magnetic crowd pleasing abilities. And that brings us to two important facts: Numero Uno: Remember that what makes this technology so exciting is that it�s real! All the robots you�ll meet here can work for you at your location NOW! Um, except me. I�m just a cartoon! Numero Two-oh: Nothing you�ll see or read about at this site can compare with meeting and interacting with an EP in person! Let�s start with this computer rendering of an EP robot:" Here�s a quick menu linking to specific EP information on this page: What�s a close encounter with an EP really like? What are some of their "high-tech" features? Why are EP robots terrific communication tools? Who are some EP "Stars" I might recognize? Who builds EPs (and how do I get my hands on one)? How do people and companies use EP robots? What�s a close encounter with an EP really like? Like all great communicators, EPs engage people with warm, entertaining personalities. And their "high-touch" style goes way beyond the limitations of passive electronic mediums so audiences have a truly unforgettable encounter: 100% interactive - EP robots respond instantly and often spontaneously. They may be cute, humorous, clever, serious or loving, but they always get their message across. 100% mobile - These robots are fast and they perform on any smooth, hard surface. They move through doors and crowds with absolute precision, allowing them to go from location to location quickly. This means that a single EP can cover a large area with ease. EPs can also travel to multiple show locations in a single day using a custom van. EPs speak your language - Whatever it is! Custom scripting and program preparation lets our clients use EPs to interact with any audience: young or old, in any language, from any cultural background. The ultimate software - They say clothes make the man. We apply that to robots. All EPs have soft fabric accessories like hands, hats and upholstered "laps" (to sit on for photos!). Even the youngest kids have fun shaking hands and getting hugs from EPs. A close encounter of the best kind - Meeting an EP is magical and memorable. We hope you�ll have the opportunity soon! What are some of their "high tech" features? These babies are loaded with options to give them robotic charm and help them interact and communicate with humans: Design - Colorful and complex geometric shapes, flashing lights and plenty of visible electronic components satisfy even the most hard-core Popular Mechanics reader. Powerful sound systems - EPs bring their own on-board mobile sound system that adjusts for any venue. So, if an EP is teaching a group of 250 excited children in a school gym, leading a group of visitors through a science museum, entertaining shoppers in a mall or promoting products at a trade show, the audience hears the message loud and clear. Digital music & sound effects - EPs are equipped with 200 watt sound systems, which is usually plenty (and we would be happy to build one with "More power!" for you Home Improvement fans). In addition to digital quality, the systems also offer digital flexibility so EPs can quickly add new music and effects for special presentations. Printed material dispenser - EPs distribute coupons, stickers, pamphlets and just about any type of flat printed material. Also, they can distribute multiple types of materials at the same time, for example a sticker to a child and a brochure to the parent. Programmable L.E.D. display - Everyone likes to see their name in lights. This bright LED display is how EPs convey written information. Fine Corinthian Leather - Coming in �97. 100% Mechanical Warranty - This feature may sound funny, unless you ever bought another robot for your company. We learned to build our robots to deliver reliable service at every performance, year after year. If we didn�t, we couldn�t make this guarantee. Why are EP robots terrific communication tools? Because they use the most powerful communication methods possible. EPs convey information using verbal, visual, auditory, written, kinetic, and kinesthetic techniques. All of which are entirely interactive from the EP platform. This multimedia versatility makes these robots outstanding for education, marketing and entertainment. Other key points are: Unique medium - How do you break through the information clutter to deliver your message? Teachers, corporations, museums and the media all face the challenge of delivering their messages in a highly competitive environment. EPs deliver information in an interactive way that�s entirely new and a way that people remember. Unlimited language capability - Like a television or computer, EPs are a communications medium that let�s you deliver your message in any language and directed to any type of audience. Our clients decide the EP�s script, jargon, language and message. Unlimited cultural appeal - One thing we�ve discovered in using robots is that they appeal to all types of people. They aren�t from any specific ethnic group so they appeal to all of them. People actually project their own cultural roots onto the robot making EPs true ambassadors of good will that can cross any cultural boundary. Who are some EP "Stars" I might recognize? We�ve promised all our robots their own personal home pages, causing a lot of commotion in our shop. But, such frivolities will take time. While we�re waiting for them to make up improbable stories about themselves and have professional portraits taken and retouched, our founding robot has taken a few moments to put some facts together: Foobie D. Robot Home Page If you�ve seen any of our EPs on TV or in the news, chances are it was Foobie. Check him out! Who builds EPs (and how do I get my hands on one)? GoWell & Kent Inc.

He claimed to have come to Earth from the planet Cragzot in the star system of Betelgeuse where he allegedly "built himself". His story is unconfirmed to this day. 1979 - In December, FUBAR aka Foobie became the first robotic Presidential Candidate when he held a press conference at the National Press Building in Washington DC. AP and UPI wire stories were published by newspapers around the world. FUBAR mysteriously withdrew from the race in early November 1980. FUBAR stated he was "leaving the race to the other three robots", not to mention leaving millions of voters undecided on the eve of the election. 1980 - On July 14, FUBAR D. Robot became the first and only robot to gain membership in AFTRA (the American Federation of Television and Radio Actors). To our knowledge, no other robot has received this honor to this day. Note: Other robots like C3PO and R2D2 are not union members - only the human actors that operate them are! 1983-84 - FUBAR signs an exclusive contract with the William Morris Agency to appear on NBC�s hit sitcom, Silver Spoons, with Ricky Schroeder. 1983 - A year of scandal for FUBAR in Hollywood. In June, the National Enquirer runs a photo of him with Hugh Hefner�s former wife Barbie Benton on his knee. That same week, Star runs a photo of him with Donna Mills on his knee. Shortly thereafter, Brandon Tartikoff directs FUBAR to officially change his name to Foobie following a short lesson in Archaic Military Acronyms from a friend. 1985 - Foobie left his acting career to devote his efforts to the field of education and public service. He continues his work today, constantly making personal appearances throughout the US. E-MAIL Foobie! Foobie loves to get mail and tries to answer each message. You can say hi to Foobie!

This page describes how corporations use high visibility robotic communicators to market products and services. This breakthrough in interactive media guarantees: More powerful consumer impressions More memorable special events More effective sales promotions More community interaction And excellent media visibility A quick robotic review Since 1979, Electronic Personalities or EP robots have fascinated Europeans and North Americans with live performances. Their intriguing combination of "high tech" robotic looks and "high touch" interactive personalities holds proven appeal for all types of audiences and all age groups. EP robots have made millions of direct consumer marketing contacts. They�ve also produced millions of dollars worth of positive media coverage for corporate sponsors. Customized robot mascots are a unique medium to promote a corporation�s image and message to the public. This page is about corporate marketing and public relations campaigns that use robots. You can also visit a separate site about how robots energize meetings, company events, tradeshows, family days and parties. What type of robot program is most effective? The most effective format we�ve found to get corporate marketing and PR results is Educational Outreach Marketing or EOM. EOM format benefits include: High corporate visibility Unforgettable contacts with children, families, government officials and the media. Economical - adaptable to different budgets Highly mobile - adaptable to different markets Easily targeted to specific areas and demographics Immediate, measurable consumer and media feedback Unique program that competitors can�t copy Enhanced community image and interaction How do robot outreach programs work? EOM programs use three components customized to a company's specific marketing and PR objectives: Sponsor relevant educational message: Custom programs and materials include information about health, home safety, environmental issues, or other important topics the sponsor chooses. Custom corporate mascot robots: These unique corporate representatives deliver entertaining interactive presentations throughout any target market area. Community service format: Giving educational robot presentations to appropriate groups is what makes EOM work well. Corporations gain visibility and direct consumer contacts while providing a valuable community service. Where do corporations use robotic representatives? A company's marketing objectives and format determine the most effective final venues. Sites already hosting robotic outreach presentations for companies include: Community events Convention centers Museums Local television and radio studios Public & private elementary schools Shopping malls and retail locations Universities and colleges What corporations use robots successfully? Although robotic media is still in its infancy, it has attracted many well known corporate clients. CNN, Good Morning America and The Today Show, local newcasts and newspapers around the world have all featured corporate robot programs.

Then, a major industry journal published a study showing that while the company excelled in a number of important areas, it had virtually no image of community service. The client was especially concerned with positive public recognition at that time as they were about to go public and the owners were trying to pre-sell blocks of stock to institutional investors. The company had 72 regional locations representing nearly 1000 retail outlets in 19 states. They needed a PR program that would work well from coast to coast. To save costs, the program also had to give each of their regional administrators the tools and skills needed to mount their own local media, public relations and government outreach campaigns. Experience: The client hired G&K to design and implement a series of national and local marketing programs over a 9 year period. The Educational Outreach Marketing segment of the program ran from 1988 to 1992 and provides an excellent example of multiple location promotion with robots. Results: The client set clear objectives . . . and exceeded them! In the program�s first year, the client donated educational programs to targeted local schools taught by their robot mascots. By the program�s conclusion, more than 1,000,000 children and their families had direct contact with the client�s custom robotic mascots and promotional materials. Their generous support of local education was amply rewarded. The client�s ad agency media counts showed that the robot mascot was a magnet for positive media coverage. The media return alone exceeded the client�s first year program costs by 2 to 1. CNN gave the client international coverage with a 3 1/2 minute spot that ran 24 times. The spot identified the client and prominently featured their custom robot mascot. Their mascot also appeared on the Today Show and in hundreds of local media spots. All told, the client�s positive media coverage nationwide was worth more than $2,000,000, much of it in front page feature articles. Principals, teachers, parents and children sent the client more than 30,000 personal letters of appreciation. Perhaps more significant were the letters of praise sent by Senators, Congressional Representatives, Governors and Mayors. State proclamations applauding the client�s contributions were passed in California, Maryland, Texas and Florida, followed by dozens of city proclamations. The client�s most distinguished recognition came from President Bush in the program�s third year. At a special White House ceremony, the program was presented a Presidential Award for Private Sector Initiatives. And there were enormous results within their own field. In 1990, the client�s community service program got them a standing ovation from peers at the industry�s annual conference. They went on to win the highest professional award in their industry for Marketing Excellence. The client finally retired their award winning EOM program after their successful public stock offering in 1992. Back to Corporate Clients |Next Example Copyright 1996, GoWell & Kent, Inc.

The strategy had to be unique to set their plans apart from area health care providers that were competing for the same customers. The plans also wanted the option to have different levels of program involvement, from considerable local staff participation to having a turnkey operation that would run itself. The method needed to be flexible enough to use at a variety of special events. Finally, the program must actually educate and promote good heath to fulfill a key component of their Mission Statement Experience: Health plans in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California have met these challenges by using G&K�s Educational Outreach Marketing programs for more than 8 years. A custom EP robot visits local schools presenting a scientifically validated health curriculum to area students. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, an advertising agency administrates the program and creates learning materials for distribution to schools and families. The custom robot mascots also make regular appearances at many public events on the client�s behalf. Results: Robots deliver excellent, unique and memorable community visibility. Parents, principals, teachers and community leaders have expressed their thanks for these programs with thousands of letters to the sponsor. Newspapers and television stations continue to give the clients excellent media coverage. News videos, newspaper clippings, letters and awards are available for viewing. The programs give the client direct contact with state, local and Federal government leaders as well as more than 357,000 families who have participated in live EOM programs. Every teacher, child and family receives the sponsor�s printed health education materials. The best indication of this EOM�s success is that plans have expanded program use every year since its inception. Previous Example |Next Example Copyright 1996, GoWell & Kent, Inc.

Area children also showed poor nutritional awareness. School budgets were limited and educational efforts were further hindered by the fact that this was a tri-racial county (black, white and American Indian). No special health programs were equally acceptable to all groups. The hospital and its doctors wanted to promote preventive health awareness to county children and their parents. As the most successful hospital in the county, the client also wanted to improve its image of service in the neighboring rural communities. Experience: After considering a number of options, the hospital decided to fund installation of the Million Dollar Machine curriculum for every elementary student in the county. The robotic instructor generated terrific excitement in the rural area and became an instant local celebrity. Best of all, the robot teacher was equally loved by each of the three cultural groups. In addition to school programs, the hospital also had their robotic representative appear at other community functions and at the hospital itself. Result: Television crews and reporters came from a 100 mile radius to cover the hospital�s events. While hospitals make their money treating illness by necessity, many reporters praised this one for teaching people to avoid sickness and stay healthy. The county Sheriff�s Department, parent�s groups and civic organizations volunteered their time to support the hospital�s effort. Evening health education classes for parents at the hospital were well attended by parents and interested citizens. County middle school students even petitioned the hospital to provide the program to them, a request that the hospital gladly granted. Based on the success of the first campaign, the hospital conducted the entire county-wide program a second time four years later.

How was the MDM curriculum developed? In 1979, Kent Davis and David GoWell invented a new type of interactive robotic character they called the Electronic Personality. In 1980, they formed GoWell & Kent, Inc. to explore and develop techniques to use this unique multi-media communication tool in the areas of education, marketing and entertainment. After many informal robot trials in schools and hospitals, David and GoWell began writing the Million Dollar Machine curriculum in May 1987. They were assisted by a distinguished group of consulting educators, psychologists and drug use prevention experts. The development team reviewed curricula from 19 states before developing the life skills concepts and included in the Million Dollar Machine Program. In the first year of development, they monitored hundreds of live robot assemblies which were then evaluated on content, student comprehension and to determine the most effective robot media teaching techniques. The powerful, comprehensive and nationally compatible MDM curriculum is the result. By the end of the 1989-1990 school year, more than 450,000 children in 19 states had experienced the Million Dollar Machine Program. The MDM curriculum materials and Teacher's Guides were again revised based on that field experience. Now, more than 2,250,000 children in 42 states are benefiting from the program. A key factor in the program's success is the extensive knowledge that elementary school teachers contributed to refine and improve the curriculum. Today, this process continues with pre-paid evaluations forms that are included with every Teacher�s Guide. The Million Dollar Machine Development Team Kent Davis GoWell & Kent, Inc.

How do teachers use the MDM Teacher�s Guide? With its robotic multi-media introduction, student retention of the MDM concepts is excellent. The robot's dramatic delivery and the associated learning materials give teachers and parents an ongoing opportunity to stimulate excitement throughout the school year. Each live assembly introduces 20 life skills concepts, or Learning Objectives to students. The MDM curriculum guide given to each teacher contains hundreds of activities that allow students to explore and fulfill each objective. Activities are grouped in a variety of Teaching Styles to maximize each teacher�s effectiveness and student interest. The activities were designed to integrate easily with other subjects, such as social studies, language art, science, art and music. Is the MDM material suitable for all grade levels? Students interpret life skills concepts at their own level of growth. In the MDM curriculum, activities and worksheets are ungraded to allow teachers to choose the ones that best fit their students' capabilities. In some cases, teachers assign one activity to part of the class, and a different or less demanding activity to other students. How does the MDM program promote healthy growth in children? Scientific research indicates that developing life skills plays a vital role in preventing childhood drug use and avoiding other dangerous behavior. MDM�s live robotic demonstration establishes the human body as a child�s most priceless possession. Then, MDM guides children to discover the reasons and techniques they need to decide against drug use for themselves. Drugs become a threat to their well-being rather than an opportunity to "try a new experience" or "get away with something." Developing self-esteem and health awareness also motivates children to protect themselves in general. These self-protection concepts give children the desire and ability to resist many other dangers, such as stealing, risk-taking, violence or sexual misconduct. How are learning materials organized? Each of the 20 Learning Objectives has two pages of activities and two worksheets. Each Learning Objective appears on the left hand page under the Section Heading. A "Note to Teacher" gives a brief overview of the lesson. The remainder of the first two pages contains a wide selection of activities in a variety of Teaching Styles. This selection will help you find activities most suited to your students and curriculum requirements. Boxes ([ ]) are provided for an easy check ([ ]) of completed exercises. What Teaching Styles does MDM use? MDM uses a variety of Teaching Styles to help students comprehend and retain the material. For older children in Grades 4-6 the Teaching Styles are: Discuss! This Teaching Style develops communication and interpersonal skills in the classroom. A series of related discussion questions gives a complete introduction to each Learning Objective. Answers are provided for fact-based questions while others allow students to explore their own feelings and opinions. In most cases, students can deduce the answers and teach themselves and their classmates. Investigate! Students gather information from books, magazines, records, newspapers, reference sources and (in our next printing!) even CD-ROM libraries, databases and the Internet. They report their findings and sources in either written or verbal form, as the teacher decides. In addition to developing independent research, reading and computer skills, teachers find that students are more receptive to information that they locate on their own. Create! This style develops creative writing skills and artistic expression. Most of these activities are presented as written assignments. Teachers may easily adapt many of them to be art, poetry or music projects. Occasionally, teachers can invite students to pick their own means of expression. Interact! This style develops communication and interactive skills both inside and outside the classroom. Many of these activities involve role play, games or other types of group participation. Sometimes, a field trip is suggested. Two other types of activities in each Interact section are "Visitor" and "Interview". "Visitor" activities recommend special guests to invite to speak to the class. Parents and local professional organizations are recommended sources for speakers. Teachers explain the Learning Objective and the goal of their lesson to each visitor in advance. "Interview" activities teach students to record and report information acquired from other people. The subject of the interview might be a parent, guardian, relative, professional, sibling or peer. Teachers can assign specific people or let students choose their own subjects. Results are submitted in writing or reported to the class during moderated discussions. Worksheets Each Learning Objective has two dedicated worksheets. The recommended procedure is for students to complete each worksheet with their parents. The activities were specifically designed to create entertaining and educational encounters between parents and children. Each worksheet has a Parent's Initial box to check parental participation. Vocabulary The Teacher�s Guide includes a list of ten vocabulary words for each Learning Objective to use in regular language arts/spelling lessons. Implementing the MDM Curriculum Why are classroom discussions so important in the MDM curriculum? In the MDM program, student/teacher interaction is a vital component of every Learning Objective. By covering the "Discuss!" questions first, students gain an excellent grasp of the concepts. This is an important preparation for completing any of the activities or worksheets.Encouraging students to share personal experiences promotes the free exchange of information, ideas and feelings. With teacher guidance, students suggest most of the appropriate answers themselves. As discussion leaders, teachers act as the expert or final authority on the subject only after students have exhausted their own ideas. Scientific research demonstrates that children have an innate knowledge of life skills. The suggested questions draw out that knowledge. This interrogatory style of teaching is referred to as the Socratic method. Research and experience show that the Socratic method maximizes student comprehension and participation. The Socratic method is particularly beneficial for students who rarely take part in classroom discussions. What is the importance of small group activities? The small group activities develop independence and social skills. They also provide excellent opportunities for students to practice courtesy, sharing and cooperation. When organizing groups, MDM recommends dividing classes in different ways to avoid always having the same students together e.g. alphabetically, by height, by random drawing, by seating, etc.). A responsible leader is appointed or elected to maintain order in each group. Some small group activities may be too challenging for younger students. In this case, alternate activities are available or the teacher can lead the activity personally. What is the importance of role play activities in MDM? Role playing is the most effective way to develop interactive skills. Students must think, feel and act, responding totally to each dramatic situation. Role play also gives students the opportunity to act out real-life situations and practice refusal skills and problem-solving techniques. Here are a few ideas to strengthen role play activities: Tell different groups of students to play the same scene. Repeat a role play after having students exchange roles. Use props and costumes to add realism or humor. Use sound, scenery or lighting effects to add drama. Ask students to perform their best skits for another class. Videotape sessions to play back for students and other classes. Ask students in the audience to write down alternative responses. Praise students for their performance and participation. How does the MDM program involve parents? Parental involvement is essential for successful life skills development. For that reason, this program includes a number of teaching tools that increase child/parent interaction. MDM introduces parents to the program with a special letter they take home following the assembly. The following two activities further develop parental interest and participation: Teachers use the two worksheets accompanying each Learning Objective so students can practice their skills at home. The worksheets were designed to give parents a time to share structured teaching activities with their children. All the activities are simple and intuitive so no special training is needed. Check boxes are provided to verify parental participation. The worksheets also stimulate family interest and discussions on important topics. MDM encourages inviting parents to be "Visitors" whenever possible. Student parents are a terrific resource with a variety of diverse careers, skills, talents, hobbies, travel experiences and cultural backgrounds. Once a few parents participate, others will want to contribute as well. How do teachers maintain MDM�s excitement throughout the year? The MDM development team came up with a few ideas to help: Be regular! Schedule a daily or weekly "Million Dollar Machine Time" to use these lessons. Scientific evidence demonstrates that life skills curricula are more effective when presented over an extended period. Be flexible! Explore some of the Learning Objectives on a purely verbal level. Just a few minutes of discussion or role play will accomplish a great deal. Teachers can also use the ready made worksheets to save time on written assignments. Share! Get together with other teachers to exchange ideas on activities that were particularly effective. Teachers can also share suggestions with the MDM development team by filling out a postpaid evaluation form in the back of every Teacher�s Guide. Take it easy! Having students teach each other makes these lessons most effective. Children are often more likely to adopt positive attitudes and good morals from their peers than they are from teachers and parents. Integrate! This program benefit students in every area of their lives. Teachers can easily combine the activities with regular social studies, language arts, science, art and music lessons. Have fun! Everyone who experiences the Million Dollar Machine introduction remembers the enthusiastic response to the robot's assembly. The activities and worksheets in the MDM guide recreate that excitement. Thousands of educators across the country already know that the MDM curriculum is fun and easy to teach. And that it works.

Not only was it thoroughly entertaining, but it also delivered a message about drugs that was appropriate to the age and sophistication level of our students. Susan G. Porter, Principal Crestline Elementary School Vancouver, WA For 45 minutes our students alternated between silent attention and eager interaction, learning then practicing drug avoidance skills. Thank you for this important addition to our drug prevention arsenal. Spencer K.

How robots help kids who hurt Welcome to the Super Power Tour! This page describes how Electronic Personality (EP) robots interact with children in hospitals and other special care environments. Since 1986, the biggest use for EP robots has been teaching children in elementary schools. The Million Dollar Machine Program (MDM) motivates children to care for their bodies, live healthy lives and achieve their personal best. Please visit that site for extensive information on this successful program, now used by more than 2,200,000 children. The Super Power Tour is for children who can not attend regular schools. There are more than four million American children in special care situations including physically and mentally challenged children, and children living in hospitals and rehabilitation centers. If you haven�t yet experienced the magic of meeting one of our robots in person, please take a moment to read what professionals have to say about the Super Power Tour. Their perspective will make the description below that much more meaningful. This page answers three questions: What do robots do in hospitals? What is the Super Power Tour? How can I bring a robot to my facility? We prepared this material especially for healing professionals and parents of children in special care. We hope that many of you will have the opportunity to try robotic media with your children and to help us discover new applications. For more information, please contact GoWell & Kent directly. What do robots do in hospitals? Years ago, our robot was visiting patients in a Baltimore hospital. One young girl had progeria, a disease that causes the body to age rapidly. This 12 year old patient, with her perfectly normal 12 year old mind, was trapped in the wasting body of an 80 year old. The staff expected her to die within weeks, which she knew. As soon as she saw the robot, she became quick and sassy. She and the robot had a great time joking, dancing and hugging. We never forgot her smile, her laughter or our special friendship. This program is the result. We don't have a miracle cure for children�s bodies, but we do have powerful healing lessons for their minds. And an amazingly effective way to teach. Children naturally project themselves onto EP robots; girls and boys, young and old, black, white, brown and yellow. In the blink of an eye, a robot can become a child's personal buddy who's cheering just for them! A robot has another special quality In hospitals: it only projects love, hope, humor, and positive emotions. A robot won�t change its expression or look away when it meets a burn victim. A robot doesn't stare with pity or depression when meeting a child in chemotherapy who will die within a few months. We use our robots to project love and strength. To tell jokes. To accept the children as they are. To inspire them to believe in themselves. And to teach kids how to give life their best shot. While humans often look at life support systems and wheelchairs with apprehension, robots look with familiarity . . . or even envy! They show children that these life-saving machines that make them so different are actually prized possessions. Stuff to be proud of! An EEG becomes child's personal video game. And wheelchairs? Over the years, our robots have conducted as many wheelchair races as the Special Olympics. And the funny thing is, the kids always win . . . just by a hair! We use robots to give children a fresh, positive look at themselves . . . taught with warmth and energy. These high-tech characters are also high-touch. They motivate with love and laughter. And they engage children in a very different way from adults. The robot lessons always look at the brighter side of life and leave each children with lasting positive memories. We use this rapport to teach children a special group of skills we call Super Powers. What is the Super Power Tour? The Super Power Tour is a traveling educational program that uses robots to teach coping techniques and self esteem skills to children in special care situations. The program visits children's hospitals, family retreats, special camps, rehabilitation centers and other caring facilities. The robot teachers empower kids to be more positive about themselves, even in the face of difficult circumstances. The SPT program objectives are: to bring joy and laughter to kids when they need it most to interrupt patterns of pain, loneliness and sadness that young patients fall into to teach practical skills that enable children to confront their challenges and improve their moods to demonstrate positive new views of difficult situations, to draw children out and engage them in productive communication to encourage healing children to seek each other out and interact in a constructive manner Through careful lesson design, child care professionals found inherent 'Super Power' skills that every child can master. There are five techniques in all. Each power is a meaningful exercise that promotes a positive mental attitude. Easy exercises with muscle tone, breathing and smiling make a huge difference in energy and feelings. The robot�s lessons in �Body Power� teach exactly that. The power of words is called �Power Talk�. Teaching a child something as simple as vocabulary control can make a big improvement in mood and perspective. �Super Hand Power� helps children recall and bring back good moods by association with a physical movement. �Super Vision� teaches children to make changes by using positive mental imagery. Finally, �Super Questions� teaches children to change their focus and concentrate their thoughts on healing answers. During each Super Power visit, an EP robot meets with children in small groups and also makes �house calls� to individual patient rooms. Children receive Super Power Tour stickers and a comic book detailing all the powers to share with their parents and friends. How can I bring a robot to my facility? GoWell & Kent Inc. donates robot visits to children�s facilities whenever possible. We also thank the many private, corporate, hospital and foundation partners who have joined us in giving this experience to special children nationwide. Program operating costs are about $1,500 per facility, including printed materials. To sponsor a program, or to get free program information and funding ideas, please contact us below.

We selected these multi-million dollar campaign examples to show how three major companies used robots to get serious PR and marketing results: Targeting Consumers with Robotic Outreach This company used custom robots to dramatically improve local and national customer relations in 19 states, as well as their national industry perception. Their program produced terrific results, including millions of dollars worth of positive media coverage and Presidential recognition. Insuring Success with Robot Teachers Teaching kids to stay healthy can be pretty dull . . . unless the teacher�s a robot! This insurance company uses robotic outreach to build consumer relationships and visibility in their market areas. The program�s growth in each of the 8 previous years is just one indication of its effectiveness. Robo Doc - One Hospital�s Outreach Program It would be hard to find a more lovable (or more visible) community ambassador than an EP robot.

The project is divided into seven identifiable workpackageswhich are briefly described below: Workpackage 1: Completion of the `core' model This workpackage is sub-divided into three groups Collection of data Validation of equation parameters Validation of base-line scenario It is envisaged that this workpackage will be completed by the end ofSeptember 1996. Workpackage 2: Extension to the new EU Member States, Norway andSwitzerland The enlargement of the EU at the start of 1995 justifies the inclusion ofthe new Member States in E3ME. This work will follow the three tasks identifiedin workpackage 1. Workpackage 3: Completion of energy/environment systems It is intended that energy and emissions in E3ME be modelled using anapproach which is based more on energy and emission abatement technologies. This work area also includes revisiting the relationships between energy,environment and economy. Workpackage 4: Developments and innovations in economic modelling Research will be undertaken on the supply-side of the model focusing onoutput. The introduction of forward-looking variables and solutions in E3ME isenvisaged. Research will seek out ways of introducing limited rationalexpectations behaviour in key areas of the model. Other areas of research willfocus on completion of the international sector of E3ME, in particular the tradeequations. The investment equations are to be extended to cover investment byasset and new equations estimated. The consumption equations are to be updatedwith an allocation structure for private consumption by use of a moredisaggregated energy module. Input-output coefficients are to be analysed withthe aim of endogenising the currently fixed set of coefficients in E3ME. Theeconomic/institutional treatment in E3ME is to be completed with re-estimationof economic relationships taking place. Workpackage 5: Base scenarios (by region) This workpackage involves the validation of assumptions and an assessment ofthe short-term growth rates in output. This workpackage also involves a basecase projection with validation. Workpackage 6: One-region solution The Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie de Paris are involved in theapplication of E3ME to the French economy, thus enabling the model to solve forone region alone. Workpackage 7: User-friendly software The objective is to make E3ME easier to use. Cambridge Econometrics iscurrently investigating alternative software packages for processing ofassumptions and presentation of results. TABLE 1: THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE E3ME MODEL E3ME11 (Version resulting from the previous JOULE IIresearch programme) Industrial Classification NACE-CLIO 25 (+ expanded fuel and power sector) Industries 32 of which services 10 Regional Coverage EU11 (EU12 except for Greece) Price Base 1985 Estimation period: from 1960-70 to 1991 Solution period 1985-2010 National Accounts EUROSTAT and QUEST Accounting system ESA Base input-output tables 1985 Count of matrix stochastic equations 18 Count of estimated stochastic equations 3511 Key dates and deliverables It is intended to update the existing version of the model with new data,parameters and a model solution (E3ME12) by the end of September 1996. Theextension of the new member states, and incorporation of developments andinnovations in economic modelling is expected by the end of 1997, by which timea new model solution (E3ME21) will be made available. Results from Model Simulations A recent paper by Terry Barker and Ben Gardiner entitled `The Direct Effectsof Energy-Saving R&D on International Competitiveness and Employment in theEuropean Union', makes use of the E3ME model. A 10% increase in total businessR&D across the EU was allocated across industries in proportion to theirenergy costs. The increase in energy-saving R&D expenditure was assumed tobe financed by a reallocation of the public sector expenditure on military R&D,so that there was no change in total R&D spending. This financing wasassumed to determine the allocation across member states, so that France and theUK, with the largest military R&D budgets, would also have the largestincreases in energy-saving R&D. The paper describes in detail the componentsof such a policy exercise: the effect that R&D in general might be expectedto have on different areas of the economy; the size of the different R&Dbudgets and the design of the scenarios to reallocate these budgets; and resultsfrom the model solution showing the direct effect on employment andcompetitiveness (both domestic and internationally) that the R&D policy willhave. The paper concludes that significant and permanent reductions in energydemand and improvements in international competitiveness are likely if R&Dbudgets are switched towards energy-saving by industrial enterprises. Theeffects on employment are mixed, but overall employment is expected to behigher. The results for the EU11 are summarised in Table 2. This shows percentagedifferences from base solutions for 9 variables in E3ME for the years 2000, 2005and 2010. These are the direct effects of the extra R&D. A fullmodel solution would include further interaction effects, which could be twiceare large as those reported.

Project number: V/CO24/94 The data and equations of E3ME are used in the project is to run a varietyof simulations to the year 2005. The simulations look at various aspects of thetelecoms liberalisation process and their effects on industry prices,competitiveness, and ultimately employment creation/destruction. The Internal Market and Employment Project Title: The effect of the intra-EU trade on manufacturing employmentand labour costs due to the Internal Market programme. Project number: XV/95/42/A This project uses the E3ME model to analyse the effects of the InternalMarket programme (IMP) on the EU labour market. Two interim reports and a finalreport has been submitted thus far. For the final report the baseline andantimonde simulations were developed with research focusing on possible changesto the modelling structure in the light of a literature review ontrade-employment linkages. The changes mainly involve the labour-marketequations but other areas, eg trade-investment causality, were alsoinvestigated. Fiscal Instruments Project Title: Potential impact on employment creation of fiscal instruments(namely of a reduced VAT rate for selected sectors). Project number: XXI/96/CB-3001 Cambridge Econometrics was awarded a contract to analyse the potentialeffects of the fiscal instrumentation on employment creation. A final reporthas been submitted. The study uses the E3ME model to establish a counterfactualscenario, ie if the changes in taxation had not occurred, and compare this withbaseline model simulation results for employment in the UK, Italy, Belgium,Spain and Germany. ERECO Projections Title: Europe in 2001, Economic Analyses and Forecasts The E3ME model was used to provide an initial sectoral forecast to 2001. The baseline was guided by a macroeconomic growth pattern for the components ofGDP to ensure a consistency between the meso and macro levels. Environmental Fiscal Reform This project is concerned with the equity aspects of substantialenvironmental fiscal reform. Five aspects are to be considered: first, theincome distribution of household expenditure on environmentally-sensitive goodsand services, such as electricity consumption, spending on petrol; second, theeffect of any extra employment and reductions in unemployment on the incomes ofthe low-paid and of low-income households; third, the income distribution ofthose who suffer damage from environmental costs; fourth, the effects of reformon vulnerable demographic groups, such as the retired population; and fifth theeffects on rural versus urban households. E3ME is to be used as a framework forthe statistics being collected and used by the project. The project is being co-ordinated by the Department of Applied Economics,University of Cambridge (Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge CB3 9DE, UK, tel +44 1223335289, fax +44 1223 335299). The set-up meeting of the project took place inlate January.

Its aim is to keep users abreast of current issues, providing supportfor their work and updating them on developments in the LEFM software. Theeditors would be pleased to receive comments on this first issue and suggestionsfor subsequent issues (write or Email the Editors of the Newsletter, SaxonBrettell and Rob Wilson at the addresses below). The Newsletter is publishedin both electronic and paper versions. Version 2.1 of LEFM Released Version 2.1 of Local Economy Forecasting Model has been released,and all users updating to the March round of CE/IER forecasts are receiving thisnew version as standard. The latest version incorporates additional features,reflecting suggestions from LEFM users, that are designed to make the model moreversatile. Version 2.1 includes flexible tabulations and further optionsregarding occupation assumptions. In addition to the locally based assumptionsthat already existed in LEFM, the user can now impose national or regionaltrends in occupation change upon their local areas. Have you been SIC92'ed? LEFM updates from March will also include data from the 1993 Census ofEmployment, the first data set at a local level released on the basis of theSIC92 classification. This is a major reclassification from SIC80. Someproblems were initially evident in the data released by NOMIS with someinconsistencies in the areas and these data were withdrawn and re-released. Also the 1991 dual-classified data essential for understanding the effect of thechanges at local level have only just been released, and very interesting theyare too.... Users of these data will know that the SIC92 revision has required a majorreclassification of employment by the Office of National Statistics (ONS hasbeen formed from the merger of OPCS and CSO), with overnight some 10% of UKmanufacturing employment being reclassified into business services. Localanalysts will need to look carefully at the changes in their own local data setsand in principle this is best done with the 1991 data since it is dual coded,although 1993 is a fuller data set. Census of Employment time series are themajor guide to economic restructuring at the local level so that this break inthe series will be a major concern to local practitioners. The good news isthat in future these data will be available annually from ONS, with less than ayear's delay (although based on a sample rather than a full census). CE/IERhave assessed the dual-classified information just released for 1991 and haveestablished a linkage procedure for constructing consistent series for 1981-93. Local authorities will have the advantage of access to detailed information onthe reclassification of their local firms and we are happy to work with localagencies with LEFM if they want to undertake a more thorough analysis of theirlocal data sets so as to establish an agreed consistent data series at theirlocal level - more on these items and other data changes at the.... LEFM Annual Conference 6/7 June This conference is now an established annual event for LEFM users. Weintend it to be the major opportunity for LEFM users with different experiencesto meet, exchange information and discuss practical issues with other users andCE/IER providers - so put the date in your diaries now! Further details on theconference and a booking form are enclosed with the hard copy version of thisnewsletter. For additional information and to book your place, contact BarbaraWilson at IER. As the number of LEFM users is rapidly expanding across the UK, this is setto become a major conference for local economy practitioners and we wish toreflect this in the content of the conference. As last year, it will be atwo-day event held on Thursday June 6-Friday June 7 1996. It takesplace, also as last year, in the Scarman House conference centre located in thegrounds of the University of Warwick. This gives state-of-the-art facilitiesfor conferencing, excellent guest accommodation and catering, all in a splendidenvironmental setting - just the forum for a series of stimulating presentationsthis year. In addition to contributions from CE and IER, there will be a number ofexternal speakers at this year's event. To complement the formal sessions onimportant new LEFM developments and advice on how to get the most out of newdata available at local level, a broad theme for this year will be to cover theissues of partnership building, and developing local economic strategies. Thisreflects our awareness that many users are seeing the role of theirorganisations both deepen and broaden. As a consequence, they are frequentlybeing asked to provide economic context and support for locally-basedinitiatives involving partnerships (often in groups involving local authorities,TEC/LECs, Chambers, Government Offices and Business Links). Such partnershipbuilding has been important in attracting inward investment. Users also faceincreasing calls for evaluation of their own agency's work and its impact onlocal economic activity. LEFM can provide a suitable framework for such anevaluation. The speakers will review the issues involved, and draw lessons froma number of recent projects involving impact analysis and policy evaluation forlocal partners. There will also be plenty of formal and informal opportunities to talk tospeakers, designers and other LEFM users, and to gain or improve hands-onexperience using the LEFM software. There will be LEFM practical sessions fornovices and for more experienced practitioners, and opportunities to receiveone-to-one based advice from our expert team. Indeed there will be time tointerrogate software designers, if necessary continuing late into the night inthe conference bar! Between sessions and in the morning and evening, as ourparticipants discovered last year, one can also take advantage of theUniversity's splendid facilities for sport, with extensive walks available inthe beautiful environment of the grounds, especially useful for laptop users. Developments of Enhanced LEFM Software EVALEFM - a local-economy-forecasting-impact-evaluation model, withenhanced facilities for evaluating the impact of European investment spending,has been developed and implemented for Merseyside and Strathclyde local areas EULEFM - a local economy forecasting model for Europe is underdevelopment. A German language version of LEFM has been developed for use inthe new Länder of Germany in cooperation with Ecometrika GMbH in Berlin. This is designed to work with the E3ME model developed by a team led byCambridge Econometrics for Europe in the same way that LEFM works with CE's MDMnational-regional model in the UK. The E3ME model was developed under theEuropean Commission's Joule II R&D programme, and distinguishes some 32industry sectors. The E3ME project began in 1993 with the aim of developing asingle regionalised model of Europe designed to evaluate policies to reducegreenhouse gas emissions by some 60% over the next 50 years. A proposal toenhance the model and extend it to cover new Member States has been acceptedunder the Joule III Programme, and this will form the starting point for thenext phase of research. Recent Applications Among significant recent model developments for LEFM has been work enhancingthe simulation facilities in LEFM. This has been used to evaluate the impact ofEU and UK government support for local areas. Work for the Brent RegenerationAgency, the Stockport Partnership, and the regional partners in Merseyside andStrathclyde region, has led to enhanced treatment of the supply-side of themodel. Merseyside Economic Assessment Merseyside has been granted EU Structural Funds status under the Objective 1category. The Monitoring Committee of the regional partners has overallresponsibility for monitoring the implementation of the agreed SingleProgramming Document (SPD) for Merseyside, designed to facilitate convergence ofMerseyside towards average European income levels over 1994-99. Work on the SPDwas originally undertaken in 1994 by CE and IER. They used version 1.01 LEFMsoftware model to help set quantitative `baseline' targets for EU support oninfrastructure and human resources. These targets were subsequently embodied in`Merseyside 2000', the EU-approved SPD providing the basis for implementation ofthe detailed programme. This work was followed up in 1995 with a second projectgiving an interim assessment of the programme after two years and reviewing theguidance on approvals. This follow-up work was undertaken for the Labour MarketStrategy Group (representing Merseyside Government Office, local TECs, localauthorities and others) in close association with KPMG's Liverpool office. Itused an enhanced version 2.01 EVALEFM model to provide an up-to-datecounterfactual scenario, (ie an assessment of what the local economy might haveachieved if the Objective 1 programme had not occurred) and compared this with abaseline forecast simulation. A number of variant future development scenarioswere simulated reflecting enhanced support for `clusters' of export-orientedsectors in the local area. The EVALEFM model was thereby used to underpineffective labour market policy advice. The work informed the dissemination ofguidance for applicants for funds in 1996, and supported the informationrequirements of local economic development agencies. The outcome - MerseysideEconomic Assessment - established a consensus approach for the manyparticipating agencies, allowing them to support the recommended new initiativesto achieve the programme objectives. LEFM was seen by the partners as afundamental tool for achieving a consensus among the partner organisations,since it provided a clear framework for considering the developmentalternatives. East Midlands Economic Review Version 2.0 multi-area LEFM software provided the framework for an economicassessment of the East Midlands economy for a research group comprising theGovernment Office for the East Midlands and the seven independent agencies (TECsand recently merged TECs and Chambers) concerned with local training, enterpriseand development. The study, undertaken by CE and York Consulting, establishedan overall economic appraisal for the region and the seven local TEC areas inclose consultation with the East Midlands research group. The work was guidedby a forward-looking study utilising a LEFM for each of the seven areas,consistent with the latest CE forecast for the East Midlands region. The studyidentified the sources of economic growth and restructuring effects at adetailed industry level, identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities andthreats to the component local economies of the region in a context of theglobal competition faced by the UK economy. The outcome was a comprehensivereport suitable as a reference document for the agencies and for use in SingleRegeneration Budget (SRB) and other forms of funding bids, and the provision ofTEC-level LEFM software embodying the detailed forecasts from the study. Toyota Impact Analysis of historical behaviour and trends is not always a good guide tofuture events. Major discontinuities can arise as a result of closures of largeorganisation or substantial inward investment. The LEFM package is designed toallow users to address such issues explicitly using an impact module. This has been used to assess the impact of both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of theToyota investment in Burnaston in Derbyshire. The former is a retrospectiveanalysis of what the effects of Phase 1 have been, while the analysis of Phase 2is prospective. In both cases the LEFM software enables an analysis of bothdirect and indirect effects of the investment on the local economy. The results illustrate the substantial effect that the Toyota investment hashad on the local area. In total, some 6,000 jobs will have probably been createdin the south Derbyshire area by the end of Phase 2, of which about a third areindirect. The package also enables an assessment of the sensitivity of theseconclusions to a range of alternative assumptions. Further details on how to usethe impact module of LEFM are available on request. Partnerships between TECs and Local Authorities Partnerships between TECs, Councils and other bodies are very much thevogue. Some have been going strong for a number of years. A good case in pointis the partnership between Leicestershire Training and Enterprise Council andLeicestershire County Council. They have been working together in producing aLabour Market Assessment for Leicestershire for the last four years. Their most recent publication Leicestershire Economic Assessment, March1996 published jointly by the TEC and Council, is based on the use of LEFM. LEFM has provided a framework which the partners have used to work together anddevelop their own view of local economic and labour market prospects. This hasincluded linking the LEFM results with detailed demographic modelling andforecasting work undertaken by the Council including numerous sector studies. Details of these publications are available from Leicestershire TEC. Call0116 265 1515 for further information. Educational Reforms and Reorganisation: Use of LEFM in Careers Advice The dramatic changes under way in the further and higher educational systemand related organisations have highlighted the need for information aboutemployment and careers prospects. Educational establishments are now chargedwith ensuring that their courses have relevance to the local and nationaleconomies. The reorganisation of the way in which careers advice is delivered has alsofocused the attention of some careers advisors on how they can make the best useof the available information to provide the most useful advice to their clients. Sussex Careers Services Ltd (previously East Sussex Careers Service) is at theforefront of such developments and has found LEFM a useful item in its tool-kit. The present version of LEFM does not analyse qualifications held by theworkforce explicitly. However, CE/IER are currently considering whether such anaddition to the package would be a valuable enhancement. Readers' thoughts onthis issue are welcomed. Please contact Saxon Brettell or Rob Wilson on thephone numbers or Email addresses given at the end of this newsletter. Description of the Local Economy Forecasting Model LEFM is a general economic forecasting model for local areas capable ofaddressing issues that link development and policy. The essential purpose ofthe model is to provide a forward- looking framework to inform analysts anddecision-makers at the local level about the key economic features of theirlocality, including the main behavioural and technical links between the economyand the labour market. TABLE 1: THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE LEFM MODEL LEFM 2.1 Industrial Classification SIC92 Industries 49 of which services 19 Occupations 22 Price base 1990 Estimation period 1981-1993 Solution period: 1994-2010 Base input-output tables 1990 Table 1 summarises the main features of LEFM. It is a detailed model ofsectors and occupations at the local level. The model is constructed, estimatedand solved on a personal computer. The model is based on a sophisticatedanalysis of local data with a user-friendly `front-end' to the model. In summary LEFM provides: a complete economic information system at the local level, covering output,employment and occupations by detailed sectors a full data bank including both historical and forecast data for the localarea as well as the broader regional and national pictures a complete trade model with detailed linkages within and to the externaleconomy the capability to deal explicitly with labour supply, population and theeconomy in one modelling framework the capability of providing short- and long-term economic and industrialforecasts and scenario variants for business and government the capability of analysing long-term structural change in demand andsupply in the local economy the capability of incorporating the insights on research and development,technological innovation and occupational change from the associated nationaland regional models and forecasts LEFM Contact Names and Addresses Saxon Brettell, Anthony Barker, Cambridge Econometrics Covent Garden, Cambridge, CB1 2HS, United Kingdom Tel: 01223 460760 Fax: 01223 464378 E-Mail Via InternetE-Mail Via Compuserve Dr Rob Wilson, Barbara Wilson, Institute for Employment Research, Universityof Warwick Coventry, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom Tel: 01202 523530 Fax: 01203 524241 E-Mail Via Internet E-Mail Via Compuserve Return To CE HomepageWT03-B15-294IA049-000852-B017-354http://www.camecon.demon.co.uk:80/uke3.htm 194.222.200.55 19970120000546 text/html 4200HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: thttpd/1.00.dis++Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 4069Last-modified: Fri, 15-Nov-96 09:54:56 GMT UK Energy and Environment UK ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT FORECASTING SERVICE Subscribers to CE's UK Industrial Service are able to benefit from an add-onservice providing energy and environment forecasts consistent with the economicforecasts. What makes the Cambridge Econometrics service different? There are many energy analysts and economic forecasters producing forecastsof oil prices or electricity sales, but these tend to be produced in isolation,or with limited links to related economic factors. By contrast, the Cambridge Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the UK economy(MDM) produces one of the most detailed sets of forecasts available, includingconsumer demand for 68 commodities, and forecasts of output by 50 industries ona bottom-up basis. An energy sub-model is integrated within the main model. Inputs, such asprices and levels of economic activity, feed into the sub-model from the mainmodel. A set of energy demand equations, for total energy and by fuel type, isused to determine final demand for 10 fuels by 12 different user groups. Inaddition, a separate capacity-based sub-model of the electricity supply industrycalculates fuel use by power generation, and there is a technology-basedsub-model of domestic energy demand. The forecast fuel demands feed back into the main model to give expenditureon fuels by industry, consumers and government. Emissions of CO2 and SO2 (and, in due course, arange of other environmental emissions) are calculated from the forecast fueluse. The Service The service provides a report published twice a year as a supplement to Industryand the British Economy, and forecasts are available on diskette. The reports summarise the key energy/environment assumptions and include thefollowing forecast tables to 2010: Fuel Demand by Fuel Type, original units For each fuel type, fuel use by user is shown - see the attached sampletable. Enables identification of market for each fuel type, eg Demand for Coalby Power Generation, Chemicals industry Fuel Demand by Fuel User, mtoe For each fuel user, fuel use by type is shown. Enables identification ofmarket shares, eg Power Generation demand for Coal, Gas, Fuel Oil Growth in Prices of Main Fuels to each User Group Carbon Emissions by Fuel Type and by Fuel User Sulphur Emissions by Fuel Type and by Fuel User Scenarios Subscribers are also able to commission their own scenarios againstindividual quotations. If you subscribe to the Full Industrial Service, you canuse your two scenarios to explore energy and environment linkages with the UKeconomy. The Cambridge model is particularly well suited to testing for examplethe effect of environmental tax reform on energy use, carbon emissions, sulphuremissions, and the macroeconomy, and is able to capture the effects of such taxreform at the level of each industry in a manner consistent with activitythroughout the whole economy.

The detailed forecasts and analysis address the following issues,of key interest to everyone involved in the construction industry and relatedsectors: The benefits to the construction industry of service-led growth The construction industry after the General Election Strong and weak construction markets in the short and long term The factors driving long-term growth to 2003 The impact of a shift towards environmentally sustainable growth The approach focuses on the prospects for investment spending by sector (egretailing, finance and business services), the key determinant of constructiondemand. The prospects for the construction industry are therefore set in thecontext of the economy generally, and investment spending in particular. A special supplement focuses on the impact on the aggregates industries of ashift towards policies to promote environmental sustainability, and suggestsstrategies to respond to this shift. Specific policies examined include theintroduction of the landfill tax and the slowdown in roadbuilding. The author ofthe supplement is Paul Ekins, Senior Lecturer in Environmental Policy at KeeleUniversity, director of Forum for the Future and a senior consultant atCambridge Econometrics Detailed forecasts and analysis are provided for the 10 types of work - 6new work and 4 repair & maintenance - as published by the DoE in itsconstruction industry statistics.

The service is organised around subscriber meetingsand two forecast reports a year, in January and June. The forecasts take intoaccount the latest available data from official statistics and governmentpolicy statements. Subscriber Meetings A central feature of the service is the involvement of subscribers inpreparing the assumptions and in discussing the results of the forecasts. InOctober, tables of assumptions together with supporting text are communicated tosubscribers giving them the opportunity to comment and state their views. Theseare taken into account when assumptions are finalised. The service includes twomeetings a year, shortly after publication of the January and June forecasts topresent and discuss the analysis and outcomes. Our forecast presentations inJanuary and June are accompanied by guest speakers addressing topical issues. Recent speakers have included Kate Barker (Chief Economic Adviser, CBI), JohnStewart (Managing Editor, Housing Market Report) and Mike Hollingsworth (ChiefEconomist, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders) and Vicky Pryce (Partnerand Chief Economist, KPMG). In addition the service includes an annual two-day residential conference toexplore in greater depth topics important to long-term economic development. The 1996 conference was Beyond the Manifestoes, and it was held atRobinson College, Cambridge on 8-9 July 1996. The speakers included MPs fromthe three main political parties (Angela Knight, Conservative; Andrew Smith,Labour; Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat), John Mitchell of the Royal Instituteof International Affairs, Prof Phil Goodwin of the University College London,Prof Jim Taylor of the University of Lancaster and Andrew Britton of theChurches Enquiry into Unemployment and the Future of Work. The Reports The structure of the reports, and the selection of tables and the economicvariables analysed, have evolved to match the requirements of subscribers. Eachindustrial report is divided into three parts. the forecast overview with chapters on the world economy, UK economicpolicy, the industrial forecast and the macroeconomic background industry in detail, with text, charts and tables to analyse and interpretin comprehensive detail the prospects for the 49 industries distinguished in thereport the main tables giving the macroeconomic summary, coverage of prospects atthe detail published in the official Index of Production, with comparable detailfor the service industries, and finally levels and growth rates for a wide rangeof economic variables. The forecasts are available on diskettes for easy use by subscribers intheir own databases. The reports also contain special features of topical interest. In recentissues, these have included: Effects of the EC's Carbon/Energy Tax on the UK Economy Inward Investment Prospects for the UK Housing Market Disaggregated Analysis of UK Exports by Country and Sector Changes and Pressures in the Service Sector Property in a Low-Inflation Era The Model We Use The projections are based on MDM, a very large model with some 5,000variables. It is distinguished from most other UK models by its degree of`disaggregation' - the extent to which it breaks the economy down intodifferent sectors - and by the fact that it is estimated on annual rather thanquarterly data. Other models do incorporate some disaggregation (or are accompanied by anindustrial model as an add-on extra), perhaps as a matter of convenience in thecontext of a basically aggregate or `macro' approach to model-building, and insuch models events at sectoral level cannot be taken formally into account. InMDM, on the other hand, the 49 industries are distinguished as integral parts ofa single large model. The number of industries is chosen to give a good balanceacross the economy, without encumbering the model and the forecast withirrelevant and unnecessary detail. Because the model solves `bottom-up' byadding industry projections together, it does not suffer from the discrepanciesbetween industry totals and macro totals that appear in a two-model approach. It produces consistent macroeconomic, industrial and financial forecasts, whichare provided together, in one service. As an annual model, estimated on time-series data going back to the early1960s or earlier (1954 for some series), MDM is particularly well-suited formedium and long-term forecasting. The data are continually updated fromofficial sources using the 1990 price base and the 1992 SIC. Our projections include: the familiar macroeconomic aggregates (such as gross domestic product) demand for the products of each industry factors influencing supply in each industry, such as costs, productivity,employment, profits and investment. Projections are provided for investment inbuildings and works, in plant and machinery, and in vehicles, by 38 sectors ineach case, and for consumers' expenditure by 68 categories. The model has a long pedigree of combining input-output and time-serieseconometric equations. The most recent account of the properties andspecification is given in Barker and Peterson The Cambridge MultisectoralDynamic Model of the British Economy, published in 1988 and already into itssecond printing. MDM is a powerful forecasting model; at the same time, it undergoescontinuous improvement at Cambridge Econometrics to take account of advances ineconomic theory and econometric techniques. Comment on the Barker and Peterson book: Taken as a whole this is a valuable book which, by describing and justifyingthe features of a large econometric model, sets a standard for other modellinggroups to meet. It will be interesting to see if they rise to the challenge. The Economic Journal, December 1988 Forecasting Structural Change MDM is essentially a model of economic structure, which is importantfor an economy undergoing long-term structural change due to such factors as the rise and decline of North Sea oil, rapid technological development, andmajor changes in economic policy. Conventional aggregate macroeconomic modelsrely on economic relationships remaining stable through time, but these are morelikely to break down when the composition of the economy is changing. Applications The detail incorporated in MDM means that it can be used to examine theprospects for particular industries and their interactions with the rest of theeconomy in a way that more aggregate econometric models cannot. This applicability of MDM means that our reports can be tailored to therequirements of individual clients, and that the aspects most relevant to theirneeds can be selected. Work of this kind is carried out on a consultancy basisand falls into the following categories: Complete Forecasts Preparation of a complete forecast based on assumptions specified by aclient. In this working relationship, we use the client's own corporate view ofgovernment policy and the world economy to obtain projections using MDM. Scenarios It may be valuable to consider a range of alternative assumptions concerningan indicator, for example a variety of exchange rates around a centralprojection. To meet this kind of need, simulations are carried out, varyingparticular assumptions and examining the resulting differences from the centralprojection. The critical assumptions to be varied are first agreed with theclient. New Models We can create new econometric models for specific needs. Work of this sorthas included in the past the preparation of sub-regional models for localauthorities and models linking a company's sales to MDM indicators. Market Prospects Provision of forecasts and assessments for a particular sector orsub-region. Such reports provide data and predictions at a very detailed level.

In asingle European market, what happens in the local economy is increasinglysubject to national and international trends, but the way in which each localarea responds to these trends depends on its particular features. Whetherdeveloping a strategy for a local area, evaluating the impact of regionalpolicy, or assessing the prospects for future growth in incomes and employment,analysts need to combine an understanding of global trends with knowledge of thelocal area. But economic analysis at the local level has often not met the users' needsadequately. There is a need to draw on national and regional data to supplement limitedlocal information. This uses substantial resources, and may be carried out in anad hoc way that is difficult to reproduce later. The scale of the task may require the use of external consultants. This canleave in-house staff without the knowledge needed to interpret or update theanalysis. The link between developments in the national and international economy andthe local areas is seldom made formal. But the result can be that these trendsare not quantified and so their significance is impossible to gauge. There is no tool to develop scenarios of what might happen under differentassumptions. But evaluation requires an assessment of what would have happenedif the policy has not been implemented. LEFM - a tool for local economic analysis and projections LEFM is a friendly PC-based tool for local economic analysis andprojections. It draws on Cambridge Econometrics' expertise in macroeconomic,sectoral and regional analysis across Europe. Users receive a tailored versionof LEFM, with a base forecast calibrated to local conditions, but they can alsodevelop their own scenarios. Comparison with national projections is madeavailable, in order to put the local results in context. LEFM provides an efficient means of generating local projections easy updating, allowing the user to draw on and reassess previous analysis sectoral detail, so that projections can be identified with major localenterprises a systematic, rigorous and transparent method, so that results can easilybe traced back to assumptions easy links to regularly updated, authoritative forecasts at the Europeanand national level a tool for constructing scenarios, examining the local impact of inwardinvestment, plant closures, and regional policy For further information contact: Saxon Brettell, Cambridge Econometrics Covent Garden, Cambridge, CB1 2HS, United Kingdom Tel: (+44) 01223 460760 Fax: (+44) 01223 464378 E-Mail Via InternetE-Mail Via Compuserve Return to CE HomepageWT03-B15-301IA049-000852-B019-332http://www.camecon.demon.co.uk:80/h_press.htm 194.222.200.55 19970120001413 text/html 7895HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: thttpd/1.00.dis++Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 7764Last-modified: Fri, 15-Nov-96 09:52:41 GMT Regional Housing Market Prospects Cambridge Econometrics Press Release Embargoed till 00.01 Monday 10 June 1996 Housing Market Activity to Pick Up in All Regions, Followedby Stronger House Price Inflation Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its first edition of RegionalHousing Market Prospects, containing detailed housing market forecasts tothe year 2005 for the standard planning regions of the UK. These forecasts arebased on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' 49-sector model of the UK economy, and onits regional housing submodel. The number of housing transactions in England & Wales is forecast torise by 4.8% in 1996, following the decline of over 10% during 1995. Thisincrease in housing market activity combined with a steadily growing economy,rising employment and falling unemployment is expected to boost house prices byan average of 2% in the UK in 1996. However, prospects vary greatly by region, with the strongest increase inactivity expected in East Anglia, the East Midlands and Wales, and the largesthouse price rises in London, East Anglia and Northern Ireland. Activity to Rise in all Regions Following a year of large declines in housing turnover in almost all theregions, activity is forecast to pick up during this year and next, helped bylow interest rates and stronger growth in disposable incomes. The strong demandconditions recently experienced in East Anglia and the East Midlands areexpected to continue through the year and housing turnover is forecast to growby around 13% in both regions in 1996. At the other end of the spectrum, activity in the South East housing marketsis forecast to remain the most subdued during the year, continuing to behindered by still substantial levels of debt and the slow growth expected in theregion's working-age population. Activity is expected to grow more slowly inGreater London than in the rest of the South East, but this still represents amarked improvement over 1995 when turnover fell by over 13%. The North and Wales are forecast to see rises in activity of around 9%, asthey recover from below-trend levels of activity. In Wales this is combinedwith a rising working-age population and thus a larger pool of potential marketentrants. In both regions, housing is now among the most affordable in the UK. The recovery in market activity is expected to improve during 1997, on theexpectation that general inflation will rise by slightly more than interestrates. The increased activity is expected to be concentrated in the southernpart of the UK, where evidence suggests that the markets are more responsive toreal interest rates. Regional House Prices to Remain Static at Worst No region is likely to see declines in house prices in 1996 although pricesin the North are forecast to remain static, and those in the South West, theWest Midlands and the North West are expected to rise by less than 1%. Exceptfor the North West, these regions saw rising house prices during 1995 and highrates of growth in personal incomes, which are forecast to see a sharp slowdownduring this year. Northern Ireland and Greater London, despite the slow transactions growthforecast in the latter, are expected to see the strongest price inflation atover 5%. In East Anglia, the strong increase in transactions is expected tosupport a 3.8% rise in prices in 1996. Prices in East Anglia are now likely torespond more quickly to increased market activity, as the pick-up in activity in1995 has helped to restore confidence. Above-average activity in the East Midlands and Wales will supportabove-average increases in house prices. Inflation is expected to accelerate in all regions in 1997, but largevariations will persist among the regions, with East Anglia forecast to be inthe lead. Long-Term Prospects in Regional Housing Markets The strongest markets over the long term are forecast to be in the regionsexpected to see net inward migration: the South West, Wales and East Anglia. Housing transactions in these markets are expected to grow by around 2% pa over2000-05, while growth of only 1% pa is forecast in England & Wales as awhole over this period. Such demand growth will provide a foundation for stronghouse price increases, especially as it will be associated with a tighterhousing market. The rate of growth in incomes and labour market participationwill also be influential, notably in the East Midlands. Activity in Yorkshire &Humberside is expected to be held back by a working-age population that showslittle change, but growth in average household incomes and rising economicparticipation are expected to push house price inflation to only slightly belowthe UK average. In general, those regions that are forecast to see the strongesttransactions growth in the long term will also experience the fastest rise inhouse prices.

Thecompany's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for theUK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the EU in collaboration with ERECO,the leading network of European economic institutes. Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic,industrial and regional forecasts available for the UK. The projections arebased on the `Cambridge model', known as the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of theUK economy (MDM), which was originally developed in the University of CambridgeDepartment of Applied Economics (in the `Growth Project' set up in 1960 byProfessor Sir Richard Stone, the 1984 Nobel Laureate in Economics, and AlanBrown). This large computerised system has approximately 5,000 endogenousvariables and nearly 16,000 behavioural parameters and other coefficients. Themodel is continually revised and improved to take account of new data andadvances in economic theory and econometric techniques. The regional housing market forecasts are based on MDM and a housingsubmodel that provides an integrated analysis of house prices and housingturnover consistent with the regional macroeconomic environment. Regional Housing Market Prospects is published twice a year. Copies of the report are normally obtained by companies through subscriptionto the company's UK Regional Housing Market Service at £4,950 per annum.

The report identifies trends and strategies across Europe's cities thatreflect the need for each city to improve its `offer' in the face of a widerfield of competition than in the past. These include: redeveloping old industrial sites improving local and international transport links developing strategic planning authorities However, the ability to invest is constrained by tight public finances, andattempts to set up authorities with a wider remit for strategic planning havesuffered setbacks in the past year. Old Industrial Sites Transformed As industry moves out, cities are taking advantage of the sites released totransform them into competitive locations for the high value added services inwhich their future lies. In the west of Paris, a major Europeanhospital (the Georges Pompidou hospital) is being built on the former Citroënsite in the 15th arrondissement. The former industrial area of BoulogneBillancourt, the 15th arrondissement, and Issy les Moulineaux is fast turninginto a media quarter: TF1 and Canal Plus television are already based there andFrance télévision may join them in the longer term. Torinopresents a similar example: the former Fiat city-centre premises of Lingotto arebeing transformed into offices, a major exhibition space and a conferencecentre. IBM has moved its Torino headquarters there. From spring 1996, aretail commercial centre with around 80 shops, will be open, while by 1997 partof the university and the laboratories of the polytechnic are expected torelocate to Lingotto. Milano has several projects to redevelop former industrial areas,including `Tecnocity', covering 680,000 m2 on the former Pirellisite at Bicocca in the north-east of the city. The project, due to be completedby 1998, will provide a site for part of the new State University of Milano,headquarters for several companies including Pirelli, a conference centre, andhousing accommodation. The flagship of Lille's transformation remainsthe Euralille business centre, but the city also has initiatives to redevelopold industrial areas. These include a new university faculty on the 35,000 m2site of the old Leblan spinning mill, to be opened in time for the 1996/97academic year and expected to bring life back to the `quartier des Moulins'where unemployment is above 23%. Another example is the Eurotéléportrecently opened at Roubaix and aimed at attracting firms whose activities dependon high- quality telecommunications infrastructure. Just as former manufacturing sites are being transformed into servicecentres, several cities are redeveloping parts of their docks or waterfrontareas. The development of Canary Wharf in London's docklands is awell-known example. Others include the major Euroméditerranéeproject covering 310 ha on Marseille's harbour front, with an investmentof FFr1.7bn spread over five years from 1997. The first stage includes newuniversity premises and housing redevelopment, while in the longer term the aimis to attract high value added service activities. On a smaller scale, Dublin'sInternational Financial Services Centre continues to attract new firms, Lisboahas plans to redevelop areas close to the Tejo for residential and businessuses, and the Cardiff Bay development continues to attract inwardinvestment. InRotterdam and Hamburg the emphasis has been on developingfurther logistics and processing activities to take advantage of the successfulports. Barcelona is seeking to build on the rapid growth of its port tomake the city the major logistics centre for southern Europe, handling tradebetween the EU and north Africa and the Far East. Its Llobregat Delta planinvolves the enlargement of the port, the building of a new rail terminal andthe expansion of the airport with a new cargo centre. More Competitive Transport Infrastructure In many cities, future competitiveness is threatened by pressure on existingtransport links, both local and international. In the Cohesion Fund countries(Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain), cities are still addressing the problemsof urban growth with policies that include major road improvements, a strategynot generally favoured in the richer cities where physical capacity constraintstypically require measures to ration road use and promote public transport. Cohesion Fund Cities Dublin is addressing the problems of its recent rapid growth and thelack of a convenient bypass by constructing the Dublin Ring Road. While thenorthern part of the road is nearing completion, problems over land acquisitionhave so far blocked action on the southern part of the scheme. Traffic growthwithin the city has also made congestion problems more severe.Lisboa's regional authorities are implementing much-needed majorimprovements in transport infrastructure, including ring roads with expresswaysto the city centre, an enlarged underground railway, a transport interchange forurban and national road and rail systems, and the Vasco da Gama 12 km bridgeover the Tejo to be opened in 1998. In Athina the major works inprogress are improvements to the road network and construction of the metro. Themetro is scheduled to be completed at the end of 1998, but indications are thatthis target will not be met. The new airport at Spata (financed with supportfrom the European Investment Bank) has also been subject to delays. To addressthe problem of urban congestion, Athina's municipal authorities have takencontrol of urban public transport, banned cars from the commercial centre andreserved one lane for public transport on the main access routes to the city. Cities in the Richer Countries Many of the major cities in the more developed economies are undertakingtransport infrastructure improvements aimed typically at improving either localpublic transport or international links. In Paris, last summer's hotweather focused attention on local air pollution from road traffic and there areseveral projects to improve the city's rail services. A new bridge is beingbuilt to transfer passengers between the Gare d'Austerlitz on the left bank ofthe Seine and the Gare de Lyon on the right bank. From 1997 a new RER metroline, Météor, will carry 170m passengers each year betweensouth-east Paris and the Gare Saint- Lazare, stopping at three stations in thebusiness quarter near Opéra. In Milano, the PassanteFerroviario, an 18 km railway line between north-west and south-west Milano, ofwhich more than half runs underground, is expected to come into operation inJanuary 1997. It will bring the local railway to the north of the city and thenational rail network together in a single system, and a large increase intravel by train is expected to reduce urban traffic congestion. In Londonthe major improvements in the near future are the £300m rail link fromPaddington to Heathrow, due to open in 1997, and the £2bn Jubilee LineUnderground extension eastwards through Docklands is due to open in March 1998. London's international transport links will eventually be improved by thehigh-speed rail link to the Channel Tunnel. Other cities with developinghigh-speed rail links (generally with earlier completion dates) include Köln(services to London, Paris and Amsterdam to begin in 1998), Lyon(developing the TGV station at Satolas and pressing for a Lyon-Torino link underthe Alps) and Amsterdam (links from Schiphol to the French TGV andGerman ICE networks to be completed by 2000). In the longer term, Barcelonastands to benefit from the agreement signed by Felipe González andJacques Chirac in 1995 to extend the TGV beyond Montpellier to Barcelona by2004. Among the Scandinavian cities, Helsinki is seeing a number ofinternational infrastructure improvements that could reinforce its gatewaystatus. The coastal E18 road (Turku-Helsinki- Kotka-St Petersburg) is to beupgraded to a motorway. The rail link to St Petersburg will be improved andserved by a rapid Pendolino-train with travel time reduced to three hours. Otherimprovements include the development of ferry connections from Helsinki toEstonia and the upgrading of the main motorway from Tallinn to Poland (theBaltlink project). However, probably the most important development inScandinavia is the construction of the Øresund fixed link (bridge andtunnel) between København and Malmö in southernSweden, due to be completed in 2000, which will cut travel time from an hour to20 minutes. Strategic Planning Authorities Because the functional urban area of a city seldom coincides with itsadministrative boundaries, in a number of cities the debate over what is theappropriate area of competence for the city's local authority has continued. There are two examples of proposed changes that were rejected when put to theelectorate: the proposed union between the Länder ofBerlin and Brandenburg, and the proposal to create a new urban province(stadsprovincie) of the Rijnmond around Rotterdam. Stuttgarthas adopted an unusual arrangement to try to address the problem, by givingresponsibility for coordination of planning by the city and its surroundingmunicipalities to the regional parliament. London has lacked astrategic authority since the Greater London Council was abolished in the early1980s and its responsibilities were devolved to smaller authorities, but thismay change if a Labour government is elected. Medium-Term Growth Forecasts Europe's Regions Although the level of per capita incomes is still uneven, the rate of growthover the past decade or so has not followed any simple explanation in terms ofcore/periphery or convergence/divergence. The forecast for per capita valueadded (GVA) growth over 1994- 2000, summarised in Figure 1, also reflects thismore complex picture. In some cases peripheral regions continue to lag behindand the gap in per capita GVA grows (eg Greece, southern Italy, southernAustria, northern Sweden and Finland). In other cases, a considerable degree ofcatch-up is expected (Ireland, Portugal, east Germany). There is some tendencyfor existing divides to be strengthened within Spain (where the north-east andMadrid have the faster growth rates) and France (where Ile de France,Rhone-Alpes and Alsace continue to do well), and to some extent in west Germany(where Hessen and Bayern are strong performers). A somewhat more balancedpicture emerges for the UK, although this reflects a better performance ofnorthern regions in the earlier part of the period (that has largely alreadyoccurred). FIGURE 1: REAL GVA PER CAPITA GROWTH, 1994-2000 Europe's Cities The long-term forecasts for economic growth in the cities are shown in Table1. The fast growth forecast for most of the cities in the Cohesion Fundcountries and east Germany mainly reflects the macroeconomic outlook for theirnational/regional economies. Similarly, growth in most of the French and westGerman cities is depressed by the modest macroeconomic growth prospectsassociated with the strong deutschemark, whereas growth in the UK and northernItalian cities is somewhat faster.

This has tended to favour regions other than the major city regionsbecause the latter are generally specialised in consumer, business andnon-market services. Roma, for example, was sheltered from therecession but saw only a weak recovery as manufacturing plays a relatively smallpart in its economy, and its manufacturing firms are not oriented towards exportmarkets. However, those cities that are more specialised in manufacturing thanis typical, and those which serve a surrounding region that is specialised inmanufacturing, have generally benefited from the recovery. Examples includeTorino and Birmingham. Export-oriented regions in Italy havereceived a further stimulus from the weak lira, favouring SMEs in Bolognafor example. Cities depending on port activity also benefited, notably Rotterdam. As one of Europe's most manufacturing-oriented major cities, Stuttgarthas been subject to the same trends and in 1994-95 saw some relief afforded byexports of motor vehicles and plant and machinery. However, the cyclicalimprovement has been overshadowed by the longer-term restructuring prompted bythe strength of the deutschemark. A cyclical recovery has also been evident inthe service sectors of some cities where these services have the nature of aninvestment (eg advertising, management consultancy, property), notably in London. The present slowdown in growth in the major European economies is reversingsome of these gains, particularly as it has come earlier than had been expected. The recovery of port activity in Rotterdam tailed off in 1995. Manufacturers in Hamburg report high stocks and low order books. However, pressure to reduce budget deficits and public debt ratios to meet theMaastricht criteria for EMU is also depressing growth among cities dependent onnon- market services. Bruxelles faces this problem at the national andregional levels, the latter because of the erosion of the region's tax basecaused by population decline. Job losses in public services are expected inStockholm in response to strains in municipal budgets. Publicadministration services in Wien are under similar pressure from measuresto control the federal budget, and the city's economy is also vulnerable to theindirect effects of tight fiscal policy on consumer spending, since it isoriented towards the domestic market.

The service providesanalysis and forecasts by sector in Europe in 2001 and by region andcity in European Regional Prospects. Europe in 2001 is the latest in an annual series of ERECO reportsproviding medium-term forecasts and analysis for five years ahead by sectorfor the major European economies and the European Union as a whole. The serieshas been published since 1989 and provides an authoritative reference for theprospects for key sectors. Its pan-European coverage and authorship ensure atruly international analysis, appropriate to an increasingly integrated Europeanmarket. CE complements this sectoral analysis with forecasts of European urbanand regional change, again using a medium-term forecast horizon. Theresults are published in the annual ERECO series European Regional Prospects,which is also produced in association with our European partners. The seriesprovides economic forecasts for the regions of the existing European Union of 15and also those of Norway. Special attention is paid to the processes of changein the most important European city regions. The report uses a consistentdatabase and a comprehensive modelling approach, with the views and analysis ofexperts from all over Europe embodied as part of the process of forecastingeconomic change in the major urban and regional economies.

Upturn on the Way as New Work Recovers Following the 1% contraction in 1995, construction output is forecast tostop falling this year and see growth of around ½%. Falls in new work,particularly in the public sector and in housing, are expected to be more thanoffset by growth of around 2½% in R&M, most notably in the privatenon-housing sector. Thereafter, strong growth, in excess of 3% pa, is forecast for 1997 and1998. An expected improving performance by UK manufacturers in 1997 is expected tostimulate greater investment in industrial new work. This will narrow thedivide in fortunes that has appeared between the slack private industrial sectorand the rapidly-growing private commercial sector (which has been fuelled bystrong service sector growth in late 1995 and 1996). Infrastructure output isexpected to be boosted by rail and airport projects despite the decline in roadsspending. Recovery in the UK housing market has gathered pace through 1996, andis expected to fuel renewed growth in housing starts and output in 1997. Thebuoyant private non-housing R&M sector, expected to see double-digit growthin both 1996 and 1997, will also contribute strongly to the overall recovery. Highlights in Types of Work Private Housing (new and R&M) - housing market transactionspicked up in 1996Q2 and prices have risen by more than 5% in six months. Housesare now more affordable than for almost two decades and mortgage rates are lowerthan they have been for 30 years. Although the emerging upturn in starts andoutput will be unable to rescue the sector from an overall decline in 1996, newwork is forecast to accelerate as confidence continues to return to the market. In the long term, the impact on new development of the growing number of UKhouseholds will be constrained by land availability and a shift in fortunestowards R&M after 2000 is expected. Public Housing (new and R&M)- public housing and housingassociation orders were 22% lower in 1996Q2 than in the previous quarter and 26%down on a year earlier. New work output fell by 7.3% in 1995 and is forecast toshow a further 10% for 1996 as a whole. A more modest decline of around 2½%is expected in 1997. Cuts on the scale of 1995 and 1996 are not consideredsustainable in the longer term, whichever party forms the next government, andso some recovery in output is projected after 1997. Infrastructure and Other Public New Work - despite the completion ofsome notable major projects (such as the Jubilee Line extension), projects suchas Terminal 5, Manchester Airport, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and Thameslinkare expected to fuel output growth of 3% in 1997 and almost 6% in 1998. Thereafter, the absence of projects of a similar scale in the pipeline meansthat output could fall back in the long term. Private Industrial and Commercial - is expected to continue to growstrongly as recovery in manufacturing investment, boosted by large inwardinvestment projects, restores private industrial growth to over 3%. Meanwhile,strong UK service sector growth is expected to drive further demand for officeand retail space, and consequent private commercial growth of over 6% pa from1996 onwards Non-Housing R&M - is expected to continue its buoyant trend(though only in the private sector) driven largely by the ongoing privatisationof Railtrack and the consequent £10bn overhaul of the UK rail network overthe next ten years. Moving to a Green Economy: Implications for the Aggregates Industry The report features a supplement focusing on the impact on the aggregatesindustries of a shift towards policies to promote environmental sustainability,and suggests strategies to respond to this shift. The supplement concludes thatbusinesses which define, or redefine, their missions to add more value to fewermaterials will find that they are sailing with the spirit of the time: they willbe in a position to comply comfortably with new regulations and seize businessopportunities and will enjoy a good public reputation. and improved long-termprofitability. In contrast, businesses that continue to define their mission asmaking profits by pushing larger volumes of material, especially environmentallyharmful materials, through the system, will be buffeted by a gale of regulatoryand popular opposition. They may be able to snatch some short-term gains fromthe storm, but they will be long-term losers. Notes for Editors Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company, and hasbeen providing detailed economic and industrial forecasts since 1978. Thecompany's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for theUK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the EU in collaboration with ERECO,the leading network of European economic institutes. Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic andindustrial forecasts available for the UK, based on the `Cambridge model', knownas the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the UK economy (MDM). Forecasts for the DoE types of work (shown in Main Table 1 in the report)have been prepared using a sub-model which projects each of the types of work onthe basis of its key sources of demand. These include the forecasts forinvestment in buildings and works disaggregated by industry (shown in Main Table2 in the report) and consumers' expenditure on construction work. The forecastsof investment in buildings and works come from the Cambridge integratedmacroeconomic and sectoral model of the UK economy, MDM. Investment in anysector depends mainly on prospects for output (itself dependent upon prospectsfor demand and competition from imports) and interest rates. Additionally, dataon key new projects - for example, inward investment decisions - areincorporated explicitly. Investment prospects for some sectors depend ongovernment policy or other specific factors to a large extent, and soassumptions are made for investment in these cases, namely oil and gas, water,sewerage, electricity, roads and rail. The DoE data for output by type of work incorporate the infrastructureseries in order to minimise the difficulties in the new work data caused by theprogramme of privatisation since 1979. However, some problems remain, notablythe allocation of work to the infrastructure series for non-housing R&M,public and private. The privatisation issue has been specifically modelled byCambridge Econometrics, using data over the period from 1980 onwards on thepublic/private ownership of each of the 49 industries distinguished in MDM. UK Construction Prospects is published twice a year, in March andSeptember. The cut-off date for the information used in the model run for this reportwas 6 September 1996. viii + 39 pages, with 29 charts/figures and 10 tables.

Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its latest edition of Industry andthe British Economy, containing detailed macroeconomic and industrial forecaststo the year 2005. These forecasts are based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics'49-sector model of the UK economy. The report includes an analysis of thecauses of recent service sector growth. Consumer spending on services is growing fast... The past year has seen a sharp slowdown in manufacturing, with outputactually falling in the last two quarters. This slowdown is clearly related toslower growth in exports and lower stockbuilding, both of which have a highmanufacturing content. Growth in services has also slowed, but by no means asmuch. At the same time consumers' expenditure growth has held up (less than ½ppslower in 1995 than in 1994, whereas non-oil GDP growth slowed by over 1pp) andis forecast to accelerate in 1996. Consumer spending on services grew by 3¼%in 1995, compared with an increase of just 1½% on goods. ...but this doesn't explain the pattern of services growth It is tempting to conclude that services are growing faster thanmanufacturing because growth is being led by consumer spending, and because thisspending is growing faster on services than on goods. However, this simplestory starts to break down when the composition of service growth is examined inmore detail. Chart 1 shows year-on-year growth rates for manufacturing and thebroad service sectors distinguished in the ONS's quarterly national accountsdata. The fastest growth has been in transport & communications. Withinthis group, UK consumer spending accounts for as much as half of total demand injust one industry, Air Transport, and there is substantial import penetration(when UK residents fly with foreign carriers). While an upturn in spending onpackage holidays provides a welcome boost to business, it is not the dominantexplanation for the industry's growth; exports (sales by UK carriers to non-UKresidents) were as important as UK consumer spending for growth of the AirTransport industry in 1995. In the fast-growing Communications industry, abouttwo-thirds of output is for business and government use, and on CE's estimatesthese account for about half of the 8% pa growth seen in the past two years. CHART 1: OUTPUT GROWTH IN SELECTED BROAD SECTORS Among financial & business services, the link between consumer spendingand output growth is even less direct. Provisional data suggest that thefastest growth in 1995 was in the three business services of Computing,Professional and Other Business Services, rather than in Banking & Financeor Insurance. In none of these three does consumer spending account for morethan a fifth of sales, a fact that is hardly surprising when the content ofthese services is considered. What, then, is driving the growth of services? In some cases, spending onservice inputs by firms is related to overall activity, including consumerspending on goods. The demand for road haulage is determined by the volume ofgoods that need to be shifted (including for export). A key factor determiningfirms' advertising spending is the level of overall consumer spending, butparticularly spending on consumer goods (since these are the subject of mostadvertising). Even services bought directly by the consumer are often linked tospending on goods: the demand for personal loans, car insurance, car dealers'services and garage repair work depends on spending on cars. Services as an intangible investment In other cases, spending on services by firms does not merely rise and fallwith overall activity, but has a more pronounced cycle. Chart 2 shows CE'sestimates for the factors determining output growth in Professional Services(These include R&D, legal, accountancy, management consultancy, marketresearch, engineering, architects, surveying and advertising services, andservices auxiliary to financial intermediation such as brokers) during therecession and the recovery. `Industrial' demand here means inputs of theseservices to industries throughout the economy, including services, and iscalculated on the basis of input-output coefficients that increase at a steadyrate (reflecting the historical trend for these services to account for anincreasing proportion of production costs across the economy). The residual inthe chart represents the difference between CE's estimate of total demand forthe industry's services and the supply as measured by output plus imports (thelatter are still very small for these services). What is of particular interestis that the residual swings from being strongly negative in the recession tostrongly positive in the recovery. Since industrial demand accounts for most ofthe industry's output, the residual probably reflects cyclical changes in firms'purchases of these services. In fact, the residual follows a similar pattern tothat of company profits. CHART 2: COMPONENTS OF GROWTH - PROFESSIONAL SERVICES What this suggests is that the decision to purchase these services has thecharacteristic of an investment. In some cases the purchase is itself linked tophysical investment (for example engineering, architects and surveying). Inothers the service actually is an intangible investment, as with R&D,management consultancy, market research and advertising. The fact that Londonhas a high concentration of these services (and that some of its activities inother services, such as banking, also have the nature of intangible investments)is probably at least as important in explaining its performance in the recessionand recovery as the impact of the collapse in house prices on household spendingin the South East. The popular perception that growth in services is explained simply by thegrowth in consumer spending on services is misleading. It perpetuates the myththat the long-term growth of services is driven by household spending onentertainment, eating out and other `luxuries'. It reflects a view of servicesthat will become increasingly outdated in a knowledge-based economy, in whichintangible investment is of growing importance for international competitivenessand long-term growth. Investment Spending to Boost Growth in 1997 GDP growth is forecast to slow to just over 2% in 1996, as the additionaldomestic demand arising from faster growth in consumer spending and investmentis met partly out of stocks and partly by stronger imports. An acceleration inGDP growth to 3% is forecast for 1997, supported by continued strong growth inconsumer spending, stronger investment growth and a recovery in continentalEuropean export markets. Manufacturing output is forecast to recover from the second half of 1996from its present stagnation, helped by stronger investment demand, strongergrowth in exports to continental Europe, and the achievement of a lower ratio ofstocks to output during the first half. Faster growth in consumer spending onservices is being prompted by low price increases, due to fierce competition andthe impact of technological change. However, the services that are growing mostrapidly are mainly serving business markets; some are intangible investments(see above). The underlying rate of RPI inflation is expected to remain low, acceleratingmodestly in 1997 to 3¼%. The headline rate is forecast to be lower thanthe underlying rate in 1996, and then to exceed it in 1997, in response tointerest rate changes.

These forecasts are based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' integratedenergy-environment-economy model of the UK. The Government has confirmed a target of 5-10% reductions in UK emissionsbelow 1990 levels by 2010, in John Gummer's speech at the Geneva Climate Changeconference on 17 July. The latest CE forecast of UK carbon emissions suggeststhat in 2000 they will be around 8% below the 1990 level, and will rise onlyslightly by 2005. The main factors contributing to lower emissions over thisperiod are the electricity industry's shift from coal-fired generation togas-fired generation, and the impact of the road fuel duty escalator on roadtransport fuel demand (which we assume will be continued indefinitely). What happens to the pattern of carbon emissions after 2005 remainsuncertain, and will depend to a large extent on whether it remains economic forthe electricity industry to continue switching into gas, and on whether thegovernment maintains the road fuel duty escalator at 5pp above the rate ofinflation. The Labour Party's CO2 emissions target for 2010 is tougher thanthe Government's: it seeks a reduction of 20% below 1990 levels (as stated inTrust for Tomorrow, the 1994 report of the Labour Party's PolicyCommission on the environment, and confirmed by Tony Blair in February in hisspeech to the Royal Society). The CE forecast suggests that new measures wouldbe required to achieve such a target, and the Labour Party has itself proposedintroducing further energy-saving schemes and voluntary agreements withindustry. The Liberal Democrats have for several years supported a 30% reduction incarbon emissions over 15 years, which would certainly require more stringentmeasures. One means by which more substantial reductions in CO2emissions might be achieved is via eco-tax reform: a shift in the tax structurefrom taxing so-called `goods', such as employment, to taxing `bads', such aspollution arising out of energy use. The report includes a detailed discussionof the use of market-based instruments such as environmental taxes and chargesas a way of achieving environmental targets, compared with the more traditionalregulatory approach. Forecast Trends in Energy Demand and Other Environmental Emissions After a decline in total final energy consumption of 0.8% in 1995 totalenergy demand is forecast to increase over the next few years before flatteningout and then falling slightly by the end of the forecast period. Over the sametime GDP is forecast to grow steadily and be nearly 30% higher in real termsthan the 1995 level by the year 2005. One of the most important fuel users in terms of primary fuel inputs andenvironmental emissions is power generation. The latest data show that totalelectricity generation increased by 1.9% in 1995. Inputs of gas to powergeneration rose by over 25% in 1995 while the demand for coal fell by 4.4%. Coal is still responsible for over 45% of the primary fuel inputs to the ESI,with nuclear nearly 30% and natural gas over 15%. Gas is expected to overtakecoal as the most important primary fuel input to electricity before 2000. Key trends in demand by other fuel users are as follows: Demand for energy by industry is forecast to increase slowly until the endof the decade and then fall, during which time gas demand is expected toincrease at the expense of coal and oil. Overall demand for road fuels fell in 1995 for the first time since 1991,providing the first sign that the road fuel duty escalator might be having aneffect on demand. In the long term, demand for road fuels is expected to decline if thegovernment maintains the road fuel duty escalator at 5pp above generalinflation. This would probably be achieved through the use of morefuel-efficient vehicles rather than actual reductions in traffic. The demand for energy by households fell by 2.7% in 1995, partly reflectingthe slightly warmer temperatures than in 1994. In the long run, household demand for energy is expected to increase at 1-1½%pa as demand for higher comfort levels and more services and an increase in thenumber of households outweigh any savings in energy obtained through morestringent building standards. Energy consumption by the commercial sector increased by 6.8% in 1995 whenboth output and employment in service sectors grew. Commercial sector energy demand is expected to increase at just under 1% pafor the remainder of the forecast period, reflecting continued improvements inenergy efficiency, although demand for electricity is forecast to grow much morerapidly. In terms of prospects for carbon and sulphur emissions: The switch to natural gas from the more carbon-intensive fuels such as coaland oil is responsible for the majority of the reduction in CO2emissions over 1990-2005. Emissions from power generation have fallen by nearly 20% in the first halfof the 1990s because of switching from coal into gas and increased nucleargeneration. Emissions of CO2 from power generation are forecast to continuefalling until the year 2000 and then increase again slightly as theopportunities for further fuel-switching become fewer. CO2 emissions from road transport are forecast to grow onlyslightly over 1995-2000 and then to fall as the impact of the road fuel dutyescalator offsets the stimulus to growth from higher economic activity. Emissions by households are expected to increase over the forecast periodas the number of households rises and penetration of gas in the place of coaland oil becomes more complete. Emissions of sulphur are expected to fall by more than half from 1995 tothe end of the forecast period, with the biggest reduction coming from powergeneration. The UNECE target of a 70% reduction from 1980 SO2 levels by 2005 isexpected to be met, although beyond 2005 further measures will be needed toreach the 80% target reduction by the year 2010. Key results differentiated by fuel type and fuel user are shown in Table 1(for final energy demand), Table 2 (for carbon emissions) and Table 3 (forsulphur emissions). Tables 2 and 3 differ from Table 1 in that they includeemissions arising from fuel use by power generation and other energy industries. Hence, coal use in Table 1 relates only to final users (industrial, commercialand household use), whereas emissions shown in the other tables relate primarilyto coal use in power generation. In the bottom half of Tables 2 and 3,emissions by fuel users relate only to fossil fuel consumption by thoseusers. Emissions from burning fossil fuels to produce electricity are allocatedto power generation.

Theseforecasts are based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' 49-sector model of the UKeconomy. Extra jobs in the north are part-time Over the last decade, the expansion of the service sector and decline ofmanufacturing employment have been associated with strong growth of part-timeand female employment. These trends have become more pronounced in the 1990s. Over 1991-95 all the regions saw an increase in part-time employment for bothmales and females and a fall in full-time male employment. Only regions withthe best overall employment performance such as East Anglia and the South Westsaw an increase in full-time female employment. However, in 1995, when UK employment rose quite rapidly (by about 1%) inresponse to rapid GDP growth in 1994, employment trends were quite different(see Chart 1). All regions apart from Scotland and the North West saw anincrease in employment but most regions in the northern half of the country sawno increase in full-time jobs. A striking exception is the North region, whichhas benefited from several high-profile inward investment decisions. Incontrast, most regions in the southern half of the country saw full-timeemployment increase. Regional convergence during the recession has helped to keep inflation low It is well known that since the early 1990s recession unemployment in allregions has converged towards the national average, with the high unemploymentareas outside the south of England seeing marked relative improvement. What isless well known is that this has been associated with convergence in relativeearnings growth, with Greater London experiencing a sharp relative decline thusreducing pressure on national inflation. Chart 2 shows the convergence in wageinflation rates relative to the experience of the 1985-90 period. This is oneof the classic arguments for an active regional policy: that a more evendistribution of employment growth will improve the UK's inflation/unemploymenttrade-off. Ironically this has been achieved not by design but by the scale ofthe recession in the south. The forecast suggests a gradual reversal, withstronger growth expected in the south. The short-term forecast: faster growth in the south and midlands In 1996, the three fastest-growing regions are all expected to be in thesouth of England. Growth in East Anglia is supported by a recoveringmanufacturing sector, continuing strong performance in services and improvingperformance in construction. The South West is also forecast to see stronggrowth reflecting good performance across all the main sectors. Although the recent strength of London's manufacturing industry is notexpected to be sustained, growth in services and a strong performance inconstruction maintain the high ranking of the region in terms of GDP growth. Increased employment in London's construction and financial & businessservices sectors underpins a forecast strong overall employment performance inLondon. The Rest of the South East is forecast to continue to underperform thenational average, despite a relative improvement in manufacturing, mainlybecause of continued weakness expected in construction as the housing market isslow to recover. The East Midlands, Wales, the North and Northern Ireland are also forecastto see above average growth. The strongest manufacturing growth continues to bein Wales, led by the (mainly consumer) electronics and vehicle componentsindustries that have been the focus of inward investment. In Scotland,reasonable manufacturing performance is combined with a weaker than averageperformance in financial & business services to leave overall GDP growth nobetter than the national rate. The West Midlands is forecast to see a temporarydeterioration in relative performance, mainly reflecting the region's verystrong performance in 1995 especially in manufacturing. Economic growth is forecast to accelerate in all regions in 1997 with growthquite broadly distributed, but only regions in the south are expected to seerates above the national average. Long-term regional growth converges relative to past experience In the long term regions in the south of England and the midlands and Walesare forecast to see the fastest economic growth, but some regions show a markedimprovement relative to their long-term historical performance. Wales and theNorth stand out, reflecting the impact of inward investment on thecompetitiveness of their manufacturing industries. Following a period in which Scotland grew faster than the national average,the economy appears to be reverting to its previous position as one of theslower growing regional economies. However, the gap between the Scottish andthe UK GDP growth is also forecast to be less than was the case historically,supported by fast growth in the electronics industry in which it is specialised.

The pressures of German unificationand recession have called into question the political commitment to greaterintegration. The future of the EMS and EMU is uncertain. Unemployment isendemic. Government deficits are large. At the same time, the economic changes promoted by the Single EuropeanMarket are continuing. Cross-border purchasing is increasing. Industrialcooperation stretches between countries. Privatization is sweeping away statecontrol and intensifying competition. Other European countries are stillseeking admission to the club. Decision-makers have to know the relative size of different nationalmarkets. They have to know how competitive different countries' firms are. They need to know where national differences still matter. Above all, they haveto know where growth will be fastest, in their own industries, in their clients'industries, and in their clients' clients'.

These forecasts arebased on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' 49-sector model of the UK economy, and onits regional housing submodel. Housing activity in England & Wales (measured by the number of propertytransactions) is expected to show growth of 7% in 1997, following an estimatedsimilar growth in 1996. This follows the short-lived recovery of 1993-94 andthe collapse in activity in 1995. The increase in housing transactions duringboth years, combined with a steadily growing economy, rising employment andfalling unemployment, is expected to boost house price inflation in the UK froman average of 4.1% in 1996 to over 7% in 1997. However, prospects vary greatly by region, with the strongest increase inactivity expected in the West Midlands and London, but the largest house pricerises in the south of England outside London and Scotland, reflecting theirstronger recovery in 1996. Activity to rise despite an expected increase in mortgage rates Growth in transactions in England & Wales is expected to continue atabout 7% in 1997 as projected higher mortgage rates (+1 pp) moderate the upwardpush that accelerating house price inflation will give in all the markets. Greater London and the West Midlands are expected to see the strongest growth,with both regions seeing better performance than in 1996. The rising rate ofhouse price inflation is expected to draw people into the market, and thiseffect is strengthened particularly in the case of London by the alleviationthat higher prices give to households with negative equity. The Rest of the South East, Yorkshire & Humberside and the North West,regions where activity has been subdued until now, are expected to seeaccelerating turnover as households' confidence strengthens. In Yorkshire &Humberside and the North West, the boost to growth in 1997 is a response to astrong turnaround in price inflation in 1996. (Prices are estimated to rise by1.8% and 3.6% respectively in 1996 following declines of 3% and 5.5% in 1995). The South West, East Anglia and the East Midlands are likely to be leadingrecovery in activity in 1996 and to reach levels consistent with theirunderlying demand conditions. Activity in these regions is therefore expectedto slow down in 1997, but house price inflation is likely to accelerate inresponse to a firmer market (see below). Accelerating house price inflation in 1997 to be strongest in the south UK house price inflation is set to accelerate from 4.0% in 1996 to 7½%in 1997 reflecting faster economic growth and continued strong growth inpersonal disposable income helped by a further expected reduction in directtaxation in the Budget. House price inflation in 1997 will also benefit fromthe price rises of 1996, with sellers in a stronger position to resist pressureto cut prices. House prices are forecast to rise fastest in the south of England whereprice inflation is supported in some cases by strong increases in activityeither currently (Greater London and the West Midlands) or in previous years(East Anglia and the South West). High price inflation is also forecast forScotland where economic growth is expected to pick up in 1997, resulting inrising employment (for the first time since 1994) and faster growth in householdincomes. The lowest house price inflation is expected in Wales and Yorkshire &Humberside, although both regions are expected to see faster growth in pricesin 1997 than in 1996. Activity in these regions fell sharply in 1995,accompanied by falling prices. A greater recovery in activity is thereforeneeded before substantial upward pressure on prices is likely. Inflation inNorthern Ireland, likely to exceed 10% in 1996, is expected to slow down in1997. Following two years of strong price rises and slower income growthexpected in 1996, housing is becoming less affordable. Long-term prospects in regional housing markets The strongest housing markets over the long term are forecast to be in theregions expected to see net inward migration: East Anglia, the East Midlands andthe South West. Housing transactions in these markets are expected to grow by1-1½% pa over 2000-05, while growth of only 0.8% pa is forecast for England& Wales as a whole over this period. This will provide favourableconditions for house price increases, on the assumption that the supply of newhousing does not pick up as quickly as demand growth. Activity in the West Midlands and Yorkshire & Humberside is expected tobe held back by a static working-age population and slow growth in the number ofhouseholds. However, rising participation in the labour market is expected tomaintain strong upward pressure on prices in the West Midlands. In general, in the long term there is expected to be a widening of theperformance differential of the northern and southern housing markets, thoughthe scale of earlier differentials is not forecast to be restored. In a scenario of stronger macroeconomic growth, southern markets see thelargest benefit The report also discusses the effects which a more optimistic economicscenario would have on regional housing markets. In the scenario a more buoyantmacroeconomic environment is assumed in 1997 with exports higher and the savingratio lower than the base forecast. Although markets are sensitive to any increase in real interest rates in theshort term, in the longer term faster income growth dominates other factorsinfluencing the housing market, and activity grows by some 0.2 pp pa faster thanin the base forecast with price inflation some 0.4 pp pa faster on average. Since regions in the south show the fastest employment and income growth, thehousing markets in these regions see the sharpest boost. Faster inflationoccurs again in the southern markets. Notes to Editors Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company and hasbeen providing detailed economic and sectoral forecasts since 1978. Thecompany's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for theUK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the EU in collaboration with ERECO,the leading network of European economic institutes. Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic,industrial and regional forecasts available for the UK. The projections arebased on the `Cambridge model', known as the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of theUK economy (MDM), which was originally developed in the University of CambridgeDepartment of Applied Economics (in the `Growth Project' set up in 1960 byProfessor Sir Richard Stone, the 1984 Nobel Laureate in Economics, and AlanBrown). This large computerised system has approximately 5,000 endogenousvariables and nearly 16,000 behavioural parameters and other coefficients. Themodel is continually revised and improved to take account of new data andadvances in economic theory and econometric techniques. The regional housing market forecasts are based on MDM and a housingsubmodel that provides an integrated analysis of house prices and housingturnover consistent with the regional macroeconomic environment. Regional Housing Market Prospects is published twice a year.

The inclusion of Washington Construction Company�s mining operations into the Mining Groupexpands the group�s revenue base and brings together two organizations that are like mindedin respect to maintaining cost-efficient projects where the health and safety of the work force isof paramount importance. The group, based in San Antonio, Texas, operates a surface lignite mine near San Antonio thatprovides three million tons of fuel per year for the nearby power plant of the mine�s owner,San Miguel Electric Cooperative. In eastern Montana, the group operates a surface coal mine forWestmoreland Resources, Inc. The approximately four million tons of coal produced annually atthis workings are loaded onto unit trains for transport to Midwestern power plants. MorrisonKnudsen Corporation owns a 24-percent interest in Westmoreland Resources. Add to this list of major U.S. contract mining operations, the Bullfrog Mine some 120 north ofLas Vegas, Nevada. Since 1988, Washington Construction has been mining and hauling up to30 million tons of ore and waste per year from this workings, one of the largest gold mines inthe country. Two other Washington Construction contract operations that are now part of theMining Group are a quartzite mine and a limestone mine, both located in southern Idaho. Internationally, MK owns a one-third interest in MIBRAG, a coal mining and industrial firm inGermany. In addition, the Mining Group operates three surface lignite mines under a contractwith MIBRAG. These mines produce a total of approximately 18 million tons of the brown coalannually. The group began mining operations for MIBRAG in 1994 and since that time has dramaticallyimproved efficiency and safety by introducing modern western mining methods and equipmentto the mines that just a few years ago were state-owned entities in the former East Germany.Recently, the MIBRAG mines achieved a record of 1.7 million working hours without a lost-timeaccident � a record that exceeded goals set at the start of the program and that was an all-timehigh in the history of coal mining in Germany. Target market areas for MK�s mining expertise include eastern Europe, South America,Indonesia and selected southeast Asian countries. Earlier this year, an MK-led joint venturewas awarded an engineering, procurement and construction-management contract for installationof coal processing, stockpiling and ship-loading equipment for a 3.8-million-ton-capacitysurface mine in Indonesia. MK serves the engineering needs of the mining industry with cutting-edge technology anda wide range of capabilities. The Mining Group�s engineering operations provide services inmining and civil engineering, and in surface and groundwater hydrology for mine design,development, operations and environmental restoration. The group meets the geoscience needs of its clients with reserve evaluation, modeling andfuel quality analysis. Extensive reclamation of MK-operated mines is the foundation of thegroup�s environmental operations that includes expertise in range management,threatened/endangered species, wildlife management, water quality, soil science, agriculturalengineering and wetlands. State-of-the-art technology in mine planning and resource development is augmented byAuto Cad services, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), including ArcInfo and ArcCad,and a full range of training and applications services related to the MINCOM mine planningsoftware.

This revitalized MK Heavy Civil Construction Group is one of the largest organizations of itskind in the United States, with proven operational expertise in constructing highways, bridgesand tunnels; airport and marine port facilities; rail lines; and water-distribution and storagesystems. Two recent projects epitomize the management skills, resourcefulness, responsiveness toclient needs and can-do attitude that is found in all of the group�s undertakings.In 1994, following the devastating Northridge earthquake in southern California,Washington Construction went to work for the California Department of Transportationon the emergency repair of a heavily damaged critical freeway interchange in Los Angeles.After mobilizing rapidly, crews worked 24 hours a day, seven days per week.The project was completed in just 100 days, 36 days ahead of schedule -- restoring avital transportation link for hundreds of thousands of citizens. Earlier this year, MK was called on by the Oregon Department of Transportation to repairtwo mountain highways decimated by heavy flooding. An MK team was on the job withinhours of the first call from ODOT and worked around the clock to open numerous slides thathad blocked a highway and isolated two small towns. MK then moved on to badly damagedHighway 6, a key route to coastal recreation areas. After extensive roadbed repairs wereundertaken, this project was completed in less than two months, more than a month earlierthan expected. While these projects were relatively small and short in duration, the performance thatproduced successful results applies to major projects, such as the $384-million EastsideReservoir Project in southern California that was awarded to a Washington Constructionjoint-venture earlier this year. The group�s skills at completing complex projects on time and within budget are augmentedby project development and financing capabilities in public-private partnerships or inassociation with commercial clients. An example of the group�s overall abilities is the E-470 beltway project in Denver. MK servedas an agent for the E-470 Public Highway Authority to develop and implement a plan of financeto fund all of the costs of the project to build two major segments of the beltway that willconnect Denver with the city�s new international airport. Following MK�s successful development and implementation of the financing plan, theAuthority awarded an MK-led limited liability company, a $321-million contract to design andbuild the two segments, a 29-mile-long project that will take 46 months to complete.Toll roads and projects similar in scope to E-470 will continue as one of the group�s primarymarkets worldwide. MK and a joint-venture associate recently were selected by theCommonwealth Transportation Board of Virginia to finance, design, construct and operatea connector road near Richmond that is expected to cost in excess of $250 million. One of the strengths Washington Construction brings to the merger is highway and bridgeconstruction, especially in California where Washington has been a dominant force for years.Among present projects are sections of the earthquake-damaged Cypress Freeway inOakland for $166 million, a $48-million interchange project in San Diego and a $32-millionfreeway widening job in San Bernardino. Another area of considerable focus is the Middle East where MK already has a strongpresence. Among recent projects in the region are several water-resource jobs in Egypt,including wastewater-treatment plants at Ismailia near the Suez Canal and at Port Saidon the Mediterranean coast. Marine construction is an MK specialty and the group recently completed the $230-millionThird Harbor Tunnel, an underwater tube tunnel in Boston Harbor for a four-lane highwayconnecting the city with Logan International Airport. The tunnel was selected as the OutstandingCivil Achievement by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Brandon Vice President Corporate Communications December 20, 1996 MK WINS $200 MILLION ROLE IN NUCLEAR CLEANUP JOB AT INEL BOISE -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation (NYSE: MK), as part of a team led by BNFL Inc., will perform engineering and construction services totaling more than $200 million for the largest privatization effort ever undertaken at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) by theDepartment of Energy (DOE). The total life cycle cost of the project will total $1.189 billion and involves the design, construction, and operation of the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Facility (AMWTP) to meet the milestones -- agreed to by DOE and the State of Idaho -- for getting nuclear waste out of Idaho. In addition to Morrison Knudsen, the team led by BNFL Inc. includes: Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), BNFL Engineering Ltd. (BEL), GTS Duratek, Manufacturing Sciences Corporation (MSC), Rocky Mountain Remediation Services, L.L.C. (RMRS), and Pajarito Scientific Corporation (PSC). BNFL Inc. is the American subsidiary of BNFL, an international nuclear fuel-cycle and radioactive waste management services company headquartered in the United Kingdom. BNFL brings 50 years experience in the design, licensing, construction and operation of private nuclearfacilities and has completed $12 billion in fixed-price capital projects since 1980. BNFL Inc. has several contracts at DOE sites throughout the U.S. In making the announcement, MK President and Chief Executive Officer Robert A. Tinstman noted that RMRS, jointly owned by MK and BNFL, is the environmental restoration and waste management contractor at the Rocky Flats Site in Colorado, where a majority of the waste to be treated at the INEL Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Facility was produced. INEL's AMWTPfacility will treat at least 99 percent of approximately 65,000 cubic meters of transuranic and alpha wastes currently stored at INEL, and have additional flexibility and capacity to treat an additional 20,000 cubic meters of optional waste. The facility's integrated treatment process will achieve an overall waste volume reduction of more than 65 percent, and will result in waste forms that can be accepted either by the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) or a low level waste storage/disposal facility. To treat the plutonium-contaminated mixed waste at the INEL, the BNFL team will employ proven technologies from its Sellafield site in the United Kingdom, including two waste encapsulation plants and a waste treatment complex designed to treat plutonium-contaminated waste at much greater levels of contamination than the waste which will be treated at the INEL's AMWTP. The AMWTP contract will be executed in three phases. In Phase I, which extends through 1999, the BNFL Inc. team will obtain permits and the authorization basis for facility operations, and MK will assist in finalizing the design and business approach. In Phase II, MK will manageconstruction of the facility to meet the completion date of December 31, 2002. Phase III extends through 2015 and will entail plant operations, waste treatment, and transportation of the waste out of Idaho. Morrison Knudsen Corporation has more than five decades of experience in the nuclear industry, including more than 40 years at the INEL. MK will be responsible for all architectural, engineering and construction management services associated with the AMWTP. SAIC, which has been a part of INEL since the 1970s, will provide all permitting and regulatory support, working with both the stakeholders and the regulators to ensure a safe and effective treatment facility is built and operated. BEL will provide the BNFL team with expertise in the design of the highly advanced instrumentation and robotics technologies, as well as proven major nuclear engineering and project management experience. RMRS, the waste manager at the Rocky Flats Site in Colorado, will support the BNFL team in bringing an unequaled knowledge of the waste characteristics -- the majority of the waste emanates from Rocky Flats -- as well as expertise in the areas of mixed waste treatment, storage, and disposal operations. RMRS is jointly owned by MK and BNFL. Team members that will provide specialty technologies include: GTS Duratek, selected for its unparalleled experience in commercial scale, radioactive waste vitrification; MSC, chosen for its unique, large-scale specialty metal melting and recycling capabilities; and PSC, which represents the leading edge in proven and unique waste characterization systems. # # # For further information, e-mail mkcorp@mk.com Return to MK News Releases Return to MK Home Page WT03-B15-334IA074-000485-B001-26http://www.mkweb.inter.net:80/pr000012.htm 38.15.25.234 19970125015704 text/html 3149HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 25 Jan 1997 01:56:59 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 2978Last-modified: Mon, 23 Dec 1996 21:55:49 GMT Press Releases Morrison Knudsen Plaza/P.O.

Morrison Knudsen Corporation and Washington Construction Group, Inc. merged onSeptember 11, 1996 and the results announced today are for the former Washington Construction Group only for the quarterly period ending prior to the merger. The Company announced that the recognition of after-tax adjustments of $11.1 million for write-downs on certain real estate properties and non-core businesses held for sale have resulted in a net loss of $11.2 million, $.38 per share, on revenue of $97.8 million for the quarter ended August 31, 1996 compared to net income of $3.0 million, $.10 per share, on revenue of $71.9 million for the third quarter of 1995.

Enhanced scalability using OS/390 workload management facility This support allows the Internet Connection Secure Server to establish policies tomanage application workload.Workload management modifies the server environment to achievethe best overall results.Increased server throughput is achieved by using the workloadmanagement facility to spread the total server workloads amongseveral multi-threaded server processes, minimizing cross-threadserialization and removing the hard ceiling on the total numberof threads that can be started by the server. Customized response based on requesting browser Your server can now automaticallydetect the type of browser making a request andreturn Web information that isappropriately formatted for the particular browser.See the Webmaster's Guide for details. Counter and date/time image support for Web pages You can enhance your Web pages witha user-access counter and the date and time as graphical images.See the section on customizing your Web site in theWebmaster's Guide for details. Enhancements to logging and generating reports on server activity This version offersa new Java Graphical User Interface (GUI).You can log and analyze activity on your serverbased on URLs, host names, methods, or return codes. You can generatetailored reports based on associations such as URL hits by host, hosthits by URL, return codes by URL, and methods by URL.See the Webmaster's Guide for details. HTTP Version 1.1 compliance Support for HTTP now includes HTTP 1.1 compliance, whichprovides for persistent connections and virtual hosts.Persistent connections allow the server to accept multiple requestsand to send responses over the same TCP/IP connection. Virtualhosts allow one IP address to serve multiple files insteadof requiring different IP addresses for different files.See the Webmaster's Guide for details. Expanded Common Gateway Interface (CGI) support CGI support now includes the Java programming languagein addition to the other languages already supported,such as C, REXX, and Perl.See the Webmaster's Guide for details. Year 2000 support The Internet Connection Secure Server makes the transition into the 21st century a smoothconversion with reliable support for the year 2000 and beyond. Performance improvements Dramatic improvements in single and multiple processorenvironments coupled with significant CPU requirement reductionsprovide higher throughput and shorter response time.See the Webmaster's Guide for details. Web site content rating support Based on the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS),you can use an independent rating service to rate the content ofdocuments served through your Web site, or you can act as a ratingservice for your own or other Web sites.Users who request the ratings can thenevaluate the Web pages for acceptable content before viewing them.See the Webmaster's Guide for details. Client authentication and other enhancements to SSL support The vast majority of users are choosing the Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) protocol for their secure transactions instead of S-HTTP, soSSL is where we're putting our efforts as well. We've removed S-HTTPsupport in this and future versions of the Internet Connection Secure Server, and we will continueto enhance our support of SSL. Our support of SSL V3 now includesclient authentication, which is a security enhancement thatallows the server to verify, with a high degree ofconfidence, that any client is who it says it is. Our support ofSSL V3 also includes server authentication, data encryption, andadditional Message Digest Hashing algorithms.See the Webmaster's Guide for details.See the Webmaster's Guide for details. SOCKS support and SSL tunneling Clients can now connect directly to a SOCKS server, instead ofusing an interim server, which lowers response time. SSL tunnelingallows the server to act as a proxy server for secure transactions.See the Webmaster's Guide for details. Online access to server performance and status information Through your browser,you can use the Server Activity Monitor toobserve performance and status information about your server andthe network.Access log entries are also displayed.See the section on managing your server in theWebmaster's Guide for details. Internet Connection Application Program Interface (ICAPI) support Improvements include expanded diagnostic capability with additionaltrace capability and additional messages. Users may useexisting HTTP methods or tailor them to their needs.See the Webmaster's Guide for details. Java servlet support Java 1.0 support provides Sun Microsystems, Inc., standardsfor servlets. Servlets typically offer significant performanceenhancements over CGI programs.See the Webmaster's Guide for details. Proxy authentication You can set up password protection for yourproxy server independentlyof the password protection at the destination server.See the Webmaster's Guide for details. Book title change Our Up and Running books of previous releases havebeen renamed Quick Beginnings. The focus remains thesame: to provide the minimal, essential information for planning for,installing, and starting to use your server as quickly and easilyas possible.

Server: IBM-Secure-Export-ICS/v970115 BetaDate: Fri, 24 Jan 1997 21:37:34 GMTAccept-Ranges: bytesContent-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 11963Last-Modified: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 17:12:54 GMT Internet Connection Secure Server Quick Beginnings Chapter 2. More about your server The IBM Internet Connection Secure Serverprovides the foundation for building yourcompany's presence on the Internet.Your business can use the Internet Connection Secure Server on the WorldWide Web to reach customers and suppliers around the world.Or you can use the Internet Connection Secure Serverwithin your business to communicate with employees. With the IBM Internet Connection Secure Server, your business can implementSecure Sockets Layer (SSL)to ensure that your business transactions are secure. This chapter describes some of the key features of the server. Installing and configuring the server You can easily install the server using theOS/2 installation tool, Software Installer. After you install the server, you can start it using theconfiguration values you specified during installation.Default values are supplied for all the other configuration values.Using a Web browser, you can then connect to the server. Once you connect to your server, you'll see the Front Page, which ituses as its home page.The Front Page provides a valuable assortment oftools and information, including links to: Configuration and Administration Forms Sample Home Page Internet Connection Family Web Site Documentation For installation steps, see Chapter 4. "Installing your server". Using other programs with the server The server supports the Common Gateway Interface (CGI),which allows you to create external programs (CGI programs)that interface with your serverand perform tasks such as searching and forwarding e-mail messages. To assist you in writing CGI programs, the serverincludes utilities for extracting forms data, writingdocument headers, and processing image maps. The server also supports the Internet ConnectionApplication Programming Interface (ICAPI).This interface is designed specifically for the server'sthreaded processing and allows you to easily extend the server'sbase functions.Using the ICAPI you can write extensions to performsite-specific processing, such as publishing customizedpages based on client's code level, enhancing the basicauthentication, and adding error routines to track problemsor alert you about serious conditions. For more information, see the Web Programming Guideand the Webmaster's Guide. Managing your server with Simple Network Management Protocol The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subagent builtinto Internet Connection Secure Server maintains server information and performance datain an SNMP Management Information Base (MIB).The MIB data describes the server being managed, reflects currentand recent server status, and provides server performance data.From any SNMP-capable network manager, you can display, monitor,and adjust thresholds for your server's performance to proactivelytune or fix server problems before they become server outages. For more information, see the Webmaster's Guide. Restricting access Most likely, you will not want everyone to be able to accessall the information on your server.For example, you probably would not want everyone to be able toaccess your CGI programs. You can restrict access based on user name andpassword, or the address of the requester.Access authorization is controlled using the configuration file andpossibly one or more other files, including: A protection setup, which defines the protection being used A password file, which allows you to define user names andpasswords A group file, which allows you to define groups of user names An Access Control List (ACL) file, which allows you to define accessfor individual files or groups of files on a protected directory For more information, see the Webmaster's Guide. Mapping resources You can create a virtual hierarchy of Web resources.As part of the server's configuration, you can specifyresource mapping rules, which associate a request templatewith the actual path to a document or resource.Each request that comes to the server is checked againstthese rules to determine if the request should be acceptedand where the requested resource is actually located. For more information, see the Webmaster's Guide. Logging requests and errors To help you determine whether or not your Internet messageis reaching the intended audience, you can keep access logsthat show who is accessing your server and when.To see internal server errors, you can check your server'serror logs.If your server is a caching proxy,you can keep logs of requestsfor cached files in a cache access log. In addition, your server creates agent logs,referer logs, and CGI error logs.Agent logsindicate which Web browser was used to access a Web page.Referer logs indicate the page that linked to or referred to the page.CGI error logs contain standard error output (stderr) from CGIprograms. You can control what gets logged by filtering out entriesthat match a particular pattern.Your server automatically creates a report for each log,so you can view the contents of the log.You can modify these default report templates so that you includeand/or exclude log entries contained in the report. Because the logs are written in a format that is common to most Webservers, you can use any of several generic statistical programs toanalyze the log contents. You can compress log data,archive reports, and include oldlog data in reports. For more information, see the Webmaster's Guide. Running the server as a caching proxy When you configure your server as a caching proxy server,you can improve performance, as well as allow usersof your internal network to access documents on the Internet. You can specify many configuration optionsfor a caching proxy, including: Which files you want (and do not want) to store in cache The maximum amount of space allotted to cache storage Automatic reclamation of cache storage space Routing of requests to other proxy servers For more information, see the Webmaster's Guide. Running the server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts You can configure your server to serve different files based onthe IP address of the network connection a request comes in onor the host for whom a request is made.This is particularly valuable to Internet serviceproviders who want to use one server to provide Web sites formultiple customers.The server allows you to configure: Welcome Pages: to determinehow the server responds to requests that do not contain a file name Mapping Rules: to set map requests to physical filesand to determine whether the server processes a request Access Control: to activate different protection rules forrequests depending on which address the request comes in on orwhich host name is specified in a URL For more information, see the Webmaster's Guide. Using server-side includes Server-side includes enable the server to do some processingof Web pages before the page is sent to the client.The current date, the size of the file, the last change of a file areexamples of the kind of information that can be sent to the client. For more information, see the Webmaster's Guide. Customizing the server's error messages The Internet Connection Secure Server design is based on the work at CERN.You can customize basic CERN messages that your serversends back to the client when error conditions are encountered.For example, you can change a messageto include more information about the cause of theproblem and suggest possible solutions to fix it.For internal networks, you might providea contact person for your users to call. For more information, see the Webmaster's Guide. Adding a search facility to your Web site The Internet Connection Secure Server includes the NetQuestion search facility in a package thatyou can install separately.NetQuestion enablesyou to build and maintain searchable indexes to the information onyour Web site. NetQuestion includes a search engine, a commandinterface, and HTML forms that aid Web site navigation andadministration. For more information, see the documentation that comes withthe NetQuestion package. Using proxy authentication The server distinguishesbetween authorized user IDs and passwords that are usedby the end-point server and the proxy server. This allowsyou to require authentication for proxy requests. For more information, see the Webmaster's Guide.

The TME 10 NetFinity Server can be downloadedfrom the http://www.software.ibm.com/download/ URL. Compatibility IBM's Web clients and servers use industry standard protocolsand are compatible with other Web clients and serversthat are compliant with these protocols. Migration considerations This section describes issues that you should consider whenmigrating from a previous release. CICS gateway Version 4 Release 2does not include the CICS gateway function.For existingCICS gateways, you must manually migrate the CICS pass rules.To obtain current information aboutthe CICS gateway, use your Web browser to go to the following URL:http://www.hursley.ibm.com/cics/saints/index.html. DB2 gateway Version 4 Release 2does not include the DB2 gateway function.For existing DB2 gateways, you must manually update thedb2.www.ini file.To obtain current information aboutthe DB2 gateway, use your Web browser to go to the following URL:http://www.software.ibm.com/data/db2/db2wgafs.html. Imbeds directive In Version 4 Release 2,the imbeds directive is required for server-side includes.In previous releases,you could specify that documents witha specific extension or suffix be processed for server-side includes.If you specified an extension or suffix of .html or .htm,you do not need to make any changes to your configuration file.If you specified any other extension or suffix, you need to checkthe AddType directives and make sure you have an AddType definedfor that suffix that has a content type of text/x-ssi-html.See the Webmaster's Guide for information aboutthis directive. Proxy server and caching proxy server The Configuration and Administration forms for defining proxy andcaching proxy settings have been rearranged and changed slightly.Two forms have been deleted and the information from them hasbeen added to the other proxy forms. These forms have been deleted: Time Limit for Cached Files Cache File Expiration In addition, the CacheTimeMargin directive has been deleted.See the Webmaster's Guide for information about configuringyour server as a proxy server or caching proxy server. Proxy authentication In Version 4 Release 1, the server did not distinguishbetween a user ID and password used for authentication at theproxy server and those used for authentication at the end-point server.In Version 4 Release 2, request authentication is supported.See the Webmaster's Guide for informationabout proxy authentication. Server IP Address Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longerbe specified for a server's IP address.This applies to the following directives: imbeds Welcome DefProt Protect Exec Fail Map Pass Redirect Enable NameTrans Service CHECKIN and CHECKOUT methods for the Enable directive Beginning with Version 4.2, theCHECKIN and CHECKOUT methods are no longer supported.You can use the PUT method for CHECKIN and the GET method forCHECKOUT; however, theInternet Connection Secure Server does not perform locking or versioning. Accessory script directives The accessory script directives, DELETE-Script, POST-Script,PUT-Script, and Search, are no longer supported. You need toport your scripts to ICAPI applications. See the WebProgramming Guide for more information.

Automating installation If you are installing the server from a remote code server,you can use a Configuration, Installation, and Distribution(CID) response file to automatically install or update the server.This section describes how to perform the following two types ofautomated installation: Remote attended installation Remote unattended installation Remote attended installation If a remote code server has the server product files, the clientsof the code server can perform a remote attended installation.Clients must meet the server hardware and software requirements,have a LAN connection, and have access to the remote code serverdirectory that contains the server product files.For more information on hardware and software requirements,see Chapter 3. "Planning for installation". The code server must have a server response file.The response file contains pre-set values for the installationvariables.The default response file for the server is named websrvr.rsp.The default response file contains comments that explain thedifferent variables and how to set them. From the client where you want to install the server,follow these instructions for a remote attended installation: Verify that you have access to the remote code server and thatthe server response file is in the same directory of the code serveras the product files. At an OS/2 prompt, enter    z:\path\install /r:z:\path\websrvr.rsp where: z:\path\ is the drive and pathwhere the server files reside on the code server. /r:indicates that the name of a response file follows. z:\path\websrvr.rspis the name of the response file to be used.You must give the full drive and path nameif it is different from the current directory. Note: There are no spaces in the/r:z:\path\websrvr.rsp string. As the installation process continues,either use the pre-set values from the response fileor modify them to meet your own particular needs. Remote unattended installation You can use a software distribution manager toperform remote unattended installations of the server.Remote unattended installation allows you to distribute softwarefrom a software distribution manager to workstations.You must have a network connection established between thesoftware distribution manager and the target workstations.The target workstations must have the client software for thesoftware distribution manager installed. For remote unattended installation of the server using othersoftware distribution managers, use the install command as follows:    install  /x  /r:z:\path\websrvr.rsp  /l1:z:\path\error.log  /l2:z:\path\history.log where: /x indicates unattended installation. /r: indicates that the nameof a response file follows. z:\path\websrvr.rspis the name of the response file to be used. /l1: indicates that the name of the error logfile follows. z:\path\error.log is the name of the filewhere the installation procedure should write error messages. /l2: indicates that the name of the history logfile follows. z:\path\history.log is the name of the filewhere the installation procedure should write information messages. Notes: There are no spaces between the parameter indicators (/r, /l1, and /l2)and the file specifications. You must give the full drive and path names for files if they aredifferent from the current directory. What's next? Go to Chapter 5.

Using your server Chapter 5. Starting to use your server Using Your Server This chapter contains basic instructionsfor starting and stopping your server.It also describes the first tasks you willprobably want to perform after installation. Partial Table-of-Contents Starting the server Starting automatically from the OS/2 startup folder Starting from the Internet Connection Secure Server icon Starting from the command prompt Starting multiple instances of the server Restarting from the Internet Connection Secure Server Window Stopping the server Viewing your server's Front Page What's next? Starting the server This section describes how to start and stop your serverafter you have finished installing it.If you think the server is running but you do not see the windowfor it on your OS/2 Desktop, press Ctrl+Escto see the list of active OS/2 programs.If the Window List contains an entry for the server, double clickthe entry to bring the server's window into view. If you are running a non-secure server,you will see the messageSecurity not available. filename.dll did not load.This message lets you know that you are not running the Internet Connection Secure Server.You do not need to do anything in response to the message. Starting automatically from the OS/2 startup folder If during installation you checked Auto Start Server at Bootup,the server has been added to your OS/2 Startup folder.Each time you start or reboot your system, the server will start.If you rebooted your system after installing the server,the server should be running now. When you start the server automatically,it uses the current configuration settings.If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,the current configuration is based on the information youentered during installation along with defaults. Starting from the Internet Connection Secure Server icon The installation procedure creates an Internet Connection Secure Serverfolder on your OS/2 Desktop.Inside the folder is an icon for the Internet Connection Secure Server.To start the server, double click the icon. The server starts with the current configuration settings.If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,the current configuration is based on the information youentered during installation along with defaults. Starting from the command prompt You can start the server from any OS/2 command prompt by entering: httpd This starts the server with the current configuration settings.If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,the current configuration is based on the information youentered during installation along with defaults. The httpd command also accepts various options for changingconfiguration settings at run time.For details on the httpd command options,see the Webmaster's Guide. Starting multiple instances of the server You can start multiple instances of the server,but each instance must listen on a separate port.All instances, other than the first, can be startedby entering the following command from a command prompt: httpd -r other_rule_file where other_rule_file is a configuration file thatspecifies the individual port. Restarting from the Internet Connection Secure Server Window You can restart your server from the Internet Connection Secure Server windowby selecting Restartfrom the Server pull-down menu on the menu bar.The server reloads the configuration settings fromthe configuration file it was originally started with. Stopping the server You can stop the server the same ways you stop other OS/2 programs.Do any of the following: Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and double clickthe small icon in the top left corner. Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and select Exit from theServer pull-down menu on the menu bar. Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and press F3. Press Ctrl+Esc.With the right mouse button click the Window List entry for the Internet Connection Secure Server.Click Close. Viewing your server's Front Page After your server is up and running, you can use WebExplorer orany other Web browser to look at the server's Front Page. If you started the server with the default configuration fileand you have not yet created your own home page,you can view the Front Page by using yourbrowser to open the following URL: http://your.server.name/ Where your.server.name isthe fully qualified name of your host.For example, http://www.ibm.com/. The server's Front Page contains the following links: Configuration and Administration Forms. A tool that letsyou configure your server by filling in a set of forms.The forms are coded with the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Sample Home Page. A sample documentthat demonstrates how to use many of the HTML tags. Internet Connection Family Web Site.

Documentation. An online HTML version of the following: Quick Beginnings Webmaster's Guide Web Programming Guide Web design information If you want to go to the Front Page after you create your own homepage, just include the Front Page file name on the URL.The Front Page file name is Frntpage.html,so you would use the following URL to see it: http://your.server.name/Frntpage.html What's next? Now that your server is up and running, you'll probablywant to configure it to your own specifications.Your server allows you to: Modify the Configuration and Administration formsto easily configure the default settings. Change the default home pageto have the server return your own home page.The home page is the document that your server returns when a clientsends a request that does not point to a specific directory or file. Change your document root directoryto serve requests that do not point to a specific directory.Your home page should always be on your home directory. Run your server as a caching proxy to improveresponse time by having the proxy server store the documentsit receives from other servers in a local cache. Run a proxy server and standard serverfrom the same host to have the convenience of runningtwo different servers from one host. Run your server with multiple IP addresses or virtualhosts toserve different files based on the IP address of the networkconnection a request comes in on or the host for whom therequest is made.This is especially helpful forInternet access providers who want to use one server to provideWeb sites for multiple customers. These activities are described in the Webmaster's Guide.

Appendixes Appendix A. Installing with SystemView Installing with SystemView You can use SystemView to install the Internet Connection Server onunattended workstations using the statements included intwo files called a software profile and aresponse file.A software profile is used by SystemView toinvoke an application installation program.A response file is used by the installation program to get all of thedata it needs during the installation process. Using SystemView, you specify the information for the software profileand response files when you customize the application definitionfile, which defines how to install and configure the Internet Connection Server.This file is shipped with the Internet Connection Server. Refer to the SystemView documentation for a complete descriptionof software profiles and response files. Overview To install the Internet Connection Server on server workstationsusing SystemView, you need to: Copy the Internet Connection Server files to the code server Add the Internet Connection Server information to the SystemView software library Configure the Internet Connection Server in the SystemView software libraryby placing it into the catalog at the distribution server Distribute and install the resulting software objectusing SystemView on target server workstations These tasks are described in the following sections.If you need additional assistance to perform thesetasks, use the online help or refer toSystemView Up and Running! for more information. Copying the Internet Connection Server to the Code Server To set up the code server so that you can install the Internet Connection Serverusing SystemView, enter the XCOPY command. For example, to copy the files from the CD-ROM located in theE: drive to the D: drive, you would enter this command: XCOPY E:\*.* D:\CID\IMG\WEB /S This command copies the files from the root directoryon the CD-ROM in the E: drive to the D: drive,putting the files under the directory \CID\IMG\WEB. The /S indicates that all of the subdirectories and their contentsand the contents of the root directory should be copied. Adding the Internet Connection Server to the Software Library To add the Internet Connection Server to the software library, do the following steps: Start SystemView. Double-click on the SystemView Service Manager icon. Double-click on the CID Software Preparation icon. Double-click on the Software Library icon. Select Software from the menu baron the Software Library window. Select New.... Select Find....

You canalso create and view reports based on the information in your accesslogs. You can customize your reports or use any of the reporttemplates that are provided. Support for user-written programs that interface with your server You can write programs that communicate and interact with yourserver, via either the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or theInternet Connection API (ICAPI).For example, you can write a CGI program to generate a dynamicresponse to user input, or you can write an ICAPI program tocustomize the way errors are handled. Support for server-side includes You can insert dynamic (changing) information into HTMLdocuments and CGI programs that the server sends to clients.For example, you can include the current date, the file size,and the date of the last change to the file. Customizable error messages You can tailor the messages that your server returns to clientswhen errors occur.For example, you can modify a message to explainhow to fix a particular problem.For internal networks, you might even include the name and number ofthe contact person. Support for multiple IP addresses If you run your server on a machine with multiplenetwork addresses, you can configure it to serve different filesbased on the IP address that a request comes in on.For example, an Internet service provider can configurea single server to supply multiple customers with Web sites withdiffering welcome pages, mapping rules, and access control.

This chapter explains what you can change about your server'sconfiguration, as well as how to change these items, by using theConfiguration and Administration forms or by editing theconfiguration file.

Set up a secure connection Running your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts Multiple IP addresses Virtual hosts Setting up your server to use multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts Backing up files Configuring your server You can configure your server either by using theConfiguration and Administration forms or by editing theserver's configuration file. Using the Configuration and Administration forms The server comes with Configuration and Administrationforms.These forms are a combination of CGI programs and HTML formsthat provide an easy way for you to configure your server or toview your server's current configuration settings. Once the server is running, you can access theConfiguration and Administration formsfrom WebExplorer (or any other Web browser).The browser can be on the same machine as the server or on anyremote client that has access to the server. To use the Configuration and Administration forms: Disable caching on your browser.Also, if you are configuring your server remotely from a browserthat uses that specific server as its proxy server,you should disable the proxy server setting on your browser. Using your browser, go to the server's Front Pageby typing the following URL: http://your.server.name/ where your.server.name is the fully qualified nameof your host. For example, http://www.ibm.com/ Click Configuration and Administration Forms. If you have not used the Configuration and Administration formssince starting your browser, you will be prompted for a user nameand password. Enter the user name and password you specified in theAdministrator ID and Password fields duringinstallation.If you did not change the installation defaults,the authorized user name is webadmin and the authorizedpassword is webibm.If you did not change the defaults during installation, it isstrongly recommended that you do so now to prevent unauthorizedaccess to your server configuration.See "Controlling access to the Configuration and Administration forms". After you enter an authorized user name and password,you go to the Configuration and Administration forms page. From the Configuration and Administration forms page,you can link to each of the input forms by clickingon the form name. When you go to a form, it is displayed withthe current configuration values in its input fields.(If you haven't changed your configuration since installation,these are the default values.) From any form, enter information about how you want toconfigure that particular part of your server. Each form provides instructionsto assist you in deciding what changes to make.For further information, you can click the help icon atthe bottom of each form.The help icon links you to a help page thatprovides detailed steps for using the form to performparticular tasks. After you fill in the form, you mustclick Apply to indicate you want to update the serverconfiguration with the changes you made.The Apply button is located below the input fields on eachform. If you decide you do not want to use the changes you made to the form,click Reset.This returns the fields on the formto the values they had when you first came to the form. Note: A few of the form pages have more than one set of Applyand Reset buttons.These pages are actually treated as multiple forms.If you click Apply or Reset, the actiontakes place only for the portion of the page associated with thatset of buttons. If you clicked on Apply,the server shows you a message indicating whether your input wasaccepted.If the input was accepted, you see a Confirmation page thattells you what configuration directives were updated. If the input was not accepted, you see a Configuration Error pageexplaining what was wrong with the information you entered.Go back to the form and try to correct the information.From the form you may also want to click the help icon at the bottomof the form. If the Confirmation page contains a Restart Server button,you can click it to have the server restart and begin usingthe configuration changes you just made. If the Confirmation page does not contain a Restart Serverbutton, then you need to stop your server and start it again for theconfiguration changes you made to take effect.For instructions on stopping and starting your server,see "Starting and stopping your server". Note: From the Confirmation page or the Restart Confirmation page,use the Configuration Page button to return to theConfiguration and Administration forms. Editing the configuration file The other way to configure your server isby editing the configuration file. By default, the configuration file is named httpd.cnf andis in the path specified on the SET ETCstatement in your CONFIG.SYS file. The configuration file is made upof statements called directives.You change your configuration by editing the configuration file,updating the directives, and saving your changes. When you restart the server, your changes take effect, unlessyou changed one of the following directives: Port BindSpecific SSLClientAuth SSLMode SSLPort NormalMode KeyFile imbeds ServerRoot If you changed one of the directives in the above list,you must stop the server and start it again.For instructions on stopping and starting your server,see "Starting and stopping your server". "Using the configuration file" describes each of the configuration file directives. Controlling access to the Configuration and Administration forms After installation, your server has one authorized user nameand one password that can be used to access theConfiguration and Administration forms. You specified the authorized user name and password in theAdministrator ID and Password fieldsduring installation.If you did not change the installation defaults,the authorized user name is webadminand the authorized password is webibm. The user name and password are stored in the ADMIN.PWD password file,which is located in the path specified by the SET ETC statementin your CONFIG.SYS file. If you have not yet changed the default user name or password,you should do so now to prevent unauthorized accessto the Configuration and Administration forms. You can use either the htadm command or the Configurationand Administration forms to control user names, passwords,and password files. If you just want to change the password for the default user namewith the htadm command, you would enter the following:    htadm -passwd d:\setetc\ADMIN.PWD user-name password In the above example: d:\setetc\ is the path specifiedon the SET ETC statement in your CONFIG.SYS file. user-name is the name you enteredfor Administrator ID at installation.The installation default is webadmin. password is the new password you want to use. See "htadm command" for completeinstructions on how to use the htadm command. For more information about limiting access to the resourceson your server, see "Protecting your server". Changing the default home page One of the first configuration tasks you will want to perform is changingyour server so that it returns your own home page.The home page is the document that your server returnswhen a client sends a request that does not pointto a specific directory or file.So when a client sends a URL in the format of: http://your.server.name/ your server responds by sending back your home page.When you first start the server,the server uses the Front Page as your home pageand uses the default configuration file. Configuration settings tell yourserver where to look for your home page and what its name is.So that you can understand how this works,this section contains background information about thedocument root directory and the welcome page list.The section then describes an easy way to create your own home pageand have the server use it instead of the server's Front Page. Note: Some Web browsers use the term "home page" to also referto the first page that the browser loads when it is started.This document uses the term only to refer to the server home page. Understanding the document root directory When the server receives requests that do not point toa specific directory, it tries to serve the requestfrom the document root directory.Because you want your home page to be returned for requests that donot specify a directory or file name, you need to have your home pagein your document root directory. The document root directory is the directory youspecified as your HTML directory during installation.If you used the installation defaults, the document root directory isC:\WWW\HTML. Changing your document root directory At some point you may decide to change the directory your serveruses for its document root directory. For example, you might want to change your document root directoryif you are creating a new set of HTML documents for your server to use.While you are creating the new documents,you might want to keep them on a directory not accessible to the server. Follow these steps to change your document root directory: From the Configuration and Administration forms page,click Request Routing.(If you're not sure how to access the Forms, see "Using the Configuration and Administration forms".) On the Request Routing form, select the Replace button. Change the Index field to the numberof the Pass rule that has /* as its URL request template. Change the Action field to Pass. Enter /* in the URL request template field. Enter your new document root directory in theReplacement file path field. Click Apply. From the Confirmation page, click Restart Server. After restarting, the server begins to use the new document rootdirectory. So now you know where your server looks for your home page,but how does it know which file to return?This is defined by the list of welcome pages. Understanding the welcome pages The server's configuration defines a list of file namesthat the server can use as welcome pages.These are the files the server looks for when itreceives URL requests that do not specify a file name. For requests that do not specify either a directory or file name,you want the server to return your home page.As described in the previous section, the server looks for yourhome page on the document root directory.It then determines which file contains your home page by matching thelist of welcome pages to the files in the directory.The first match it finds is the file it returns as your home page. The default configuration file defines a list of four welcome pages.The order of the welcome pages is important because theserver goes down the list from top to bottom when looking forthe file it should return. The default welcome page file names and their default order are: Welcome.html welcome.html index.html Frntpage.html The server returns the first file it finds that matches a file namein the list.Until you create a Welcome.html, welcome.html, or index.html fileand place the file in the document root directory,the server uses Frntpage.html as your home page. For example, if you are using the default configuration and yourdocument root directory does not contain a file named Welcome.html,or welcome.html, but does contain files named index.html and Frntpage.html,the index.html file is used as your home page. For more information on welcome pages and how they are usedby directories other than the document root directory,see "Directories and Welcome Page - Set viewing options". The easiest way to have your server start returning your ownhome page is to create the page in a file named Welcome.htmland store the file on your document root directory.The next section explains how to do this. Creating your own home page You can use any HTML document for your home page. If you already have a document you want to use as your home page,just copy it into your document root directory and rename it toWelcome.html, welcome.html, or index.html. If you want to create a new home page and have your server start usingit, you can use the following procedure: Using your browser, go to the server's Front Pageby typing the following URL: http://your.server.name/ where your.server.name isthe fully qualified name of your host.For example, http://www.ibm.com/. Click Sample Home Page. From WebExplorer select Save as from the Filepull-down menu on the menu bar.(Most other browsers provide a similar function.) Save the file with a name ofWelcome.html and put it in the document root directory.Your home page must be placed in your root directorysince this is the directory your server uses to serverequests that do not point to a specific directory. Use your choice of editors to edit the new Welcome.html fileand turn it into your own home page masterpiece. Need some help with HTML?Depending upon your current level of expertise with HTML, thereare many sources of information available. The Internet Connection Family Home Page, which is a link fromthe server's front page, allows you to download beta code,as well as giveaways, retail products, and accessory products. A fun and easy way to learn about HTML and generate ideasfor your own home page is to go surfing on the Web.Find some pages you like and use your browser toview the HTML markup that makes them work. Many samples are available in BonusPak and BonusPak II. You can write your HTML documents using any editor capableof producing flat text files.However, if you use a plain text editoryou will have to key in each of the HTML tags.There are several editors and related tools designed specifically tohelp users create HTML documents without having to key in all thesurrounding tags. For example, non-commercial users can get a free copy ofan editor called HoTMetaL Free from SoftQuad.Go to the following URL for instructions on how to get HoTMetaL Free: http://www.sq.com/products/hotmetal/hm-ftp.htm When you have documents ready that you want to show the world, youcan start to register your server with various databases.For example, the following URLs take you to sites where you canregister your server: http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Geographical_generation/new-servers.html Note: The URL above is shown on two lines only because of its length.When entering the URL on your browser, type one continuous string withno spaces. http://www.yahoo.com/http://www.lycos.com/ Each of the two URLs shown above contains links toa form you can use to register your server. Running your server as a proxy Clients connected to a proxy server can askthe server to retrieve documents for them from other servers. You can also set up afirewall machine,such as the IBM Internet Connection Secured Network Gateway.A firewall machine is connected to both yourinternal network, or intranet, and the external Internet.Users of the intranet are inside the firewall.The firewall machine can be set up to prevent external machinesfrom reaching your intranet. Two types of proxy/firewall configurations are available: A proxy server can link to a firewall machine that has a socksserver in it.The proxy server is chained to the socks server in the firewall machineand the firewall machine linksto the Internet, as shown in Figure 1.This kind of proxy server, also known as a socksified proxy,allows users within your intranet to access the Internet. Figure 1. Socksified proxy server and a firewall One machine can contain both the firewall and the proxy serveras shown in Figure 2.For this kind of configuration, you can use theIBM Internet Connection Secure Server for AIX for your proxy and theIBM Internet Connection Secured Network Gateway for AIX asyour firewall. Figure 2. Machine with both a firewall and proxy server Caching documents on your proxy server You can also use cachingto have the proxy server store the documentsit retrieves from other servers in a local cache.The server can then respond to subsequent requests for thesame documents without having to retrieve them from other servers.This can improve response time. Within an intranet you may want to set upa server as a caching proxy toreduce the amount of traffic on the network.In large networks you can connect a hierarchy of caching proxies.A client request cascades up through the hierarchy of serversuntil the document is retrieved from a server's cacheor from the actual server where the document resides. Setting up your proxy server To set up a proxy, you need to: Configure basic proxy functions Optionally, configure basic caching functions Optionally, designate a port number for your proxy Optionally, configure advanced proxy functions Optionally, configure advanced caching functions Specify which clients can use the proxy Set up a secure connection After you've configured your proxy server, tell your users so theycan configure their browsers to point to it. Step 1. Configure basic proxy functions To configure your serveras a proxy, specify which protocolsyou want the server to act as a proxy for.You do this by one of two methods: Filling in the Proxy Server Settings formfor the protocols this server will function as a proxy for Adding Pass rules for the protocolsto your server's list of mapping rules Either method enables your server to act as a proxy. To fill in the form: From the Configuration and Administration forms page,under the heading "Proxy Settings", clickProxy Server Settingsto display the Proxy Server Settings form. Select the protocols that the server will act as a proxy for.(Checking a selection box generates a Pass rule for the protocolchecked.) You should accept the default size specified for the Proxybuffer size. If you want your server to be a socksified proxy server, you needto specify the host name or IPaddress of the socks server through which this proxy server will bepassing requests. When you specify a socks server on this form, you indicate thatyou want this proxy server to be chained to a socks server. Click Apply. Once the changes take effect, your server runs as a proxy. To socksify the proxy, you also need toset the SOCKS_NS environment variable for the user Step 2. Configure basic caching functions Perform this step if you wantto make your proxy server a caching proxy server. From the Configuration and Administration forms page,click Caching Settings. From the Caching Settings form,check the Enable proxy caching box. If you have more than 5 megabytes ofdisk space to use for caching files,change the Cache size field to a larger number. In the Root directory for cached files field, enter theabsolute path name of the directory where you want to keep cached files.Make sure the directory you specify has at leastas much disk space availableas you enter for Cache size. In the File name in which to log cache access field,enter the absolute path and file name of the file you wantto use for logging cache access. For the upper size limits for files to be cached, the value youspecify indicates that any file bigger than that value is not cached. Specify a size for the lower file limit.This limit indicates the minimum file size a file has to be beforefile size is taken into account when doing garbage collection.The more the size of the file is above this limit, the more likely it isto be removed during garbage collection. Click Apply. Restart your server so your changes will take effect.See "Starting and stopping your server" for more information on starting and restarting. Step 3. Designate a port number for your proxy server Perform this step only if you want your proxy server to listento a port number other than the HTTP default of 80. From the Configuration and Administration forms page,click Basic. Change the Default port number fieldto the port you want the proxy to listen to.The default value for this field is 80.Some other commonly used port numbersfor proxy servers are 8080 and 8008. Click Apply. Restart your server so your changes will take effect.See "Starting and stopping your server" for more information on starting and restarting. Step 4. Configure advanced proxy functions You can specify that certain protocol requests are routed to anotherproxy server.This allows you to chain together a hierarchy of proxy servers. From the Configuration and Administration forms page, clickProxy Chaining and Non-Proxy Domains. In the Proxy chaining section, select the Insert beforebutton. From the selection list, select the protocol you are specifying aURL for. In the URL field, type the URL where you want requests for thatprotocol to be directed. Click Apply. If you've set up a hierarchy of proxies, you canspecify any domain names the proxy can get todirectly rather than going to the next proxy in the hierarchy.These are called non-proxy domains. From the Configuration and Administration forms page, clickProxy Chaining and Non-Proxy Domains. In the Non-proxy domains section in the non-proxy domains field,type the name of the domain or domains to which requests should bepassed without going through the next proxy in the hierarchy. Click Apply. Step 5. Configure advanced caching functions Several other functions are available to help you control the cachingfunctions.You can control: How long HTTP and FTP files are cached How often the cache is cleaned How expired files are removed from the cache Which files you want your server to cache Controlling how long HTTP files are cached To control how long HTTP or HTTPS files are kept in the cacheafter they are last used, do the following: From the Configuration and Administration forms page, clickTime Limit for Unused Cached HTTP Files. Specify the amount of time in months, days, weeks, or hours thatyou want the server to keep unused cached HTTP files. Specify the amount of time in months, days, weeks, or hours thatyou want the server to keep unused cached HTTPS (SSL) files. Click Apply. Controlling how often the cache is cleaned To control how long FTP files are kept in the cache and how long tokeep unused FTP files in the cache, do the following: From the Configuration and Administration forms page, clickExpiration Settings for Cached FTP Files. For the default expiration time, specify the amount of time(in months, days, weeks, or hours) tokeep FTP files in the cache, regardless of whether they are used. For the unused expiration time, specify the amount of time(in months, days, weeks, or hours) tokeep unused FTP files in the cache.In general, unused expiration time should be lower thandefault expiration time. Click Apply. Controlling how expired files are removed from the cache To specify how you want expired files removed from the cache,do the following: From the Configuration and Administration forms page, clickCache Storage Reuse. The box to enable storage reclamation is checked.Delete the check, if you do not want to enable garbage collection. Specify the maximum memory (in kilobytes)available for garbage collection.The process works best if it can read all cache informationinto memory at one time.The amount of memory needed will vary based on dynamic changes suchas the directory structure of cached files.If garbage collection fails because there is not enough memoryon your system, set this field to a smaller value.If you have plenty of memory to spare, you may want to set this valueabove the default of 500. Specify the time you want garbage collection to occur.Select a time when the server won't be busy. Garbage collectionconsumes system resources, and the cache is disabled whengarbage collection is being done. Click Apply. Controlling which files you want your server to cache To specify which files you want your server to consider forcaching,you can create a list of URLs you do want to cache ora list of URLs you do want not to cache.If you do not create either of these lists,any file is a candidate for caching.The server considersfiles for caching if the request is a GET, the URL does notcontain a question mark (?), and the requested file is notprotected by a user ID/password. From the Configuration and Administration forms page, clickCaching Filters. Click Add. Click either Cache the URL requests listed below orDo not cache the URL requests listed below. Type in the list of URLs. Click Apply. Step 6. Specify which clients can use the proxy You can use the server's protection function to controlwhich clients can use your server as a proxy. The default configuration file contains commented lines thatyou can use as a basis for controlling access to your proxy.For this reason, it is easier to accomplish this task by editingthe configuration file than by using the Configuration andAdministration forms. Follow these steps to define which clientscan use your server as a proxy: Use the text editor of your choice to open the configuration file. By default, the configuration file is named httpd.cnf andis in the path specified on the SET ETCstatement in your CONFIG.SYS file. Find the following commented Protection and Protect directives: # Protection PROXY-PROT {#       ServerId        YourProxyName#       Mask            @(*.ibm.com, 128.141.*.*, *.ncsa.uiuc.edu)# }# Protect  http:*    PROXY-PROT# Protect  ftp:*     PROXY-PROT# Protect  gopher:*  PROXY-PROT# Protect  https:*   PROXY-PROT# Protect  wais:*    PROXY-PROT# Protect  news:*    PROXY-PROT The Protect statement for https is in the configurationfile. Remove the comment character (#) from each of the lines. Change the Mask subdirective so that it contains templatesfor the host names or IP addresses of the clientsthat need to use your server as a proxy. In order to use host name templates,you must set the DNS-Lookup directive to On.If the DNS-Lookup directive is set to Off (the default),you can use IP address templates only.See "DNS-Lookup - Specify whether you want to look up host names of clients". The Internet Connection Secure Server distinguishes between a user ID and passwordused for authentication at the proxy server and those usedfor authentication at the end-point server. When a user ID is specified in the protection mask for a proxy request,the proxy server requires the browser to send a PROXY-AUTHENTICATEheader.If the header is missing or incorrect, the proxy serversends a message (HTTP 407 error status) back to the browserstating that proxy authentication is required. If request authentication is required at the end-point server,that server sends back a message (HTTP 401 error status) statingthat authentication is required.The end-point server's errormessage is returned to the browser by the proxy server.A WWW-AUTHENTICATE header sent by the browser is forwarded by theproxy server to the end-point server. PROXY-AUTHENTICATE headers are never forwarded by a proxy server;this ensures that validated proxy user IDs and passwords are notsent to servers that they are not intended for. Note: Web browsers must also support proxy authentication if yourequire user ID authentication in your proxy protection setup mask. Save the configuration file with the changes you make. Restart the server. The server will now act as a proxy only for clients and requeststhat meet the specifications on the mask subdirectives. Step 7. Set up a secure connection If you are using SSL, the kind of connection between the clientand the proxy and between the proxy and the destination servercan vary depending on whether the client uses SSL tunneling. Connections with SSL tunneling Some clients, such as Netscape Navigator,use SSL tunneling to establisha secure connection to a destination serverthrough a proxy.The proxy can be a base or secure server. Because SSL tunneling is generic, it can beused to access resources on different ports.For example, the Internet Connection Secure Server uses port 443 for httpsrequests and Netscape uses port 563 for SNEWS (Secure News). To set up a proxy for SSL tunneling: Enable the CONNECT method.You can use the Method Enablementform or code the following directive in the proxy's configurationfile: Enable CONNECT Specify a Pass rule for each port connected toa destination server.You can use the Request Routing form or code the followingin the proxy's configuration file. Examples: For https requests, specify Pass *:443 For SNEWS (Secure News), specify Pass *:563 Have clients set their security proxy in Netscape Navigatorto point to port 80. Connections without SSL tunneling Secure WebExplorer does not use SSL tunneling.You need Pass directives definedfor https and http requests. Here's how the connection from a Secure WebExplorer clientto a destination server through a proxy is handled: The kind of connection between the client and the proxy is governedby the proxy protocol.If the proxy protocol is https, thenthe connection between the client and the proxy will be secure.If the proxy protocol is http, thenthe connection between the client and the proxy will not be secure. The kind of connection from the proxy to the server is governedby what is specified in the URL.If the URL specifies https, theconnection between the proxy and the server will be secure.If the URL specifies http, the connectionbetween the proxy andthe server will not be secure. The lock will be displayed on Secure WebExplorer if the URL specifieshttps.This means, at minimum, there is a secure network connection between theproxy and the server.There will also be a secure network connection between the client and theproxy if the proxy protocol is https. The server's certificate will not be displayed on Secure WebExplorer if theURL specifies https. Running your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts You may want to use one server to provide Web sites for multiplecustomers. For example, you might havetwo customers (customerA and customerB), both of whom want to makeinformation about their companies available on the World Wide Web.You might want to put both Web sites on the same machineif the expected number of requests for the informationis not great enough to justify a separate machinefor each customer. With the Internet Connection Secure Server, you can use multiple IP addresses, virtualhosts, or both to provide multiple Web sites on one server. Multiple IP addresses To use multiple IP addresses,your server must be installed on a machinewith multiple network connections. If you have only one network connection andrun two instances of the server on the same machine, then onlyone server has the benefit of using the default port number.Requests to the other server would have to include a port number. If your machine has two network connections,you can run just one instance of the server andassign each customer to a different IP address.For each IP address you would define a different host name.So customerA could be www.customerA.com on IP address 9.67.106.79 andcustomerB could be www.customerB.org on IP address 9.83.100.45.You could then configure the server to serve a different setof information depending on the IP address the request comes in on.Because the server can accept requests from the default port ofeach network connection, requests to either host name would not requirea port number. Virtual hosts With virtual hosts, no additional hardware is required, and you cansave IP addresses.However, clients must support HTTP 1.1 or HTTP 1.0 with1.1 Extensions. With virtual hosts, you can run just one instance of the server andassign each customer to a different host.In the domain name server, you define your hosts and associatethem with the IP address of your server.You can then configure the server to serve a different setof information depending on the host for which the request is made.Requests do not require a port number. Setting up your server to use multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts Setting up your server to use multiple IP addresses or virtual hostsis very similar.For multiple IP addresses, you'll need to specify the IP addressa request comes in on and for virtual hosts, you'll need to specifythe host name for which a request is made. You configure the server to serve different information foreach customer by indicating that certain parts of your configurationapply only to requests coming in on certain addresses or forcertain hosts.You can configure three key parts of your serverso that requests are processed differentlybased on the IP address they come in on or the host name in the URL. Welcome pages Mapping rules Access control Welcome pages You can specify a different set of file names to use as welcomepages depending on the address a request comes in on or the host namein the URL.The file names you define as welcome pages determinehow the server responds to requests that do notcontain a file name. For example, you might want to specify that homeA.htmlis a welcome page only for requests received on 9.67.106.79 orfor hostA,and homeB.html is a welcome page only for requests received onan address 9.83.100.45 or for hostB. From the Configuration and Administration forms page,you can configure your list of welcome pagesby clicking on Initial Page.From the Initial Page form, click the help icon for informationon defining welcome pages and how to associate awelcome page file name with an IP address or a host name. Alternatively, if you are editing the configuration file,you can add an IP-address or hostnameat the end of a Welcome directive to associate awelcome page file name with an IP address or a host name.For details, see the description of the Welcome directivein "Directories and Welcome Page - Set viewing options". Mapping rules You can specify a different set of mapping rules for theserver to use depending on the address a request comes in on orthe host name in a URL.Mapping rules map a request to a physical file on the serverand determine whether the server processes a request. For example, you might want to specify that arequest beginning /cgi-bin/ received on address9.67.106.79 or for hostA is mapped to the /customerA/cgi/ directory,and the same request received on 9.83.100.45 or for hostBis mapped to the /customerB/cgi/ directory. From the Configuration and Administration forms page,you can configure your mapping rulesby clicking on Request Routing.From the Request Routing form, click the help icon for informationon how to use mapping rules and how to associate amapping rule with an IP address or a host name. Alternatively, if you are editing the configuration file,you can add an IP-address or hostnameat the end of Exec, Fail, Map, Pass, and Redirectdirectives to associate the directivewith an IP address or a host name.For details, see the description of these directivesin "Resource mapping - Redirect URLs". Access Control You can activate different protection rulesfor a request based on the address the request comes in on or thehost name in a URL.Protection rules are defined in protection setups anddetermine how your server controls access tofiles and programs. For example, you might want to specify that arequest beginning /cgi-bin/ received on address9.67.106.79 or for hostA is protected by the rules in aprotection setup named PROT-A and thesame request received on 9.83.100.45 or for hostBis protected by the rules in a protection setup named PROT-B. From the Configuration and Administration forms page,you can configure how protection is activatedby clicking on Document Protection.From the Document Protection form, click the help iconfor information on protecting documents and how to associateprotection with an IP address or a host name. Alternatively, if you are editing the configuration file,you can add an IP-address or hostnameat the end of DefProt and Protect directives to associatethe directive with an IP address or a host name.For details, see the description of these directivesin "Access control - Set up access control for the server". Backing up files It is recommended that you periodically back up the following files: Configuration files (httpd.conf, ics_pics.conf) Password files Group files ACL files Content files For a secure server, you should also back up: Key ring files Signed certificates and, optionally, certificate requests [ Top of Page | Previous Page | Next Page | Table of Contents ]
