AhmadSHL Consolidated Bhd has allocated RM60 million for the expansion of itsbrick and quarry operations in its scheme to develop them as coreactivities in future.  Executive director, Mr Yap Teiong Choon told reporters yesterday afterSHL's annual general meeting that from the RM60 million, RM40 million willbe invested for the construction of a third fully automated brick plant inSepang while RM10 million will used for the upgrading of its first brickplant.  "The remaining RM10 million is set aside for the expansion of a thirdquarry plant which will increase the present annual production capacity of3 million tonnes by another 1.5 million tonnes giving a total annualproduction capacity of 4.5 million tonnes," Yap said.  The third plant, which is expected to be installed by 1998, will add-onanother annual production capacity of 100 million pieces of bricks to itscurrent annual capacity of 200 million pieces of bricks.  The new plant is expected to start construction in the third quarter ofnext year.  The upgrading of the first plant involves the construction of a newtunnel kiln and extension of a new factory space together with furtheradd-on of new equipment.  Yap said the expansion will see it to be the largest manufacturer ofbricks in Malaysia and a major player in the quarry business which willhelp improve future profits.  "From our experience in the quarry business, we foresee the new quarryplant will generate about RM10 million annual profits," Yap said.  Meanwhile, Yap said that SHL is in the process of negotiating a numberof big projects but declined to disclose the amount and when the projectsare expected to be finalised.

This is as it should be because of the danger of small capitalisedstocks being manipulated by syndicates which if left unchecked, would leadto a sudden plunge in prices - and volume - and those who would suffermost would be most likely the individual retail players.  Of course, not all individuals who buy second board stocks lose moneybecause if they had bought the stocks sometime ago when prices were lower,they would still stand to gain if prices drop sharply.  A retail player who bought his shares in a second board company when theSecond Board Index was at the 300 or 400 point level.  However, given the small number of shares floating around among thesmall capitalised stocks on the second board, it would not have taken muchbuying power for prices to jump up over the last few weeks.  What this means is that if many players had been chasing stocks on theway up, many of them would have bought them at the higher end of the pricerange.  Those who play second board stocks would have realised by now that if aperson buys second board stock to keep it and then wait for something tohappen which would push up the price, he may have to wait for quitesometime. Maybe even a long time because there are some second boardstocks which are thinly traded and their prices barely move.  Therefore, the person who buys a second board stock may see his moneytied in the market for an uncomfortably long time because it is not easyto sell his stock if he needs money urgently.  In short, the lack of liquidity among the small second board stocks is adrawback for those may want to buy stocks when the market is "quiet." Itmay be so quiet that he will not be able to find a buyer for his stock ata reasonable price.  The net effect of this lack of liquidity among second board stocks isthat  many punters prefer to indulge in buying and selling of second boardstocks when there is already a build-up in the volume so that there issufficient liquidity for him to get in fast and get out even faster whenthere is a need to do so.  Unfortunately, given the small capitalisation, by the time there is asurge in the trading volume of second board stocks - and thus in theirliquidity - their prices would have shot up to quite a high level.  The upshot of this is that it is at this time when many punters jumpinto the second board stocks, thus ending up buying the stocks atdangerously high prices. However, after a sharp pullback, second boardstocks need not necessarily continue to slide.  Like all cycles, second board stocks have their ups and downs, and theycan come back again - the only question is when they will make a comeback.Many punters will, of course, hope that they do not have to wait too longfor their comeback.

Orders have been increasing, includingthose requiring production to commence only in 1997," DVB managingdirector Tee Boon Kee said in an interview.  He said although the group presently commits a significant part of itsproduction facilities to Proton, there exists a ready OEM market which isconstantly requesting the group to increase its current supplies ofautomotive parts and accessories.

Copyright 1996 The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) BerhadBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (MALAYSIA) via NewsNetSeptember 30, 1996Notebook: An investor modest enough to admit making mistakesfrom BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,     30 Sep 1996, page 5By Yee LiamTHERE is this seasoned investor who told his friends that he had beenbuying and selling stocks for over 30 years, experienced five major marketdeclines and yet he still makes the same mistakes.  The only investor who does not make any mistake is a dead one and evenif he were to somehow return from the dead to invest in stocks, he islikely to commit the same mistakes as before.  The seasoned investor is modest enough to admit that he continues makingmistakes but as he is still rich and continues to speculate, he must bemaking fewer of the same mistakes over the years. Otherwise, he isunlikely to be rich today because if he had continued making the samenumber of mistakes as he did in the early years of speculation in stocks,chances are he would have lost most of his money by now.  If he had gone through five major market downturns, it is logical thathe would have survived each of the downturns and participated in thesubsequent market rallies.  He may have lost money because of the mistakes he made in each of theboom and bust market cycles but as he is still wealthy today, his personalscoreboard suggests that his right decisions outweigh his wrong decisionsin the stock market. The net effect of his decisions is that his profitsover the years have more than offset the losses incurred.  Only an ignorant investor will strive for a perfect score and hope tosee profits in all his trades and suffer no losses.  The most dangerous experience that a new investor can undergo when hefirst ventures into the market is that of striking it big and making a lotof money in his initial trades. He will think that making money is so easyin the stock market, failing to realise that losing it could be eveneasier if he becomes careless and over-expose himself. A new investor iscommonly in a hurry to make big money and consequently endangers himselfby taking on too much risk.  A wise man knows his own limitations and accepts these limitationsgracefully and this seasoned investor is certainly wise because he readilyadmits to his friends his limitations as an investor - one of which isthat he continues to make mistakes in stocks.  He will still be making mistakes because he is only human and there isno way he can avoid them completely as long as he is subject to the sameemotions and impulses which all human beings have.  The only difference is that a successful investor makes fewer mistakesthan a less successful one, but they are likely to continue to makemistakes.  An experienced investor is likely to make fewer mistakes than the newerone because he would have learnt from his past mistakes and make repeatedattempts to avoid them.  Still, despite being more alert in avoiding mistakes, the experiencedinvestor will occasionally make some mistakes but he would have takenprecaution to make sure than he is not fatally injured financially andthat he will recover to fight another day in the market.  After so many years of involvement in stocks, he will be realisticenough to accept the fact that mistakes are unavoidable in stocks.  More often than not, it is the new and inexperienced investor who goesaround with the notion that they must not make mistakes if they are to besuccessful in stocks. He feels that many of those who came before him lostmoney or if they did make money, they should be making more money, becausethey made mistakes in their trading.  As far as this new punter is concerned, he is out to "prove" that hewill be better than many of them because he will not make the samemistakes committed by many others before him.  He may not have realised it at this early stage but he had just made hisfirst mistake by carrying in his head the erroneous idea that he will notmake mistakes in the market. Over time he will realise how wrong he was.  Ironically, by accepting the simple fact that making mistakes is partand parcel of the whole business of speculation, the punter is betterprepared mentally to avoid the mistakes that come in our way.  The reason is simple. If a speculator buys a stock because he feels thatthe price will double in two months' time, he will not hesitate to get ridof it if it does not perform to his expectations after one month. Forinstance, if the price falls sharply instead of rising, he may quickly re-examine the stock and come round to the conclusion that he had beenmistaken about the stock. He accepts that he can make mistakes and beforeany further damage is done, he may decide to cut loss and clear out of thestock.  A punter who carries the notion that he will not make mistakes may notbe psychologically prepared to accept mistakes even if he is uncertain ofa stock anymore.  Instead of acting fast and cutting losses if a trade has gone wrong andhe had obviously made a mistake, he may just refuse to budge and continuehoping that things will get better.  He has already made up his mind that mistakes will cause him to losemoney and as he does not want to lose money, he will not make mistakes andby refusing to sell to cut losses, he can continue with the fiction thathe has not made a mistake. It tends to become a vicious cycle and it canbe costly to the punter when the vicious cycle is finally broken by himselling out to cut his losses.  There is this thing about realising one's losses and if a punter has toultimately realise his loss, it is better than he realise it sooner ratherthan later because that way, he minimises his loss. Inaction and refusalto accept reality can be enemies of the successful punter.  If the punter cannot avoiding mistakes because stocks can be so volatileand unpredictable, then he can at least minimise the damage that can becaused when he makes the inevitable mistakes.

"We are paying the compensation on behalf of the Royal Government ofCambodia, eventhough land is a state matter," Mr Tan Teng Chye, Ariston'sproject director, said in Sihanoukville.  Ariston, which was awarded the US$1.3 billion Sihanoukville developmentproject, was accused of dragging its feet in starting work on the project,by several quarters, including Cambodian First Prime Minister PrinceNorodom Ranariddh.  The Malaysian company explained that it was unable to begin renovationwork at the Sihanoukville International Airport - the first phase of theproject - as it was unable to obtain vacant possesion of the land.  The amount that was paid to the various families is said to varyaccording to the size of land each family lived or worked on.  According to Tan, Ariston was advised on the amounts to be paid to thevillagers by a special task force within the Sihanoukville DevelopmentAuthority that was set up to determine the figure.  According to the villagers and some of the provincial officials, thecheques reportedly ranged from US$25 to more than US$3,000.  However, Tan said Ariston has still not obtained vacant posession of theland as the villagers are still on the land. "They should move off soonand then we should be able to get things going," he told Business Times ina telephone interview.  Ariston has begun work on Naga Island, however, where an internationalstandard casino resort and hotel will be built.  The deputy governor, Kim Bo, who witnessed the handing over ceremony,said the villagers had arrived at a mutual understanding with the RoyalGovernment and were happy to accept the compensation.  "I am aware that my land is located on a development site and I am happywith the compensation," a villager was quoted as saying in a localnewspaper.  He admitted that he was among those who had taken up weapons anddemonstrated at the airport site in May this year.  "I thought that my land was being invaded by Ariston at the time and soI took an axe to fight against them. But now I find they are honourableand I am very happy with the compensation," he said.  Neither Tan nor Cambodian officials would specify the amount of cashthat had been paid for each plot of land.  However, Cambodian officials say the agreed compensation that was paidby Ariston amounted to some US$1,500 for each hectare of land, thoughother sources say US$1,700 was paid per hectare of land.  Meanwhile, Ariston signed three agreements in mid-September with theRoyal Goverment that will expedite work on the Sihanoukville project.  The first agreement was for the lease of land on Naga Island for a 70-year period. Naga will be the site of an international standard hotelresort and casino.  The second was a land lease agreement for O Cheou Teal, involving thedevelopment of an 18-hole international golf course and internationalhotel.  The third agreement was a 25-year build, operate and transfer (BOT)concession agreement for the Sihanoukville International Airport.

This friend happens tobe one of the key executives of a big and still expanding outfit listed onthe stock exchange with operations so diverse from the original core thatit is difficult to keep track. One day this chief executive thought, whynot look up this old friend and since his background is research, hethought it might be a good idea to know what is happening with thecompany. Instead, he was surprised to be greeted with a barrage ofquestions, cynical enough to question his motive of seeking anappointment. He said to himself that he is not going to ever call this oldfriend for an appointment again. He felt if it has been any of the foreignanalysts such as Merril Lynch, Solomon or BZW, in no time will they begranted an appointment. He is wondering what is happening to ourexecutives? Don't they realise that by being reluctant to meet localanalysts they are placing the local analyst in a more disadvantagedposition than the foreign ones?  Not too long ago the Research Institute of Investment Analyst Malaysia(RIIAM) conducted `Meet the Analysts' sessions for listed companies.Although we had some response from some listed companies, but overall itwas difficult to get anybody to face the local analysts. In the end thesessions were stopped for lack of response. At the same time we read aboutcompanies with their entourage going overseas to meet the foreign analystsor accommodating requests of foreign analysts. Maybe local analysts do notrepresent billions or trillions of dollars foreign ones do, but disclosureof information to our local investors will certainly help improve thecurrent situation of believing in rumours, so typical of the Malaysianmarket. Take the second board companies for example, the whole euphoriahas the semblance of the 1993 bull run and prices are really getting todizzy heights. The amount of rumour being generated is unbelievable somuch so those so familiar with the characteristics of our investors needonly to generate some ridiculous rumour to get their support.  This year the focus has certainly been on the second board but thegullibility of the investors have certainly not been confined to just thesecond board companies. The dialogue with local analysts was intended tohelp enhance the transparency of companies. With the rapid pace ofeconomic growth it is not strange to find the rapid change in a company'ssituation. The number of companies listed too increase rapidly and onehardly has time to differentiate the numerous acronyms companies assume.If companies are reluctant to entertain requests made by local individualanalysts, then the dialogue with a number of analysts might save a lot oftime and be more beneficial for the local investors. One cannot reallypass a law to stop rumour mongering. Neither can one pass a law to believein a rumour. If a rumour is being worked upon very hard by certainindividual to make it look like it is not a rumour (the prices actually goup as claimed), it is even more difficult to convince the public not tobelieve in rumours. So much has been said about the importance of relyingon fundamentals but this year anyone can throw fundamentals away byshowing the increase in the prices of second board companies.  So much has been said of the importance of not relying on rumours aboutthe importance of investing in fundamentals but this year what seems todrive the market is the same thing that drove the market in 93 and 94. Thevolume of trade may be inflated by those who trade intraday, purely onspeculation. Do we limit the increase narrower? Do we limit the increaseon the first day of listing? Do we restrict the availability ofspeculative trading? Do we restrict the flow of funds to the stockbrokingcompanies so that they cannot grant too many facilities to their clients?Or do we shorten the settlement period so that there is not much room forspeculative activities? These are not easy questions to answer. We need tobalance between maintaining order and the need to allow the market to takeits course. If allowing to take its course means a lot of people are goingto get hurt, does it mean we will still allow it to happen?  In the meantime, companies should come forward to be more transparent intheir activities and not necessarily wait for queries should there be anyirregularity. Periodic meetings with analysts will certainly enhanceinvestors' understanding of the corporate sector. Provided of course theanalysts do not keep the information to themselves.

This is because the role, contribution and viability ofSirim will not be measured by its revenue-earning capacity.  Sirim Bhd president and chief executive Dr Mohamed Ariffin Aton said itscorporatisation will allow a more flexible management system for it toprovide fast, efficient, cost-effective and customer-oriented serviceswith accountability.  "Ultimately, we want to be cost effective and broaden our customer baseand train our people to make decisions at their level. This will certainlyspeed things up but quality is maintained as they know their job well.  "At the same time, everyone learns about responsibility and will be heldaccountable for making that decision," he told Business Times in ShahAlam.  Ariffin was the managing director of Petronas Research Sdn Bhd before hewas appointed to head Sirim Bhd, taking over from Datuk Dr Ahmad TajuddinAli who became the executive chairman of Tenaga Nasional Bhd,  For Sirim to achieve quality and speed, Ariffin is embarking on an"inside out" quality services strategy to meet its vision.  He believes that quality, when planted internally, will progressnaturally outwards.  "In our day-to-day work, for example, the finance department which holdsthe traditionally role of scrutinising every claim will have to think ofits colleagues as clients.  "Some think this will encourage forgery but the claimants have aresponsibility and are accountable for their claims.  "In this way, there will be continuous improvement and value creationfor the company to move faster. Ultimately, Sirim is the people," Ariffinsaid.  Sirim's vision, he said, is to be a renowned institution in three of itscore businesses: research, technology development, and standardisation.  His said his task is to strenghten the competency base and put in placethe research and development (R and D) strategy.  Sirim's technology competencies include industrial instrumentation andelectronics, industrial automation, automotive, measurements andartificial intelligence systems.  Ariffin said R and D does not necessarily get one's hands dirty. "Thereis also a management side to it which I am dealing with."  He feels that R and D is a continuing process of investment and regardsresearchers as "a special breed of people who are very independent".  "It is an intellectually challenging experience to be in the group," hesaid.  Ariffin, who considers working as his pastime and thinking of solutionsas his hobby, feels that the biggest challenge in managing researchers isto change their perception of research work as a service.  "Research is not a hobby, especially when there is a sponsor, andresearchers must try to provide the quality work in as short a time aspossible within a limited budget," he said.  On human resource management, Ariffin said he is not worried thatSirim's staff will be pinched. "All good companies will have staffmovement. Those who move away from Sirim are not totally lost as they willbe contributing to the country in other ways."

In his latest annual statement, the chairman says the group will"entrench our strategy on our financial and property/infrastructureservices expertise to create synergies these two core business areas andat the same time, seek to develop our interests in other sectors such asindustrial services".  Reviewing the group's performance, Azman says the group's core businessareas continued to record impressive growth.  Amcorp's activities in property development have been given a boost whenit acquired about 82.96ha of land for the development of 311 bungalow lotsunder the exclusive Kayang Heights development project, which is next tothe Bukit Cerakah Forest Reserve in Shah Alam.  Amcorp has also successfully concluded conditional mandatory generaloffers for shares in two companies. The first being the shares inMelawangi Sdn Bhd, developer of the prestigious Amcorp Trade Centre inPetaling Jaya, which is now 100 per cent-owned by Amcorp.  The other is South Peninsular Industries Bhd, a manufacturing companylisted on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) second board, which ispresently a 51 per cent-owned subsidiary of the group.  Azman says growth within AMMB Holdings Bhd, which led the financialservices sector of the group, continued to be significant. Among thedevelopments is the commencement of offshore banking operation in Labuan.  Elsewhere, Arab-Malaysian Securities Holding Sdn Bhd expanded itsoperations to Indonesia when it acquired a 60 per cent stake in Jakarta-based stockbroking firm, now renamed PT Arab-Malaysian Capital Indonesia.The group, through a subsidiary company, has also acquired a seat on TheStock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd.  Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank, which obtained Tier-1 status and theapproval from Bank Negara to open four more branches, has entered into anasset management joint-venture agreement with Macquarie Bank Ltd ofAustralia.  Closer to home, AMMB Futures Sdn Bhd began operations trading in futurescontracts on the Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange andthe Malaysia Monetary Exchange. Meanwhile, Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd andArab-Malaysian Bank Bhd has also received approvals from the Central Bankto open nine and eight new branches respectively.  Azman says the growth prospect of the Malaysian economy is expected tocreate increased loan demand which will provide lending opportunities forthe AMMB Holdings group. Likewise, activities in the capital markets willremain robust, in line with Government's objective of promoting KualaLumpur as a regional financial hub.  "Thus, the group is poised to harness further opportunities arising inthe forthcoming year," says the chairman.  Other significant events include the listing of Powertek Bhd, in whichArab-Malaysian Development Bhd has a 30 per cent stake, on the main boardof the KLSE. Azman says this is notable as it is the first independentpower producer and first new infrastructure project company to be listed.  For the year ended March 31 1996, the Amcorp group registered a profitbefore tax of RM321.9 million, which shows a growth of 38.6 per cent.Profits from Amcorp's own activities, comprising financial services andproperty construction and development, surged by 79.3 per cent to RM87.7million.

Construction for the RM100 million integrated waterfront property is setfor December this year. The project will be developed by Harvest RimbaSdn Bhd, a subsidiary of public listed Harvest Court Industries Bhd.  The development, which is projected to be completed by 1999 is situatedclose to Port Dickson and the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport inSepang.  "We are very pleased and excited to be developing this project inMalacca given the state's historical ties with the sea. With thedevelopment of Marina Cove, we hope to generate local interest in yatchingand other related activities," director of Harvest Rimba Sdn Bhd, EncikAbdul Halim Yunus said.  "The main attractions of the cove lie in its low resident per acredensity, exclusive home designs and its own private marina berthingfacilities," he said, in a statement.  "These factors, together with pleasant surroundings and world-classmarina facilities make it a high value investment."  Marina Cove waterfront project, which was launched a few days ago by theChief Minister of Malacca Datuk Seri Haji Mohd Zin Abdul Ghani, willcomprise of bungalows, townhouses, apartments, shops, hotel apartments, aclubhouse with marine facilities and a broadwalk.  "Marina Cove will have the lowest resident density per acre in thewaterfront marina development segment. We will be developing only 12 unitsper acre  compared to the industry average of 40 units per acre," saidAbdul Halim.  "Because we want own ers and residents to enjoy the privacy and serenityfor their surroundings, we will be developing only 19.25 acres of thealloted 35 acres of coastal land. The remaining acre is devoted to openspaces and water ways," he said.  On the developed area, a Marina Arcade comprising of 10 shoplots and a16-storey Waterfront Apartel consisting of a 150 unit apartment hotel willbe built.  On the residential side, Cove Apartments-made up of five differentblocks of either four or five storeys and only 176 apartments, will bebuilt. The company also plans to offer 80 units  of terraced townhouseswith private berthing facilities as part of its Waterfront Quay Terrace.  "In other waterfront projects in Malaysia, private berthing facilitiesare available only to bungalow owners. Marina Cove has extended thisexclusive facility to our terrace house owners because we want as manyresidents as possible to enjoy the pleasure of yachting and boating," headded.  Some 20 bungalow lots are expected to be available to owners ofWaterfront Villas.

Copyright 1996 The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) BerhadBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (MALAYSIA) via NewsNetSeptember 30, 1996Malaysia an atrractive choice: Economistfrom BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,     30 Sep 1996, page 1By Meera T'RatnamWITH the outlook for both the Malaysian stock market and economy set toimprove considerably by year-end, Malaysia will be an attractive choicefor the astute investors wishing to bank in Asia, Jardine Fleming Pte'sSingapore-based economist Rajeev Malik says.  Not only have fears of a fast-paced economy been allayed but purereconomic and political fundamentals, coupled with Malaysia's ease incoping with this year's global electronics slowdown, are just some reasonswhy Malaysia may win hands down in garnering economists' approval.  "Until a few months ago investors were worried that Malaysian economywas growing too rapidly. The economy was like a Kancil bounding with ahigh centre of gravity," he said. "It raised fears it would topple cominground the corner."  "But it's made a very skillful turn, so much so the concern now in somequarters is that softer external demand will cause a sharper-than-expectedslowdown," he said.  In an interview with Business Times, Malik said some downward revisionof the government's own estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) growth -previously set at 8.5 per cent - should be expected with the budget. Thebudget is set to be tabled on October 25.  Expectations of a sharp slowdown in GDP are quite unwarranted though, hesays. While the economy is moderating, its overall strength remainsrobust. Malaysia's second quarter performance of 8.4 per cent was muchbetter than Singapore where half-year growth came in at a lower-than-expected 7 per cent.  Despite estimates that up to half of Malaysia's total exports are tiedup in electronics, the slowdown in electronics has hurt Malaysia far lessthan other Asian tigers. The absence of lumpy imports has also contributedto this year's trend of sharply falling trade figures, with exportsoutpacing imports.  "Malaysia's current account deficit for 1996 is already set to be muchlower than Thailand," he said. "Neither does it have to contend with ahotbed of political and economic woes like Indonesia and Thailand."  Malik expects real domestic demand to ease from 14.6 per cent to 10.1per cent in 1996. He credits the central bank for steering the economywithout resorting to severe credit controls. Last year's budget broughttighter controls on credit card users, higher taxes on real property gainsand foreign purchases of real estate, higher taxes on luxury cars and lessfinancing for car purchases.  The central bank followed up with initiatives to free up interest ratesby introducing a new framework for calculating base lending rates; raisingthe statutory reserves requirement twice; and, a healthy dose of moralsuasion.  It may have taken some time for the slowdown to register but loan growthhas clearly eased. Though partly driven by a decline in lending to broadproperty and consumption, Malik says it's happening across the board. "Arecent pick-up in property lending growth in no way bucks this trend," headds.  On the longer-term horizon, Malik dispelled the need to agonise over theloss of competitiveness issue hounding the coverage of Asian economieslately. "Sure, the convergence theory that Asia is cheap is no more. Butit does not mean because costs are rising, foreign investors are shiftingtheir investments and moving out."  On trend in Malaysia, a greater proportion of new investment inmanufacturing goes towards expanding existing operations, instead ofsetting up new ventures but as Malik sees it, "It's part of a gradualprocess that has to take place for Malaysia to become the capital ofvalue-added manufacturing operations".                               Copyright 1996 The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) BerhadBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (MALAYSIA) via NewsNetSeptember 30, 1996"Shorties" to debut on KLSE todayfrom BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,     30 Sep 1996, page 1By Jennifer JacobsTODAY, for the first time, the Malaysian stock market opens itself to"shorties", the colloquialism for those who carry out short-selling, thatis "... selling shares one does not own in anticipation of buying themback later at a lower price and profiting from the difference in price."  Many foreign players, as well as professional traders, have longcommented that opening the market to short-selling is a crucial step inthe development of the Malaysian capital market as it will facilitatehedging and arbitrage activities which are essential for the introductionof stock options trading.  What this roughly means is that one can either buy equities and short-sell futures, thereby covering one's back if the market turns eitherbullish or bearish or short-sell equities and buy futures contracts.  With the introduction of short-selling, investors can also profit in abearish market.  Short-selling is expected to increase the liquidity of the marketespecially for the securities in the approved list. The list of 50counters, released on Friday evening, came as a surprise to many who hadonly expected some 20 to 30 counters initially to be on it.  As at the end of last year, only 28 counters had met the relevantcriteria for short-selling, namely, an average daily market capitalisationof RM2 billion for the past three months; at least 100 million shares inpublic float; at least 2,000 registered shareholders; five years ofuninterrupted profit track record; and, an average monthly share volume ofmore than 2 million for the past 12 months.  These criteria had been drawn up to ensure that short-selling is notallowed across the board but limited only to the "bluest of blue-chips".  Of course, the Securities Commission, in approving the rules drawn up bythe Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), had added that the exchange hasthe discretion to expand and change the list of approved securities as andwhen deemed necessary.  The exchange must have deemed it necessary right away because the listincluded companies that are hardly blue, maybe a pale azure.  The question, of course, is whether in "shorting the shares" investorscan actually manipulate the prices and push them down unnaturally, as itis one thing to bet on the shares going down and another altogether inforcing the counter down.  The exchange, with this concern in mind, has introduced prescribedlimits to bring about an idealised form of short-selling.  KLSE senior manager for marketing development S. Loganathan said theexchange will suspend further short-selling for any period if the positionexceeds the amount that is desirable to public interest or if it isdetrimental to the counter.  Every deal has to be reported to the KLSE at the end of the trading dayso that the exchange can disseminate the positions of the short-sellingdone for the day.  Direct deals are not allowed, meaning no off-market deals between thedealer and the client.  And only stockbroking companies which have in place approved writtenguidelines on "Know Your Customers" practices will be permitted to engagein regulated short-selling.  Investors seeking to engage in regulated short-selling must be fullyaware of the risk and have the financial capacity to meet their financialcommitments. Which basically means as in all other types of trading: "Ifyou can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen."  Professional traders used to the liberality of the more matured marketsmay find these safeguards rather draconian and unnecessary, but theyshould bear in mind the highly speculative image of the KLSE, especiallythe second board, where speculators have had a field day in pushing upstocks as the fancy takes them.  The exchange, which has been trying to fight off this image, would beloath to put yet another toy into the hands of these gamblers.  However, all in all, short-selling is essential for the maturity of thecapital market and regulated short-selling protects the market frompossible foul play, so maybe this will be one market that can have itscake and eat it.

He said while it is common to have differences in opinions betweenmembers, they should try to resolve their problems within the party.  Dr Mahathir said there will be no end to the culture of members seekinglegal action if members persist in doing so.  "Today it will at the party's central committee level, tomorrowdivisional and branches."  For example, he said even if a member succeeds in getting the court todeclare him or her as the party leader, it would not help if the majorityof the members reject his or her leadership.  "There must be some form of compromise within the party.  "If this cannot be achieved, the dispute should then be solved by thepolitical way of who is getting the most support from members," he toldreporters at the Sultan Abdul Aziz International Airport on his returnfrom New York yesterday.  He was asked to comment on the political tussle between Parti Gerakanpresident Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik and Gerakan member and member ofParliament for Batu, Datuk Joseph Chong.  Dr Mahathir said the dispute within Gerakan will not affect the Barisancoalition and expressed confidence that the Gerakan members will be ableto resolve their problem among themselves.  On Umno, Dr Mahathir said the special committee, headed by him, toinvestigate complaints against disciplinary committee members forallegedly breaching the no-campaign ruling is keeping an eye on theconduct of the candidates.  "You will find out in time," he said to a question whether any of thedisciplinary committee member had breached the ruling.  A total of 185 candidates has been declared eligible to contest in theUmno party elections in October.  On allegations that some candidates are using their official functionsas a  "platform to campaign" by opening two or three functions a day, thePrime Minister said the bunching of some of these functions could notavoided.  "But I hope the delegates will be able to judge for themselves themotives of these functions," Dr Mahathir said.

At least six basic materials critical to the industry are likely to beshort in supply before the year 2000.  Clinker, the main component for making cement, is also on this list.Supplies of marble, reinforcement steel, structural steel, and PVC pipesare also not expected to be able to meet the industry's demand. The supplyof sanitary ware and fittings are expected to begin running short by 1999.  Even materials which are expected to be in surplus could experience"localised" shortages.  The study investigated supply and demand trends of 15 building materialssince 1994 and produced a trend forecast up to the year 2000.  Expansion plans, existing production capacities, imports and exportswere also analysed in studying future trends for the building materials.  The study was conducted by Arthur Andersen HRM (Management Services) SdnBhd in association with the Quantity Surveyor Malaysia. It is the firstreport prepared for the Goverment which covers the aspect of basicbuilding materials.  The 15 materials included in the report are cement, carpentry andjoinery timber, aggregates and crusher-run, marble tiles, ceramic tiles,bricks, reinforcement steel, structural steel, sand, roofing materials,uPVC pipes, cast iron pipes, concrete pipes, sanitary wares and fittingsand timber of formwork (plywood and timber remnants).  The construction sector is forecast to grow at an average rate of 7.5per cent a year.  Clinker is likely to be short in supply up to the end of the year. Evenat 90 per cent production capacity, local manufaturers are only expectedto churn out 9.9 million tonnes of clinker this year. Domestic demandhowever is forecast to be 10.7 million tonnes.  Clinker is a major semi-finished product used in the production ofcement. Production of a tonne of cement requires a 0.95 tonne input ofclinker.  Last year, local clinker production was only 7.7 million tonnes whichwas only about 83.7 per cent of the required 9.9 million tonnes, thuscausing a supply deficit of 2.2 million tonnes.  Local cement producers will continue to source clinker from South Korea,Japan, Thailand and Indonesia until the shortage, which has been occuringsince 1991, begin to ease later next year, the report said.  The study forecasts a 1,000 tonne surplus of clinker next year.  The situation will further improve in 1998 with a surplus of 3.2 milliontonnes but dropped to 2.9 million tonnes in 1999 and 2.1 million tonnes inthe year 2000.  The cement industry, as a whole, is involved in a production expansionprogramme from 13 million tonnes in 1995 to 21.87 million tonnes by theyear 2000. The Malaysian Cement Industry's 1995 Report showed that thedemand for cement last year was 12.1 million for Peninsular Malaysia and1.35 million tonnes for Sabah and Sarawak.  In the case of marble wall and floor tiles, the report said that withits current production at 52 per cent capacity, shortages can be expectedright up to the year 2000 and beyond. However, the shortage may be delayedat least until 1999 if production runs at full capacity. The reportsuggested that the authorities look at the possibility of imports to meetthe rising demand.  For reinforcement steel, the report forecast a shortage of 29,000 tonnesnext year which will reach 430,000 tonnes, or more than a quarter of thetotal demand, in 2000.  In the case of structural steel, the shortage since 1994 is expected tolast until the end of the decade despite increases in production capacity.The authorities have been urged to introduce new incentives to attract newinvestments to the sector.  Demand for sanitary ware and fittings grew between 1988 and 1993 butsupply has been able to meet the industry demand. At 85 per centproduction capacity, the industry is expected to face a shortage by theyear 1999.  The uPVC pipes are substitutes for cast iron and concrete pipes and aremainly imported. Since the early 1980s, local production capacity has notbeen able to meet the requirements of the local market. This is notexpected to change during the period under review.  The study also highlighted manpower shortages in the respectiveindustries producing the building materials. Inefficient transportservices, quality of materials, and pricing were also discussed.

The three selected petrol stations, located in the Klang Valley, havebeen positioned with a group of trained experts known as customer serviceassistants to help motorists get comfortable with the idea of servingthemselves.  "We are committed towards addressing the labour issues that are plaguingthe country, especially with the issue of foreign labour at theforecourts," chairman and managing director of Caltex Oil (M) Ltd, Mr.Robert J. Gregory said in Kuala Lumpur.  "As with any change, there is bound to be some apprehension and webelieve the best solution is to help, prepare and educate the public toget used to the various aspects of self-service," he said.  The Meor Hisham station in Ampang began to offer self-service onSeptember 19, followed by F I Star and Kwang Hap Siang.  The company has put in place a programme that incorporates various on-site programmes for motorists. This is to familiarise them with theconcept of self-serve well before the Government mandated date for allpetrol stations to be on self-service by January 1, 1997.  Trained customer service assistants will point out how to use userfriendly electronic facilities and to guide customers on payment methodsaccording to their choice of cash or card.  In addition, Caltex Malaysia will also have an elite squad of trainedpersonnal who will be deployed to these self-serve test stations initiallyand subsequently to the various self-serve test stations in residentialneighbourhoods.  Tagged as the "Self service Support Squad" (SSS Squad), the squad willbe commissioned to provide additional support to customer servicepersonnel at petrol stations and introduce the do-it-yourself conceptwhilst giving hands-on demonstrations on self-serve.  Apart from investing in mobile labour squads, Caltex has also invested atotal of RM9 million on hardware, electronic and retail automation forfacilitating self-serve.  Caltex has also set up a toll-free hotline at 800-3188 to handleenquiries on self-serve.  "We are confident that with our comprehensive programme, additionalfeatures and unique services, Caltex Malaysia will take the lead for self-serve," said Gregory. "We will also be joining the Government and otheroil industry members in the joint educational programmes that have beenplanned." he added.

In the middle of last year, the company purchased its own workover rigfor RM15 million and, in doing so, became the first Malaysian company toprovide full workover service.  The rig, named "Merpati Cerah", was designed and partly built byEcodrill and is capable of "working over" or reconditioning 30-40 oilwells a year and drilling up to 10,000ft, Ecodrill director Raj Narayanansaid in an interview with Business Times.  "Unlike other rigs used in the oil and gas industry, this rig is easy todismantle and is designed to handle all heavy duty workover work exceptpure drilling," he said.  He believes the improved design will help the company's clients savesubstantial amounts of money in conducting remedial operations to restoreproduction at problem wells.  The company was awarded a major workover service contract worth RM11million a year by a leading oil and gas company - Unocal Thailand, whichis a subsidiary of US-based Unocal Corp.  "The initial contract period is for one-and-a-half years, but the dealis expected to take between four and six years," Narayanan said.Operations are expected to start in the middle of next month.  The contract is viewed as a means to help Ecodrill realise its long-termobjective of becoming a regional integrated workover service company, hesaid. The company is also negotiating similar deals with three other oilcompanies in Brunei and Indonesia.  "This, coupled with our approval as a local contracting arm under theVendor Development Programme of Petronas, should see the company operatingat least four workover rigs (inclusive of the existing one) by the year1999," Narayanan said.  Ecodrill hopes to have its subsequent rigs totally manufactured inMalaysia.  Besides workover services, the company is also actively involved inproviding technical training services.  "We have successfully established a skills training centre in Miri,Sarawak, known as Ecotech Training Centre and Technical Institute since1990," Narayanan said.  Established in 1988, Ecodrill is jointly owned by Narayanan (16 percent) and chairman Mej. (R) Mat Salleh Noor (84 per cent). "The initialpaid-up capital of the venture was RM25,000, which has since increased toRM3 million."  Narayanan said the company with 32 workers was set up to provideconsultancy services to the oil and gas industry in Malaysia and the FarEast region in the drilling, engineering, production and maintenanceareas.  "Four years later, we started providing technical training in petroleumand drilling engineering at the present Technical Institute," he added.  "Miri was chosen because we saw tremendous potential growth in the areaat the time. We also wanted to go to an area where we felt we couldintroduce certificate and diploma courses to people interested in the oiland gas industry," he said.  Plans are already under way to set up its first branch campus in KualaLumpur next year.  "We also intend to upgrade the Technical Institute to become a researchand development support centre, now that we have direct involvement in oilproduction operations, as we own a workover rig," Narayanan said.  "From there, we can move to the development of new products andtechnologies," he added.  Narayanan believes Ecodrill is now ready to export its servicesregionally, particularly to Brunei, Indonesia and Vietnam.  Currently, Ecodrill's business totals some RM4 million a year which issolely from the provision of training and consultancy services.  "This year, we expect total business to increase to RM6 million fromtraining and consultancy services together with a small contributioncoming from workover services," Narayanan said.  From next year onwards, with the Unocal Thailand contract in hand andimprovements at the Technical Institute, the company expects turnover toreach RM18 million to RM20 million a year.  "By 1999, we'll see turnover rising to RM60 million-RM70 million ayear," he said. "Workover services will eventually contribute 70 per centof total revenue while the remaining 30 per cent will be from training andconsultancy," he added.  Narayanan estimated that in Malaysia, the workover business is worthRM100 million a year. "We are not looking at monopolising the industry,but we aim to secure between RM20 million and RM30 million worth ofservices."

"I don't want the association to be perceived as one that only looksafter the welfare of hotels in Kuala Lumpur just because it is based inthe capital," he told Business Times in Kuala Lumpur.  Mazli who is also Holiday Inn (hotel operations/development) generalmanager, has taken the first step by ensuring the association representsthe views of hotels across the board.  "Our new management committee members comprise not only four- and five-star hotels but also three-star operations as well," said Mazli, who hastaken over from Encik Azman Harun whose two-year term ended recently.  Mazli wants the association to be more vocal in fighting for theinterests of hotels and the industry. MAH is currently seeking to lowerelectricity charges which have gone up with the withdrawal of the 10 percent discount on electricity tariffs for the hotel sector.  He said the hotel industry contributes substantially to the country'stotal electricity consumption and that the average three- or four-starhotel (with 200 to 300 rooms) in Kuala Lumpur spends about RM500,000 peryear on electricity.  Tenaga Nasional Bhd is very aware of this and it has already raisedelectricity charges considerably without giving prior notice, he said.  The association has submitted a memorandum to Energy, Telecommunicationsand Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie in June to consider its claims but hasyet to receive a response.  MAH, working together with the Government, is also looking intoambiguities in sewerage and service charges, the Social SecurityOrganisation (Socso), the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and wages.  "We have compiled these matters in a memorandum which has already beensent to Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri AnwarIbrahim during a pre-budget dialogue session in Ipoh in July," he added.  Mazli said the hotel industry is presently enjoying a boom, with hoteloccupancy rates at between 70 and 80 per cent.  "At the end of next year, we'll see tremendous growth in hotels in thecountry as the industry gears up to host the Commonwealth Games for thefirst time," he explained.  At present, there are about 55,000 hotel rooms in the country.  The number is expected to reach 100,000 by the end of next year.  On whether the hotel market will be saturated then, he says, thislargely "depends on how well we promote our country and how good oureconomy will be".  "Equally important is the location of a hotel. If a hotel is notproperly located, it may suffer with the onset of fierce competition," headded.  However, Mazli said one unavoidable problem is the shortage of skilledworkers and service staff.  "This will inevitably lead to an uncontrolled increase in wages ashotels fight for more staff to fill positions in their hotels. Each(hotel) tends to offer more for similar posts," he explained.  Because the market share for hotels is becoming smaller, Mazli saidhoteliers must now work hand in hand with the authorities to find ways andmeans to bring in more visitors into the country.  "I think we should not rely solely on the Government to bring in morevisitors. I believe hotels have got to do more," he said.  He added that the association has been supporting the Government in allits efforts to promote tourism in the country.  Mazli said MAH is currently working with the Malaysian Association ofTour and Travel Agents and the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board inanticipation of the Asean Tourism Forum which will be held in Kuala Lumpurin January next year.  "The event will generate income and create more awareness of Malaysia'stourism industry," he believes.  "At the same time, the association is also looking at the meetings,incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) sector.  "This is one component of the tourism business that I think willcontribute major exchange earnings to the country in the long run," hesaid, adding that business travellers have higher disposable incomes andtheir length of stay is longer.  Mazli said there is a need to build convention centres in Kuala Lumpur,Penang and Kuantan so that business will be spread out evenly.  According to him, the construction of the Kuala Lumpur InternationalAirport (KLIA) in Sepang marks the beginning of a new era, as "the newairport means more airlines will be coming in, more visitors and morebusiness for the hotel industry".

Otherwise, the local bourse last week was mildly active on quite ahealthy number of shares traded, making it "generally uninteresting butdefinitely not boring" according to one analyst.  Despite the country's seven months' good trade figures, the market hadstarted out on a weak note last week, arising from the uncertainties inthe direction of US interest rates. The KLSE Composite Index, on Monday,lost 4.09 points, closing at 1,126.51 while the second board index rose1.35 points up to 608.48.  On Wednesday, shares rose in active trade with strong gains registeredin index-linked stocks. It was an immediate reaction to the US FederalOpen Market Committee's decision to maintain interest rates at the currentlevel. The Composite Index closed 5.59 points higher at 1,129.31, whilethe second board rose 16.62 points to 625.41.  After a continuous upward movement in the second board index, Thursdaysaw it tumble down 24.86 points or 3.98 per cent to 600.55. Although acorrection was expected, the fall on Thursday was due to concerns ofrestrictions on second board stocks, imposed by some local stockbrokingfirms. The KLCI, however remained steady, losing only half a point to1,128.81.  The last day of the week ended fairly mixed with the CI moving up 1.78points at 1,130.59 while the second board index continued its downwardfall, breaching the 600-psychological level to end the week at 595.58. Thefirst time the second board index hit the 600 level was the Friday beforewhen it closed at 607.13.  Overall last week, a total of some 1.647 billion shares were tradedworth RM14.258 billion compared to 1.781 billion shares worth RM15.006billion the week before.  About 914.247 million shares were traded on the main board valued atRM6.681 billion, while the second board saw a total of 602.420 millionshares done worth RM7.114 billion.  Analysts said for this week, the market is expected to move sideways,with speculative main board stocks continuing to attract punters. Interestin second board stocks, however will not cease, said one analyst.

Negative trade figures which were reported did not have a significantimpact on the KLSE.  Volatile trading on Tuesday saw second board stocks trading in anerratic fashion.  Stocks on the main board were not doing much either, one way or theother.  Heavy speculative buying on Wednesday pushed prices of small capitalstocks upwards.  The overall market sentiment also improved with a new batch of stockswhich came into play.  The volatile movement of second board stocks continued on Thursday, onlythis time round, they were hammered by aggressive selling.  The bearish situation was, however, cushioned by firm support forselective main board stocks which registered good gains.  Mixed trading was the order of the day on Friday. Market sentiment waspulled down by cautious selling on second board stocks, while only thesituational issues on the main board were giving supportive play in themarket.  For the week, second board stocks were again in the limelight for theright and wrong reasons.  The much expected correction came in to cool off the over speculationwhich has taken the second board stocks to record highs.  Market players who were caught on the high side would be licking theirwounds, but for medium- term investors, this correction is healthy.  Sentiment wise, the KLSE is expected to be choppy with wild fluctuationsto remain a feature among second board stocks.  The market minus the very speculative second board stocks is stillattractive in value terms and interest may just shift to main baordcounters.  In the past couple of weeks, there has been a slow uptrend which has notcaught too much attention among main board counters.  This gradual momentum has not produced anything spectacular but withpatience there is a high potential for lagging stocks to bring in therewards.  On the technical front our short-term Timing Device has been on thedowntrend for the past eight trading sessions and currently the fallingpace has been steadily reduced in the past four sessions.  It is quite possible that this short-term market barometer which is nowstanding at -56.4 points, is preparing itself for a trend reversalsometime this week.  The first supporting level is at -119.2 points, failing which, it isexpected to have the second support at around the -300 point level.  Our O/O Indicator has continued to go up but at a lesser pace.  Until this rising market barometer is arrested, we will continue toremain bullish and treat corrections such as the one we are now seeing asa technical pullback, which are necessary for any rally in the market.  Currently, breaking out of the overhead resistance at zero is vital tothe continuation of the bullish trend we are seeing.

Kadir Jasin in New YorkNEW YORK: A prominent Malaysian businessman I met strolling on New York'sFifth Avenue a couple of mornings ago excitedly told me that his managingdirector was in the Bahamas to attend the wedding reception of his nephew.  He told me the story after I remarked that the Malays have come very farfrom their rice farming days to be able to stay in the best hotels, shopat the most fashionable stores and stroll leisurely on one of the mostfashionable streets of one of the largest cities in the world.  And he was not alone and he may not have travelled on the supersonicConcorde as some did. A whole group of Malaysia's most successfulbusinessmen descended on the city last week to join the Prime Minister,Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, at the United Nations.  The fact that an untypically large group of Malaysian businessmen hadaccompanied Dr Mahathir to the UN is explained by the fact that the PrimeMinister had earlier attended and addressed a business meeting organisedby the Asia Society.  They could have joined the trip in deference to the Prime Minister andthe co-sponsor of the Asia Society dinner, Petronas.  Having covered major international conferences around the world in whichMalaysian leaders have participated since the late 1970s - first for theBusiness Times, then for Berita Harian and now the New Straits Times - Ican quite confidently say that our country has come a long way.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, only a handful of business peoplewould accompany the Prime Minister or his deputy on such trips. TheBumiputera businessmen were the rarest.  The Prime Minister or his deputy could count themselves lucky if theyhad more than the usual group of journalists from Radio and TelevisionMalaysia, Bernama and the few large newspapers accompanying them.  Businessmen almost invariably did not consider accompanying the PrimeMinister on international trips a fruitful business. Officials, too, didnot find it appropriate to invite them to join him on his official tours.  Malaysia Incorporated was still many years away and the likes of Tan SriTajudin Ramli, Tan Sri Halim Saad and Tan Sri Abdul Rashid Hussain werestill in the backrooms learning the tricks of the trade.  Even dealmakers Tan Sri Vincent Tan, Datuk Francis Yeoh and the youthfulDatuk T.K. Lim were still in the background - shadowed by the likes of TanSri Lim Goh Tong, Mr Robert Kuok and Datuk Tan Chin Nam.  Tan Sri Kishu Jethanand of Globe Silk Store fame had already hit the bigtime but had yet to develop an international profile, while Mr K. AnandaKrishnan had the name but not the face. He had made his fortune in oiland, being a graduate of Harvard University, was at ease with thingsAmerican.  He is still a shy and highly private person. But like other successfulMalaysian businessmen, he too has been thrust onto the world stage byMalaysia's unprecedented economic success in the last decade and by DrMatathir's Malaysia Incorported policy.  In the early days, the media organisations were invited to sendjournalists to cover the Prime Minister's visit abroad and their expenseswere often borne by the Government. This practice was stopped by the lateTun Hussein Onn when he became Prime Minister in 1976.  Fortunately, since media organisations also benefit from the rapideconomic growth, they can continue to send journalists on overseasassigments at their own expense.  When I was first sent to New York for assignment, the best hotel theBusiness Times could offer was The Tudor, which in the late 1970s andearly 1980s, charged US$70 a day (US$1 = RM2.51). Today, even middle-leveljournalists stay at St Regis together with the Prime Minister.  Times have certainly changed. But the bigger change is in the way theGovernment and businesses are collaborating to strengthen the country'sposition on the global political and economic map.  For this very important reason, it is contemptible that we find someMalaysian companies and businessmen showing tendencies of becomingarrogant and insincere in their dealings with the outside world,especially the poorer countries.  I think it is the collective responsibility and moral obligation ofMalaysian businessmen, especially those enjoying the privilege of beingincluded in the Prime Minister's entourage, not to do things that willtarnish the good name of the country and its leaders.  It is alright for them to take pride in telling people that they areaccompanying the Prime Minister or his deputy, especially if it helps toopen doors. But they must make sure that they announce the PrimeMinister's name at the appropriate door.  Those who misbehave, even in front of a United Nations security guard ora hotel clerk, should be hauled up and spoken to by those responsible forincluding them in the Prime Minister's entourage.  Kurang ajar and arrogance should not be made our trademark. If they arenot known to have good manners (including table manners), they should begiven proper briefings before they are let loose on the world as membersof the Prime Minister's entourage.  Although some Malaysians can travel all the way from Kuala Lumpur to theBahamas to attend wedding receptions and their children's graduation orare picked up in a private jet to go on a gambling trip to Las Vegas, weshould avoid behaving like kaduk naik junjung. We should try to be likepadi, semakin berisi semakin tunduk.

The Fed'saction gave the market a clearer direction for interest rates as theweek's economic data turned out mildly weak.  Consumer confidence for September was down to 111.8 against August's112.0 and August's existing homes was also down 0.02 million to 4.13million. More significant was the durable goods for August which dropped3.1 per cent against a 1.4 per cent increase the previous month.  With this, rates eventually eased and they are expected to stay softnext week until the next FOMC meeting in November.

It however retraced to closethe week at a 6.53 per cent yield (price RM100.33/35).  There was no Bank Negara bills issue during the week forcing some bankswho were short on their liquid assets requirement to buy up Bank Negarabills in the secondary market.

However, the market was caught by surprise with the Fed's decision toleave interest rates unchanged, prompting fresh concerns about risinginflation. The FOMC voted against raising short-term rates, even though amajority of analysts had predicted a modest 25 basis points increase.  Currency investors that had banked on a rate increase sold the US dollarfrom 1.5140 to 1.50  marks, with strong support seen intact at 1.4980.Some dealers blamed politics for delaying a much-needed interest rateincrease, with the pressure of Presidential and Congressional elections inNovember.  By the end of the week, the market witnessed a steady bid interest onthe US dollar after a surprising Swiss interest rate cut. Switzerland cutits discount rate to an 18-year low of 1 per cent from 1.5 per cent andinvestors fled the Swiss franc and the mark . Investors appear to haveforgotten their dissapointment with the Fed's decision to keep interestrates untouched. The market is also expecting lower interest rates inGermany in the coming months. The market has also turned a blind eye tothe dissolution of the Japanese Parliament's Lower House.  The marketclosed at 1.5240 amd 110.70 against the mark and the yen respectively.  As for next week, the market is vulnerable to all US indicators in therun-up to the key non-farm payroll on Friday. Some analysts believe thatthe US asset markets are currently hyper-sensitive to all kinds of ratesand so the US dollar could be on its guard. Others express concern thatthe US dollar is gaining its strength mainly from external factors. The USdollar will require fresh internal incentives/factors to rise above itscurrent key resistance level of 1.5250 marks.  As for the local unit, the ringgit fell to the 2.51 level on fresh USdollar demand ahead of the month-end requirements from commercials andalso due to heavy stop losses orders being triggered as the marketapproaches the 2.51 level. The market is expected to be traded between2.5050 and  2.5125 for next week.  As for the Asian currencies, we expect the Singapore dollar/ringgit  totrade between the 1.7750 and 1.7880 range and  the yen/ringgit between2.2500 to 2.2800.

The car dipped and then appeared tolevitate. A harsh gasp broke the startled silence as the passengerswaited, almost expectantly, in the split second for the bang ... There wasa dull thud and then the silence was broken by an apologetic giggle.  "Sorry, pothole," the driver said. A regular journey through the streetsof Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.  This is a city of contradictions. The traveller first meets what must bea collection of the nicest Customs officers in the world, as theyapologise for having to check your luggage and then actually help you toput your things back.  Having been lulled into a false sense of security that all theliterature on the gentle Cambodian people is true, the weary travellersets foot outside Pochentong International Airport, only to be accosted bya large crowd of deafeningly aggressive taxi drivers. They stick theirfaces in yours and holler at the top of their voices: "Taxi, madam".  If it is not the taxi drivers, then it is self-styled porters who try tograb your bags and rush off in any direction they think you want to go.Saying "No" is of no help.  After locating your vehicle, they will shove everything into the bootwithout a thought given to the fact that you may be blanching in shock atthe sound of breaking bottles of sambal belachan and Lee Kum Kee oystersauce. The inevitable tip is asked for. You could get away with a 500 rieltip (about 50 sen) although if you do not have riels, US$1 (2,500 riels)will get you a princely bow.  Once safely in the car, the next shock hits you: there are no streetlights in most parts of Phnom Penh. This adds a new dimension to themeaning of the phrase "pitch dark".  Then, comes contradiction number two in the glaring and almostdecadently bright shape and form of Monivong Boulevard, one of the mainstreets in the city.  Almost every shop is adorned with colourful lights, and neon signs blinkaway the darkness announcing the presence of massage parlours, snookerparlours and parlours where one can do any number of parlour-like things.This is the world of Suzie Wong - on a smaller scale and without theAmerican GIs.  In the glaring daylight, however, Monivong is a lot less colourful. Itis shrouded in a perpetual cloud of dust that seems to hang over the wholecountry and choke and cloak everything. The facades of the shops andstores without the cover of night, are no more inviting than the "rumahtumpangan" in Chow Kit, Kuala Lumpur.  A quick whizz around Phnom Penh, and this city-bred Malaysian had partedwith a fortune in US dollars to what appeared to be society's downtrodden.Beggars come at you from all sides and do not mind pinching convenientlyexposed parts of your body to attract attention. Most of them areheartrendingly incapacitated, lacking in at least one limb, usually more.  These are just a small part of the thousands of mine victims inCambodia, struggling to make a living in a country where even the fit,hale and hearty have a tough time making ends meet. The only other twoplaces in the world where I have seen these many beggars are India and theLondon underground.  By lunchtime, several dollars poorer, wearing a cloak of dust andparched from the dry heat of the city's "rainy season", we stepped into a"Pizza Hot" restaurant. The logo is a mirror of the more well-known PizzaHut's red and white. The food is not that much different - a tad moreinternational than the Malaysianised fare in Kuala Lumpur's Pizza Huts.  Suddenly overcome by a fit of homesickness, I decided to find thataccoutrement of most homesick Malaysians - Maggi Mee. Choosing the fastestmeans of transport, I hopped on to a "moto dop" (motorcycle which doublesas a taxi) and whizzed away, past the slower "cyclos" (trishaws).  Whizzing with me were whole families of five or six, perched onmotorcycles. There were also the odd motorcycle balancing a mattress ortwo, or with furniture strapped high on the back seat. I ogled at them andthe Cambodians ogled back at me, for I was the only woman sitting astridea motorcycle, hanging on for dear life to the rider.  The other women all sit side-saddle and do not come into any physicalcontact with the riders. During the war years, apparently men too wererequired by law to sit side-saddle on motorcycles because this made hand-grenade throwing more difficult.  In a local supermarket catering for expatriates, I found Maggi Mee. Itwas also here that I encountered Cambodian directness.  "Madam come from where?" a sales assistant asked me.  "Malaysia."  "Madam how old?"  Looking as mortified as I felt, I decided to pander to this peculiaroutrightness. "Madam, 29 years old."  "Ah ... " (She looked surprised). "I think Madam sirty fife," she said,driving the point home by holding her hands up to show three and fivefingers.  I left the store bemused and amused, armed with a packet of curry laksaflavoured Maggi Mee which cost 25 US cents. Also in my grocery bag was apacket of cigarettes which cost US$1, a bottle of Angkor beer for 80 UScents and a French loaf for 30 US cents.  Grabbing a newspaper for 1,000 riels, I walked out of the store to readthe first person account of a Khmer Rouge deserter on life with thenotorious Pol Pot leader of the guerrilla faction, which had stayed inpower in the country from 1975 to 1979.  Almost 20 years after the Khmer Rouge were overthrown, their legacyremains in the broken families, the shattered dreams of the people, theircrushed city, the homeless children, the bomb craters dotting thecountryside, and ruined lives.  That night, after a packet of Maggi Mee and sitting in the balmy nightbreeze of my villa (read this as semi-detached house), I noticed the smellof Phnom Penh was finally overpowered by the large "mata kucing" tree inmy front garden.  Phnom Penh smells like a growing child - of food, sweat and hope.  And it is this hope that is most infectious. I found myself hoping thatthe Khmer Rouge will surrender and that complete peace will be restored tothis still tragic country, that those of my generation who have known notmuch more than a life of war and deprivation will be the last to know sucha life.  The gentle smiles from the older generation of Cambodians are no longermirrored in the younger folks. It is this gentleness that could be thebiggest loss if hardship and constant economic struggle become the way oflife.

They think the FOMC may instead decide on ahalf-point rate hike at its next meeting, which will be after the Novemberpoll.Those who expect an immediate increase in the federal fund rate, which is whatbanks charge each other for overnight funds, note that a majority of the 12Federal Reserve district banks are now reportedly in favour of a quarter-pointhike.There are signs that some of the inflation doves in the Fed, includingGovernor Janet Yellin, are now concerned about the growing signs of inflationand support a tighter monetary policy.The FOMC consists of the six governors of the Federal Reserve and the 12regional bank presidents.Wall Street has been perplexed by the mixed messages in recent days about theeconomy, with stock and bond prices falling at signs of inflation (and apossible rate hike) and then rising as threats of inflation (and a rateincrease) seemed to dissipate.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Lowest take-up for new homes in eastern S'porefrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Michelle Low and Agnes WeeLeasehold status, prices said to be among reasons for highest proportion ofunsold units[SINGAPORE] The Geylang and East Coast areas have the highest proportion ofunsold new apartments, a BT survey shows.And for new houses, the lowest take-up rates are in the Kew Drive area inBedok. BT looked at private housing projects of at least 50 units now underconstruction and which are not yet fully sold. Data was divided intosub-regions according to postal districts.Geylang has the highest percentage -42 per cent -of unsold new apartments.Next comes the East Coast (28 per cent).In contrast, only 2 per cent of new apartments are still unsold in Pasir Ris.In the Orchard/Bukit Timah area, 12 per cent are unsold, and in Upper BukitTimah, 13 per cent.Market watchers offered several reasons for the varying take-up rates.Geylang, for instance, was only recently turned into a residential corridorwith a series of new launches last year, and still suffers somewhat from itsreputation as Singapore's red-light district.But location and pedigree are not the only reasons why people buy property.The East Coast is a well-established residential district and yet 28 per centof the 2,949 newly-marketed apartments there have not found buyers.Said one consultant: "The East Coast already has a high concentration offreehold private housing estates and the new ones are mostly leasehold, whichmay be less popular."Also, prices of new leasehold East Coast projects are typically a shade higherthan equivalent freehold Upper Bukit Timah properties.The Bukit Timah stretch (districts 11, 21 and 23) has seen a flurry of newlaunches over the past year, and these projects generally saw strong take-up.About 400 new units are still on the market.But supply in this sector is growing -1,300 new condominium units being builtby Far East and City Developments in Bukit Batok (district 23) have just comeon the market.In landed properties, projects in familiar landed territory (like Serangoon)fared well, while those in new areas (like Kew Drive and Jurong West) soldslowly.In the East Coast area, more than half of the houses in three Kew Driveprojects have not been sold. Consultants say, though, that buyers' resistanceto these 99-year lease houses, launched last year, is slowly wearing down.Far East still has 18 of its 31 Kew Gate units and 20 of 37 Kew Residenciahouses to sell. Nearby, CityDev has yet to sell 46 of its 76 Villas at Kewunits.In district 22 (Jurong West), United Overseas Land still has 98 houses up forsale in Westwood Park after phase one (170 units) was launched about a yearago.In the prime Holland Road area, a third of Far East's 113 Holland Grove(99-year lease) are unsold.The biggest developer, Far East, has not yet sold 27 per cent of its newhouses and 29 per cent of its apartment or condo units unsold.Far East is by far the biggest supplier to Singapore's private housing market,marketing thousands of new units every year. Recent projects which are nowfully sold include the Kew Vale houses and Westcove condos. Another big-leaguedeveloper, CityDev, has 21 per cent of its condos and 60 per cent of its newhouses still unsold. Earlier this year, the Kwek-controlled company sold outits 928-unit Signature Park.DBS Land, meanwhile, still has 30 per cent of its condos on the market. It hassold out Casuarina Cove in Tanjong Rhu and the 159-unit Richmond Park nearOrchard Road.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Chavalit, Amnuay ahead in race for new Thai PMfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Loh Hui Yin in BangkokMarkets likely to be cautious until outlook becomes clearerTHE Thai government's six coalition partners are in intense behind-the-scenemanoeuvring following Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa's resignation andahead of a meeting tomorrow.Mr Banharn's Chart Thai Party, with 92 seats in parliament, remains the coreof the coalition and its Members of Parliament have indicated they want a sayin who becomes the next premier.Mr Banharn, who is being blamed for Thailand's economic slowdown, has said thenext prime minister must be competent in economic affairs.The two front-runners are Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the New AspirationParty, and Amnuay Virawan who heads the Nam Thai Party. Both men are deputyprime ministers in the current cabinet.Dr Amnuay, formerly a respected bureaucrat, finds more favour with thebusiness community. He was executive chairman of Thailand's largest bank,Bangkok Bank, from 1983-1992.While Dr Amnuay might be preferred by the business community, his Nam ThaiParty has only 18 seats in parliament and this would make it difficult for himto govern.General Chavalit, a former army chief who quit to join politics, has beenbolstering his political base with the just-announced military reshuffle. Hehas been promoting big commercial projects, like a new bank, for the military.Mr Banharn announced on Saturday he would resign in seven days' time. But itis not clear if Mr Banharn will take any position in the new cabinet.His departure will be greeted with relief by the business and financialcommunity, but the financial markets are likely to be cautious until thepolitical outlook becomes clearer in the next few days.Photipong Lamsam, chairman of the Board of Trade, said the new cabinet shouldbe formed quickly because the prolonged political problems have affectedbusiness.Mr Banharn's hand was forced on Saturday morning when New Aspiration Party,Nam Thai Party and Muanchon Party banded together and threatened to voteagainst him on the no-confidence motion if he did not agree to quit before thevote.During the blistering three-day censure debate, Mr Banharn was accused by theopposition of economic mismanagement and corruption.An upset Mr Banharn, whose 14 months as prime minister has been stormy, said:"I have been very tired after working for slightly over one year. I am proudof what my government has done so far."Thailand's exports have slumped this year and economic growth is at its lowestin a decade. Speculation is rife that the Thai baht will be devalued tostimulate exports, and the currency has been under attack with Thai stockssinking to three-year lows.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Top Asian groups to join US$200m Yangon project / Wharf Holdings, JardineMatheson Holdings, Salim Group, Pidemco Land,from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Loh Hui Yin in BangkokJardine, Salim and Wharf to take stakes in industrial project promoted byS'poreTHREE of Asia's biggest conglomerates are joining a Singapore-promoted US$200million (S$280 million) industrial development project in Myanmar.They are Wharf Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings of Hongkong; and theSalim group of Indonesia.Singapore's Pidemco Land will also become a shareholder of SinmardevInternational which is promoting the project.Sinmardev International's original shareholders are architect-businessmanAlbert Hong and his firm, RSP Architects, Planners and Engineers, and buildingmaterials producer PD International of Singapore.The project calls for the development of a 12 square kilometre industrial parkand a port for bulk cargo on the outskirts of Yangon. It is a much scaled-downproposal from the ambitious $4 billion township that Sinmardev mapped out twoyears ago.The Myanmar government, which has a 40 per cent stake in the project, willprovide land in Thanlyin-Kyauktan, about 18 km south-east of Yangon. The bulkterminal will be located in Thilawa where another Singapore firm, C&PHoldings, has been given permission to build and operate container berths.Thilawa is 16km inland from the Yangon river.Having the three big business groups, which are likely to be minorshareholders, will help Sinmardev market the project to potential investors.A Singapore businessman active in Myanmar said the three big groups are mostlikely using the Sinmardev project as a testing ground for future investments.He added that Singapore-backed projects are held in good esteem by the Myanmarauthorities.Singapore's Pidemco is not new to Myanmar as it is building a hotel there. ThePort of Singapore Authority is also exploring an investment in a Thai-backedtownship project in Yangon.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Ex-head of derivatives trading at Barings to suefrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Neil BehrmannLONDONHe claims FT, authors of new book have defamed himRON BAKER, former head of derivatives trading at Barings, is suing theFinancial Times and authors of a new book on the collapse of the bank.Mr Baker has featured in alleged transcripts of taped telephone conversationsat Barings. They were obtained by FT reporters John Gapper and Nicholas Dentonand have been published in the newspaper's serialisation of their book, AllThat Glitters.Mr Baker, who was in charge of Nick Leeson when the rogue trader brought downthe bank, has been trying to clear his name for some time. He contends thatthe serialisation and book to be published today have defamed him by quotingconversations out of context.Moreover, he claimed the FT has prejudiced a forthcoming hearing before theSecurities and Futures Authority. Several months ago, Mr Baker sought ahearing before an SFA tribunal to defend himself and reverse a proposedthree-year ban and [pound]10,000 (S$22,000) fine."The implication of what is said in the Financial Times is that I somehowcontributed to the collapse of the bank and this is untrue," Mr Baker told BT."The cause of the collapse was a fraud in the segregated client accounts ofBarings' agency broking business; it had nothing to do with house tradingwhich I ran in 1994."Mr Baker added that he became head of the derivatives desk at the beginning ofJanuary 1995, less than two months before the bank collapsed."Nothing in the SFA allegation against me relates to the collapse of Barings,"Mr Baker said. He added that by the time he was made Leeson's manager, thetrader's fraud was well advanced and Barings' losses ran into millions ofpounds."The publishing of taped telephone conversations in its own right does notbother me, although they are a dangerous medium for establishing the factsupon which to draw conclusions," Mr Baker said. "Isolated telephoneconversations do not provide the full story (my telephone wasn't taped) andthey give no context.""However, in this case, they have cut and pasted a number of differentconversations, omitting large areas, in a manner which creates a picturetotally at odds with the facts."The FT will be defending the case because it believes that the book has strongevidence.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996All set for invasion of Normandy / Microsoft Corporationfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Toh Han ShihBusinessITMicrosoft plans landing of its first Internet platform in the Asia-Pacific[SINGAPORE] Microsoft is planning to invade the Internet of entire nations inthe Asia-Pacific with Normandy, its Internet platform with capabilities inInternet commerce and the Intranet.Normandy is Microsoft's first platform for commercial Internet servicesspecifically designed for Internet service providers (ISPs), network operatorsand Internet content providers. It has several servers including MerchantServer, Microsoft's Internet commerce server that allows customers to set upInternet malls; tools to build Intranets; and security features for Internetcommerce."The Internet war is not over browsers because both companies (Microsoft andNetscape) are giving away browsers (free). The war is over Internet servers.It is the servers that makes money for these companies," said Ray Chang, chiefexecutive officer of AsiaConnect, Malaysia's largest provider of Internetsites. AsiaConnect is Asean's first Normandy user.Analysts predict that Intranets will generate many times more revenue than theInternet. Mr Chang said Normandy would be one of the platforms for a broadbandwidth Intranet consisting of fibre optic cables and microwave networksthat will cover the whole of Malaysia in two years.Though Netscape now dominates the Internet server market, Mr Chang predicted:"A fairly large portion of Malaysian Web sites will use Normandy. Normandywill command a substantial market share worldwide rapidly."He said this is because the money Microsoft is putting into research andmarketing, running into billions of dollars and exceeding Netscape's turnover,is "mind-blowing".Chinese organisations, Indosat (Indonesia's only internationaltelecommunications company), NTT (Japan's national telecommunicationscarrier), Datamat (a Thai ISP), Singnet and Singapore Cablevision areevaluating Normandy. Analysts believe NTT will take up to half of Japan'sInternet market in future.SAP, one of the world's largest software firms, will integrate its enterprisesoftware with Merchant Server.However, Mr Chang qualified: "I would not write off Netscape."He noted the high quality of Netscape's Applications Foundry, a suite ofIntranet tools. AsiaConnect deploys both Netscape's servers and Normandy.Ben Yeo, a deputy manager with Sembawang Media, pointed out that Normandyworks only with Microsoft NT. This means organisations running Unix serverscannot use Normandy for their Internet applications. Mr Yeo said that as longas Unix remains, Normandy cannot totally replace Netscape. Sembawang Media isa Netscape distributor.However, Microsoft network manager Chong Yoke Sim said: "With Normandy, itwill accelerate the adoption of NT, not only for corporations, but also ISPs."Netscape regional manager Casey Ong said Normandy is not so open. Heexplained: "Merchant Server works closely with ActiveX, which makes Windows anindispensable component in the Internet. That rules out Internet applianceswhich do not use Windows, and future versions of Windows will include Explorer(Microsoft's Internet browser)."Microsoft, in trying to promote Explorer, will make it such that there arecertain sites that Netscape Navigator cannot get into. The only access tonon-Microsoft databases like Oracle is through ODBC, which is not conducive tomassive exchange of information or mission-critical applications."Ms Chong said future versions of eshop, an Internet commerce technology nowincorporated into Merchant Server, will be compatible with NT only, whereas inthe past eshop worked with Unix software and Silicon Graphics hardware.Netscape's Mr Ong pointed out that computers not using Windows or NT, userswith Netscape browsers, and millions of future Internet appliances likehandphones and TV will not access Normandy easily. And AsiaConnect's Mr Changsaid Sun hardware cannot work with Normandy."For Internet commerce to take off at full speed, we need to embrace opensystems. Even if Netscape doesn't do well, there are third parties to buildapplications, based on open standards," he said.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Internet malls are coming your wayfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96BusinessIT[SINGAPORE] It's been great to send and receive e-mail. It's been mind-blowingto surf the ever-expanding world of the Internet. And soon, Singaporeans willhave a new cyber treat -- they will be able to shop at Internet malls.These "malls" allow users to virtually inspect goods, shop, order goods, bankand conduct financial transactions via the Internet.Contact, a subsidiary of the Sembawang Group, and AsiaOne, a subsidiary ofSingapore Press Holdings (SPH), will set up the Internet malls early nextyear. Both companies will set up infrastructure for the malls and from there,their customers can set up as many shopping "precincts" as they want.The concept is part of the Electronic Commerce Hotbed, a National ComputerBoard initiative.Contact general manager Gary Koh said last week: "We will have customersrunning their malls by early next year. Some people have committedthemselves."He declined to reveal who these Internet shopkeepers will be, but said most ofthe organisations which expressed interest in the cyberspace malls are localbanks and local merchants. He added that Contact would have regional customerssetting up Internet malls soon.There has been similar enthusiasm, too, for AsiaOne's Internet mall scheme.Low Huan Ping, general manager of AsiaOne, said local parties had committedthemselves to setting up shop. It will also, in future, have stores from theregion.Contact's parent company, Sembawang Media, offers a service whereby customerscan put their Internet malls on Sembawang's Asia Internet Holdings (AIH)backbone.Similarly, AsiaOne will be putting its Internet mall on Cyberway's ownpan-Asian backbone, which Cyberway is building with regional Internet serviceproviders.

Sometimes they even go the other direction") andthe existence of "garage shops" or clone-makers which sell PCs at cut-throatprices.The product's launch in Asia has also been slowed by some "supply-chaindifficulties", director of South-east Asian sales and distribution Philip Chuatold a press conference in Singapore earlier this month.Despite these difficulties, the home PC market is important for HP as aspringboard for HP's entry into other emerging home technologies, such as a"home server" which manages household appliances and information -a productabout "a year away" from being launched, estimated Asia-Pacific marketingmanager Steve Haslett. Mr Zitzner said: "Being in the home market gives usknowledge and understanding of the consumer and where that business might go."HP also already has several other non-PC products in the home space, includingprinters and calculators.After a successful 1995 pre-Christmas launch in the US, HP decided to launchthe product in Europe and test the Asia-Pacific market, starting withAustralia and New Zealand. The countries were chosen for their similarity tothe US, said Mr Zitzner. Launched in April, the Pavilion has quickly moved tobecome one of the top seven home PCs in those markets."We need to make sure the business model works well -supply chains, sales anddistribution model, retail channels. As we become more sophisticated withthat, then we'll look at expanding the market," said Mr Zitzner.Singapore could see the launch of the Pavilion as early as the second quarterof next year, according to Mr Chua.Features customers can look forward to, based on HP's new October models,include Pentium microprocessors of between 120 and 166 MhZ, 3D acceleratedvideo graphics, an 8X CD-ROM drive, pipeline burst cache and up to 2.5 GB harddrive.The products will also have a suite of imaging features as well as built-inInternet access.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Eutech sets global sights with software consortium / Eutech Cyberneticsfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Annette PauBusinessIT[SINGAPORE] Home-grown Eutech Cybernetics has initiated an Asia-wide virtualcorporation that it hopes will vault the high-tech company into the ranks ofglobal IT players.Hari Gunasingham, scientist-turned-entrepreneur and managing director ofEutech Cybernetics, told BusinessIT in an interview: "We want to be thestandard for enterprise systems, the Windows 95 of the enterprise game."Eutech Cybernetics is the main driving force in the formation of theEutech-Asia Software Consortium, which currently comprises six membercompanies, including five publicly-listed Indian software companies. It hopesto add other IT companies over time.Eutech-Asia is a software consortium which aims to deliver IT products andservices aligned with business systems through an architectural model to setnew standards in the fast growing area of enterprise computing.The consortium will be officially launched tomorrow, based on a Memorandum ofUnderstanding signed early this year. Members include Eutech Cybernetics,Microland, Infosys Technologies, Macmet India, Ashok Leyland InformationTechnologies, BFL Software."Today, the whole paradigm is about enterprise systems. People areincreasingly looking at corporate networks and systems, and as more corporateIntranets are connected up, they will want new ways of doing business, newbusiness systems, new concepts. These are the areas that we as a consortiumwant to tackle," Dr Gunasingham said.Consortium director Arun Abraham explained how the consortium helps poolresources: "Eutech provides the systems knowledge, management and marketinginfrastructure in Singapore, while our Indian counterparts have the technicalskills and expertise, and the human resource."One of the central aims of the consortium is to create an architecturalstandard for both IT and business systems. Eutech has in fact developed anarchitecture as a framework for building enterprise systems and for deliveringboth products and services to businesses. This, says Dr Gunasingham, is bothuserand network-centric, allowing business objects to communicate with eachother using "intelligent agents".It also seeks to join forces in R&D, focusing on wireless communications andagent-based technology. Collective R&D spending so far has amounted to some$15 million.According to Dr Gunasingham, response to the consortium has been good. Manyregional companies have asked to join the consortium, and it intends to takein more members to increase their pool of IT professionals to a lofty numberof 100,000 in the year 2000."We expect to grow faster than the current 70 per cent average growth of the(Indian) members of the consortium," said Dr Gunasingham.Eutech Cybernetics was founded in 1990, a spin-off from research scientistsfrom the local university. Staff has grown from five to 140 now.Eutech's revenues for FY95 were some $11 million. In FY96, Dr Gunasinghamreckons modest revenues of $16 million. This is expected to double thefollowing year, with the launch of Catseye, described as the embodiment ofEutech architecture.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996HP's Internet Servicesfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96BusinessIT[SINGAPORE] Hewlett-Packard's World Customer Support Organisation isintroducing Internet Services, a range of end-to-end support services forcorporate users.Meant to assist firms in the design, development and implementation of anInternet or Intranet infrastructure, Internet Services will also includeservices for the maintenance of Web servers and networks and for businessrecovery for Internet sites.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Canon Singapore sales surge with whopping printer demand / Canon Singaporefrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96BusinessIT[SINGAPORE] Sales by Canon Singapore, which oversees the electronicsmanufacturer's operations in Asia outside Japan, grew almost three times morethan projected, thanks to strong demand for its printers.Canon Singapore last week posted a 35 per cent increase in sales to US$493.3million (S$690 million) in the first half of this financial year from US$366.4million in the same period last year. The steady growth of the officeautomation industry and the introduction of a new range of printers arebelieved to have contributed to this.Actual sales have far surpassed the projected growth of 13 per cent, thegroup's managing director, Mr Kohtaro Miyagi, said. "It is certainly a boostfor the group's operations, especially in the emerging Indian and Indo-Chinamarkets," he added.Sales of printers accounted for most of the increase in sales, with a 118 percent jump in demand for Laser Beam printers. Bubble Jet printers alsoregistered a 20 per cent increase, with brisk sales of low-cost-high-outputmodels such as the BJC-610 and the BJC-210.Calculators also sold well, with a 56 per cent growth in sales due to anexpanded range of products. Sales of facsimile machines and cameras increasedby 9 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively.Parent company Canon Inc also did well, recording a 89.2 per cent increase inconsolidated net income in the first half, compared with a 20.7 per cent risein net sales in the same period last year. Canon Singapore's results were theforemost contributor to this increase. Projected consolidated net income andnet sales for Canon Inc this year are US$727 million and US$22.7 billionrespectively.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Hopes of Windows NT surge overstated : Analystfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Kenneth JamesBusinessITBut Smith Barney's Bosak still sees 18 to 20 per cent PC growth[SINGAPORE] For months analysts have been predicting that the launch ofMicrosoft's Windows NT 4.0 operating system will light a fire under thepersonal computer industry.Won't happen, says Smith Barney Inc's computer research chief Barry Bosak.But Mr Bosak, managing director of the New York securities major's researchdivision, adds that PC growth should still hit a respectable 18-20 per centthis year. "Business isn't bad," the veteran analyst says. "Demand, especiallycorporate demand, is steady."Mr Bosak, a former head of the Computer Industry Analysts group in the US,tracks computer and related stocks for Smith Barney, the second-largestsecurities firm in the US. Speaking to BusinessIT last week, he gave hisperspective of the state of the industry.The softening in the PC and related industries is because "too much electroniccapacity has been put on line", he says. Part of the reason has been thedoubleor triple-ordering of components and peripherals by PC makers, andresultant cancellations.Add to that an overhang of PC supply from last year. He cites a finding byresearch group Dataquest that as much as six million PCs were made in excessof demand last year. That will have to be cleared this Christmas quarter.Still, he doesn't expect a repeat of last year's December quarter which wascharacterised by "whimsical purchases by consumers who had a lot of money".But demand in both corporate and consumer markets is healthy, Mr Bosakemphasises. Only don't expect last week's launch of Windows NT 4.0 to sparkoff a resurgence in PC sales. That's "overstating the case" and there will be"no big wave" of NT-induced buying, he says. "I don't think corporations arerunning out to buy Pentium and Pentium Pro PCs."He explains that corporations are "more methodical" in their computerpurchases now. And they have had plenty of time to build up their PC armouryin anticipation of a switch to Windows 95 and Windows NT.He cites the case of a large financial institution that has been buyingPentiums and Pentium Pros steadily since March. "It's not something that'shappening all at once."So who are the likely winners and losers among computer stocks? For a start,Mr Bosak zeroes in on a largely unheralded group: data storage providers.He offers this insight on the changing nature of computing: "I don't thinkcomputing is about computing, it's about information, either getting it orsending it."So storage companies will be engines of the new information age. Which is whycountries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, which succeeded in attractingthe major players, "are going to feel very fortunate".His pick of the winners in this category: EMC Corp in high-end disk arrays;Seagate, IBM and Western Digital in disk drives.Among PC companies, he is upbeat about beleaguered Apple Computer. "They aredoing the right things to shore up the company, and they have some excitingmachines coming out," he says. Apple rates a "buy, with speculative risk" inhis book. But leader Compaq is an "underperform, high risk" stock: "Highmargins gone; near term bounce over," he says.In networking, "Cisco is doing a phenomenal job" while Sun "has a lot ofpotential". And the star of stars? Analysts mention HP, Sun, Microsoft, Intel,he notes "but IBM probably makes it to the top of the list". The computergiant is sitting on a US$7 billion cash hoard and "cash might be king in atechnology stock correction".Also, its various divisions are in good shape, with mainframe sales "steady",storage manufacturing "growing very nicely" and its US$15 billion PC business"finally looking like a contender".What could go wrong? Mr Bosak, who's seen it all after 30 years in thebusiness, admits to a "greatest fear": recession.Indeed the official line at Smith Barney is that "the slowdown (of the USeconomy) is coming, it's just taking its sweet time".The securities house expects real GDP growth to slow to 2.6 per cent in thesecond half of this year, down from the 3.4 per cent of the first half; and todecelerate further to between 1.0 and 1.5 per cent in the first half of nextyear.But if the slowdown tailspins into a recession, then all bets are off.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Internet takes centre stage at trade show: Novell unveils new products andstrategies at Networldfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By David Welcher in AtlantaBusinessITTHE most recent major networking trade show, Networld+Interop, has just endedhere, with more than 60,000 participants seeking definitive networkingsolutions from over 600 vendors, but largely finding them elusive.Grown from an extremely modest event in 1986, when only 300 people attended,it today represents a must-visit constellation in the galaxy of networkingevents. Not surprising, then, that Novell chose this venue to introduceIntranetWare, the latest, Internet-empowered version of NetWare.IBM, showcasing its server families, anti-virus tools, and Internet abilities,was also there, as was Lotus, promoting the new, Internet-capable NotesVersion 4.5. Microsoft, despite a highly publicised challenge from Novellabout whose network directory services were superior, essentially ignored theUtah contingent and continued to promote Windows NT as the ideal networkserver.Industry professionals could also take a guided tour of the InteropNet, astate-of-the-art network which tied together all exhibitors at the show.Featuring ATM, FDDI, Fast Ethernet and the latest in diagnostic and monitoringtools, it provided an operating, production-scale demonstration of theindustry's latest advances.InteropNet runs TCP/IP, IPX and AppleTalk, uses twisted-pair copper, fiberoptic cable, and wireless connections, and contains nearly 200 km of cablingto connect the show's 6,000 on-line devices.Although it could safely be stated that the future of networking technologywas clearly represented on the show floor, choosing the winner of thatsweepstakes was not quite that simple. In fact, although the usual candidatescompeted for attention and claimed superiority, it remained for the visitingprofessional to determine the questions at the show, and resolve the answerscarefully over time.In the broadband arena, there was no clearly superior solution. While numerousvendors proclaimed that ATM and Frame Relay were available now, and costlyFDDI (fibre) begged for continuing attention, most professionals seemed to betaking the cautious track. Many continued to look towards the proposed1-gigabit Ethernet standard, perhaps because it does not seem to require sucha radical change in direction. The Novell caveat -that the best solution isone that leverages existing technology without requiring that everything bereplaced -appeared to be right on the mark.With relatively little truly new in the hardware arena, software took centrestage, prominently featuring the Internet. The commercial future of theInternet, hampered by security concerns, remains some distance down the road.But corporate networks, featuring smooth integration of Internet access, arereadily available now, especially in the GroupWare and e-mail categories fromLotus, Microsoft and Novell.While professionals struggled to determine the best solutions to networkplanning problems with global impact, and vendors invested millions in tryingto promote their message, a few unusual items stood out from the crowd; notbecause of their gravity, but rather because they were different.One of the most fascinating is a log-in authentication system from NationalRegistry Inc (NRI), of Reston, Virginia. Combining NRI's imaging software withfingerprint recognition touchpads, NRIdentity Scanners come in two models, amouse-like pad which connects to a Enhanced Capabilities Parallel (ECP) Port,and one built into a keyboard.Together, they provide any Windows-based computer system with a biometricscanning and identification system to control computer access, by comparing auser's scanned fingerprint to an image previously placed in a database.Current pricing is about US$400 (S$560), still a bit costly, but downsignificantly from the US$1,000-US$2,000 of a few years ago. The companyanticipates significant further price drops with volume production, saidRobert Leamy, vice-president, Product Development.

Atthe just concluded Networld+Interop in Atlanta, Novell rolled outIntranetWare, the latest iteration of its flagship NetWare product, and alsodescribed a cohesive mission knitting together the strengths of its variousproduct groups.Novell has been seen by many industry experts as marching to the wrongdrummer. This is because NetWare uses the IPX protocol, while most of theindustry, including the Internet, uses TCP/IP. In a move to correct this,IntranetWare adds new services to Novell's NetWare 4.11 operating system toprovide a complete Intranet platform.The defined mission, according to senior company officials, is to combineNetWare, groupware, Internet browsing and Java development into acomprehensive solution for providing corporations with Intranets.As corporations seek to maximize the Internet's business potential, there is agrowing interest in Intranets, said William Donahoo, Novell's Director ofInternational Marketing. "Intranets are business networks used for corporateinformation needs, which also utilise Internet technologies," he said.IntranetWare provides both IP and IPX access to its Intranet resources, whichinclude Web servers and browsers, FTP servers, and Internet connections. Thearrangement provides a natural security firewall, Novell officials explained,since unauthorised access from the Internet cannot penetrate the NetWare IPXgateway to access corporate NetWare servers.Novell's installed customer base includes 3.5 million servers and 55 millionusers. The new strategy is intended to capitalise on its core networkingstrengths, as well as leverage its 55 million-strong user base. The "glue"intended to cement together this new corporate strategy is Novell DirectoryServices (NDS), which is widely considered to be one of Novell's strongestassets. NDS allows users to see other file servers as directories, and willnow be able to do the same for Internet sites.Novell is not only targeting its own installed base, but is promoting NDS tovendors of competing operating systems. "Other operating system vendors wantto use NDS," said Michael Simpson, Director of Novell's InternetInfrastructure Division. "It is, in fact, intended to be OS portable. Only 9per cent of the code is platform specific."Novell expects to see considerable revenue from this new initiative, MrSimpson said.Heading off the obvious question of whether NetWare's future was questionable,Mr Simpson emphatically stated: "This is a new revenue potential, not a hedgein case NetWare slips." SCO released an NDS-aware version last January, andnegotiations are under way with numerous others, he said.The upgrade needs of Novell's existing customers have also been carefullyconsidered, said Denice Gibson, Novell senior vice-president, atIntranetWare's formal rollout last Tuesday. "Customers are looking toimplement Internet solutions, and they need to seamlessly turn existingtechnology into Intranets with minimum disruption and cost," she explained."They are not interested in a solution which requires them to rip outeverything they have.""To both do this and give them best of breed technology, we are partneringwith other companies to provide this," she added.Major partners who have signed on with Novell in the effort include Netscape,whose browser will give NetWare users access to the Internet, and UUNet, whichhas the network in place to deliver the necessary information.Although all this comes too late for ex-CEO Robert Frankenberg, who resignedin August, it seems to directly echo his previously stated vision of Novell'sfuture. Frankenberg's address at the November, 1995 Comdex, envisioned a"Smart Global Network, incorporating NetWare, the Netscape browser, and Sun'sJava language as the core of a global data communications network."IntranetWare will be available on Oct 7, and carries no increase in price fromprevious versions. Limited time incentives are being offered to encourageexisting users to upgrade.Summing up Novell's message that its customers need not look elsewhere foranswers, Ms Gibson concluded: "To our 55 million users, we say tonight: Lookat what you've got."Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Microsoft NT 4.0, Workstation 4.0 hit the marketfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Toh Han ShihBusinessIT[SINGAPORE] Amid analysts' predictions that Microsoft NT will gain marketshare from Novell NetWare, Microsoft last week launched its latest softwareserver, the NT 4.0, as well as its client operating system, Workstation 4.0.Microsoft is giving the NT 4.0 Internet and Intranet features, as is Novellwith its latest NetWare, as both try to outdo each other in the softwareserver market.Microsoft back office manager Yong Yun Seong said NT 4.0 has Intranetcapability, in addition to the application's support, file and printcapability of earlier versions.NT 4.0's new Intranet features include Microsoft FrontPage 1.1, which allowsusers to publish Web pages easily; Microsoft Index Server; an Internet searchengine; and Internet security. NT 4.0 is optimised for broad bandwidthnetworks like Fast Ethernet and allows users to make local calls for remoteInternet access to their corporate LANs.Dataquest industry analyst Janardan Menon said Novell would continue to losemarket share to NT at an even more accelerated rate than last year.He attributed this to the growing popularity in the corporate world ofMicrosoft Workstation as a client operating system, which is designed to fitin with NT. He said that although NetWare is compatible with Workstation,people would prefer to have the same operating system from the same company onboth the client and server.Mr Menon added that Intel would promote NT because NT requires Intel's PentiumPro chips to run."It's not only the product that matters, but the marketing around it," hesaid, adding that NetWare's network directory services are superior to NT'sequivalent.Ray Chang, chief executive officer of AsiaConnect, a Malaysian company that isone of Asia's largest providers of Internet Web sites, offered a more extremeopinion. "I don't think Novell stands a chance against NT," he said."NT is scaleable, cheap, seamlessly integrated to the Internet and easy toimplement. NetWare does not seamlessly fit into the Internet as well as NT."Now, over 60 per cent of the world's PC LANs use Novell NetWare, and it iseasier for these NetWare users to upgrade to future versions of NetWare thanto NT, according to Novell Asia-Pacific marketing manager Jason Pan.Microsoft's Mr Yong said NT 4.0 is compatible with NetWare, so companies thatdeploy NetWare can add NT 4.0.Microsoft has also provided tools to allow users to migrate from NetWare to NT4.0.Workstation is part of Microsoft's plan to target the corporate market. MrMenon said corporate users would prefer Workstation to Windows 95 because theformer is pure 32-bit and more robust.Microsoft marketing manager Natasha Kwan said PCs with Workstation would bepowerful enough to move into the workstation market. However, MicrosoftSingapore managing director Paul Lovell admitted Workstation consumes so muchpower that notebooks need a power cable to operate Workstation.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Wing Tai net earnings jump 73% to $145m / Wing Tai Holdings, DNP Holdingsfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Michelle LowResult beats market forecasts by $20m; more project profits booked thanexpected[SINGAPORE] Wing Tai Holdings has reported a 73 per cent rise in net profit to$145 million for the year to June 30, higher than market forecasts by about$20 million.Wing Tai, which started out making garments but now makes its money fromproperty, said it would wind down its loss-making garment manufacturingbusiness in Singapore. But it will continue profitable garment-makingoperations in Malaysia through associate DNP Holdings.Space vacated by the manufacturing operations at its Tampines headquartersbuilding will be leased out. The site may be redeveloped in future -itslocation in a housing district and near a proposed MRT station makes it idealfor a residential project.Almost all of 1996 (and 1995) earnings came from Singapore property projectssold in the early '90s.In the second half, the group earned almost $100 million more than it did inthe first half. Analysts said forecasts were off the mark as Wing Tai bookedmore profit from development projects than they had provided for.In the period under review, the group recognised 40 per cent of total bookingsfrom Maplewoods, 29 per cent from Palm Springs and 30 per cent from theHougang Mall it sold to NTUC Income. Pre-tax profits came to $238 million, up68 per cent from last year. Turnover rose 53 per cent to $573 million.Earnings per share jumped to 25.7 cents from 14.9 cents. Net tangible assetswent up to $2.06 per share from $1.84 per share. Directors recommended adividend of 20 per cent, the same as last year.Sales of its new housing projects here are steady. The just-launched SunriseGardens sold 50 per cent of its 252 units in a week. The Bedok apartments werepriced at $580 per square foot and marketed just after the "Ghost Month"ended.Sales at the 251-unit Duchess Crest improved to 65 per cent, up from 45 percent in July. Analysts say sales improved after Wing Tai took the $1,000 psfproject to Hongkong to sell.Between now and mid-1997, Wing Tai will sell four more projects -onecommercial (Bencoolen Street) and three residential.Another 400-unit Bukit Timah project on the Rothmans site will be sold only in1998.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 199650% of profit to come from overseas / Wing Taifrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Michelle Low[SINGAPORE] By the turn of the century, half of Wing Tai's profits will comefrom overseas property projects in Hongkong and Malaysia.The largest single project on Wing Tai's plate now is the massive AirportRailway Kowloon Station Development in Hongkong. Wing Tai leads a consortiumin developing the HK$7.7 billion (S$1.4 billion) residential project, phaseone of a seven-phase project.The first phase will have about 1.6 million square feet of built-up area. WingTai, which has a 30 per cent interest in the project, declined to give profitestimates.But analysts suggest that at a conservative selling price of HK$7,000 persquare foot, the first phase could generate revenue of close to HK$12 billion.Subtracting a cost of close to HK$5,000 psf, profit could be more than HK$3billion.The group was mostly silent on China, except to say that activities were "at arelatively low level" but "longer term prospects are positive". Wing Tai isinvolved in the Suzhou Industrial Park and is also building apartments inSuzhou's New District.In Malaysia, associate DNP has "started to make property development andinvestment a core business".DNP owns 14.3 million sq ft of commercial and residential land in Kuala Lumpurand Penang.As part of its regional focus, Wing Tai is also planning a chain of high-endservice apartments under the Lanson Place brand.Some 700 units in four projects are being built in Singapore (Winsland HouseII), Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta.

On the surface, the link isshipping. Mr Tung is chairman of Orient Overseas International Ltd, which ownsshipping firm Orient Overseas Container Line.But hidden beneath the waves, the link could well be China, extending a"guiding hand".Mr Tung's declaration puts to rest months of speculation about the intentionof the hottest favourite for Hongkong's top post-1997 job. Pro-China andpro-business parties will be relieved by his declared interest, while liberalswill see the development as part of a staged competition. After all, thelow-key shipping tycoon has been tipped to be China's prefered candidate andis expected by many to toe the "make money, not democracy" line.His candidacy may even provide comfort to some pro-British elements since hewas also a member of the Governor's advisory body. As for those without astand, Mr Tung has at least widened the field for a contest which has so faryielded only two other candidates.Yet, all is not rosy. Is a businessman with huge interests in Hongkong andChina and business partners like Li Ka-shing right for the job? To reassuredoubters, Mr Tung plans to resign from all his key positions and stay awayfrom the selection committee which will elect the chief executive. He willalso transfer his business interests to other family members.More importantly, however, is whether the selection process will be fair andtransparent. To many people here, the choice of the chief executive hasalready been made by Beijing.Meanwhile, Secretary of Economic Services Stephen Ip called a press briefingwith the major port operators Hutchison Whampoa, Jardine, Wharf and Sealand toannounce the breakthrough in the agreement on CT9 (Container Terminal Nine).He had difficulty assuring and reassuring the media that the CT9 agreement wasa purely commercial deal and no political pressure was made to reduceJardine's role.Despite his efforts, it seemed that none of the journalists who attended thebriefing came away convinced. As far as the media was concerned, the Britishhong was clearly the loser. After four years of highly-charged politicalwrangling between the British and Chinese, Jardine's participation has beenreduced from a lead role in a new terminal to a secondary stake in arestructured consortium which will take over two existing berths at CT8. Thegroup gets no part at all in CT9.Optimists say, however, that the two berths will ensure that Jardine still hasa role in the thriving port business here. Also, Hongkong finally gets toexpand its port capacity and the government can now move on to tendering CT10and CT11.As for China, it now badly needs to show the world that the impasse over CT9was an isolated case and no such wrangling will happen again in future"commercial" deals.Do we see a show of hands?Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996SembCorp may inject transport and logistics into SML / SembawangCorporation, Sembawang Maritime, SMLfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Rahita Elias[SINGAPORE] Sembawang Corp (SembCorp) has confirmed that it is consideringtransferring some of its transport and logistics (T&L) businesses intotakeover target Sembawang Maritime Ltd (SML).

The three items accounted for about 35 per cent ofAugust's non-oil domestic exports.The latest trade figures released last Friday showed a worse-than-expectedfall in non-oil domestic exports of 6.3 per cent in nominal terms, anddetailed data on the major electronics items reflect manufacturers' woes.HG Asia economist Song Seng Wun said: "The hard disk drive segment is showingsome stability but the semiconductor segment is under a heavy cloud. Productprices are falling..."He said checks on the local industry revealed a pick-up in orders ahead ofChristmas. "But these are hopeful purchases. Should there be signs ofinventory piling up again and weak sales, customers will turn around andcancel orders.""People are placing orders in anticipation of being able to flog them ahead ofChristmas, but if the US numbers remain depressed and demand is weak fromEurope, those orders will be cancelled," he said.He said month-on-month numbers might look encouraging, but year-on-yearnumbers were not."You're seeing the sharp impact of the decline in product prices."In the personal computer segment, he said demand was growing by 20 per centwhile supply was rising by between 40 per cent and 50 per cent.

The project, called the Fully Automated EOL Process, is being helped bythe Economic Development Board which has given MIT a $1.5 million grant.Semiconductor firms need processing equipment at various stages ofmanufacturing, such as testing, laser marking and packing. What MIT will do isto integrate all these processes into one automated system. It will alsoreduce labour.Incorporated in 1992, MIT designs and builds processing equipment forsemiconductor firms. A family-owned company, it intends to be listed byend-1998 or early-1999. Turnover for the company has been doubling every yearuntil this year, when it rose 20-30 per cent due to the slowdown inelectronics sector.

"If the tender system is not used, whatever othermechanism employed will be similarly blamed."The tender system, she said, is superior to any other system to determineprices -- especially when the true or fair value of land is hard to assess.Ms Mao also defended the government's high reserve price in tendering outland. "As the land belongs to all Singaporeans collectively, it is thegovernment's responsibility to capture as much as possible the full economicvalue of the land," she said.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Housing cost not up as much as property prices: Academic defends tendersystemfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Chuang Peck MingChief statistician: consumption and investment distinctTHE cost of accommodation for home owners has not increased as much as the bigjumps in property prices would suggest, said government chief statisticianPaul Cheung on Friday.His submission to a Cost Review Committee hearing, embargoed to be releasedtoday, showed that the proxy measure of changes in housing cost -the annualassessed value (AAV) estimated by the Chief Valuer of the Inland RevenueAuthority of Singapore -rose by single-digit figures, and not the double-digitrises witnessed in the property market in recent years.He said: "The owner-occupied housing sub-index (of the Consumer Price Index)has increased by 5.1 per cent between 1992 and 1993 and 0.9 per cent during1993-95. However, it declined by 0.2 per cent during January-June 1996."A distinction has to be made between consumption and investment when thebuying price of a house or flat is considered, said Dr Cheung. The CPI, whichtracks price changes in consumption, is only interested in the shelter servicethat is consumed. It does not take into consideration the house or flat as anasset which can be sold for capital gains. Ordinarily, the CPI needs only totrack the changes in rentals to get a measure of the price changes inaccommodation, or user cost. But since most Singaporeans are owner-occupiers,the rentals have to be imputed. And the AAV provides the best imputation. "Therental equivalence approach for treatment of owner-occupied housing isconceptually and methodologically sound," he said. "The same approach isadopted in the compilation of national accounts statistics."Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Electronics slump hits Singapore most : reportfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Anna TeoAMONG the region's economies, Singapore has probably been the hardest hit bythe global electronics slump, says Consensus Economics Inc, noting that theaverage 1996 growth forecast had been cut to 7.4 per cent from 8.5 per cent inthe last two months.The London-based firm's latest gross domestic product (GDP) growth average isderived from 17 forecasters in early September, including NatWest Marketswhich heads the list with an 8.5 per cent projection.But NatWest has since sliced its 1996 Singapore growth forecast to 7 per cent,which brings the Consensus Economics average down to 7.3 per cent.A separate BT list of 19 GDP growth forecasts for 1996, ranging from J PMorgan's 6 per cent to Nomura Research Institute's 7.6 per cent, produces anaverage of 7.1 per cent.Consensus Economics polls financial and economic forecasters around the worldevery month for their estimates of key variables.Its findings for Singapore show a GDP growth average of 5.3 per cent in thethird quarter (compared to a BT average of 4.6 per cent) and 6.4 per cent inthe fourth quarter (BT average: 6.1 per cent).Manufacturing growth is expected to reach a trough of 4.5 per cent in thethird quarter this year, according to Consensus Economics' poll."Consumer sentiment, and thus spending, has also been badly affected by thesubsequent job-cutting in the manufacturing sector," it says, noting thesluggish consumer demand reflected in weak retail sales.Retail sales grew about 2.9 per cent over the first half of the year, and 4.3per cent in July. The poor retail performance has reduced price pressures,with inflation below 1.5 per cent in the last few months.The government remains on course to reach its year-end inflation target of 1.5per cent, says Consensus Economics.But while most of Singapore's recent indicators show signs of an economicslowdown, investment growth remains strong, rising by 23 per cent in thesecond quarter. This has been reflected in an upward revision to the consensusinvestment forecast to 11.9 per cent for 1996.Boosted by robust investment growth, GDP growth is expected to recover by thesecond quarter of 1997, says Consensus Economics.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Leader Universal plans to issue Euro bonds / Leader Universal Holdingsfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96[KUALA LUMPUR] Leader Universal Holdings Bhd has proposed to issue up toUS$125 million (S$175 million) Euro bonds to take advantage of itssubstantially lower interest cost over local bank financing.Commerce International Merchant Bankers Bhd said in a statement on behalf ofLeader Universal that proceeds from the issue would be used to repay bankborrowings, additional investment in subsidiaries and the settlement ofexpenses for the proposed exercise.

A 47 per cent risein interest expense to $4.4 million also dragged down its interim performance.The fall was offset partially by a 29 per cent decline in taxes to $11.4million.Earnings per share (EPS) fell 23 per cent to 14.5 cents. Analysts polled byThe Estimate Directory have pegged Inchcape's full-year EPS at 30.7 cents,down 14 per cent.Group turnover was down 2 per cent to $643.8 million.Profit before interest dropped 5 per cent to $39.3 million. This includedcontributions from associates.Of the total, its "motors business stream" generated some $21.1 million -down25 per cent year-on-year.The "marketing business stream" fared better with profit rising 61 per cent to$8.4 million. Its consumer division did particularly well, with profittripling to $6.4 million. It had benefited from the rationalisation of lossmakers last year and the disposal of the office automation business.Meanwhile, Inchcape's shipping business incurred a loss of $200,000 comparedto a $200,000 profit in the same period last year.Its financial services business saw profit before interest rose 25 per cent to$9.5 million. IRB Finance, which mainly finances retail car purchases inBrunei, had benefited from the higher value of car sales financed.Directors declared an interim dividend of 10 cents per share before tax,unchanged from the same period last year.On current year prospects, they said the second half would be a challengingtime for the group, especially in the motor industry.

BNI is the first state-owned bank to be privatised inIndonesia.The bank said over the weekend that it would float 25 per cent of its paid-upcapital in the IPO and is awaiting formal approval from the Indonesian CapitalMarkets Supervisory Agency (Bapepam).Analysts had earlier speculated that the size of the issue would be around onetrillion rupiah (S$608 million) with market capitalisation of four trillionrupiah.BNI shares will be listed on the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges thoughthe bank said that it is also open to international investors. The IPO will beunderwritten by Danareksa Securitas while Lehman Brothers will act as theinternational adviser.The BNI issue comes at a time when sentiment on the local stock market hasturned bearish. Foreign investors, who dominate trading on the Jakarta bourse,have pulled out of the market over political succession concerns.The July 27 riots that rocked Jakarta have further eroded confidence.Not surprisingly, this has not been a particularly good year for IPOs.Analysts have revised downwards earlier estimates of US$1.5 billion (S$2.11billion) being raised through new offerings in 1996. Nevertheless, the BNIoffer is expected to bring investors back into the market.The BNI issue will be the only Indonesian state-owned firm to go public in1996. Besides BNI, the government originally had ambitious plans to floatthree other state firms this year.These are toll-road operator PT Jasa Marga, steel firm Krakatau Steel andinternational carrier Garuda Indonesia. But the flotations have been delayedbecause of international perception that these state firms are not performingwell and hence the government would not be able to set an attractive price.BNI, which is the largest of Indonesia's seven state-owned banks, is also thehealthiest. At end-June, the bank had assets of 32 trillion rupiah andreported revenue of 17 trillion rupiah.The bank said that between 1993 and 1995 its net earnings rose from 245billion rupiah to 378.7 billion rupiah. BNI has a capital adequacy ratio of9.1 per cent and a loan-deposit ratio of 86.3 per cent.BNI proposes to use the IPO proceeds to fund its investment and developmentprogramme.

The Singa pore offer is expected within the next two weeks. Analystsexpect the company to raise up to HK$250 million (S$46 million) from theissue.The funds will help Easyknit develop its own fashion brand name, Library. Thecompany plans to open 10 Library outlets here by the first quarter of nextyear, before penetrating Taiwan and China's markets.Mr Koon says: "We have a very strong design team and we have a very strongsupplier network. We can offer many styles at lower costs."In fact, much of Easyknit's success in recent years had been attributed to thegroup's unusual relationship with its 16 or so suppliers. Years ago, Mr Koonparcelled out production functions to his employees and helped them set uptheir own businesses.Now they are his suppliers, helping him to source for cheap materials fromaround the world while he focuses on expanding his export markets."I lent them money and now I'm taking my money back. Some are my long-timefriends. Some are my ex-employees," said Mr Koon."They only concentrate on working for me. We both make money together. Mymaterial costs are about 10 per cent lower than my competitors."Easyknit's links with its suppliers are further stamped by exclusive contractswhich last for 10 years each.Mr Koon, who won the Young Entrepreneur of the Year award in 1994, employs asmall number of staff compared to his listed rivals. Easyknit has only about70 employees, dealing in marketing and merchandising. Still, turnover for theyear ended March 31, 1996 came to HK$1.2 billion and net profit, HK$104.6million.In comparison, Glorious Sun Enterprise, which employs more than 1,000 people,has a turnover of about HK$1.6 billion.Mr Koon is confident that the new retail business would be profitable by thefirst year. "It is because we don't keep inventories. We don't do theproduction. We can test market first and then we make bulk orders. We don'tget stuck with inventories."Besides going into the retail business, the company is also expected togenerate property income from its investment in a new building.Easyknit recently bought a plot of land and is developing its new 27-floorheadquarters on the Cheung Sha Wan site in Kowloon. The property investmentwill help to diversify its earnings base from 1998.The recent diversification into retail and property has gone down well withanalysts. Analysts expect the company's rental income to hit HK$10 million ayear and the retail business to contribute about 20 per cent of turnover fromnext year.As for its core trading business, the company will continue to enjoy lowmaterial costs, quick turnaround times and strong profit margins, thanks toits exclusive contracts with suppliers in low cost countries such asIndonesia, China and Honduras.Analysts expect Easyknit's net profit to grow by at least 20 per cent in thecurrent year to about HK$146 million and to HK$174 million in the followingyear.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996GIC, DBS Land among S'pore groups vying for HK$7b projectfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Quak Hiang Whai in HongkongSINGAPORE's interest in Hongkong's real estate market remains unabated asseveral of the republic's biggest property groups joined in the territory'slatest land tender for a HK$7 billion (S$1.3 billion) airport-railway stationproperty project.At the close of the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) tender on Friday,the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), the Hong Leong Groupand DBS Land were among the over 30 companies which formed 12 consortiums tobid for the second phase of the Tung Chung MTRC project.With previous MTRC tenders attracting only five to six consortiums each, thelatest tender for Tung Chung will be the hottest contest ever for an MTR site.The Tung Chung site is the first station linked to the proposed airport atChek Lap Kok island.Hong Leong and GIC, which were unsuccessful for the prestigious HK$40 billionCentral MTR tender earlier this year, joined Hongkong China and HKRInternational for the contest.DBS Land, which has teamed up with Ng Teng Fong's Sino Land for severalHongkong property projects, was part of the consortium which includes SinoLand, Tai Cheung Holdings and Great Eagle Holdings.Last year, DBS Land joined the winning consortium led by Sino Land for theHK$12 billion Tai Kok Tsui MTR mixed project. DBS Land is expected to joinSino Land for phase three of the same project.The MTRC has so far awarded six contracts along the airport railway line,including phase one of the HK$70 billion Kowloon project which was won by aSingapore-dominated consortium. That consortium was led by the Wing Tai Groupwith participation from Singapore Land, Straits Steamship Land and TemasekHoldings. Property developers like airport railway projects because of themixed features and proximity to the railway line.Analysts say the record numbers of bids for the second phase of Tung Chungproject reflects the reviving bullish sentiment in the Hongkong residentialproperty market. Analysts also attributed the strong response to the smallersize of the development.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996East Asian gold demand slumped in first halffrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Neil Behrmann in LondonConsultancy says China leads region in falling demandGOLD demand in East Asia, particularly China, slumped in the first half of theyear, according to a London-based consultant.Gold Fields Mineral Services, a respected and well-connected consultancy,estimated that fabrication demand from East Asia, including Japan, slid to 485tons in the first six months of the year from 572 tons in the same period in1995.Consumption in China contracted to only 69 tons from 128 tons in the sameperiod. Hoarding of gold in East Asia shrank to 61 tons from 140 tons and inChina the amount was only two tons in the first half, compared with 13 tons inthe same 1995 time-frame.In the early part of the year when gold touched a year-high of US$418 anounce, there was resistance to higher prices, the consultant said."But China's slump in gold purchases is also the result of a prolongedausterity campaign, the stabilisation of the currency and a growing preferencefor jewellery set with diamonds and other gems," said Stewart Murray, chiefexecutive of Gold Fields Mineral Services.In contrast, Middle Eastern gold jewellery consumption and hoarding, jumped to271 tons in the first six months from 230 tons the previous year. Consumptionand hoarding in India rose to 321 tons from 296 tons and good weather forfarmers points to a continuation of this trend, forecast Mr Murray.Despite a sound market in the Indian sub continent and the Middle East, globalgold demand fell 8.3 per cent to 1,727 tons in the six months to end-June1996. In the major European nations, spending on gold jewellery fell becauseof a worsening economic climate and rising unemployment. Gold prices,presently languishing around US$383 an ounce, down 8 per cent from theirJanuary peaks, have also fallen because of an increase in supply.Year-on-year global mine production rose 3.2 per cent to 1,120 tons in thefirst of the year and gold scrap recycling by 15 per cent to 338 tons.Disenchanted investors who had bought at high prices in 1995 and early 1996off-loaded 160 tons between February and the end of June.Central bank sales dipped to 108 tons in the first half of 1996 from 196 tonsin 1995, but the timing of the supplies contributed to the market depression.Mr Murray said he believed there were secret sales over and above this amount.He expects gold consumption to improve in the coming months ahead of Christmasand Chinese New Year in late January. Yet, the price will only rise if thereis lower producer and central bank sales. The market is uncertain about thepsychological impact of potential International Monetary Fund sales of 155tons.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Fed seen staying its handfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96Column:  Simex Weekly RoundupBy Collum HendersonInterest rate differentials still hold key to strength of greenback[SINGAPORE] Will they or won't they? It's definitely a close call. On balance,however, MMS expects the Fed to continue to stay its hand -the Reuters storynotwithstanding.Fed governors have proved less hawkish this time than their regional Fedcolleagues and are notably more reluctant to simply fight growth, particularlywhen inflationary pressures remain very muted.Granted, the Philly Fed price component rise is a concern, but the latestProducer Price Index, and more importantly Consumer Price Index, data suggestthat there continues to be no inflation problem as yet.Some might see the upcoming US presidential election as an obstacle to any Fedtightening. However there is surely no question that Alan Greenspan would hikenow if he thought it was warranted, whether or not he was ever invited to sitnext to Hillary again.We expect steady Fed policy this week -followed by a 50 basis point tighteningat the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting just after the election.So what does this mean for the US dollar?The forex market is pricing in a Fed tightening this week, resulting in thedollar trading higher. No Fed rate hike means the US dollar is likely to seethose gains eroded very quickly.The Fed statement, if there is any, will be important. Going forward, the keywill be consequent rate expectations -the dollar will not suffer as much ifthe market continues to expect the Fed to hike.Interest rate differentials, rather than trade fundamentals, remain the keyfor now. Near term, we do not expect any change in the official interest ratedifferential between the US, and Germany and Japan. Thus, the dollar shouldsoften near term from here.Aside from the FOMC, we have a full slate of data this week. First off, today,is the Italian September CPI data. Though most attention is focused ongovernment attempts to bring forward a credible 1997 budget, this data shouldconfirm that inflationary pressures in Italy are continuing to decline-leaving the Bank of Italy room after the budget to ease rates further.German COL and Import Price data for September and August respectively is duetomorrow. MMS expects these to show price pressures remaining equally muted inGermany.Also coming out tomorrow is the UK's Q2 Gross Domestic Product data.

Not when the Second Board Index has more than doubled andit's hosting two counters that have crossed the M$100 level.Last week, the index set four record highs and, as usual, dominated the market-more than M$1 billion was traded daily, which is significantly more than the$325.71 million average chalked up by the entire local market comprising themain board, Clob and Sesdaq.Brokers here tell of harrowing sessions every day as excited clients, lured bythe double-digit gains, call constantly to place huge orders, for which fewactually have the funds to pay. One stressed dealer at a foreign brokeragesaid: "Clients buy in the morning, sell before lunch and buy again afterlunch. This goes on throughout the day, and all in minimum lots of30,000-50,000 and all on a contra basis. I've actually had to talk them out ofsome trades."If retail punters here are minting money on the Second Board, then imaginewhat the impact has been on the personal wealth of some of the people who ownsignificant stakes in Second Board companies. Take, for instance, Wan Adli WanIbrahim, a relatively unknown Berjaya group executive director who currentlychairs two Second Board companies, Transwater and Bridgecon.Having just bought 50.84 per cent of Transwater's capital for M$15 per shareor M$99.1 million last month, Mr Wan Adli's stake is now worth M$100 pershare, or about M$661 million. On paper, he is sitting on M$561.82 million ofprofit.As for Bridgecon, he raised his stake to 20 per cent just before the shareswere suspended last week. The stock jumped 68 per cent to M$32 when tradingresumed on Friday. Wan Adli's stake is now worth M$127.68 million, bringingthe combined value of his Transwater and Bridgecon shares to M$788.68 million.Along the way, Transwater said it had submitted a M$1.1 billion bid to thegovernment to rebuild the Johor-Singapore Causeway, while Bridgecon announcedan increase in its rights issue, an acquisition of land costing M$463 million,and an acquisition of its shares by SAP Holdings managing director RaduanTaib, who bought a 36 per cent stake at M$20 per share. Both Wan Adli and MrRaduan have Vincent Tan's Berjaya Group to thank for their instant wealth --the conglomerate is believed to be the main contender for the Causeway'sreconstruction and is the party which sold the land to Bridgecon.Transwater, whose shares traded at M$5 last November and M$15 in August, isnow capitalised at about M$1.3 billion. No doubt if Bridgecon continues tomake similarly exciting announcements as it did last week, it too will joinTranswater in the billion-ringgit club.The Second Board, no doubt, will continue to dominate trading but it isuncertain which direction it would take.

Not when the Second Board Index has more than doubled andit's hosting two counters that have crossed the M$100 level.Last week, the index set four record highs and, as usual, dominated the market-more than M$1 billion was traded daily, which is significantly more than the$325.71 million average chalked up by the entire local market comprising themain board, Clob and Sesdaq.Brokers here tell of harrowing sessions every day as excited clients, lured bythe double-digit gains, call constantly to place huge orders, for which fewactually have the funds to pay. One stressed dealer at a foreign brokeragesaid: "Clients buy in the morning, sell before lunch and buy again afterlunch. This goes on throughout the day, and all in minimum lots of30,000-50,000 and all on a contra basis. I've actually had to talk them out ofsome trades."If retail punters here are minting money on the Second Board, then imaginewhat the impact has been on the personal wealth of some of the people who ownsignificant stakes in Second Board companies. Take, for instance, Wan Adli WanIbrahim, a relatively unknown Berjaya group executive director who currentlychairs two Second Board companies, Transwater and Bridgecon.Having just bought 50.84 per cent of Transwater's capital for M$15 per shareor M$99.1 million last month, Mr Wan Adli's stake is now worth M$100 pershare, or about M$661 million. On paper, he is sitting on M$561.82 million ofprofit.As for Bridgecon, he raised his stake to 20 per cent just before the shareswere suspended last week. The stock jumped 68 per cent to M$32 when tradingresumed on Friday. Wan Adli's stake is now worth M$127.68 million, bringingthe combined value of his Transwater and Bridgecon shares to M$788.68 million.Along the way, Transwater said it had submitted a M$1.1 billion bid to thegovernment to rebuild the Johor-Singapore Causeway, while Bridgecon announcedan increase in its rights issue, an acquisition of land costing M$463 million,and an acquisition of its shares by SAP Holdings managing director RaduanTaib, who bought a 36 per cent stake at M$20 per share. Both Wan Adli and MrRaduan have Vincent Tan's Berjaya Group to thank for their instant wealth --the conglomerate is believed to be the main contender for the Causeway'sreconstruction and is the party which sold the land to Bridgecon.Transwater, whose shares traded at M$5 last November and M$15 in August, isnow capitalised at about M$1.3 billion. No doubt if Bridgecon continues tomake similarly exciting announcements as it did last week, it too will joinTranswater in the billion-ringgit club.The Second Board, no doubt, will continue to dominate trading but it isuncertain which direction it would take. Most analysts are now calling for along overdue correction and hopefully, when this happens, it won't be toopainful for those involved.As for the local market, it would be unfair to say that interest isnon-existent as liquidity has improved. However, although the Straits TimesIndustrials Index managed to break 2,200 during the week, its inability tohold onto its gains and Friday's sobering trade figures will probably rein inany further rises.On the external front, the US Federal Reserve meets tomorrow for its regularinterest rate meeting.

Thezone, controlled by guerillas of the Lao Patriotic Front, had its owncurrency, and its own mechanism for distributing money in provinces itoccupied.The zone under the US-leaning Vientiane government consisted of a centralbank, and six private banks.After liberation, the existing banks were nationalised by the Lao PatrioticFront which committed the deadly mistake of consolidating all commercialbanking activities into the central bank, the National Bank of Laos.Soon afterwards, the name of the central bank was changed to State Bank, and,as its name suggested, the bank extended loans primarily to state firms, whileretaining the exclusive right to issue currency. The State Bank established anetwork of 96 branches across the country. It was only in 1988 that autonomousstate-owned commercial banks were allowed to start.When the late strongman Kaysone Phomvihane launched reforms under the NewEconomic Mechanism the same year, the central bank was restructured into a newentity, the Bank of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and a two-tierbanking system introduced to separate central banking from commercialfunctions.First signs that the government would relax entry rules for foreign banks camewith the establishment of a semi-private bank in 1989 in which both the stateand private firms held shares.These reforms put an end to an era of profligacy when state firms hadunfettered access to central bank funds at negative interest rates. Thegovernment, for the first time, in 1991 introduced minimum and maximuminterest rates. Interest rate controls were scrapped in mid-1993. The onlycontrols left were a minimum savings deposit rate, and a maximum lending rate.It was the reformed banking sector that introduced bonds and T-Bills. Now withLaos set to join Asean, it has set its sights on issuing long-term bonds.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Uncertain future for Laotian T-bonds: Banking reforms end era ofprofligacyfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Harish MehtaInflation deflates euphoria that came with launch of short-term bonds in 1991[SINGAPORE] WHEN Laos launched its first government bonds five years ago,residents of the capital, Vientiane, were delighted by the novelty of earninginterest at double-digit rates.The euphoria accompanying the introduction of short-term bonds in 1991 isover. Bond issues have been hit since last year because inflation runs at morethan 19 per cent.Things are just as bad this year. As a result, the government has stoppedissuing long-term bonds. For now, it offers only six-month bonds that earnhalf-yearly interest of about 10 per cent.Laotians venture into the bond market as their kip-deposits in banks earnlower annual interest of 16 per cent. But even so, interest gains are beingwiped out by inflation. Many Laotians, in the days of single-digit inflationin 1994, were able to save a small part of their salary, and happily parkedwhat they saved in short-term bonds. But since last year, as prices ofessential goods rose, the choices for the man on the street, with an averageannual income of US$331 (S$463), were clear: food came before all else.Sharp price rises between March and September last year triggered substantialdepreciation of the kip, which lost about 27 per cent of its value as thecurrency plunged to about 1,000 to the US dollar in September last year from734 six months earlier.Pany Yathotou, the governor of the Bank of the Lao People's DemocraticRepublic (PDR), the central bank, said: "When inflation was low, evenforeigners bought bonds through their relatives living in Laos. But withhigher inflation, they're not buying them anymore."Bonds issued by the central bank and the Ministry of Finance look like a cashcertificate, and come in a maximum denomination of 10 million kips (aboutUS$10,520).Laotians fret about three issues -the climbing rate of inflation, constantdanger of kip devaluation, and the lack of a secondary market.So kips are often converted into Laotians' favourite currencies -US dollar andThai baht.Although the future of bonds is hobbled by a lack of a secondary market, MsPany said bond holders could redeem them at the central bank.Her predecessor, Bousbong Souvannavong, said before a secondary market couldbe created, it was necessary for the central bank to issue sufficient paper inthe primary market. "Once the market is sufficiently liquid, will it makesense to talk of a market price," he added.Until a secondary market can develop, Laotians will have limited opportunitiesof converting their bonds into cash.Mr Bousbong said the underdeveloped state of the financial markets was due toerrors of the recent past. The government handed over the power to issuecurrency to the governor of the central bank as late as in 1990. That ended aperiod when the government extended interest-free loans to state companies.Laotian bonds also have a strategic difference from bonds issued by otherdeveloping countries: the Bank of Lao PDR issues bonds as a monetaryinstrument to mop up excess liquidity in the economy, not to raise capital."For infrastructure development we would need a long-term maturity of bonds,"Ms Pany said, "but we have issued only short-term bonds."Three years after the bonds came on the market, the Laotian Ministry ofFinance began issuing Treasury bills to soak up a very liquid economy. Thefirst auction took place in March 1994, and auctions of one billion kip areheld once every two weeks.The government now needs bonds and T-bills more than ever as the threat ofinflation is growing, and the economy is skidding.Mr Bousbong explained that since Laos introduced financial reforms in 1988,one of the main objectives was to "curtail liquidity expansion that hadresulted from the easy access state-owned enterprises had to bank credit atnegative interest rates". To tackle the crisis, the government adopted apositive interest rate policy in August 1989. It ensured interest rates wouldbe higher than the inflation rate, lending rates higher than deposit rates,and long-term rates higher than short-term rates.In time, the central bank will be compelled to create a variety of riskierinstruments such as corporate bonds and equities. Perhaps, the electricity andwater utilities should be encouraged to issue their own paper. A next logicalstep would be the creation of financial institutions such as pension funds andinsurance firms.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996ShipRepair 96 : a chance to find out what competitors are doingfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96Column:  DockyardBy David HughesTHIS time of the year is always marked by a flurry of conferences, conventionsand exhibitions. This year is no exception with the normal northern autumncrop of events, on everything from Ship's Agency and Crime at Sea to ArrestingShips.Being somewhat the Cinderella of the shipping industry, despite its crucialimportance, there is not much of interest to the repair and conversion sector.But it does have one annual gathering, at London's Olympia, in early November.The organisers of ShipRepair & Conversion 96 have just put out the publicityfor the two-day conference and exhibition.Once again Alan Thorpe and Ronald Sim have put together a well thought-outprogramme. The conference covers a wide range of topical issues, though withperhaps some emphasis on tankers and dry bulk carriers.The conference, as ever, tackles a mixture of technical and commercialsubjects.The first session looks at something that ought to be dear to every yardmanagers' heart, money. The initial paper looks at how repairers can helpthemselves by getting contracts right to start with. Solicitor Mike Lax,partner with UK law firm Lawrence Graham, provides "A Practical and LegalGuide to Enforcement under Shiprepair Contracts".There will be more than enough to keep those who go to ShipRepair mainly forits technical content happy. The only reservation in this regard is that theorganisers make use of "technical workshops" which take place in parallel withthe presentation of the main papers on both mornings.Having more than one presentation at a time has its drawbacks. Firstly itassumes that people interested in, for example, listening to a paper onPollution-free Sterntube Seals will not be just as keen to attend thepresentation on Planning for Special Surveys.To be fair, the organisers have to weigh up all sorts of practicalconsiderations and still try to pack in as much as possible. Probably the mainproblem is that two days is not really long enough to do justice to theshiprepair and conversion industry.And there is certainly is a terrific amount packed into this programme. Butmost of the presentations are from representatives of European-based companiesand organisations.There is, though, one Singapore-based speaker. Sigurd Gude, executivevice-president of Kvaerner Ships Equipment, will be presenting ServiceAgreements -Predictable Maintenance Cost True or False. Also from this region,Hongkong United Dockyards managing director Chris Pooley will present TheFuture of Hongkong's Repair Industry after 1997.The European emphasis should not deter anybody from the Asia-Pacific regionfrom attending. This is the one annual opportunity to find out whatcompetitors are doing, and thinking, especially what they think aboutcompetition from Asian yards.ShipRepair ventures into the area of competition between the majorshiprepairing countries. On the first day there is a panel discussion on theEuropean shiprepair market. This focuses on competition within Europe andparticularly on the impact of the yards in what was the Eastern Bloc.Polish yards already have a formidable reputation for cheaper steel repairs.Now they are moving into technically more complicated areas. That worries therepairers in western Europe, whose views should be well represented in thedebate.The European yards are also worried by competition from this region forconversion contracts. So the second day will see Peter Fetton from the UK'sA&P Group asking: "Is the European conversion industry competitive against theFar East?"Since Mr Fetton's paper is preceded by two about current FPSO conversions inEuropean yards, the answer to his question seems self-evident. After allSingapore yards, for example, are not inexperienced with, or slow to bid for,FPSO conversion work.The reality is that much of the world's repair and conversion business issubject to intense competition, driven by severe overcapacity, and winningcontracts depends on providing dependable quality at a keen price. Thatapplies wherever your yard happens to be.By David HughesCopyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Lumut port expects cargo volume to doublefrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96[KUALA LUMPUR] Lumut port in Perak has projected an 80-100 per cent increasein cargo throughput to 600,000 tonnes by the end of this year from the levelachieved in its first year of operations which ended in July 1996.Lumut Maritime Terminal (LMT) general manager Kwek Chee Wah said the projectedcargo handling for the port during July to December 1996 will be higher thanthe 400,000 tonnes achieved during the one-year period (July 1995 to July1996)."Port operations took off after the second half-year (January-June 1996) ofits operations, with a 230 per cent increase in cargo handling to 295,170tonnes as compared with the first half-year of business," he said recently.Dry bulk cargo remains the principal cargo type handled, with 190,010 tonnesor 64 per cent of the total volume handled during January-June.The port also handled 99,760 tonnes of breakbulk cargo such as iron and steel,project cargo, asbestos and hydrated lime which made up 34 per cent of totalthroughput.Mr Kwek said the port's growth reflects the users' growing confidence and theincreasing number of manufacturing industries in Perak.He reiterated that Lumut port is not competing against Port Klang or Penangport for cargo but will play a complementary role.LMT is owned by Perak Development Corp and Halim Rasip Holdings Sdn Bhd, eachholding a 30 per cent stake, and Ipco International, 40 per cent. -MBTCopyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Apply aviation's approach to safety, conference toldfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Felix ChanMARTECH '96Speaker urges pro-active investments in accident prevention[SINGAPORE] The aviation industry's emphasis on proactive investments inaccident prevention as opposed to reactive investments in accident costreduction should also be applied to shipping, delegates at the Martech '96conference were told.Speaking on the final day of the international conference on Maritime Safetyand Environmental Protection, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)professor E G Frankel said that emphasis should be placed on a limited numberof important maritime issues, instead of casting the "current wide net" oflargely unimportant regulations which dilute the effectiveness of existingregulations.Many of the existing regulations address mainly short-term effects or isolatedincidents and are more oriented to publicity and political gain than longerterm improvements in maritime safety and environmental protection, he noted.He also noted that although the world's maritime community agreed to adoptcertain safety and environmental protection agreements, and introduced portstate control as an enforcing mechanism, the resultant enforcement isgenerally quite "lax or non-existent"."Differential enforcement of international conventions is self-degrading asships always gravitate to the flag of lowest enforcement," he told delegatesat the conference on Friday.Prof Frankel stressed the need for an institution that could act like a worldmaritime court with enforcement powers -something akin to a "worldwide UNcoast guard"."Ocean shipping is an international industry and ships in international watersshould be accountable to international conventions independent of theirnational laws. National sovereignty should not extend beyond nationalborders," he added.Other speakers on the final day of the conference include Lloyd's Register ofShipping's deputy chief surveyor JM Ferguson, who spoke on bulk carriersafety; and ABS Pacific Singapore's head of safety and environment systemcertification R N Chandha, who spoke about auditing to ISM.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Joint bunker venture all set to go / KMP Coastal Oil Pte Ltd, M Zain WakilPenghantaran Sdn Bhdfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Yong Mei FongKMP Coastal Oil and M Zain Wakil Penghantaran waiting for licence[SINGAPORE] A bunkering joint-venture between Singapore operator KMP CoastalOil Pte Ltd and Malaysian freight forwarding company M Zain Wakil PenghantaranSdn Bhd is now awaiting the final step -a licence -before starting to supplybunkers in Port Klang.KMP Coastal Oil, a major bunker operator in Singapore handling about onemillion tonnes of bunkers a year, holds a 40 per cent stake in thejoint-venture set-up Straits Energy Sdn Bhd.Its Port-Klang based partner holds the majority share of 60 per cent throughits subsidiary, Fasa Prestij Sdn Bhd.According to M Zain Wakil Penghantaran director Jason Goh, the joint-venturecompany has an initial paid-up capital of M$100,000 (S$56,290). He said thenew company was expected to start operations in the first quarter of nextyear.When licensed, Straits Energy will be among the small handful of about eightapproved operators in the port, of whom only about two are said to be active.Currently, the volume of bunkers lifted in Malaysia is low, at an estimatedvolume of about 200,000 tonnes last year.Industry sources say because of customs duty imposed on bunkers for shipsplying the domestic trade, Malaysian shipping lines found it uneconomical tolift bunkers at home and turned to Singapore for their needs.However, the Malaysian government recently abolished bunker taxes, as part ofan incentive package to promote Port Klang as a cargo load centre. With thetax lift-off, more shipowners are expected to take bunkers at Malaysian ports,particularly Port Klang.Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Port Klang spells out its policy on bunkeringfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96By Yong Mei FongNo intention to compete with S'pore, but it aims to cut price difference[SINGAPORE] Despite what the industry says, Port Klang is not likely to be amajor bunker centre like Singapore, nor does it aim to compete with Singaporeon bunkering services, says M Rajasingam, general manager and chief executiveof Klang Port Authority (KPA)."We have to develop the marine services here and our strategy is to see if wecan provide bunkers at prices which will not make ships calling here look foranother site," he told Shipping Times.Convenience to the ship and costs were issues that the authority was tackling,said Mr Rajasingam.South Korea is already giving Singapore -currently the top bunkering port inthe world -a tough run for its money by offering lower bunker prices. Industryplayers say Port Klang is a potential competitor too because it has beenattracting more international lines.Disputing this, Mr Rajasingam said: "A lot of ships go to Singapore, not forcargo handling but just for bunkering. I don't think Port Klang will be likeSingapore, a bunker centre, because of the differences in location."Referring to the port's position next to the Straits of Malacca, he said: "Thesheltered water area is very limited. I don't think we can afford the luxuryof ships coming here just for bunkers."Given this, the authority was in fact encouraging ships to take bunkersoutside the port limits, under the Malaysian Bunkering Procedure, which wouldbe issued soon, he said.Mr Rajasingam also said that bunker prices at Port Klang -at about US$12(S$16.90) to US$14 more per tonne than at Singapore -were a lot higher. Hehoped to narrow the difference."I am not even thinking of matching the price at Singapore, but to bring itdown to about US$3-US$4 more," he said."Though it may still be higher, it is better for the ship operator than havingto make an extra trip to another port for bunkers. This will keep the cost ofcalling at Port Klang reasonable," he added.Likewise, said Mr Rajasingam, Port Klang would also work at putting othersupport services in place, such as ship chandling, supplies, water, shiprepairand even professional services like banking and insurance.Some of land along the port was already alloted by the government forshipyards, he disclosed. "The idea is that we must provide services to shipsthat will make the ship operator say that if I go to Port Klang, there will befacilities that would take care of my needs."Copyright, STP (1975) LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS TIMES (SINGAPORE PRESS) via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Intermodal Asia '96 starts in Singapore todayfrom BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96[SINGAPORE] Intermodal Asia '96 kicks off today at the Hilton Hotel.The three-day event will open with a special address by E G Frankel of theMassachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Ocean Engineering.

The rate in a major Saigonhospital is currently $130/day.  That includes a phone, TV andair-conditioning.  But Swiss company, Ketone, is aiming to buildit's own hospital where patients would be charged $150/day.  Thedifference in price is attributed to foreign doctors being paid$10000 a month.  That's 300 times what a local doctor now receives. The message to expatriates in all these figures is that gettingsick in Vietnam will soon be too expensive to contemplate.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: Cloudy Windowsfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Microsoft's introduction of a Vietnamese version of its Windows 95program has resulted in somewhat cloudy results.

He hascalculated (possibly without including himself) that if Vietnam's poolof 30 million labours contributed one day a year to the notion for"patriotic duties" the country would have an extra trillion dong toplay with.  Its a nice notion, and one that has worked well for theBurmese for many years.

He citedoperational shortcomings (a nice way of explaining away banks thataccept deposits but can't find the money at withdrawal time),inadequate checks on loans (assets are a bit difficult to quantifyin Vietnam), and the employment of unqualified and `degenerate'officials (loans are sometimes given on the basis of available sexand entertainment).Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: Expansionfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996The ADB is loaning Saigon Port $30m as part of a $40m upgrade.Work has already begun on the three year project which will seecapacity increase by 25%.

Mitchell of international law firm Russin & Vecchi,summarizes here in a percent Asian Initiates seminar in Rangoon thesections of the economy open to foreign investment and the methodsby which a foreign investor may establish a presence in Myanmar.For detailed information regarding any of the issues  discussedbelow, please contact the author at Russin & Vecchi in Rangoon.ESTABLISHING A PRESENCE IN MYANMARIn 1988 the State Law and Order Restoration Council (the "SLORC")passed the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law (the "MFIL"), whichsignalled a new era in Myanmar's economic development.  The MFILoffers attractive incentives and guarantees competitive with thoseof the neighbouring nations.  Though most sectors of the economyare open to foreign investors, there are certain reservations.A.    Permitted Areas for InvestmentSome sector of economic activity are reserved to the State byvirtue of the State Economic Enterprises Law s. 3.  There are:    -    extraction and sale of teak;    -    exploration, extraction and sale of petroleum, natural gas andproduction of by-products;    -    exploration, extraction and export of pearls, jade and preciousstones;    -    breeding and production of fish and prawns in fisheries;    -    postal and telecommunications;    -    air and railway transport;    -    banking and insurance services;    -    broadcasting and television services;    -    exploration and extraction of metals and export of same;    -    electricity generating services; and    -    manufacture of products relating to security and defence whichthe Government has prescribed by notification.However, even in these sectors Myanmar citizens and foreigninvestors alike may apply under s. 4 for a certificate allowingthem to undertake these activities.  In practice such permissionwill often only be forthcoming where the proposed activity is to beundertaken in a joint venture with the relevant State entity.B.    Entry Vehicles for Doing Business in MyanmarThere are three primary methods for investors to establish apresence in Myanmar :1.    Appoint a Business Representative;2.    Obtain a Permit to Trade and incorporate a company/register abranch office;3.    Apply to invest pursuant to the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law(the "MFIL"), and then, if doing so as a company, obtain a Permitto Trade and incorporate a company or register a branch office inMyanmar.Given the size and sector restrictions applying to MFILinvestments, most foreign investors utilize #2.  It is worth notingimmediately that 100% foreign ownership and control of companiesincorporated in Myanmar is permissible, and that where the State isto have any form of equity interest in company it must be formedpursuant to the Special Company Act 1950.  Finally, where a jointventure is to be through a corporate vehicle, the provisions ofMyanmar's Partnership Act will obtain.1. Business RepresentativesRegistration of a Business RepresentativeThough there are no provisions for "Representative Offices" as theterm may be understood in other countries, there is a procedureunder which a Myanmar citizen, or a branch office or company inMyanmar, can be registered as the official Business Representativeof a foreign entity.Who may be a "Business Representative"The appointment of business representatives in Myanmar is governedby the Ministry of Trade's Registration of Business RepresentativesOrder (order No. 2/89, or the "Business Representatives Order").The Business Representatives Order defines a "BusinessRepresentative" as:1.    "an agent engaged in accepting indents and placing orders forgoods from the supplier abroad on a commission basis or anybusiness representative employed to do any business transaction forany individual or organization abroad or to represent anotherperson in dealings with third person."It also includes:1.(1)    technical assistants and business consultants employed by aforeign manufacturer or exporter;1.(2)    products specialists, buying agents, technicians and businessconsultants employed by foreign buyers who purchase Myanmarproducts;1.(3)    individuals who represent a foreigner in foreign trade andwho render services for the benefit of such foreigner; and1.(4)    individuals having an established office in the Union ofMyanmar and representing a foreign company or organization or anentrepreneur to act as business representative or to engage inconsultancy services or employee recruitment but not registered asthey are not governed by any existing law.Section 3 stipulates that a person appointed a BusinessRepresentative must be:    (a)    a citizen of Myanmar;    (b)    at least 18 years of age;    (c)    not a service personnel of any State owned entity; and    (d)    must possess appropriate qualifications.It is also possible to appoint companies incorporated in Myanmar,or branch offices registered in Myanmar, as a BusinessRepresentative, even if these companies are foreign owned.Powers of a Business RepresentativeAs between the Business Representative and the Principal, the scopeof the permitted powers must be clearly delineated in theAppointment Letter, which will be registered at the Ministry ofTrade.  Any liability for the acts of a Business Representativewill be determined with reference to the terms of the appointmentletter and will be governed by common law agency principles ascodified and modified by the Contract Act 1872.Appointment ProcessAn application is filed for a certificate of registration, whichcertificate will be valid for one year.  With 30 days notice priorto the expiry of the certificate an application may be made toextend the registration for a further year.  The appointment lettermust be certified as authentic by the Myanmar embassy in theforeign principal's country.Registration FeeThe registration fee is based on the proposed remuneration of therepresentative.  This remuneration must fall within definedparameters.  A Business Representative may earn agency commissionin foreign exchange, in which case the registration fee is kyat10,000 payable in foreign exchange (which would be approx. $1800.00at the official exchange rate of 5.75 kyat/ 1$).Alternatively the Business Representative may earn a salary, inwhich case registration fees are payable in local currency asfollows:            Category            Registration Fee        Extension Fee(1)    monthly salary of US$1,000    kyats 10,000            kyats 5,000        and above(2)   monthly salary of US$501        kyats 5,000            kyats 2,500        to US$1,000(3)   monthly salary of US$100        kyats 2,500            kyats 1,000        to US$500For reference the official exchange rate is pegged to the SpecialDrawing Right (SDR) and the rate is currently approximately kyat5.75 = $1US.  However, the market exchange rate, which can now belegally obtained at a recognized new Exchange Centre, is about kyat130 = $1US, so that for example the registration fee of kyat 2500would cost only $20.When is a more formal corporate presence in Myanmar necessary ?Though  the definition of "business representative" noted abovegives some indication of the scope of activities contemplated forBusiness Representatives, the point at which a company mustestablish a more formal corporate presence in Myanmar remainsill-defined.  The trigger appears to be when a company is "doingbusiness" in country.2. Obtaining a Permit to Trade onlySection 27A of the Myanmar Companies Act requires that requiresthat foreign companies obtain a Permit to Trade.  Formerly suchPermits were issued by the Ministry of Trade, whereas now they areissued by the Ministry of National Planning and EconomicDevelopment.An application for a Permit must be in the prescribed form and willrequire certain information regarding the investor and theinvestment.  The Capital Structure Committee will considerapplications, and will stipulate a minimum capitalization amount.There are certain prescribed minimum amounts, which are outlinedbelow for the 5 categories of Permits to Trade, but in some casesthe CSC may stipulate a higher amount in part based onconsideration of the company's expected expenditures during thefirst year of operations.  One half of the stipulated amount mustbe brought into the country before the Permit will be issued, andthe balance must follow within one year.Following are the categories:    i.     Manufacturing             kyat 1,000,000    ii.    Trading                   kyat 500,000    iii.   Services                  kyat 300,000    iv.    Hotel/Tourism             kyat 300,000    v.     Banking/Finance/Insurance kyat 300,000As the official exchange rate is approximately kyat 5.75 - US$1 theeffect is that, for example, a requirement to import 300,000 willactually require that the investor bring in roughly $53,000.  Thesefunds will be transferred into the investors foreign currencyaccount, and can be withdrawn in foreign currency equivalentForeign Exchange Certificates ("FEC's") to meet local expenses.  Upto 75% can then be used to open an LC and thus in effect to bringcapital :in kind".It is important to note that the company will be restricted toactivities which fall within the purview of its Permit to Tradecategory, and that this Permit to Trade category must gybe withstated objects of incorporation of the company.  Whereas formerlycompanies would adopt "kitchen sink" objects clauses whichcontemplated every conceivable manner of activity, now companiesare restricted to a list of objects issued by the Registrar ofCompanies for companies in the relevant category of Permit toTrade.  Companies must choose a limited number of the objectsclauses on this official list.Additionally, whereas previously the categories of Permit to Tradewere tiered and inclusive, such that a manufacturing company couldengage in trading and services, and a trading company could engagein services, now each category of Permit to Trade is distinct.  Forexample, a manufacturing company may not engage in trading orservices, but must instead incorporate a distinct company andobtain a distinct Permit to Trade for that purpose.  However,companies may engage in what might be termed "downstream orupstream" operations directly related to the activitiescontemplated in their Permit.  Thus a manufacturing company couldengage in the retail sale of its own products and could import theraw materials necessary for production.  That company could not,however, participate in trading of unrelated goods.Please note that in many sectors the economy the investor will needto submit a licence fro the relevant Ministry as part of the Permitto Trade application.Once the Permit to Trade has been issued the investor can proceedwith the incorporation of a company or registration of a branchoffice.  These application must again be in the prescribed form,and require information on the shareholders, directors etc.3. The MFILInvestment under the MFIL always merits consideration because ofthe generous tax and export/import incentives, and the explicitguarantees regarding repatriation and nationalization, for whichMFIL investors are eligible.  However, there are certain listedareas of permitted investment, certain minimum thresholds for MEILinvestors and MFIL has certain objectives to be considered whenassessing an application, including:    - promotion and expansion of exports    - exploitation of natural resources which require heavy investment    - acquisition of high technology    - supporting and assisting production and services requiring highcapital    - opening up of more employment opportunities    - development of works which would save energy consumption    - regional developmentIn the results trading companies, for example, will not generallybe eligible for MFIL incentives.  By law it is never mandatory toinvest under the MFIL, but as a matter of policy companiesinvesting in certain sector of the economy might be asked to submitthe comprehensive MFIL proposals even if they do not want theincentives that the MFIL offers.  It would be a rare case howeverwhere an eligible company did not want to avail itself of theMFIL's benefits.Under the MFIL, foreign investment can occur in the form of 100%foreign-owned venture, or in a joint venture with a Burmese entityor individual.  If wholly foreign owner the investment can occur inthe form of a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a limitedcompany; if a joint venture, at least 35% of the joint ventureequity capital must be foreign capital.MFIL applications require detailed information which must becomplied and submitted in a prescribed form.  Information requiredincludes information as to the investment participants (includingbank references and other information as to financial standing),the investment structure, the magnitude, nature, division andtiming of capital contributions, the input requirements (foreignexchange, personnel, power, etc.) and output projections for thebusiness, and any draft agreements (such as leases, contracts withrelevant Ministries, etc.) relating to  the project.MFIL applications will be vetted and forwarded to the MyanmarInvestment Commission (the MIC") for review.  The MIC's membersinclude all Ministers whose portfolio's could be said to related tocommerce, industry to commerce, industry or finance.  When the MIChas issued its recommendation regarding the application it willforward it to the Cabinet for final consideration.  Thisrequirement that the powerful Cabinet explicitly consider and issueits approval for issuance of an MFIL Permit is an importantdistinction from certain other regional nations lacking such aunitary central authority.  Such a "seal of approval" can greatlyexpedite future dealings with government officials, provided alwaysthat the matter at issue was explicitly contemplated in the MFILapplication materials.When an MFIL Permit is granted the investor may then establish acorporate presence in Myanmar pursuant to the steps noted above in#2 if this is the chosen investment vehicle.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: Success is a mind's gamefrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Hanoi:FT : - For a country that for decades learned more from thetext-books of Marx than the market economy, Vietnam is doingremarkably well.Group domestic product growth is around 8 per cent, mainly on theback of rapid growth in construction, increased exports andindustrial growth.  Saigon, the country's engine of growth, grew byalmost 15 per cent, although there are signs that Hanoi and thenorth is catching up."The main thing is staying on course in terms of macro-economicmanagement," says Bradley Babson, resident representative of theWorld Bank.But despite the past four years of successes, Vietnam has reachedan economic crossroads.  Inflation, which in 1988 raged at about300 per cent, was brought down to 5.2 per cent by 1993.However, consumer prices have increased ominously and economistsfear that the indicator could climb back up to alarming levels onthe back of rapid economic growth unless the trend is checked.Although domestic savings accounted for some 17 per cent of growththis year, far above the paltry 7.4 per cent recorded in 1990,economists say that this is still too far below average levels inthe region and compares unfavourably to that of China, where therate is about 35 per cent.Although the fruits of doi moi are evident in the main cities -where cars are becoming more common and many residents have beenbusily converting their homes into mini-hotels or small shops - thecountryside lags far behind.  Since agriculture employs more than70 per cent of the workforce and accounts for more than 50 per centof total export volume, this could act as a drag on growth.However, the economists sound greatest alarm over investmentinflows, which, though increasing, will not be enough to sustainindustrialisation.The World Bank, normally upbeat on Vietnam, has in its latestreport tempered its praise with a warning that Vietnam mustdemonstrate more enthusiasm for developing the nascent privatesector if growth is to be sustained."Despite the success of state enterprise-led industrialisationsince 1991, a strategy based on developing large, capital-intensivestate enterprises, protected from foreign and domestic privatecompetition and concentrated in selected `strategic' sectors, wouldnot deliver the kind of industrialisation Vietnam needs," said theWorld Bank report.Vietnam's private sector is restricted to small-scale enterprisessuch as food processing and the manufacturing of garments and someconsumer goods.  Vietnamese private businessmen complain of anunequal playing field on which they are forced to compete withprivileged state-owned enterprises (SOEs)."The state sector has a monopoly of many high profit businesseslike telecoms, real estate, export and import but the privatesector is not allowed to take charge of them," says Bui Huy Hung,president of Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank, one of a handfulof share holding banks."This is the biggest obstacle to the transition to the marketeconomy."Despite a vigorous campaign by Hanoi that has cut the number ofSOEs to 6,000 from 12,5000 since 1990, Hanoi appears set onmaintaining the state sector's dominance of key sectors of theeconomy.  Foreign economists point out that most of the SOEs closeddown as part of the down-sizing were small, town-based units in theprovinces, with little economic clout, even collectively.In mid-1994, Hanoi formed 14 conglomerates in sectors such aselectricity, cement, textiles and rubber.  "The idea is to increasecompetition and to form more commercial establishments," says PhanVan Tiem, chairman of the government's State Enterprise ReformCommittee, admitting that Vietnamese policy makers are using thechaebol of South Korea as one model.Foreign economists and the World Bank suspect that the creation ofsuch conglomerates may be just another way of strengthening SOEcontrol over the economy, saying that rubber scarcely qualifies asa strategic industry."They cannot do this with the state sector as the centre ofgravity," says one foreign economist.Economists see an urgent need to mobilise domestic savings -estimated at about $2bn - and channel them into the banking system. Progress on this has been slow due to traditional mistrust ofbanks and despite the launch this year of a series of domestictreasury bill auctions ultimately aimed at the retail market.In the meantime, Vietnam hopes to meet some of its spending needsby issuing government bonds internationally.  Hanoi is keen to moveas fast as possible with huge sums needed for infrastructure,education and healthcare."Vietnam has ambitious targets and the danger is that they going tospend too much too quickly, and that could affect inflation and thebalance of payments," said a foreign economist in Hanoi.Financial TimesCopyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: $1bn for flat steel millfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Hanoi:Vietnam's attempts to aggressively recruit foreign companies to buildsteel mills within its borders are about to pay off in a big way.Korea's Posco and Daewoo are finalising plans to build Vietnam firstflat-product steel mill, which could cost as much as $1 billion."We are discussing this project with Daewoo and VSG," Sujin Oh,Posco's chief representative in Hanoi said.  "We have finished thepre-feasibility study."The large infrastructual needs expected to be associated with theproject are causing headaches in determining its location.  Atleast three sites are under consideration, two in central Vietnamand one in the north.  The Vietnamese are again pushing for DuangQuat as a steel mill fits in well with their ideas ofindustrialising central Vietnam.  Costs for infrastructure alone,including a deep-see port that could accommodate ships of at least40,000 dead-weight tonnes and adequate electricity and roads, arelikely to be about US$200 million."We assume the Vietnamese government will provide theinfrastructure," he said.  The Vietnamese are assuming that theforeigners will pay for it.Four joint ventures between Vietnam Steel Corporation and foreignpartners have come on line within the last 18 months with a totalcapacity of more than 700,000 tonnes.  This is still short ofDaewoo's annual projections for Vietnam of 3 million tons by 2000.All of these mills are producing construction steel, which is usedprimarily for reinforcing buildings.Vietnam at present has no mills producing flat steel, which is usedin products such as cars, refrigerators and washing machines.  TheKorean flat steel mill will be a welcome part of the nationalstrategy that Vietnam is encouraging in its shift to heavymanufacturing.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: $650m for Vung Tau portfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Saigon:In the largest build-operate-transfer deal ever signed in Vietnam, aTaiwanese led consortium  is to put up to $650m into turning VungTau into the nation's leading container port.  The deal, involvingTaiwan's Evergreen, Malaysia's MMC Ports, and Singapore's TrediaResources, is the largest infrastructure investment on record.Under the BOT contract the consortium will run the port for 40years before handing it back to the government.A first phase is expected to go into operation within two years andwith 15 years the project will have the capacity to handle 45million tonnes of cargo annually.Vietnam Marine Corporation, a state-owned entity, will initiallyhold a 5 per cent stake in the project but as the expansion startsto make money it will buy shares from its foreign partners toincrease this to up to 20 per cent.The Vung Tau upgrade will complement the $40m revamp of SaigonPort.  The ADB funded project will see capacity there expanded by25% by 1998.With annual trade growing at 30% Vietnam's ports are woefully inadequateto handle it.  They could become completely congested within twoyears as new infrastructure development fails to keep pace withtrade.Vietnam has a BOT law to encourage infrastructure improvements butfew companies have attempted this form of investment because oflimited guarantees on foreign exchange and pricing of services.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996Cambodia downsizes contractfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Phnom Penh:Cambodia has a unique interpretation of downsizing, the Americanterm for reducing employees.  Cambodia downsizes entire contracts.Two years ago it threw out two Thai airlines and signed with theMalaysians for Royal Air Cambodge.  A year ago Phnom Penh signed abillion dollar deal with Malaysian company YTL to turn Angkor Watinto a major tourist attraction.  Now, the land that had beenawarded to YTL (1095 hectares) has been cut in half and seven newcompanies have been called in to bid on its development.Aspara, the agency charged with overseeing protection andmanagement of the temples, has asked two local companies and fiveforeign firms including France's Dumen GTM Cambodge, and Korea'sDaewoo.  YTL was not even on the list.The rebidding for the Angkor Wat complex reveals the infightingbetween Tourism Minister Veng Sereyvuth who supported YTL, andState Minister Van Moulyvann who leads Aspara.  The latter had beenparticularly critical of YTL's proposals for a light-and-soundshow, while conservationists are worried that the hotels will bebuilt on archaeologically protected land.For his part Veng Sereyvuth defended YTL saying that it hadproduced a professional plan that would protect the environment andhad commissioned a study showing the light-and-sound show would notdamage the temples.The real question that investors are asking on their Cambodiandeals is whether a Cambodian contracts is worth the paper it iswritten on.  The YTL downsizing is an obvious example that its not.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BURMA: $7 billion despite pressurefrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Rangoon:The generals in Burma have reason to feel optimistic.  Despiteincreasing pressure for foreigners to disinvest and continuingAmerican calls for sanctions, total approved investment in Burmashould reach $7 billion by year's end.  All is from the privatesector with oil and gas attracting the most investment with 25projects worth $1.44 billion.Since 1988 when SLORC took over the government no loans had beenforthcoming from international financial institutions such as theWorld Bank (WB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and AsianDevelopment Bank (ADB).The lack of foreign aid and soft loans does restrict development,says David Abel, the country's Minister for Economic Development.But he still believes that private investment will continue toblossom with another $1.5 billion committed by March 1997.Whereas Abel believes that Burma, which is still a member of thegoverning bodies of the WB, ADB and IMF, faces only politicalobstacles rather than "technical" ones for the resumption of loans. An ADB official said the inadequacy of economic reforms in Burmaand the government's foreign exchange policy were the mainstumbling blocks.American companies remain the leading investors in Burma with morethan $250m committed so far on 15 projects.  Some 20 countries haveso far invested $4.13 billion in 176 projects, with two Europeannations among the top three investors.Britain tops the list with $1.003 billion invested, followed bySingapore ($896 million) and France ($465 million).Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: British may get a chancefrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Hanoi:British construction firm John Liang International may yet get thechance to build Hanoi's new international airport.  Four years agoit had submitted a bid for a new, smaller passenger terminal afterundertaking a privately financed feasibility study that assessedpassenger growth and traffic forecasts.  The British firm, despitestrong backing from London, lost the Hanoi contract to a Japaneseconstruction group and work on the first phase of the Hanoirebuilding scheme, the construction of a new internationalpassenger terminal, has just begun.The Vietnamese, never slow to use foreign cash to achieve their owngoals, have decided that the new Hanoi airport would serve bothcivilian and military aircraft.  Japanese aid is given under strictcivilian guidelines and is specifically prohibited from being usedto assist military - related projects.  This means that theJapanese will most likely withdraw from the project altogether.  Ifthat happens, the most likely beneficiary will be John LiangInternational that still has the original ,50m in government aidthat was used to back its earlier bid.  Talks have been opened andthe Vietnamese are receptive to a British takeover should theJapanese falter.The Hanoi revamp, plus a similar one in Saigon, are thecornerstones of a massive upgrading scheme.  The country's civilaviation department has proposed spending $5 billion to $8 billionduring the next 15 years to improve 50 airports throughout thecountry.An IATA report has predicted that air traffic in Vietnam would grow from1.2 million passengers in 1993 to 3.9 million in 2000 and 17.4million by 2010.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: Individual tax in VNfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Hanoi:David King is the resident representative in Vietnam of accountancy firmPannell Kerr Foster.  He clarifies here the tax regulations thatforeign individuals face when they take up residence in Vietnam.A recent crackdown on foreign representative offices by the taxdepartment has caused some confusion among foreign workers aboutwhat taxes they should be paying and who they should pay them to.The Hanoi People's Committee has sent a memo to all foreignrepresentative offices in the city saying that its ExternalEconomic Department is now charged with collecting the income taxof Vietnamese and foreigners in representatives offices.  Thismeans that staff in these offices must pay their salary tax to thePeople's Committee instead of the tax department.The tax department is looking at ways to increase its effectivenessin tax collections and, in a sense, the People's Committee has beensub-contracted to collect the taxes for which it receives a smallcommission.The People's Committee is taking a common sense approach tocollecting the taxes and there now appears to be an unofficialamnesty for foreign representative offices to lodge their incomedeclarations.  However, if a representative office in audited andfound to be neglecting its tax payments, the tax office is unlikelyto show any leniency.From the People's Committee's perspective the chief representativemust be a resident in Vietnam, which raises two issues.One is the tax perspective.  If you are nominated as chiefrepresentative, the People's Committee tax collection teamconsiders that you are a resident and you should be paying tax onyour worldwide income at Vietnamese tax rates.There are three tax levels for foreign workers.  According to theTax Act a foreigner working in Vietnam for less than 30 days overany consecutive 12-month period pays no tax on his or her income.The difference between Vietnam and other countries is that the12-month period does not necessarily coincide with Vietnam's taxyear, which is from January to December.The second tax scale applies to a foreigner working in Vietnam formore than 30 days and less than 183 days over a consecutive12-month period.If you fit into this group you are supposed to pay tax at a flatrate of 10 per cent on Vietnam-sourced income.The third rate is for a fully-fledged resident in the country forany period over 183 days.  This is the criteria under which thechief representative falls and is taxed on his worldwide salary andwages income.The chief representative should be paying tax at this third ratebecause he should be a permanent employee of an office in Vietnam.There is no difference between paying tax to the People's Committeeand the tax department.  The tax payer fills in the same form andreceives the same receipt - the payment simply goes to a differentaddress.The People's Committee issues an assessment which says how mucheach employee must pay per month.  The amount is paid and a receiptis issued.Confusion in paying taxes for foreign workers arises becausepayments must be made monthly and many foreigners are in Vietnam -on and off - for short periods.  Many workers are uncertain howlong they will remain in the country, making it difficult to assesswhich tax level they fall under and how much they should pay.A preferable tax system would not categorise tax payers at thebeginning of their work period - they would be categorised over thelong term.  Monthly tax would be paid at a marginal rate then fullyreconciled in the annual return.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BURMA: Is SLORC on a slide ?from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Rangoon:In a country that is chronically short of telephones Burma's SLORCis selling its citizens mobile phones - 4000 of them at $4000 each. But as the phones have to be purchased in dollars, the $16mgenerated from the sale drained the local black market of dollarsand seriously undermined the value of the kyat.  The local currencylost a quarter of its value in this odd attempt to boost governmentcoffers.  The attempted solution to one problem led to potentiallymore serious problems elsewhere.But mobile phones are only part of the story.  They are not thesole reason for the fall in the kyat, and nor is the exchange ratethe only difficulty confronting  SLORC.Newspaper headlines have been dominated by talk of rising politicaltensions, increasing dissent among opposition groups andinternational criticism of Rangoon's human rights record, and SLORCfaces a whole range of worsening economic problems.  Its attemptsto tackle these problems threaten to make matters worse before theyget better.  And the economic woes have great potential to add tothe discontent.Inflation is rising, a trend that can only worsen as the currencydepreciates.  Dollars are becoming harder to find because they areneeded for imports, while dollar-earning exports face numerousobstacles.  The trade balance is in deficit.Investment, which ought to offer a major means of escape from thisvicious cycle, is also looking grim, with a growing number offoreign firms deferring projects or withdrawing from the countrybecause of political controversy.SLORC's hopes of raising foreign exchange through its Visit BurmaYear campaign have been largely dashed because of the dissidents'campaign against the promotion, and because some tourists areafraid of trouble."SLORC is tying itself up with economic problems," said one Asiandiplomat.Most businessmen expect the kyat to hover around 180 kyat to thedollar until the end of the year.  This compares to its movementlast year between 100 and 110 kyat on the unofficial market.  Theofficial exchange rate is 5.6 kyat to the dollar.One of the reasons for the economic concerns is the deterioratingpolitical situation.  Confrontations between SLORC and oppositionleader Aung San Suu Kyi and the arrests in May of 262 of Mrs SuuKyi's National League for Democracy members for "questioning" arethe most visible troubles.This incident, together with the death of James Leander Nichol, theformer honorary counsel for Denmark, Finland, Norway andSwitzerland, has prompted some Scandinavian countries and theUnited States to seriously consider economic sanctions againstRangoon.Also contributing to the worries are rumours of the deterioratinghealth of the country's main strongman, Ne Win, according toanalysts in Rangoon.Suu Kyi has been outspoken in calling for the suspension ofoverseas aid and for a boycott of the government's Visit MyanmarYear 1996 campaign.  This has been "psychologically effective"among international communications and is frustrating SLORC, saidone Burmese businessmen."The investment climate is now looking grim," said another observer."People are made to feel insecure by such political confrontation,"said a third.Their dissatisfaction could increase as the cost of livingincreases.  Inflation has almost doubled, form 24 percent last yearto 40 percent at present.As the kyat sinks, the cost of imports rises.  About 80 percent ofBurma's consumer products and construction materials are imported,while exports include beans, pulses, low quality rice and rawmaterials.To generate more revenue for the government, SLORC has quietlyinformed businessmen it has changed the formula for calculating thetax it charges on imports and exports.It has created a new official exchange rate to be used exclusivelyfor calculating import and export duties.  The price of imports andexports is now calculated at 10 kyat per dollar instead of the 5.6kyat official rate it sets for actual transactions.This could have meant a 20-fold leap in tax payments, but SLORC atthe same time slashed the duties payable on imports and exportsfrom 100 percent to 10 percent.  The result is that the duty ratehas doubled, with SLORC hoping its revenues will increase byapproximately 50 percent.The new formula has increased the price of imported consumerproducts by 20-30 percent, according to Sriwat Suwarn, the ThaiMinister Counsellor for Commercial Affairs in Rangoon."Poor people and low-ranking civil servants are suffering most," hesaid.The salaries of government officials range from 1,000 kyat permonth to 2,500 kyat for those at the director general level.Many local businessmen disagree with the new plan but say there isno one to turn to with their complaints.Mr Sriwat predicted SLORC would be forced to scrap the new formulabecause it is unworkable and will cause widespread discontent.The military government is aware of the rising cost of products andearly this year opened a new Government Employees Bank to helpcivil servants.  The bank grants interest-free loans equal to 10times monthly salaries so officials can keep pace with the risingcost of living.SLORC knows the public servants will have difficulties repaying theloans, whose first repayments are due next month, so a 60 percentsalary increase is expected to be announced in the new few weeks,according to one Burmese source."The 60 percent increase is to help them repay the money theyborrow," he said.Unfortunately, traders have already raised their prices as theyknow civil servants have more money to spend as a result of theloans.  Rumours of a new salary hike will only add to theescalating prices, said the source.Thein Tun, the chairman of Pepsi-Cola Products Myanmar Co, placesthe economic blame elsewhere.  He said export problems are causedby port congestion, but this should ease in two years time when newfacilities are in place."There are 47 ships waiting to berth but we cannot export ourcommodities," he said.To ease the port congestion, the government has recently signed anagreement with three Singaporean companies - C & P Holding,Sinmardev International and Myanmar Integrated Port Service - tobuild wharves and other facilities at a new port in Thilawa, about30 kilometres from the capital.Construction is expected to be completed in two years.But Mr Sriwat of the Thai Embassy said this would not be enough.The government should seriously consider measures to attractforeign investment in manufacturing industries as the value-addedproduction would help reduce imports and boost exports.Added investment would break the vicious cycle of devaluation andinflation, but foreign confidence in Burma is at a new low.The recent withdrawal of European brewers Heineken and Carlsberg,and cancellations by a group of Japanese tourists planning to visitBurma are just some examples of the multinational pressure mountingon the junta.Threats from the US to sanction Burma would not have a major impacton the country because it is not a major trade partner of SLORC,said one Burmese trader.But it would cost the jobs of 40,000 Burmese who work in textilefactories serving the American market, he added.Bangkok PostCopyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: Hanoi admits foreigners are scepticalfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Hanoi:In a somewhat refreshing comment, a high level official in Vietnam'sMinistry of Planning and Investment (MPI), vice-minister NguyenNhac, has admitted that despite a decade of opening up, foreigninvestors are still sceptical of the government's policies.This month should see the amendment for the third time of Vietnam'sForeign Investment Law.  It is supposed to focus on simplificationof post-licence procedures, such as land use permits, constructionpermits and taxation, and other challenges which foreign investorsare encountering that, presumably, covers things such as the statetheft of 40 containers of mining equipment from Westralian Sandsearlier this year.Under the revamped investment law investors will get permits forland use and construction in one month.  The government hasfacilitated licence procedures since the merger of a licensing body(State Committee for Cooperation and Investment) and a planningagency (State Planning Committee) last year creating a theoreticalone-stop service at the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI).But investors are still struggling in some areas of investment andin some parts of the country, Nhac said.  "In some areas MPI works,but in others there are still problems.  That's why we'redetermined to perfect our legal framework and improve theenvironment including infrastructure.  In certain areas, investmentis falling, such as in real estate and office/hotel projects.  Butwe see a good trend: over 80% of the projects are manufacturingindustries, which is in line with our needs."MPI is considering more incentives or facilities for industrialestate development.  "We try to provide facilities, the lowest landrents of fees, fewer taxes and longer tax exemptions," he said.What Nhac would do well to consider is a concerted effort toprevent foreign investors from being ripped off at the slightestexcuse.  Over-charging and corruption is one thing.  That can bemanaged.  But orchestrated state theft is quite another.  There isfar too much of both at a time when Vietnam is facing serious regionalcompetition for the investment dollar.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: Following in thou footstepsfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Hanoi:As Westralian Sands executives fled their Ha Tinh ilmenite minewith little more than the shirts on their backs, and leaving behind40 containers of sophisticated mining equipment that wassubsequently stolen by provincial authorities, another Australiancompany was digging in for the long term.Perth based Golden Tiger Resources is one of the few publiclylisted firms in Australia to focus entirely on Vietnam.  "Our company isnow completely set up to become a mining company in Vietnam,"Golden Tiger Resources managing director Rupert Crowe said.  "It isgoing to take a while, but we have confidence that there is a lotto be found there."Two of Golden Tiger's Vietnam's projects are 50-50 joint ventures withthe Canadian mining company Teck Corp.  Golden Tiger has threeexploration programmes under way in Vietnam.  Two are joint ventureswith Teck to search for gold, and the other is a lead-zinc project.With reference to Hanoi's theft of 40 containers of miningequipment, Crowe said, "Obviously, there are concerns about thosesort of problems.  But our relationship with the Vietnamese is verygood." Westralian said much the same thing, right up until thepolice put a padlock on their mine.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: Sponsorship opportunities aboundfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Hanoi:In Indochina, there are great opportunities for sponsorship, but alot of thought must be given to the realities of each countrybefore events are planned, according to Bates Vietnam chairmanDavid Bell.Mr Bell said it is believed that consumer involvement in events isstronger in the developing markets of Indochina because consumershave been isolated from international-style events for a long time."In the case of Vietnam, it's about 20 years.  therefore, virtuallyanything new is exciting," said Mr Bell.However, because of the rigid system of government control in somecountries, it does not mean that all sponsorships willautomatically be a success.In Vietnam, there is a three-station TV Choice in Saigon and Hanoi,and the station calculates its rate on time segments rather thanprogramming."TV cost efficiency is generally good.  However, one of the majorproblems is the inability of the TV Stations to plan theirprogramming in advance and their likelihood to change," said MrBell."Viewers may get used to a foreign entertainment programme being onat a certain time each week, but suddenly it will change and muchviewership is lost."In Burma, only the state-run TV Station gives national coverage andreaches a total audience of around three to four million viewers.A peak time 30-second spot goes for $585, so for high ratingprogrammes, Myanmar TV is very economical.According to Mr Bell, sponsorship is not well developed inCambodia, but it is possible to do it.  He explained that the Thaistation, TV5, is easier to deal with and has better coverage - withspillover into Cambodia.  The Thais are also more clued up aboutsponsorship.  However, it is more expensive for a peak time spot,and no reliable research is used to evaluate performance.All these three countries have marked differences in culturalvalues.  They have different religions and languages, though thereare some common languages such as English, Chinese, French and Thai."The trend for marketing events in these countries is to use locallanguages," said Mr Bell."Nevertheless, some important similarities, like sport, music,entertainment programmes and popular sciences, are such thatsponsorship and event marketing can use them for regionalactivities that can reach similar groups across differing cultures."Though there are a lot of problems we have to face in organisingsponsorships and event marketing in these markets, we should trynew things and have patience with the authorities and otherlogistical problems."MEDIACopyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: Metropole office space readyfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Hanoi:Metropole Centre offers 5,600 sqm of Grade A office space in aprime location in the heart of Hanoi.

Three times it flew its executives and media reps intoVientiane in anticipation of the contract signing.  The firstpostponement was due to only a Lao version of the contract beingavailable.  The Lao's inexplicably gave as their reason for thedelay a requirement for an English version of the contract.The second postponement was due to the arrival in Vientiane ofThailand's Prime Minister which gave Lao government officials amuch better excuse to be unavailable.  The third postponementunderlined the reasons for the first delay.  Vientiane had beenoffered a better deal by M Group, another Thai telecom giant whichhas a high profile in Laotian telecommunications.M Group has won a licence from the Lao government to operate agigantic broad-casting satellite project, L-Star.  The country'sfirst satellite will be put into orbit in December next year andwill cover all of Asia.Shinawatra operates Thaicom satellites of similar coverage andcapacity.  The top bosses at both groups are widely known to havehad a difficult relationship for the past few years.  SuradetMukyangkoon, a highly-placed source in the Lao government said thepostponements were caused merely by a Thai company wishing toparticipate in the telecom projects."The company has approached the government and made attractiveoffers many times while Shinawatra was engaged in negotiating towork out the new deal," said the government source, without namingthe contender.The message to investors is clear.  If negotiating in Indochina ingood faith, you can bet on it that the other side isn't.  If theother side comes up with a litany of excuses to avoid signing acontract, look over your shoulder.  You will probably find thecompetition using every trick in the book to get you out of thepicture.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996LAOS: Urban growth, rural povertyfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Vientiane, AP:Ten years after embracing capitalist-style reforms and cautiouslyopening its doors, this impoverished communist nation in the heartof a dynamic Southeast Asia is beginning to register economicgrowth.But while more urban dwellers can buy cars and television sets,relatively little has been done to fight malnutrition, disease andilliteracy in the valleys and hills where most Laotians live."The growth is not distributed equally.  The challenge this countryis facing is a widening gap between city and country, the rich andthe poor," says Jan Mattsson, head of UN Development Programme inLaos.While sleepy by the standards of most Asian capitals, Vientiane isrevving up.  Its markets are full, new restaurants and hotels areopening, and banks from neighbouring, wildly capitalistic Thailanddominate the city's main Avenue of a Million Elephants.But by World Bank estimates, half of Lao's 4.6 million people stillfall below a poverty line set at $12 of income or goods a month.In rural areas, most are subsistence farmers who cannot participatein a market economy and whose lives are mirrored in the bleakoverall statistics.Average life expectancy is 51 years.  More than one-third of adultsare illiterate.  Electricity reaches only 15 percent of thepopulation.  Nearly half the children under 5 years suffer stuntedgrowth from chronic malnutrition.Officials argue that a rich-poor gap is inevitable when centralisedcontrol is loosened in favour of the free market.  But to this, sayanalysts, is added a deeply rooted disregard for the countryside byVientiane's elite - colonial, royalist or today's mix of Marxistpower brokers,  old families and the newly rich."When you open up the country, the black beast emerges,: saidThongphachanh Sonnasinh, a senior planning official.  "But we aretrying to decentralise the resources we get from outside."At its sixth congress in last March, the 78,000-member CommunistParty focused on the issues of equality and how quickly it shouldembrace the outside world.Underlying the debate are apparent fears that the economic gapcould bring political instability and that wide open doors couldlead to loss of both party control and national sovereignty.Laos is certainly vulnerable.  It is land-locked, heavily dependenton some $200 million in foreign aid each year and surrounded byeconomically aggressive Thailand, Vietnam and China.  It has littleto offer foreign investors but its natural resources - chiefly,minerals, hydroelectric potential and rapidly diminishing forests.The world's least populated communist state admits controlling themore than 500 foreign investors already here is difficult.  Laoswill even be hard pressed to find qualified officials to staff the200-plus annual meetings held by the Association of Southeast AsianNations, which it joins next year."While not completely reversing course, the party appears to havechosen to emphasize the perceived dangers stemming from theopen-door policy, including social problems and a loss of economiccontrol," says Ray Eaton, an Australian businessman with extensivecontacts in Indochina.The liberalising "New Economic Mechanism", introduced in 1986, hasyielded some benefits, and Laos is one of the few least developedcountries to enjoy growth.Despite an inflation rate of nearly 20 percent and flooding thatdisplaced 10 percent of the population, Laos still managed a 7.1percent economic growth rate last year.Since 1988, foreigners have invested $5 billion, three-quarters ofthis going into hydroelectric power projects that economists saycould help pull Laos out of poverty over the decade."We want to grow faster and join the developed community, but ourconditions are not yet ready," said Mr Thongphachanh in aninterview.  "We now take one step forward, one step back.  We areon the platform, but don't know when the launch will take place."Despite such caution and anxiety - voiced by almost every officialin Laos - odds are great the country will inevitably be drawn intothe one of the world's fastest growing regions.All-weather roads linking Laos to China and Vietnam are beingrapidly constructed, while agreement was recently reached to builda second bridge across the Mekong River to Thailand.  Some 43,000tourists visited the country last year, up from almost zero a fewyears earlier.Membership in the seven-nation ASEAN will force Laos to lowertrade, immigration and other barriers.  The country may even entercyberspace: One foreign company is trying to introduce the hithertoillegal Internet.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VEITNAM: Environment loses in race for economic growthfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Bien Hoa:More than two decades after the Americans decimated Vietnam's tropicalforests and farmland with defoliants and bombing, the country'secosystem is under attack again, this time from unharnessedeconomic growth.Flushed with the success of its drive to revamp an economy scarredby years of war and isolation, Vietnam's communist leadership is nowplanning a hell-for-leather dash to become an industrialised nation."If the government doesn't smarten up its act on the environment,it will have a Bangkok or Jakarta on its hands by the end of thecentury," said one Western aid worker.  "Alarm bells are ringingand the government is listening with only half an ear."Vietnam says pollution has not yet become a serious problem.  But acasual observer in the southern boom town of old Saigon, mightdisagree.Long lines of trucks belching filthy emissions clog the mainarteries into the city, where the tinkle of bicycle bells has longbeen drowned out by the roar of cars and motorbikes.Cars are still somewhat of a novelty in what remains one of theworld's poorest nations, but annual sales are expected to growalmost six-fold between now and the end of the century to 60,000units.  That will put a major strain on the country's road system,one of the most primitive in Asia.Down at the Saigon River, which runs through the heart of the city,scavengers rummage through stinking mounds of garbage.  Others pokeabout in the inky water, where huge islands of debris float alongwith dead rats and human faeces.About 30 kilometres to the northeast, the ageing Bien Hoa 1industrial park spews mountains of untreated waste into the DongNai River, a tributary of the river that flows through Saigon andprovides 90 percent of its drinking water.The Dong Nai Paper Company deposits some 3,000 tonnes of untreatedcaustic soda into the Dong Nia River every year.  Hoan, generaldirector of the company, says fishermen have long deserted thestretch of river by his plant."This is an old factory so we don't have a chemical recoverysystem," he said.  "The chemicals just go into the river."However, the government is starting to listen to the warnings ofenvironmentalists, even if it is less than keen to make thefinancial investment needed for prevention.  A law on environmentalprotection was introduced in 1994, and companies like the Dong NaiPaper Company are being told to clean up or close down.The state-run media has also been peppered in recent months witharticles critical of careless exploitation of resources,particularly deforestation and indiscriminate use of fertilisersfor cash crops such as coffee and rubber.The World Wide Fund for Nature says Vietnam's forest cover is just 19percent today, against 43 percent in 1943.   Remote-sensing datashows that at current reduction rates, the natural primary forestswill disappear within 20 years."At this juncture of Vietnam's development it is important not to repeatthe mistakes of many other countries, particularly some of theneighbouring countries," Nay Tuen, the UNDP's Asia-PacificDirector, said at one conference on the environment.Nevertheless, critics say the authorities still show a worryingtendency to brush pollution problems under the carpet.  A recentoil spill in the Mekong Delta, for example, was reported days laterin the local press and officials refused to go further than confirmit had happened.ReutersCopyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: What's in a road ?from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Hanoi:Laos and Vietnam are like two lovers sleeping together, but if they areto grow together the roads linking them must be expanded andupgraded.  The Lao's want the access to Vietnam's deep water ports thatwill wean them away from expensive road transport and Bangkok.  TheVietnamese are looking for tourist and trade links across Laos toThailand.  A number of options have been put forward, some by Laos,others by Vietnam.  There is no doubt as to the benefits should roadlinks between Laos and Vietnam improve.Route 8 which links Paksane with Vinh in Vietnam is the road mostfavoured by the Lao's.  It is the shortest route from Thailand toVietnam, as well as from Vientiane to Vietnam.  The 260 kms of the roadthatis in Vietnam is in reasonable condition while much of the Laotian partis barely usable over mountainous, winding terrain.  The road alsocomplements the continuing construction of Nam Theun 2 and NamTheun Hinboon hydro power plants.  Route 9 connects Mukdahan withSavannakhet in Laos and Vietnam's central port town of Da Nang, some 500kms away.  Again, in Vietnam it is in fairly good shape while in Laos itis in bad need of repair.  There are plans, perhaps dreams would bea better description, to revamp an old railway that runs parallelto Route 9.Both routes are seen as new avenues for the free flow of goodsbetween industrial northeastern Thailand and Vietnam.  Developing themis a priority project for the Asian Development Bank, which is themain advocate of a sub-regional cooperation scheme for sixcountries sharing the Mekong River: China, Vietnam, Laos, Burma,Thailand and Cambodia.Since Vietnam is pressing ahead towards industrialisation orsemi-industrialisation by the year 2000 its leaders are aiming forsocial, political as well as economic results by promoting directforeign investment in what is the poorest part of the country.Laos, for its part, is serious about economic development andraising the people's standard of living.  By 2000 it wants to seeits per capita income up to $500 a year and to introduceelectricity to at least half of Savannakhet province.  It is hopingthat renovating Routes 8 and 9 will give the province the magicalimpetus.The economic boast will, of course, come from he hundreds ofmillions of dollars needed for the upgrade.  Its not just the roadsthat require money.  Besides upgrading and reconstructing roads,software issues like customs and immigration procedures also haveto be worked out.  The ADB is reported to be committed to financialassistance, but disbursement will take time.  But once it doesstart to roll out its millions there will be plenty all round forforeign expertise and investment in the tourist infrastructureassociated with the two projects.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BURMA: The good news and the bad newsfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Rangoon:Stephen Huen, executive director of the UE Myanmar Group, brieflycomments here on the good news and the bad news of doing businessin Myanmar.FIRST, THE GOOD NEW...1.

Before signing it would be wise toconsider the hidden extras.  An apparent `good deal' could be adisaster in the making.Depending on whether one is in the north or the south, measurementcan very greatly.  In the north, most buildings are let on a nettinternal area basis.  In the south, most projects are offered on agross area basis which means that tenants are charged for all thecommon areas.  These could occupy as much as 20% of the floor area.Rents are usually quoted nett of taxes and service charges, thelatter ranging from $3 to $8 psm.  When paying rent, expect also topay the 20% tax that is levied on the landlord's income.  Thatbrings the psm cost to 110% of rental.  Car parks are seldomincluded in a rental.  They could cost an extra $100 psm per month. Even parking a bicycle may not be free.  Where daytimeair-conditioning costs may be included in the service costs, nighttime or holiday air-conditioning will be extra.  The ideal buildingshould have a separate electricity meter for every tenant.Once the extras have been understood and factored into the rental,the lease can be signed.  Then one is faced with fit-out costs of$250 psm for average quality to up to $1,000 psm for a quality thatapproximates the best that Hongkong would have to offer.It is vital that a tenant has clear understanding of what be isgetting.  In Vietnam, the `fair' part of a deal is usually found on theside of the Vietnamese.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996CAMBODIA: Caltex aims for 10%from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Phnom Penh:It's been 21 years since Caltex was last in Cambodia.  The US oilgiant has re-entered the Cambodian market on a wave of confidencestarting with the first American owned retail outlet since 1975.Caltex has plans to invest $20m in Cambodia, opening some 20service stations in Phnom Penh and major provincial cities andbuilding a major oil depot at Sihanoukville."We see great potential here," said Clifton Hon, chairman of theCaltex Group of Companies based in Singapore.He said studies indicated that Cambodia's current11,000-barrel-per-day consumption of petroleum products could morethan quadruple in the coming decade if its economy develops alongthe lines of its neighbours."We're hoping for at least a 10% market share very quickly," saidJohn Raeside, the general manager of Caltex Cambodia Ltd.Five other Caltex stations are now under construction in thecapital and the company is looking at sites to build on inCambodia's second-largest city of Battambang and in the populouseast-central province of Kampong Cham.The service stations will eventually be supplied by the $8mSihanoukville depot which will handle oil from Caltex refineries inSingapore and Thailand.The depot is expected to be completed in mid-1997 and until thenproducts will be shipped up the Mekong River to the port in PhnomPenh.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: Viet Kieu fail to investfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Saigon:Supporting one's relations is one thing, supporting the governmentis another.  That seems to be the rationale behind the reluctanceof Viet Kieu to invest in their old homeland.  Only a trickle ofinvestment has found its way back from overseas Vietnamese, whoremain mostly unconvinced by the tax breaks and preferentialtreatment on offer.  Viet Kieu investment is around half a per centof foreign invested capital.  Since Vietnam launched its reforms in 1988only $130m has come from Viet Kieu.  Of that, only $7m can beattributed to the 1.5 million Vietnamese who settled in America.Hanoi has offered a 20% reduction in taxes and a flat five-percenttax on profit remittances.  Viet Kieu are given the same rights asdomestic firms to lease property and hire staff unlike otherforeign investors.But as one Viet Kieu told BNI, " we may look stupid, but we are notstupid."  Viet Kieu continue to help their relations to the tune of$600m a year in remittances to fund hotels, restaurants and shopsthat remain outside official channels.  Those few who do returnchaff under the country's dual pricing system that makes foreignerspay more than double what locals pay for hotels and airfares.While welcoming their money, officials remain suspicious of peoplewho fled and many Viet Kieu complain of harassment by securityservices.  Despite the repeated pledges by the government that itwants to close the chapter on the past, anxieties about thepolitical and social impact of Viet Kieu remain near the surface.Communist Party chief Do Muoi warned in a recent speech that Saigonwas a hotbed of sabotage plots concocted by "hostile forces," areference to overseas Vietnamese groups opposed to the government.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996CAMBODIA: Cambodia has its own 'bullet' trainfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996'Bullet' trains in Cambodia take on a whole new meaning.  Not onlydo the Khmer Rouge shoot them up, but when the soldiers who aresupposedly guarding the railway lines get bored they let fly with afew bullets, too.  Being a passenger on a Cambodian train is oftena death sentence.  The northwest line from Phnom Penh to Battanbangis subject to attack by the Khmer Rouge which continues to wage aneffective guerilla war along the Thai border.In addition to rebel and bandit attacks the Royal Railways ofCambodia (RRC) face horrendous maintenance problems.  The railwayis 70 years old.  For the past 25 years zero maintenance wasundertaken.  Locomotives are a mixture of Russian, American andChinese machines and often one finds an old wood or coal burnerchugging through the rice paddies.  Passenger transport isnonexistent with freight trains being used to haul largelynonpaying riders.RRC embarked on a major modernization drive earlier this yearfollowing the launch of a new nonstop freight train service betweenPhnom Penh and Sihanoukville.  Travelling time has been halved to 6hours.  That is still double the road time.  RRC has made trackupgrade on this sector its top priority so that speeds of up to 70Kph could be achieved - double the current maximum.The Asian Development Bank has been strongly supportive of RRC'sefforts to modernize, contributing $5m to rehabilitate 16 bridges,repair culverts and embankments and replace wooden sleepers withconcrete ones.  While much work on the southern line remains to bedone, the train now runs on a regular daily basis.  The trackthrough Kampot, halfway between Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, isstill in bad shape despite emergency rehabilitation.  The newfreight service from the coast is being mainly used to movecontainers.  Sihanoukville is virtually an all-container port thesedays and the train provides a cheap and relatively secure means ofgetting cargo to the capital and empty containers back to the port.RRC's director, Pich Kimsreang, would like to see Cambodiaconnected to Thailand in the west and Saigon in the east.  Hecommented, "The railway is very important for the tourism industry. We want to upgrade the existing lines and look into expansion ofthe domestic network and at the same time link Cambodia to theinternational railway network."That, of course, depends on the defeat of the Khmer Rouge.  Onlythen can RRC bury its reputation for 'bullet' train service.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996VIETNAM: Viet cinemas get a boostfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Hanoi:Three years ago Vietnam had about 300 cinemas.  Today, only a handfulare left as owners rushed to convert them into more profitablebars, restaurants and KTV dens.  Hanoi has only two cinemas for its3 million people.  Those cinemas that remain open for businessusually only show Vietnamese films.  These have lost out inpopularity in recent years to imported movies from Hong Kongwatched at home or shown in street-side video bars.  Several USfilms, including the Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie True Lies,have been screened at cinemas over the past year.A cinema renaissance is about to begin with the arrival of anAmerican and a Thai company that hope to renovate several crumblingVietnamese cinemas and build new multiplex centres that will showthe latest US movies.Vision Net International (VietnamI) has signed with state moviedistribution company Faflim to renovate cinemas in Hanoi, Saigonand Da Nang, VietnamI would build 20 multiplex cinemas with up to fourscreens, each with audience capacity of 300.  Fafilm, a state firmknown for its conservatism, will maintain control over the filmsthat are chosen for release.VietnamI joins Kantana Group, a major Thai entertainment company thatintends to invest $40m in Indochina using satellite theatres, orminiplexers as the Americans prefer to say.In Laos, Kantana is operating three conventional cinemas.  It hopesto establish 10 and 30 of its conventional cinemas in Cambodia andVietnam respectively.  This at a time when cinema attendance in Vietnamhasdropped to almost zero and that country's number of operatingconventional cinemas has dropped to only 3.Kantana believes that if conventional cinemas are receivedpositively without too many operational problems, Indochina couldwell see the launch of 300 plus satellite theatres.  Kantana wouldopen them at the rate of 5 a year in the first phase and theremainder in place and operating by 2005.The main thrust of Kantana's cinema strategy in Indochina is tointroduce satellite theatre complexes.  But this first requiresoperators who are familiar with the conventional theatre business.Hence the initial emphasis on conventional cinemas.The problem that Kantana and VietnamI will face is not so much in theattractiveness of its cineplexes which is a given, but on whetherIndochinese can afford them.  Vietnam, the richest and most developed ofthe Indochinese countries, has an average GDP of only $250, risingto $850 in Saigon.  That doesn't leave much for more than one ortwo visits a year to the movies.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BANGKOK: Giant remains cautious on VNfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Bangkok:Thailand's biggest cement maker, Siam Cement (SCC), is in no hurryto establish a cement plant in Vietnam.  It cited inaccurate demand andsupply forecasts for its hesitancy.  This is in spite of it beingin Vietnam for the last four years sheparding investments as diverse asroof tile manufacture and property development.  It has a $10m rooftile venture in Song Be, near Saigon, where it also hopes toproduce sanitaryware.  But its real reason for being in Vietnam remainsthe sale of its cement.SCC was lured to Vietnam by Hanoi's forecast of annual cement demand of20 million tons within the next four years versus annual productionof only 7.2 million tons.  Vietnam's construction boom has attractedforeign investors to plunge into capital intensive cementproduction, with five joint ventures licensed to date and anotherawaiting approval.  That one involves Taiwan's Universal Cement andtwo Vietnamese groups: Ha Tu Limestone Cement Enterprise in QuangNinh province and Vietnam Coal Corp (Vinacoal).  It would invest$240m to produce 1.28 million tons a year of clinker and 1.5million tons of cement.By the end of this year Vietnam will have 25 cement factories.  Althoughattractive to investors, the large scale of such projects and thecomplexity of doing business in Vietnam have driven many to look forgovernment or multilateral guarantees for financing.  Especiallywhen they are all up and running there is a strong possibility of aglut in the market.  Domestic cement production is expected to hitnearly 20 million tons by 1999.  A surplus that would have to berelieved through export or the lowering of operating levels.Annual per capita consumption of cement in Vietnam is less than 100killogrammes compared with Thailand's 420 and South Korea's 1,300.At present SCC exports 80-100 container loads of its Elephant brandcement to Vietnam each month.  It is looking at supplying relatedproduts such as premix concrete, paper pulp and paper-packaging.It is also looking at other ASEAN markets to determine the bestlogistical location for cement production.Location                   Location     Investment Production Start date                                           capacity*Liks Cement         Thua-Thien   65m        0.5m       end of 1996  (Hong Kong)         HueClinfon Group       Haiphong     288.3m     1.4m       early 1997  (Taiwan)Mitsubishi Material Thanh Hoa    347m       2.27m      1998   Nihon Cement  (Japan)Holderbank          Kien Giang   233.8m.    1.8m       1998  (Switzerland)Lucky Cement        Hai Hung     265m       1.8-2m     1999  (Taiwan)Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996LAOS: China cargoes transit Mekongfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Vientiane:With China's southern province of Yunnan, Thailand, Burma and Laosalready part of a cooperative economic quadrangle, the next logicalstep is to use the common waters of the Mekong River to transitcargoes from China through to Thailand.  A private Thai company,Lan Chang International (LCI) intends to do just that.  It hopes toobtain permission from Laos to carry Chinese goods down the Mekongto Thailand's port of Laem Chabang.LCI already transports goods and tourists through the Yunnan WaterTransportation Company.  Its Chinese partner has 49% of thecompany, LCI 41% and the balance split between Burma and Laos.  Themost popular route for tourists is from Chiang Saen in Chiang RaiProvince to Xisuangpanna in Yunnan.A successful test transportation run for cargo along the MekongRiver was first carried out last year, with a vessel carryingapples from China to Thailand through the Chiang Saen port inThailand's Chiang Rai province.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS VIETNAM via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BANGKOK: Neighbours chase investmentfrom BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996Bangkok:BOTH LAOS and Cambodia are keen to get their hands on the regionalinvestment dollar.  A recent seminar in Bangkok saw speaker afterspeaker from Cambodia and Laos plead for more foreign funding oftheir market economies.  If an investment could generate hardcurrency, all the better.For Laos, emphasis is being placed on investments inhydroelectricity, mineral extraction and processing, agribusiness,wood products, export-oriented light manufacturing, small-scaletourism, and financial and transport services.At present there are 230 projects in Laos that have been funded byforeign investors, but only 168 are still operating.  It is still amore encouraging figure than that found in Vietnam where only one thirdof licensed projects are actually established.Cambodia wants foreigners to invest in its still shaky touristindustry which, for many investors, remains the easiest way to gettheir hands on foreign currency.  Where Laos wants to shepardinvestors into the state sector, Cambodia has no preference andappears equally happy when an investor works through his privatecontacts as with the country's national tourism board.Copyright 1996 Business VietnamBack to Headline List WT03-B04-4IA086-000616-B001-97http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it124.html 205.156.212.5 19970122023046 text/html 272567HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:27:49 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:40 GMTContent-length: 272379Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it124.html Sample Issue Copyright BUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNet September 19, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Philippine Stock Exchange as of September 18, 1996 (1303 words) Peso Cross Rates as of September 18, 1996 (277 words) BSP Reference Rates as of September 18, 1996 (396 words) Dear Editor: Correcting facts on ECCs (482 words) Dear Editor: Nuclear test ban (272 words) Dear Editor: Clarification (221 words) Dear Editor: He"ll smoke "em (147 words) Across the Board: Graft watch - 2 (612 words) Upshot: For 30 pieces of silver (872 words) The View from Taft: Effective leadership in a changing environment (630 words) ShopTalk: Hypocalcemia (66 words) ShopTalk: Anti-child labor (78 words) ShopTalk: Another Mexican invasion (138 words) ShopTalk: PLDT statistics (158 words) ShopTalk: Mismanaged (217 words) ShopTalk: Mania for meetings (101 words) ShopTalk: Fine dining (104 words) ShopTalk: Circuitous route (161 words) ShopTalk: Cabbies on shabu (134 words) ShopTalk: Hurdle (213 words) ShopTalk: Feeling important (116 words) One Voice: What is love?

M. La VinaThis refers to today's (Sept. 12) issue of BusinessWorld which ran anitem entitled "DENR sitting on the ECCs of four major energy projects."We would like to correct the impression brought about by theabovementioned title in view of the following facts: 1. The ECC for theSunrise Power Corporation was granted by the DENR just yesterday, Sept.11, 1996. The project involves the construction and operation phases ofa 23-megawatt diesel/bunker power plant to serve the PetrochemicalProducts Corp. of the Pacific, a locator within the PNOC-PetrochemicalProducts Corp. of the Pacific, a locator within the PNOC-PetrochemicalDevelopment Corp. Industrial Estate in Brgy. Batangas II, Mariveles,Bataan. 2. The application of the Tarlac Power Corp. is for theconstruction of a 30 MW bunker fired power plant expansion of theexisting 6.4 MW Heavy Fuel Engine Power Generating Plant in Bgy. Sto.Nino, Tarlac, Tarlac, to augment Tarlac's power needs. The EIA reviewCommittee, on 5 September 1996, forwarded its recommendation to theDENR Central Office and is now being reviewed for  consideration/approvalby the Secretary. 3.The San Pascual Cogeneration Project, which involves the constructionand operation of a combined cycle cogeneration plant at the CaltexBatangas Refinery in San Pascual, Batangas has been recommended by theEMB on 29 July 1996 for issuance of ECC.However, some clarifications with the proponent and the Review Committeeare necessary with respect to land ownership and land classification. 4.The proposal for the Lake Mainit Hydroelectric Project of the Agusan PowerCorp. is a 22-MW Hydroelectric Power Plant in Jabonga, Agusan del Norte.On 6 September 1996, the DENR Central Office returned the papers to theEMB and the EIA Review Committee in view of necessary information on theproject's impact area, considering that the project will involve amongothers the boring of a 3.2 km. tunnel under the Malimono Ridge fromLake Mainit.The Department wishes to clarify that the Environmental ImpactAssessment System involves the submission by the proponents of ImpactStatements which are subjected to the evaluation of an independentgroup of experts. Considering the variability of local conditions andthe extent and variety of projects we receive, it is expected thatinformation in addition to the standard set of documents submitted willbe required as evaluation takes place, leading to the impression thatthe DENR does not act expeditiously.In view of this, we have been trying to fast track evaluation and triedto improve on the system. We are presently revising the EIA guidelineswith the objective of streamlining the procedures.We hope the above explains the issue. ANTONIO G.M.

We now urge the five nuclearpowers (US, UK, Russia, France and China) to sign the treaty as soon asit is opened for signature, and to commit themselves to pursuingcomplete nuclear disarmament.Twenty-five years ago this month, Greenpeace was launched to peacefullyprotest nuclear weapons testing. We view this treaty as a milestone inthe history of the nuclear age and an extraordinary way to mark ouranniversary.We must now channel the overwhelming worldwide momentum toward theComprehensive Test Ban Treaty into efforts to eliminate all nuclearweapons.The Philippines, together with Indonesia, Malaysia and other ASEANcountries helped small countries propel the overwhelming signing of theUN resolution.The overwhelming vote at the United Nations is a moral victory for thepeace movement, for the little people everywhere and for all Asian NGOcolleagues who have campaigned for an end to nuclear testing for thepast 50 years.The treaty can take effect only after the signature and ratification of44 specific countries, including India, which so far refuses to sign.It is, therefore, essential that the US and the four other nuclearpowers ratify the treaty soonest and affirm their commitment never totest nuclear weapons again.On behalf of Greenpeace International, MARIA ATHENA RONQUILLO RegionalEnergy Campaigner, Southeast Asia #49 Matatag St., Bgy.

Robert Z. Barbers'memorandum delineating the responsibilities of the two undersecretariesof the Department of the Interior and Local Government, Messrs. AlvinG. Dans, for Peace and Order, and Manuel R. Sanchez for LocalGovernment.While we are thankful for the exposure, we wish to correct howevercertain inaccuracies in the story, among them the incorrectinterpretation conveyed by the accompanying headline (DILG's Barbersdumps Dans for Sanchez) that Undersecretary Dans was "dumped," or, assuch a term normally implies, "removed," and the reference in the storyto a supposed rift between Dans and Director Serafin Benaldo as theprobable cause of Dans' transfer.To set the record straight, Dans himself was the one who requested thathe be made responsible for the Interior or Peace and Order sector ofthe DILG. This request Secretary Barbers acceded to.Thus, while Dans may have had a policy difference with Benaldo on thefunding of the proposed Community Development Assistance Project, asmentioned in the story, this was not at all the basis for SecretaryBarbers' decision.We hope this will clarify matters.

Khan, Jr.Two columns ago (BW, Sept. 5, 1996) I wrote about a nascent movementthat is designed to mount a constant "graft watch" on those activitiesof government that readily lend themselves to graft and corruption.Former presidents of the Personnel Management Association of thePhilippines (PMAP) and that organization's Society of Fellows are inthe vanguard of this effort.In a meeting yesterday, the former PMAP presidents, led by GregImperial and Wency Malabanan, began to map out doable plans to assistthe Ramos Administration - assuming that it would welcome thisproffered assistance - in sustaining its avowed campaign to go hammerand thongs against officials and employees who betrayed or arebetraying the public trust.Much on the administration's political will and sincerity to ensure thesuccess of this campaign.Despite the fact that the Philippines has probably the toughest lawsagainst public malfeasance and misfeasance, there has been no seriousprosecution under any of those laws. Both the PCGG and the Ombudsmanare proving to be no match to the ingenuity and resourcefulness ofthese criminal civil servants and their co-conspirators in privatebusiness.While hidden wealth may take some doing, unexplained wealth should notbe too difficult to pin down if our so-called "graft-busters" truly settheir minds and hearts to it. A citizens' "Graft Watch" may just lighta fire in their behind and put it in their belly.Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) andSingapore's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) are two ofthe world's most successful anti-corruption agencies, either of whichcan serve as a very useful and workable model for the Philippines.It is not by happenstance that both Hong Kong and Singapore areparagons of a graft-free society where laws are actually enforcedregardless of who gets hurt, and crooked officials are actually putbehind bars. It is interesting to know, for example, that theestablishment of Hong Kong's ICAC in 1974 was precipitated by rampantpolice corruption in the Crown Colony.Dr. Raymond Pomerlau of the San Francisco State University has made acareer of studying graft and corruption in Asia, particularly in Korea,Taiwan, and China. He has identified a number of strategies which hemaintains are imperative in the battle against institutionalizedcorruption in government. Among them: "1. Corrupt activity must betreated seriously and not dressed up in the rhetoric of morality.Political will and an avowed policy of implementation must be secured.Adequate budgetary and independently established human resources mustbe pressed into service. Compre-hensive investigative and innovativelegal measures must be consistent with due process laws. "2.Appropriate administrative infrastructure must be invoked. Fundamentalchanges in public attitudes must be encouraged and an ethical valuesystem must be prompted. Application of punishment for corruptpractices must be exercised swiftly, equitably, and without exception."3. Boundaries between government and business must be distanced.Contributions to political campaigns must be legalized under stringentguidelines. Social encounters must not turn into money-denominatedexchanges. "4. Pursuit of private gain must never be at the expense ofpublic duty. 'Honest graft' and 'dishonest graft' must be calledcorruption. Laws must remain the most important means of combatcorruption. Principles of transparency must be institutionalized in thebody politic. "5. And ,finally, national integrity must be avowed asthe linchpin of the nation's well-being."If the foregoing moral "infrastructure" could be put in place in ourcountry, there will be hope yet that we can prevail in the war againstgraft and corruption.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Upshot: For 30 pieces of silverfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5By Bernardo V. LopezFor a lousy 30 pieces of silver, Okinawan Governor Masahide Ota decidedto retain the controversial US bases. The Japanese government offeredoodles of development aid so that Ota would capitulate and reverse hisstand to get rid of the bases. He could not resist the offer,nullifying an overwhelming plebiscite where about 90 per cent ofOkinawans voted to get rid of the bases. That's the way the cookiecrumbles.Bases withdrawal was replaced with "bases reduction," which reallyamounts to nothing, just a few square meters lopped off to appease theangry crowd. The strong protests of the Okinawans stems from the rapelast year of a school girl by three American GIs, which shocked theconservative Okinawan community.Ota led the protest but gave up when 30 pieces of silver, or a whopping$45.8 million, was laid at his feet. Okinawa is one of the poorestplaces in Japan with average income of half of Tokyo's.The base leases held by about 3,000 landowners mostly opposed to thebase expire in May 1997. This may just make the Ota decision useless.Some of the biggest in the eastern hemisphere since Subic was lost, theOkinawa bases are home to 47,000 American soldiers, the largestconcentration of US troops in the entire Asia Pacific.The strong anti-base feeling among the Japanese is also due to thelesson of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Japan has one of the most resilientanti-nuclear movements in the world. Many feel that Japan may just besucked into a regional nuclear confrontation because of the bases.Ironically, Japan also has one of the most conservative military-mindedrulers who believe an alliance with the American superpower is the keyto peace in the Pacific.Learning a lesson from Filipinos who got rid of the Subic naval basewithout batting an eyelash, the Americans made sure this would nothappen in Japan, a crucial military partner in any confrontation withChina or Russia. The strong bilateral pressure from the Americans onJapan's central government to retain the bases was, of course, realizedby the 30 pieces of silver, which is a drop in the bucket consideringhow much the Americans spend to maintain 47,000 in the base. It is easyfor the US to bribe the 3,000 landowners or use force to renew theleases in the future.A Japanese journalist last year reported on a syndicate involvingFilipinos and Americans which has been secretly exporting Filipinochildren to a neighborhood near the base, reportedly for the R&R ofAmerican GIs.The rape of the Japanese school girl is nothing compared to the masspedophilia that may be happening clandestinely in Okinawa, if theallegation are true.It was a useless trip last week to Subic for Okinawan officials led byMashiko Takara, chair of the Special Committee on Development ofEvacuated Military-Used Lands. They were eager to have their own basewithdrawal in their country. They came to study the base conversionmodel at Subic with Filipino executives giving a lecture on the how-toof base conversion.Okinawa holds 40 of the 100 US bases scattered throughout Japan,including its version of Clark Field, the Kadena Air Force Base. Overand above the American bases, Japan has the most powerful and modernair force in the entire Pacific, which has forced China to modernizeits air force in response.Ninety per cent of the escalation of strategic weapons in the Pacificis due to an overly superior Japanese air force with the Americansbenefiting in terms of billions of dollars worth of sale of the mostsophisticated airplanes.Japan is the biggest arms spender by far in the entire Pacific,believing that its future as a world economic power depends on it. Someobservers believe however this will cause its downfall.Ironically, this thinking in the military and government centerscontrasts greatly with the essential anti-military and anti-nuclearmentality of the Japanese public due to the trauma of World War II. Theproblem is, the public has very little clout in the decisions upstairsin spite of the effective mass sit-down strikes against the Yokosukanaval base where the US "neither confirms or denies" the presence ofnuclear weapons.With the loss of Subic, the strategic value of the Japanese US baseshas tripled as there is a gap between the bases in Diego Garcia in theIndian Ocean (now participating actively in attacks against Iraq) andGuam and the Japanese bases. Geopolitics dictate that the Americanskeep the Chinese sleeping giant at bay at intervals across its massivecoastal area. The geopolitical wisdom of containing a rival giant is,however, questionable.The Americans and the Japanese are the hawks of the Pacific who willcause the next major confrontation because of their massive escalationof weaponry. The chances of a bases withdrawal in Japan is practicallynil if the Japanese bureaucrats keep their medieval shogun mentalitycontrary to the will of the public, which is the only only force thatcan stop them.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996The View from Taft: Effective leadership in a changing environmentfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4By John MallirisIn today's complex business environment - increasing globalcompetition, deregulation, political and economic protectionism - thecompanies which implement continuous changes have competitive advantagefor survival.Leadership is the most critical factor to implement such changes andthe driving force that causes an organization to stretch beyond itsnormal range of performance.The behavioral characteristics of a leader may be broadly categorizedinto (1) charismatic and (2) instrumental.The elements of charismatic behavior are knowledge, vision and energy.A leader possessing these qualities is able to elicit employee supportand commitment. He is able to direct individual objectives, values,aspirations and aggressiveness toward organizational benefits.The elements of instrumental behavior are structuring, controlling andappraisal. A leader is said to have these qualities if he is able todefine standards, clarify degree of authority and responsibility,establish systems and processes to monitor behavior and results,prescribe corrective actions and give meritorious rewards.The combination of charismatic and instrumental behavioralcharacteristics comprises effective leadership, which is necessary toget meaningful changes and the best results.The combination of these leadership characteristics is manifested in anorganization in its (1) dynamism, (2) personal interaction, (3)integration of individual and group goals, and (4) structural fluidity.DynamismIn contrast to traditional management, leadership does not alwayscreate consistency. It produces movement, action and change tough: a) ahigh degree of directional intensity - new objectives, a vision for thefuture and the commitment of people to power and purpose; b) alignmentand communication - direction to achieve the vision; and c) motivation- adoption of new values and discarding of old habits.Personal InteractionA successful organization calls for the leader's personal participationand interaction with people. It means asking the right people the rightquestions and listening to their opinions as well as to facts. Forexample, instead of simply relying on statistics in submitted reports,a leader can directly ask a service engineer to determine the timespent in the field against the time spent in the office.Integration of Individual and Group GoalsEffective leaders give meaning to the people in their organization by:a) making them understand what a particular vision means to them; b)assisting individuals across the organization to find a greater purposein their working environment; c) empowering people to become involvedin the change effort and be responsible for getting extraordinaryresults; d) adopting a certain style so others can be comfortable withthem.Structure FluidityEffective leadership is also dependent on the leader's ability todevelop high-level management groups or leadership teams whose membersinteract principally to share information and make decisions. Thisrelieves the leader of part of his work load and at the same timeprovides an excellent cross-disciplinary training ground for futurechief operating officers.Many organizations have such management teams, composed of a collectionof senior level managers who more or less function together.Unfortunately, a member occasionally throws his weight around toconceal his inefficiencies.High-performance organizations have "real" leadership teams withmembers who are equally committed to a common purpose or goal, whotrust one another, and who hold themselves mutually accountable fordecision making.In summary, an effective leader should be able to harness both hischarismatic and instrumental characteristics to steer his organizationto success in these times of rapid environmental changes.(The author is the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of First SubicHoldings Inc., Director of Universal Electronics, Inc., Board member ofSt. Luke's Medical Center, and faculty member of the De La SalleUniversity Graduate School of Business.)Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996ShopTalk: Hypocalcemiafrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4Sen.

Negotiated by then NationalFood and Agriculture Council chief Domingo F. Panganiban in the early'70s, the grants were supposed to be bidded out to fertilizer companieswhich would then sell them to end-users, paying the government the costof the chemical plus a margin. When Mr. Panganiban left governmentservice with the entry of the Aquino regime in 1987, he said he turnedover about P780 million in proceeds from the fertilizer grants. Duringthe Aquino regime, the bidding process was junked and the NationalAgriculture and Fisheries Council, the grant's implementing agency,opted to award the grant to basically three groups. As of lastaccounting, these groups owe the government about P300 million. Of thisP300 million, about P120 million is owed by Sanduguan, a farmers'organization. Canada is apparently disturbed by these developments andis now considering coursing its fertilizer grants through privatefertilizer companies. Petty graft it can live with, but not themagnitude of corruption in the handling of the grant. Tokyo has alsoexpressed concern and has required projects to benefit from its grantto get its prior approval.

GarchitorenaShe is small for her age and not given to much talk, at least not infront of strangers: Rhona Mahilum, the 8-year-old girl who went intotheir burning hut time and again in order to bring out her littlesiblings. Her shoulders are hunched up as a result of the scarring ofthe tissues from her neck, contracting the connecting muscles.Her mother is a small woman and just as quiet.She had to walk 15 kilometers carrying Rhona over her shoulders like alamb in order to avoid further destroying the burned flesh on her back.She ignored her husband's command to just bury the child, whom hethought was already dead. She walked thus to the nearest hospital toseek treatment for her little girl.Two small women. Two great heroines.What is it that made them do what they did? What drove Rhona toovercome her natural instinct for self-preservation and to brave theheat of the flames in order to save her brothers and sisters? How couldshe ignore the agony of her burning back? Whence came that courage comein one so young?Perhaps the maternal instinct of the mother was more understandable.She refused to give up hope. She refused to give up her child. Rhona,on the other hand, risked her own life. Not once but four times. Andshe's only eight years old.When I went to visit Rhona at the Ospital ng Maynila, tworepresentatives from the Readers' Digest happened to be there, too. Oneof them asked me where I thought that act of courage of Rhona camefrom. I could only say that it must have been her great love for herbrothers and sisters that made her do it.I believe that God has given each of us the capacity to love. That lovemanifests itself in different ways in our different relationships inlife. But, perhaps, some have been given a greater capacity thanothers. Rhona certainly had it in large measure. As did her mother.I can only imagine that the mother must have shown Rhona and the familya quality of quiet love and caring that was deeply impressed in thelittle girl's mind and heart.Perhaps she was reflecting that same love and concern when she forgotherself and her own safety totally and completely in order to save thelives of her loved ones.It has been said that "a greater love than this no man has, that he laydown his life for another."Rhona has shown us that pure and selfless love such as that Christshowed us still exists in this world.Her example should be held up for all Filipinos, indeed for allmankind, to see and appreciate so that we do not lose hope for ournature. Her example should silence the cynics who insist that lookingout for number one is the only valid lifestyle for our modern day.Rhona was to have been operated on this week to remove the scar tissueand to release the muscles that had contracted along her neck andshoulders. After a few more months to ensure her good health, she willbe released from the hospital where she has been staying with hermother and two younger sisters.The trust fund that Mayor Alfredo Lim of Manila started has grown toabout P1.7 million. Its earnings are intended to ensure the health andeducation of the children.They are fortunate that such a Trust Fund has been set up. All toooften, we see similar donations that are simply frittered away by afamily that is not used to handling and managing such large amounts offunds.There is, of course, the concern that Rhona may become spoiled by allthe attention and all the largesse that is being heaped upon her. Ithas also been reported that a movie is being planned on her act ofgreat daring and heroism and selflessness.We can only pray that her mother will have the character and thecourage to see to it that she remains a loving and simple child.Rhona's act of great love reaffirms our humanity. She has shown us whatall of us are capable of. She has shown us how to be heroes. She hasshown us the true meaning of love.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996My Turn: Caught in traffic on a rainy nightfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4By Daniel F. DeLongIt's probably a matter of sheer, stupid luck. When it rains, somehow Imanage to find reasons not to go out.But the man who coined the phrase, "It's better to be lucky than good,"didn't have driving in the rain here in Metro Manila on his mind whenhe uttered those words.Because, as we all know, luck has a tendency to run out.I had to go to the New World Hotel in Makati on a recent afternoon fora story. It turned out there wasn't a story.On the way home, it began to rain. I knew I was in trouble sitting atthe corner of Ayala Avenue and EDSA, waiting to turn left so I couldreturn to New Manila.To begin with, it took the light nearly 10 minutes to switch to green.We all moved like greyhounds through the pounding rain, for one block.From Buendia to the house, a distance of 10 kilometers, it took another96 minutes.By now, the tape I was listening to had already finished one side andit was running to the conclusion so that the machine could flip it tothe other side.The cars were moving like something out of a nightmare. Slow, slowerand S-L-O-W-E-S-T. Finally, no movement at all.I had the air conditioner turned on so that I didn't have to breathethe horrible exhaust fumes coming from the buses to the right thatseemed intent on blocking progress for all of mankind. The windows werebeginning to steam up."We're all blind!" I thought. "How can anyone see anything?" So Irolled each one down and back again to improve vision. It still lookedthe same as it did before.About 20 minutes later I cleared up the windows again and I happened tolook off to the left at a bunch of signboards that were grouped tightlytogether.Two of the advertisements were for shoes. "Yes," I thought to myself,"walking would probably be better - even in this confounded rain thatdoesn't seem to want to stop."The bottom signboard was from a major distributor of condoms."That board should have been there 20 years ago," I mumbled to no one."If it had, perhaps traffic tonight would be better."Despite the fact that we were moving, if you want to call it that, soslowly that I was passed three times by the same vendor - yes, streetvendors walking on EDSA - I continually found myself in between lanes.I try as much as possible to pick a lane on the road and stay therethroughout my trip. Sometimes, however, what we want and what we do arenot the same things.A dear friend of mine has a fantasy about driving here. He would liketo build a car with reinforced steel that could absorb impact, and thendriving with a photographer and his insurance man, go out on the roadsand operate his motor vehicle like they do in the US.In case you don't know, a man's place in a lane is something thatcannot be violated. If, for some strange reason it is, there will betrouble.My friend theorizes that he would be a one-man teaching crew, showingthe locals how it is supposed to be done.So what would life be without fantasies?On EDSA, it's the buses. They ruin it for everyone. Why doesn't thegovernment take control? It would be better to put up with inefficiencythan to suffer the current conditions.Also to blame is Henry Sy, Sr. While he keeps building malls, he isn'tdoing it fast enough for the population to spread out.Once I asked him why doesn't he build more roads so that the people canget to his malls to spend their money faster?He simply smiled, shrugged his shoulders and simply moved on.As I approached Megamall, I noted that the beginning of the end iscoming for the Ortigas Center, which is up in arms over a 300% increasein property tax valuation."What," I asked my steering wheel, "will happen when they build out allof the open space and there is nowhere to park a car?"Already there is no water there because all the high-rise buildingshave sucked the precious commodity out of the ground.Why do the developers here always worry about the most important thingsafter the damage has been done?On Ortigas itself, heading through Greenhills, the problem is nowoversized trucks.

JaraGrand International Airways, Inc. (GrandAir) is gearing up to beginflights to the United States by February next year notwithstanding theopposition lodged by flag-carrier Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL).Eliseo Hizon, executive assistant to GrandAir's president and chiefexecutive officer, said in an interview that the airline has alreadysecured a permit from the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and thatthey are just preparing several requirements."We have the permission from the US this December but probably it maynot push through because we have to meet certain requirements from theFAA. We are working on those right now," Mr. Hizon said.These requirements include the company's business plan, aviation safetydocuments, and an environmental impact study, among others.For its initial US operations, GrandAir plans to cover theManila-Honolulu-Los Angeles route with daily flights.Mr. Hizon also said that once they begin their US services, they willbe looking at possible tie-ups with US carriers. "Not strategicalliances, not yet. Maybe we will go for interline agreements which aresimilar to code sharing and other forms of bilateral agreements. Thiswill all be possible as early as February 1997 as soon as we completeour requirements."Mr. Hizon said their permit for US flights, also known as thetranspacific route, was issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)"about two or three months ago."Officials of CAB could not be reached for confirmation as of press time.Last June, PAL wrote a letter to the CAB asserting that GrandAir has noright to fly more international routes until it receives a Certificateof Public Convenience and Safety (CPCS).The CPCS, issued by the government, serves as a permanent license foroperating in a service-oriented industry like aviation.GrandAir is currently running under a temporary operating permit.PAL also said in its letter that GrandAir should first secure fromgovernment an official designation as the country's second nationalcarrier.The Office of the President, which has to power to make suchdesignations, has yet to act on CAB's recommendation that GrandAir benamed a national carrier.Earlier, GrandAir chief operating officer Angelo V. Balverde stressedtheir planned international routes will cover the Philippine's airtraffic slots left unserviced by PAL. On the other hand, PAL has filedan application before the CAB seeking to cover all of the country'sentitlements to the US under the RP-US Air Services Agreement.GrandAir's current international operations consists of thrice a weekManila-Hong Kong-Manila and Subic-Hong Kong-Subic flights.Grand Air was granted a temporary operating permit to cover domesticroutes in December 1994 and October last year for internationaldestinations. Using a Boeing 737 aircraft, Grand Air's firstinternational flight bound for Hong Kong took off last April 3.CAB recently approved GrandAir's application for Manila-Seoul-Manilaand Manila-Taipei-Manila flights. The airline is preparing to startcovering these routes before the end of the year.The Panlilio-owned Grand Air, which has proven to be PAL's toughestcompetitor since it started operations in March 1995, is also planningflights to other Asian countries like Japan and Singapore which areconsidered among the most lucrative routes.In the domestic front, Grand Air currently serves flights to Cebu,Davao, Tacloban and Cagayan de Oro with planned expansions to Iloilo,Puerto Princesa, Kalibo, General Santos and Bacolod.In another development, GrandAir has opposed the application of AirPhilippines Corp. for international flights, asserting the company isfinancially and technically unfit for such services.In a letter filed before the CAB last week, GrandAir, through its legalcounsel Roberto Rafael Lucila said, "The applicant is not fit andqualified to engage in the business of international scheduled airtransportation services.""The articles of incorporation of Air Philippines, Inc. provides thatthe authorized capital stock of the corporation is P16 million - Hence,this application fails to state the legal and financial fitness of theapplicant," the letter said.The Panlilio-owned GrandAir, currently the only airline aside fromPhilippine Airlines operating international flights, also cited therecent grounding of Air Philippines as a sign of technical incompetence."Applicant does not possess the technical capability and fitness toundertake the services applied for as its present domestic serviceshave been reportedly suspended by the Air Transportation (ATO)recently, on the grounds of aviation safety requirements," Mr. Lucilasaid.The Subic-based Air Philippines was grounded by the ATO early thismonth following a series of minor landing accidents. The ATO laterdeclared the airline unsafe. Upon compliance with requirements, ATOlifted the suspension and allowed the airline to continue its services.Air Philippines has resumed operations but it will still be undergovernment observation for a period of 30 days.GrandAir further said Air Philippines failed to establish in itsapplication the need for a third international carrier for the countryas indicated in Executive Order No. 219.Under EO 109, the law liberalizing the air transport industry, twointernational carriers shall be designated as official carriers.Additional airlines will only be designated if the first two fail tomeet passenger demand and are unable to use all the country's flightentitlements under Air Service Agreements (ASA) with other countries."The application does not allege the urgent need for a newinternational air carrier along the routes already being serviced orapplied for by GrandAir and Philippine Airlines. Specifically,applicant failed to allege that the present designated carriers do notservice the total frequency entitlements of the Philippines under ASAsor similar arrangement," Mr. Lucila said.Air Philippines is majority-owned by plastics magnate WilliamGatchalian and in part by three foreign groups. It currently flies toSubic, Puerto Princesa, Davao, Tacloban, and Cagayan de Oro. It plansto operate flights to the United States and countries within the AsiaPacific region.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Philippine Ports Authority calls for selective liberalizationfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 18Relaxing the rules on interisland shipping to allow the participationof foreign-owned vessels should be implemented on a regional basis, thePhilippine Ports Authority (PPA) said.In a letter, PPA general manager Carlos Agustin told the MaritimeIndustry Authority (Marina) that lifting the cabotage law should bedone in stages since a unilateral declaration will only favor foreignshipping lines to the disadvantage of the local sector.A memorandum of agreement (MOA) is pending approval by officials of theMarina and the Bureau of Customs (BoC). It will allow non-Filipinos toengage in coastwise trade which is being vigorously opposed by localshipowners.The PPA said that before implementing the proposal, both offices shouldconduct intensive consultations with industry experts to determine itsconstitutionality.A similar appeal was made by the Domestic Shipping Association whichasked the Marina and the BoC to secure the official opinion of theDepartment of Justice. However, the two are still inclined to go aheadwith the MOA, saying they have direct jurisdiction.The PPA said a reciprocity clause wherein the same arrangement can alsobe availed of by Filipino firms should be explored by the two agencies,adding that not all ports in the country may be able to meet therequirements of prospective clients.Local firms have raised apprehensions that the move will cut them outof the competition since foreign vessels can charge domestic rateswithout paying the same taxes required from domestic ships.Currently, foreign ships can only pick up and unload cargoes at theManila International Container Terminal and South Harbor. This setup,officials said, slows down the flow of cargo traffic and stifles thegrowth of exporters.Based on the MOA, foreign vessels that will engage in coastwise tradewill have to secure two clearances, one from the BoC and another fromthe Marina. A vessel authorized to unload import cargoes at a localport will be allowed to pick up export cargoes destined for thevessel's port of call abroad or to another local port.Officials said the MOA will merely provide an alternative since thefinal choice will depend on shippers.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Financing woes plague bus firmsfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 18By Conrad M. CarinoAre bus companies becoming unattractive to banks and financingcompanies? Industry sources said the bus industry, already hurting frommultiple factors, is finding it difficult to finance the acquisition ofnew buses. Likewise, creditors are having a hard time collecting loansfrom bus companies.Alex Yague, president of the Provincial Bus Operators Association ofthe Philippines (PBOAP) said banks are becoming very selective infinancing bus acquisitions since many companies are already hurting."Tingnan mo, ang daming mga bulok na bus na tumatakbo sa (Look around,there are a lot of dilapidated buses plying) Metro Manila," he declared.Other bus companies said the industry is hurting from factors such asthe recent wage increases, diesel price hikes and the unified vehiclereduction program (UVRP).They said that unlike jeepney operators, bus companies employ officestaff and a regular maintenance work force which are paid fixed wages.In addition, prices of spare parts and new buses are no longer cheap. A12-meter air-conditioned bus now costs around P4 million, while an11-meter air-conditioned unit sells at around P2.7 million.Financing companies are willing to shoulder up to 70% of theacquisition cost with an interest rate of around 18% to 20%. The mostacceptable collateral for bus acquisitions is real estate. The maximumperiod for installment payments is three years.Unlike automobile buyers, bus companies are not offered ofzero-interest loans, low downpayment and easy installment plans."Hindi iyan uso sa industriya (that is not practiced in the industry),"a source who requested anonymity told BusinessWorld.A check with SOH Technologies Corp., one of the top three manufacturersof brake drums for heavy vehicles, also points to hard times for thebus industry. Company president Leon Ang said this is evidenced by theslow cash collections from his customers.Most maintenance parts of buses are locally fabricated. These includebrake drums, brake shoes, suspension leafs, suspension mountings andair cleaners.Of the problems confronting the bus industry, the UVRP may have themost telling effect. Metro Manila bus operators contend that the schemehas resulted to an average loss of almost P2,000 per vehicle per day.On the other hand, provincial bus operators say they incur a loss of upto P5,000 per vehicle per day because their units cannot exit nor enterMetro Manila-based terminals.Mr. Yague said losses of bus companies from the UVRP are expected to bereduced since the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) agreed toissue exemption stickers to 10% of bus operators' fleets. The stickersare yet to be issued to the bus operators.If worse comes to worse, bus companies will start shutting down and thebig ones are not exempted. Mr. Yague said one bus company with morethan 250 units stopped operations early this year due to bankruptcy.He said the industry hopes no other bus company will suffer this fatesince this will make banks become more wary in providing loans.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Share prices dip on profit takingfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 12By Rosemarie V. FranciscoProfit takers took advantage of the correction in the US blue chipsmarker Dow Jones Industrials last Tuesday to collect their gains in thelocal market after its two-day uptrend."People took it as a cue to harvest profits," said Monique Lecaros,analyst of Armstrong Securities, Inc.The composite index fell 11.13 points, or 0.34%, to 3,248.59. Themarket was weak throughout the session, sagging 25.66 points at themost to 3,234.06 during intraday trades.Value turnover narrowed 19.94% to P2.49 billion. If the block salestotalling P373.87 million were taken out, peso volume will amount toP2.11 billion, still within the P2 billion mark. This reflects somelevel of foreign participation in the market.Volume of shares eased 9.49% to 18.51 billion. Of the total 171 issuestraded, decliners routed advancers, 66 to 37, while 68 were unchanged.The local market simply mirrored the movement in the Dow Jones. The USmarket closed marginally lower 0.37 point to 5,888.83 last Tuesday dueto a news report which stated that eight out of 12 regional FederalBank presidents have asked for an increase of at least 0.25 percentagepoint in the discount rate on direct loans to banks. The US bond marketalso reacted as the long bond ended weaker.Investors took this as a sign that the US Federal Reserve is keen onincreasing interest rates during its Sept. 24 meeting even if economicdata released last week showed that the growth of the US economy isstill manageable and will not put pressure on inflation.However, Ms. Lecaros noted that the Dow Jones did not correctsignificantly. "It was merely a hangover after the party," she said.The Dow Jones posted record highs for two consecutive days earlier thisweek. Previously, analysts said the local market will follow the trendset by the Dow Jones and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT)listed in New York. But yesterday, the market ignored the uptick inPLDT of $0.625 to $64.25 and focused instead on the US market's keyindicator. Local PLDT shares slipped 1.18% to P1,675.Ms. Lecaros believes the local market's slide yesterday was expectedand that investors just used the Dow Jones' correction as a reason toheed cash calls. "This market has risen too much in the past two days.The rise is so unsettling," she said. Thus, the trading resultsyesterday was partly due to a technical correction, negative sentimentsafter the Dow Jones slide, and profit taking, she added.The Phisix gained 66.04 points in the past two days after weeks ofsluggish trades.While the bullish sentiments of foreign fund managers towards thecountry is not waning, they are taking a cautious view of Asian marketsgiven the possible hike in US interest rates.One sector at a disadvantage is the property stocks. "The strategy offoreign fund managers is to stay out of the property stocks until theuncertainty in the US market is not erased," Ms. Lecaros said. Propertyissues are sensitive to the movement in interest rates. When the USimplements a rate hike, local monetary authorities will have to adjustlocal interest rates accordingly to prevent foreign funds from flowingout of the country.In turn, high interest rates do not augur well for property companiesas the cost of housing loans will become too pricey for consumers."Things will continue to be uncertain until the 24th... As long asthere are uncertainties in interest rates, we will continue to be justpaced by the Dow Jones," Ms. Lecaros said.Trades will remain cautious.

Corp. was responsible for the death of suchvarieties as lapu-lapu, banak and samaral. This plant, which is thecountry's biggest coal-fired thermal power plant, forms part of the15-year power development program of the National Power Corp. (Napocor).The source said plant workers had repaired the breach, which measuredfive meters long and five m. deep, after gathering the dead fish. Oneworker who cooked some of the lapu-lapu refrained from eating more,saying the meat tasted "like mud."Plant station manager George Markin declined to be interviewed, sayinghe was not in a position to answer inquiries on the accident.BusinessWorld called offices of the Department of Environment andNatural Resources and Hopewell in Manila but their officers were allattending meetings. One Napocor official, who requested anonymity,tried to distance Napocor from this issue, saying Hopewell's Pagbilaoplant had begun operations only last June and that Napocor was supposedto only monitor the plant's operations.But the same plant's test run in September last year had reportedlyresulted in a fishkill in the area. The Quezon provincial board, whichthen attributed the fishkill to the plant's allegedly indiscriminatedumping of toxic waste in nearby waters, passed a resolution two monthslater threatening to close down the plant should inquiries prove theplant's adverse impact on the environment.Plant officials had then denied responsibility for the reportedfishkill, saying the plant observed environment laws. One officialsaid, for instance, the plant's environment compliance certificateallowed Hopewell to convert the affected mangrove into an ash lagoon.The same official said a tripartite monitoring group meets every monthto scrutinize the plant's activities, including those related toanti-pollution efforts. But BusinessWorld discovered the group, whichused to meet at the Pagbilao town hall, has not convened for severalmonths now.Pagbilao councilor Jimmy Zaporteza, former chairman of themultisectoral Buklod Pagbilao which opposes the plant, noted only MayorConrado de Rama represented the municipal government in the monitoringgroup.

CarlosAnticipating continued strength in investors' appetite for thecountry's new uncollateralized bonds, a global investment bank hasurged government to invest in New Money Bonds (NMB), said to behigher-yielding than local bonds.In a recently released paper, New York-based Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc.said it foresees yield from the Philippines' Brady bond swap to be atpar with the Eurobonds issued by the National Power Corp. (Napocor)."Assuming the Philippines succeeds in completing its bond exchange,there should be a convergence between yields on the remaining Bradybonds and the (existing) sovereign-rated euro issues," Bear Stearnssaid.Earlier, Napocor issued about $100-million Eurobonds to bankroll itsinfrastructure projects. The bonds were guaranteed by the NationalGovernment.Eurobonds are corporate or government-denominated bonds sold in acurrency other than the national currency of the issuer.The US investment bank said investors should be offered to buy NMBswhich is seen to have a higher cash flow yield than Napocor at 9% in2002. On the other hand, it admitted NMBs have "shorter average life."An NMB is a type of debt instrument issued by government in the 80s togenerate additional funding for government projects.Early this month, government announced it will retire $1.9 billion ofits Brady bonds by swapping them with new debt.Finance Secretary Roberto F. de Ocampo said government plans to issueat least $200 million of 20-year fixed-rate and $200 million of 15-yearfloating-rate bonds.The Philippines has set a 7% US Treasury benchmark rate to be used indetermining the price and yields of the bond swaps, arranger J.P.Morgan yesterday said.The rate gives the 2017 bond exchange a yield of 8.3% on a price of$823.43 per $1,000 of principal. The 2018 exchange bond yield is also8.3% on a price of $827.18 per $1,000 principal amount. The minimumfixed rate bond exchange yield is 9.25%.The bond swap was developed based on a model set by Mexico, the firstto use the so-called Brady plan to restructure defaulted commercialdebt in 1989. Mexico was also the first to swap Bradys for new bonds.The scheme removes US Treasuries as collateral and allows yield-hungryinvestors to obtain straight exposure to the economy and theirhigh-yielding assets.International credit rating agencies Duff & Phelps and Standard &Poor's have assigned a "BB" rating to the bonds, to be issued inexchange for the Brady Par Bonds, Series A and B.Government is offering 15-year floating rate bonds and 20-year fixedrate bonds, with interest yields to be fixed on September 18.

This increased toP724 billion in 1995 and P777 billion in 1996. Projected domestic debtfor 1997 is P820 billion.Foreign debt in 1994 was P397 billion, but dipped to P390 billion in1995 and P377 billion in 1996. It is expected to further decrease toP368 billion next year.Budget assistant secretary Narcisa Santos told a Senate budget hearingthe government intends to bridge the gap between the growth of foreignloans and domestic borrowings."Local borrowings (by the government) really crowd out the privatesector for available credit," she said.Mr. Enriquez said foreign borrowings would be more beneficial to thecountry since these have lower interest rates.Next year, interest payment on the total foreign loans is pegged atP74.2 billion while principal amortization is placed at P43.5 billion.Total borrowings for 1997 are placed at P1.18 trillion composed of P820billion of domestic loans and P377 billion of foreign borrowings.Mr. Enriquez said the country will have to continue its dependence onborrowings despite the existence of the build-operate-transfer (BOT)scheme meant to increase private sector participation in economicbuilding.He said the BOT "can only go so far" and could not be solely relied onby the government. "We need to unify everything, borrowings, savingsand BOT."He added there's no need to worry about the balance of payments sincethe government has a "good standing" with almost P5 billion.He pointed out the public and legislators need not worry about thegovernment's possible abuse of getting loans since there is a law whichlimits foreign borrowings to $10 billion at any given time.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996FOREX MARKETfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1The peso strengthened 1.2 centavos, averaging P26.232 to $1 fromP26.244.

Thebell-weather 91-day Treasury bill rate also declined from 13.2% lastMay to 11.3% in yesterday's auction."These developments will help boost the country's growth performance tothe higher range of 7% to 7.5% during the year," he added.Although the Finance chief sees "an acceleration of infrastructurespending" during the rest of the year, he said this is not expected toerode the surplus.The government is eyeing a zero CPSD for next year.Huge CPSD had handicapped the Philippine economy for almost two decadesdue to the dismal performance of GOCCs and GFIs, which in the past havetransferred liabilities to the National Government.Earlier, Mr. de Ocampo warned the country faces a P14-billion deficitin its CPSFP next year if Congress fails to pass the controversialComprehensive Tax Reform Package (CTRP).He said there's that danger considering no firm alternatives have beenidentified on where the government should source the P13.6 billion itexpects to forgo without the CTRP.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Malacanang to "force" version of "sin" taxesfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1By Ronald F.

And, eventually, it will win.A high-ranking leader of the House of Representatives, who requestednot to be named, told BusinessWorld Malacanang is not willing to settlefor anything less than what was agreed on in a recentLegislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC).In his weekly press conference yesterday, President Ramos expressedoptimism the Senate will fine-tune Malacanang's version of theComprehensive Tax Reform Package (CTRP) when it starts to tackle theexcise portion passed last week by the House of Representatives.Mr. Ramos said he is banking on the Senate to come up with a betterversion of the excise tax system."The Senate still has to put out its own version... They (Senate)cannot go ahead of the House when it comes to tax or revenueappropriation measures. But now that they have it, then they can go onputting their own revisions," Mr. Ramos said.The Ramos government is pushing for a specific tax scheme for "sinproducts" under the excise tax portion of the CTRP, which is expectedto generate an annual revenue collection of P13 billion. The Budgetdepartment has incorporated this projected figure in its 1997 budget.Should the Senate pass a version different from that of Malacanang, Mr.Ramos said he will remind both Chambers of their promise to harmonizetheir versions during the bicameral conference committee.Malacanang is counting on the promises made by Senate ways and meanscommittee chairman Juan Ponce Enrile and finance committee chiefErnesto Maceda to pass the version that will generate the most revenues.LEDAC members earlier agreed to support an outright shift to specifictax from the present ad valorem tax on both beer and cigarettes.However, the Lower House "selectively" followed the agreement. Itapproved a shift to specific tax on beer products while it approved a"de facto" ad valorem tax on cigarettes.This alarmed the Palace, the source said. If the Senate does notdeliver, the Executive is left with no recourse but to "force its hand"in the bicameral conference committee, the House source said. "It willstrongly lobby for the passage of a specific tax on all sin products...Eventually, the President's word will prevail," he said.The source referred to a letter of Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampoto the House leadership dated May 29, a copy of which was obtained byBusinessWorld, to bolster his claims. He said Mr. de Ocampo asked theHouse Majority Leader, Isabela Rep. Rodolfo Albano, to help in thepassage of a version as close as possible to the Finance department'sproposal and a formula "that the President can accept."The DoF-backed formula calls for a specific tax as the basis forcomputing and assessing tax liability. However, a quarterly computationof tax liability on an ad valorem basis by the Bureau of InternalRevenue via market sampling at the retail level will also beundertaken. Should the ad valorem computation result in a higher taxtake for the government, the difference would be treated as anadditional tax liability.The source quoted the Finance official as saying, "We must endeavor topass a version that adheres as closely as possible to the main elementsof the (DoF formula) and that the President can accept," he said."This only means Malacanang will not accept anything that does notconform with its formula...We can expect then a 'seen' hand in the(bicameral conference committee discussions)," the source said.This has always been the fear of Makati Rep. Joker Arroyo who saidwhatever legislation Congress approves is always mangled in thebicameral conference committee. "It (bicameral conference committee)has become a modern-day Frankenstein," he said. However, he is hopingHouse committee on ways and means chairman Antique Rep. Exequiel Javierdoes not renege on his commitment not to allow anybody to mangle theHouse version.This developed as House Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr. yesterdayinstructed the ways and means committee to fast-track the considerationof the last component of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Package - theincome tax reforms and the tax administration reforms.He sought the immediate passage of the tax measure increasing theexemption of wage earners and exempting families living below thepoverty line and overseas contract workers from paying income tax.The CTRP calls for an increase of exemption to a uniform P20,000 fromthe present P9,000 for single individuals, P12,000 for heads of thefamily and P18,000 for married individuals.Meanwhile, House Minority Leader San Juan Rep. Ronaldo Zamora yesterdaypushed for an increased income tax exemptions for separated women andsingle parents. He, however, failed to state up to what level theincrease in exemptions should be. At present, single parents can claimonly a P12,000 deduction as head of the family. He also called for theexemption of the first P150,000 annual income of couples with fourdependents.In a related development, the approval of the proposed P476.2-billionnational budget for next year will not be delayed even if the CTRP isnot in place, said Senate Majority Leader Alberto Romulo.He said Congress can deliberate on the budget and the CTRP at the sametime since the two measures "go together."Sen. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, economic affairs committee chairman,added Congress can approve the budget based on projected revenues.She told BusinessWorld legislators do not expect any delay in thepassage of the 1997 budget because Congress or the Executive canexercise the authority to cut expenditures.Mr. Romulo said both Houses have enough time to approve the CTRP andthe budget as long as solons have political will."Since the budget relies on revenues, the two proposals go together andwill be passed on time," he added.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996FOCUS: Computerized elections: Room for improvementfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1By Veronica C. SilvaFirst of two partsAll eyes were focused on the elections in the Autonomous Region forMuslim Mindanao (ARMM) last Sept. 9. Though the region represents lessthan 3% of the country's total voting population, the elections were ofnational importance.Some say for newly proclaimed governor Nur Misuari, who ranunchallenged, last week's elections were a baptism of fire: a test ofwhether or not the Moro National Liberation Front's covenant with thegovernment heralds the coming of peace in the region. If the reports ofelection-related violence were used as a measuring stick, he would passwith flying colors. Both the Commission on Elections (Comelec) and theNational Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel) reported "minor"incidents of such violence, even describing the ARMM elections as"boring" and "dull."Equally significant is that the computerized election system thegovernment is planning for the national polls in 1988 was pilot-testedin ARMM. Republic Act No. 8046, enacted in June 1995, authorized thepilot testing of the system which will facilitate the holding of clean,honest and orderly elections.Almost all those who closely monitored the ARMM elections agree thepilot test was successful in terms of speeding up the counting andcanvassing of votes. Mr. Misuari and his running mate, Guimid Matalam,were proclaimed winners after 48 hours. But, then again, they neededonly one vote each to win since there were no other candidates.There is still room for improvement, said Rizal Rep. Emigdio S.Tanjuatco, Jr., chairman of the House of Representatives committee onsuffrage and electoral reforms, and a member of the pilot-testoversight committee."The automated counting system, which minimized almost to nil humanintervention and then speeded up the counting, really addresses theproblem of dagdag-bawas - the manipulation or falsification of electionreturns and statement of votes," he told BusinessWorld. "However, thefunctioning of the (counting) machine can stand some improvements." Healso sees the need to streamline procedures.Some of the problems observed during the pilot test, such as wetballots, were not technology-related but nonetheless affected theperformance of the machines.Much is expected from the computerization of elections, but many agreethe electoral system needs more than a technological face-lift. Whiletechnology helps automate some steps, relying on it to solveelection-related problems is only accomplishing half the task.The project to computerize elections has had its share of criticisms.Issues such as the high cost involved, voters' attitude and securityrisks were raised.When RA 8046 was enacted last year, the next task was to look for theappropriate technology to do the job.During the tenure of Comelec chairman Christian Monsod, consultantsfrom the information technology (IT) industry, local and foreign, weretapped to evaluate the available technology.But when current chairman Bernardo P. Pardo took over, the Comelec didthe evaluation itself. Executive director Resurreccion Z. Borra saidthe poll body even insisted on its independence from the NationalComputer Center, an agency under the Office of the President.For its purposes, Comelec chose the American Information Systems, Inc.(AIS) counting machine which uses an optical scanning device to "read"the ballots fed from a paper tray.Comelec acquired 40 units of the AIS Model 150 which can read 150ballots per minute.The machine eliminates problems related to erroneous entries in votetallying since little human intervention is involved, said Alwin S.Sta. Rosa, Comelec director for Management Information Systems.In the ARMM elections, one counting machine was provided for every twomunicipalities. Only authorized personnel were allowed to operate it.It recorded the number of votes counted in a 3.5" diskette. A printerproduced a hard copy and this document was used by the Namfrel inconducting an unofficial tally of the votes through its Akbay BilangCenter.The Comelec used a personal computer (PC) to consolidate municipalresults and produce the provincial count. A computer program developedby AIS - Election Reporting System (ERS) - was used to consolidate thevotes. A hard copy of the results was also produced.One of the major issues raised about the computerization of electionswas security.Namfrel's earlier concern was the use of the 3.5" diskette, fearingthat since this diskette is commercially available, it is easy toswitch diskettes and tamper with the data.RA 8046 specifies the use of "memory packs," in this case, a diskette,to store data or the election tally.Comelec officials assured security measures were put in place toguarantee the sanctity of the ballot.Mr. Sta. Rosa said each diskette was pre-coded and encrypted to ensureno switching would go undetected by the system. Should the PC userinsert a diskette whose code could not be read, the computer programwill reject it. Should diskette switching take place, the results willbe invalidated.Should this happen, whether or not special elections would be allowedis not yet clear.Comelec officials said the computer printouts provide the audit trailsfor the new system. Officials said should there be a discrepancybetween the diskette and the printout, the latter will be used as theofficial document.In an interview before the ARMM elections, Mr. Borra told BusinessWorldComelec personnel anticipated bad weather and the lack oftransportation as potential problems. Some areas in Marawi City andTawi-Tawi, for example, are 18 to 20 hours away from the provincialcapital where the counting machines are located. He said these coulddelay the centralized counting of the votes.Mr. Borra also then said some ballots to be transported across the seashave to be carefully handled because if these get wet, the countingmachine would not be able to read them. Mr. Sta. Rosa, on the otherhand, assured the Comelec staff were prepared for possible technicalproblems, saying technicians were trained to do troubleshooting onsite. He added that should one counting machine bogs down, there werebackup machines.More than one counting machine and PC were located in a provincialcounting center where the votes were to be consolidated. Lanao, thelargest voting province in the region, had the most number of machinesat 19, Mr. Sta. Rosa said.No matter how prepared the Comelec and its deputies were, the ARMMpilot project was beset by problems, many of which were nottechnology-related.With the new technology, the Comelec projected the voter turnout at theARMM elections at between 80% and 85%. Mr. Borra said the commissionwas hoping the voters would go out and vote, the new systemguaranteeing the security of their ballots. However, over a week haspassed and the Comelec still has to announce the official voterturnout. Mr. Borra said the earliest the Comelec can announce theofficial number is tomorrow.Counting in some areas has been quite slow because of moist ballotswhich could not be fed to the counting machine.Mr. Tanjuatco observed humidity caused the ballots to stick together,causing frequent paper jams."If this happens often, then your rate per minute will go down insteadof attaining 150 ballots per minute," the solon said.Moisture from heavy rains and turbulent seas seeped into the windows ofthe ballot boxes, noted Mr. Borra. Lanao del Sur and Maguindanaoexperienced heavy rains on election day and the first day of counting.The ballots had to be dried first before these could be fed to themachines.Mr. Borra said the Comelec had wrapped the ballots with cellophane orplastic before distribution to polling centers but they still got wet.For the next elections, he suggested windowless ballot boxes or otherprotective covering to better protect the ballots.Another problem noted was the long queues both at the polling centersand the reception areas for the ballot boxes. For this, Namfrelchairman Jose S. Concepcion, Jr. blamed "controls in the bureaucracy."He said some election officials did not know Namfrel volunteers were tobe given copies of the printout for the group's quick count. Someelection officials insisted on the bureaucratic procedure: some askedtheir supervisors for permission while others insisted they compile theprintout before giving Namfrel the copies. He said this defeated thewhole purpose of conducting a quick count.Mr. Concepcion also mentioned an election official putting all copiesof the printout inside the ballot box. Under RA 8046, the copies of theprintout should be distributed to the majority and minority parties andthe election officer. Only one copy of the printout and the diskette gointo the ballot box.Members of the Board of Election Inspectors were required to sign theprintout. However, Mr. Concepcion noticed the signatures were mereformalities because the teachers who were supposed to witness thefunctioning of the machine do not appear to be computer literate. Theydid not know whether there were any errors in the procedures.Mr. Concepcion also related that when the counting machine bogged down,one of the board of election inspectors, a teacher who was assigned tothe machine, cannot or maybe has forgotten how to operate it. Thisconfusion contributed to the long lines outside the counting centers,he said.Technical problems compounded by bad weather delayed the regionalcanvass of the ARMM elections.The regional board of canvassers, headed by Mr. Borra, convened at theComelec office in Manila on Sept. 10, but no certificates of canvassand diskettes arrived until early the following day. Mr. Borra,however, expected this, saying the board was supposed to consolidatethe results as soon as the diskettes arrived.Mr. Borra said these problems were anticipated and did not affect theschedule of the counting and proclamation. He said Messrs. Misuari andMatalam were proclaimed governor and vice-governor of ARMM on Sept. 11,still within the 48-hour schedule the poll body has set. The 21assemblymen for the seven districts of ARMM were all proclaimed twodays after.Without the computerized system, observers said it could have takenmore than a week to complete the canvass of votes for a region withclose to a million registered voters like ARMM.To be continuedCopyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Petroleum Price Updatefrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1Petroleum Price Updatebased on Singapore Posted Prices (US$/bbl)Products        Aug.11-Sept.10  Sept.18 Sept.11-18      Increase               (Average)       SPP     (Average)       (Decrease)Premium         23.866          23.373  23.343          (0.5256)Unleaded        24.619          24.108  24.108          (0.5115)Regular         20.816          20.748  20.748          (0.0677)Avturbo         28.094          30.345  30.187           2.0938Kerosene        28.923          30.590  30.590           1.6619Diesel Oil      25.961          27.440  27.177           1.2165Fuel Oil        15.928          17.562  17.323           1.3948LPG             25.284          25.452  25.431           0.1470Source: Department of EnergyCopyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996FVR denies involvement in Charter changes planfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8President Ramos is keeping his distance from recent moves in the Houseof Representatives to amend the Constitution to allow him to extend histerm beyond 1998.During his weekly press conference yesterday, Mr. Ramos denied changinghis mind on the matter."My position is that my time, the time of the people, the time ofCongress, the time of all responsible Filipinos should be devoted togetting our legislative program finished so that we shall have asustainable economic development," he said.The Chief Executive said recent moves in the Lower House to change theConstitution is not the sole domain of lawmakers belonging to theadministration party Lakas-NUCD. He noted a Nacionalista Partycongressman from Iloilo is one of the main proponents of Charterchanges."If some Lakas are involved there, they are just supporting orresponding or reacting to earlier initiatives by some members ofCongress," Mr. Ramos said.The President has repeatedly said he will not seek reelection when histerm expires in 1998.But he dismissed the possibility that Lakas will institute disciplinaryactions against partymates who continue to initiate moves in amendingthe Charter."These are not criminally punishable acts on the part of the partymembers," he said.Meanwhile, House Speaker Jose de Venecia yesterday said the Houseleadership does not support plans to amend the 1987 Constitution."It has been put in the back burner and it will remain there," said Mr.de Venecia in a statement.But Lakas-NUCD party whip for Mindanao and Bukidon Rep. Jose Zubiriconfirmed that several congressmen are soliciting public support forthe plan to amend the Constitution.Meanwhile, Malabon-Navotas Rep. Tessie Aquino Oreta challenged hercolleagues and President Ramos to enter into a written "covenant" withthe people that they will all step down in 1998."If the President cannot accept the challenge of showing sincerity onhis pronouncements that he will give up Malacanang in 1998, we, in theLower House, should show the way that Malacanang may follow ourexample," she said.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Gov"t consultants get P700,000 monthlyfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8Senators were asked yesterday to check on the reported hiring offoreign consultants at very high salaries by several governmentagencies. Senator Juan Flavier yesterday said it is necessary to lookinto the situation since the fees, which range between P300,000 andP700,000 per month for every consultant, appears questionable. "We maynot have all the expertise for government programs but I find it hardto accept that they (foreign consultants) are being paid so much," hesaid. Data from the office of the senator showed a foreign consultantin the Health department received as much as P700,000 per monthexcluding per diems and travel allowances. A consultant of theDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), meanwhile,receives a monthly salary of P390,000. In another DENR project, 116foreign consultants were hired on "call basis" with salaries rangingfrom P2,000 to P9,000 a day. A project to rehabilitate Pasig Riverallotted P30 million for the salaries of six consultants or P5 millionper consultant for the entire program. Mr. Flavier said the practice ofhiring foreign consultants has to be regulated because it could lead toabuse and misspending. "We need a clear government policy on thismatter." He disclosed the agencies should not hire consultants left andright since the money, usually loans, utilized for projects has to berepaid by the government.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Dept of Health warns hospitals on wastesfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8Government and private hospitals are in for a rough time once thehealth department finds out which ones are not complying with properwaste management disposal practices. Health Secretary CarmencitaReodica yesterday issued a stern warning to erring hospitaladministrations that their service licenses will be revoked should theyfail to meet the minimum requirements set for sanitation facilities. Ina briefing with reporters, Ms. Reodica stressed the importance of ahospital incinerator as part of the overall health program of thecountry. However, due to the high cost of purchasing an incinerator,the lady chief said hospitals should instead encourage a wastemanagement disposal networking scheme wherein groups of hospitals mayavail of the services of a common contractor. An incinerator costsabout P4 million. Based on a 1994-1995 report of the EnvironmentalHealth Services of the Department of Health (DoH), majority of the 45government hospitals failed to meet the requirements for sanitationfacilities. It likewise revealed that hospital personnel practices onhospital waste management is "far from ideal." Of the 45 hospitals,only six have their own incinerators: National Kidney Institute, SanLazaro Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Center for MentalHealth, Vicente Sotto Hospital in Davao and Cullon Hospital in Palawan.Private hospitals with incinerators are East Avenue Medical Center,Rizal Medical Center, Orthopedic Hospital and Jose Fabella MemorialHospital.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Charge corrupt prosecutors, public urgedfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. yesterday urged the public tofile formal complaints against corrupt prosecutors.

Mr.Guingona also asked the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to lookinto reports that "fix-cals" abound, particularly in the provinces.Meanwhile, DILG Secretary Robert Barbers yesterday asked Mr. Guingonato take action against two prosecutors who allegedly mishandled twocases. Mr. Barbers said Quezon City assistant prosecutor HildaFantastico-Ibuyan issued "a highly irregular and contradictoryresolution" in the extortion case against a policeman. Also irregularwas the dismissal by Pasig City prosecutor Eduardo R.

The DILG chief said the convict shouldhave been sentenced to death. Also yesterday, he directed Police ChiefSupt.

But I can assure you that there is a lot of friendlyback channeling efforts being done by peace advocates as well as localofficials," he said.The Chief Executive also said the government's peace strategy with theMILF is similar with its strategy with the MNLF."Of course, we hope that one with the MILF will not last that manymonths or years. After all, we have started already with the MNLF. Thedifference, however, between formal talks or negotiating talks must bemade," Mr. Ramos said.The MILF has been critical against the government's peace accord withthe MNLF, particularly on the creation of the Southern PhilippinesCouncil for Peace and Development (SPCPD), which will oversee peace anddevelopment projects in 14 provinces and nine cities in Mindanao.It may be noted the MILF wants complete autonomy for Mindanao.Mr. Ramos also said he has issued a memorandum on the creation of aspecial task force to oversee peace negotiations with the MILF andother enemies of the state.Meanwhile, MNLF officials yesterday asked the Senate to conduct aninvestigation into the alleged involvement of four politicians andformer military men with Christian vigilante groups in Mindanao.This is after the MNLF accused businessmen and politicians withbusiness interests in Mindanao of spearheading moves against theestablishment of the SPCPD.In a forum at Club Filipino in Greenhills, MNLF legal counsel BloAdiong claimed these businessmen and politicians also floated a "whitepaper" which said the SPCPD will "Islamize" Mindanao.The white paper was reportedly circulated in Zamboanga and Cotabato.Mr. Adiong claims these politicians and businessmen "are the samepersonalities that have big business in Mindanao."Earlier, South Cotabato Rep.

Militaryofficials also said the report was unconfirmed.Military and police operatives, meanwhile, are now looking into thealleged involvement of a prominent businessmen in Zamboanga City withthe Mindanao Christian Unified Command (MCUC).Meanwhile, former MNLF spokesman Datu Ibrahim Uy Alhadj, now chairmanof the Bangsa Moro Holdings Inc., also said Christian militia groupsare harmless compared with the MILF and the Abu Sayyaf."They (militia groups) are not capable of creating violent attacks andtake arms against the government and other Muslims," he said.Meanwhile, MNLF chairman and new Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao(ARMM) governor Nur Misuari is expected to join negotiations with theMNLF.Presidential Management Staff chief Alexander Aguirre yesterday saidthe MNLF will be consulted the MILF peace talks since a largeconcentration of Islamic Front is in the ARMM.Earlier, Mr. Misuari reportedly planned to distance himself from theproposed talks, saying that is "solely the initiative of thegovernment."Meanwhile, senators yesterday vowed to block the proposed P230-millionbudget for the integration of MNLF members into the Philippine NationalPolice (PNP) unless the government can provide a clear program forrebel disarmament.Senate Minority Leader Edgardo Angara said the lack of a disarmamentplan for MNLF forces, particularly those excluded from the integrationscheme, is a source of apprehension among people in Mindanao.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Death penalty legalfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8Although it is not necessary to pass upon the constitutionality of thedeath penalty, the Supreme Court should pass judgment on thecorrectness of death sentences imposed by trial courts.Thus recommended Jesuit priest and lawyer Joaquin Bernas,vice-president of the 1987 Constitutional Commission, in a 23-pagememorandum submitted yesterday to the High Court.He also asked the High Tribunal to formulate guidelines for trialcourts to follow in imposing death sentences.The Supreme Court had asked Fr. Bernas to give his recommendationsafter death row convict Pedro Malabago questioned the constitutionalityof the heinous crimes law. A lower court had sentenced Malabago todeath after it found him guilty of killing his wife.Fr. Bernas said Congress did not violate the Constitution when itenacted Republic Act 7659 which paved the way for the reimposition ofthe death penalty by classifying several crimes as heinous. But it isthe duty of courts to examine the validity of the classification."The fact that Congress has listed a crime in the books as heinous doesnot settle everything. Congressional definitions are not alwaysconclusive. It is the same when Congress labels a crime as heinous.Crimes do not exist in books. Crime exist in life. And life is notunivocal," said Fr. Bernas.He also said Congress did not impose the death penalty but merelyprovides for a penalty which the courts, where proper, may impose."It is the courts which decide whether it is legally andconstitutionally proper to impose the penalty, and impose it not on anabstract criminal coldly described in books but on warm bodied accusedindividuals who possess the very fundamental and precious right tolife," he said.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Political advertising ban on showbiz folk proposedfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8Media and showbiz personalities planning to run for office should takea "leave of absence" to avoid the possible "misuse of media" bycandidates, says House Bill 7462 which will amend the law banningpolitical advertisements.The bill seeks to amend the Omnibus Election Code by allowing the useof mass media and other campaign materials by candidates running foroffice."The bill seeks to equalize the political playing field by reducing theundue advantage enjoyed by candidates who are media or show businesspersonalities ," said Rizal Rep.

MallariWith the economy's 7.1% growth in the first semester, real per capitaincome correspondingly improved.Data culled from the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB)show per capita gross national product (GNP) - or the estimated incomeeach Filipino receives - at constant 1985 prices was placed at P5,916in the first half of the year. This registered a 4.6% hike from P5,655in the same period last year. A rising income means Filipinos arebetter off than before.Real per capita GNP is calculated by dividing GNP by the populationduring a given period. Ideally, the output produced by the economyshould be faster than population growth. For the past two years, theeconomy has been growing more than twice the population growth. Inparticular, GNP expanded 5.5% in 1995 and 7.1% in the first half of1996. Based on the 1990 Census of Population and Housing, the number ofFilipinos was estimated at 71.9 million as of the second quarter of1996, increasing steadily by roughly 2.3% annually. Per Capita GDPPer capita gross domestic product (GDP), on the other hand, amounted toP5,641, up 2.6% from P5,496 the previous period. This was slightlybetter than the 2.3% growth posted in 1995. Per capita GDP is deemedmore reliable measure of one's income level than per capita GNP.The growth in per capita GDP can be traced mainly to the favorableperformance of the agricultural sector which registered a 3.8% upswingin the first six months, or a rebound from almost 1% in the precedingyear. The NSCB reported that strong production of palay, corn andsugarcane kept the sector moving.However, the gap between per capita GNP and GDP during the period underreview has widened. In 1996, the difference was at P275, bigger thanP159 in 1995 and P134 in 1994. In recent years, net factor income fromabroad (NFIA) which includes remittances of overseas contract workers(OCWs) remained a major contributor to GNP. OCW remittances have beenon an uptrend, accelerating 76.5% in the first semester.Despite the widening gap, economists are confident per capita GDP willsoon catch up since investments have been leading local growth.As real per capita GNP improved, purchasing power further expanded.Personal consumption expenditure (PCE) per head was valued at P4,337,up 2% from P4,251 the previous year. PCE refers to consumer spendingfor goods and services.PCE for the past quarters has generally slowed down. This can mean moreFilipinos have been saving or pouring their surplus funds to longertermed investments.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Economic Indicator: Increasing number of contractors shows upbeatconstruction sectorfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 10By Leotes Marie T. LugoReflective of the upsurge of construction activity in the country, moreand more contractors have been granted licenses by the PhilippineContractors Accreditation Board (PCAB). In a span of five years,population of the local contracting sector reached 8,225 or nearlydouble the 5,476 registered in 1991.Contractors are primarily responsible for gathering all the necessaryresources required in putting up the desired facility. Proponents ofthe contracting sector also coordinate and supervise the entireconstruction process. An increase in the number of contractors attestto impressive showing of the industry.PCAB is the government agency tasked to issue, limit, suspend andrevoke contractors' licenses as well as upgrade the classification oflicensed contractors. The Board issues regular and special licenses.The first is granted to Filipino sole proprietorships, and partnershipsor corporations with at least 60% equity participation. The latter isissued to joint ventures, consortiums, foreign constructors or aproject owner engaged in the construction of a single specificundertaking.Increasing disposable incomes, lower interest rates and favorabledemographics contributed to the boom in both residential andnonresidential construction. Rising demand for support facilities instride with the country's economic expansion also enticed morecompanies to join the real estate bandwagon.In the first quarter alone, the sector was joined by 1,973 new approvedcontractors. More than half of the total fell under category D.Contractors are categorized with respect to their minimum capital base.Firms under AAA have a minimum capital of P10 million; AA, P5 million;A, P1 million; B, P500,000; C, P300,000; D, P100,000 and Trade, P5,000.A closer look at the PCAB data show the industry is composed mainly ofsmall contractors. Firms under category D, C and B captured the first,second and third places respectively, in terms of number. Evenaggregate entities under the Trade classification exceeded the combinedtotal of type AAA and AA contractors. Trade contractors are limited torepair works and undertakings of up to P500,000 contract or projectcost.Moreover, only 199 companies fell under the AAA grouping. These are thecompanies capable of handling large scale projects worth P50 millionand above. Commonly referred to as the big guns in the industry, theseinclude D.M. Consunji Inc., EEI Corp. and F.F. Cruz and Company, Inc.,among others.The present composition though may prove a disadvantage to theindustry. Faced with the entry of foreign players, "local contractorsmust join forces and be ready for competition," a high rankingPhilippine Constructors Association (PCA) official said.The official further noted that joint ventures are fast becoming apractice in the sector, which PCA hopes will lead to the formation ofconsortiums and in the long run, mergers among construction companies.Approvals of licenses is expected to be on the uptick given theconsistent positive showing of the industry, Sonia T. Valdeavilla,Philippine Overseas Construction Board-International ProjectsMonitoring Division chief told BusinessWorld in an earlier interview.Ms. Valdeavilla pointed to the increasing government budget forinfrastructure as well as the Countryside Development Fund asadditional come-ons for construction firms. Build-operate-transferprojects in the pipeline are estimated to cost P212.53 billion.Likewise, the Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines (CIAP)estimates real construction output to move up 13.5% this year andaccelerate at an annual average rate of 14% until 1998. Tourism andreal estate development are also counted on to bolster the industry'sgrowth.CIAP computed real demand for construction this year to reach P99.2billion, of which P55.8 billion will come from private constructionwhich covers residential and nonresidential projects. Addressing the3.72 million housing backlog through the construction of low cost andsocialized housing will answer the demand side. Meanwhile, the growthof urban centers and the continued development of industrial centers iscounted on to sustain the boom in the nonresidential sector.Government construction, on the other hand accounts for P43.4 billionof the total. This covers infrastructure development in power, energyand electricity, transportation, water resources, social infrastructureand communication.Licensed contractors are further classified into generalbuilding, general engineering and specialty contractors.General building companies are involved in the development of awide range of structures and buildings. Contractors who performcivil engineering works requiring specialized engineering suchas construction of irrigation, drainage, water supplysewerage, flood control, highways and roads, harbors, docks andwharves, shipyards, ports and heavy industrial establishments areclassified under general engineering. Specialty contractors arethose who undertake work requiring specialize building trades.Majority of contractors belong to the general engineering/buildingclass.Number of Contractors by CategoryCFY             AAA     AA      A       B       C       D       TRADE90-91           30      31      388     860     1390    2313    46491-92           42      38      473     1012    1524    2400    41492-93           72      60      563     1215    1662    2435    40793-94           142     84      651     1317    1841    2603    35994-95           158     94      673     1362    1830    2725    602As of March '96 199     89      682     1502    2006    3094    653Classification  MinimumCapital BaseAAA     P10 millionAA      P5 millionA       P1 millionB       P.5 millionC       P.3 millionD       P.1 millionTRADE   P.005 millionSource: Philippine Contractors Accreditation BoardCopyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996DECS, DoST agency launch school, forest park programfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16Filipino schoolchildren can better appreciate the importance ofprotecting the environment through a program which has been created.Called "School Forest Park Program," it will support the government'sclean and green initiative and consequently, create consciousness amongchildren on the value of environment protection and conservation of itsbiodiversity.The Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) and PhilippineCouncil for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research andDevelopment (PCARRD) joined hands through a signing of the memorandumof agreement (MoA) to fully implement the program.Signatories to the agreement were DECS Secretary Ricardo T.

ChancoThe International Monetary Fund (IMF), like any financial institutiondeserving the name, is worried. In a story bylined by BusinessWorldreporters Maricris C. Carlos and Elisha R. Garcia earlier this week,the IMF expressed more than a bit of curiosity about the rate ofnational economic growth and wondered out loud - as anyone in theirposition appears well entitled to wonder - if the Philippines hadenough growth sustainability factors to keep up with its spending.Of course, this whole exercise is about money. It's only money.It's money that interests the money merchants and the money spenders,but the IMF is quoted as worried about the country's money inflows. Thebulk appears to come, not from the hot shots riding the rails on theBicol-North super expressways, but from overseas contract workers(OCWs).Either kind of legal tender will pay for life's real or imagined needs.But when overseas income starts surging 76% higher in the first sixmonths of 1996 compared to that of a year ago, it's time to look at thecolor of one's money.When one considers that there has been a continuous downtrend in thenumber of Filipinos employed overseas in these last years, the innuendoturns absolutely tantalizing. One wonders: Did those overseas workerswe have left somehow marry into rich families on the desert sands? Oris there a new kind of corporate capital sharing now at work that wewill never hear of in the country?I remember, some five or six years ago, watching at a big Quezon Citycar exchange where a transaction involving a large passenger van wasgoing on. The deal may have been several days in the making, but when Ichanced on the scene money was already changing hands. The buyer was ashapely Filipina who could have been a stewardess, nurse or just anoverseas spellbinder. But she was tough and spoke in knowledgeableTagalese that she intended to get value for her money.She took out so many high-denomination bills from a large suitcase Ithought she had a direct pipeline to a next-door bank. Finally, whenall the accessories, tires, papers, etc. had been dumped inside thevan, she and two other companions got in and drove away in a cloud ofdust.At another time, I watched at a money changer's shop while twoforeigners dickered for centavos on the standard peso-dollar exchangerate - and ended up changing $20 per head. Behind them, a short, squatFilipino OCW walked up and waited patiently at the counter. Hedeposited a thick wad of hundred-dollar bills big enough to choke adinosaur. He had a proper escort, this man had; when they zoomed offinto the sunset, he made the old cowboy John Wayne look Lilliputian bycomparison.So there you have it - big bucks and big money from fewer Filipinoworkers overseas. But they still float enough high-octane gas to fuelthe consumerist boom in cars, housing, food, appliances, durables. Thevery breath of life, the IMF seems to say, which makes even us askplaintively - how long is this bubble going to last? How long before itblows up on our faces, and another IMF set of conditions is imposed tomake Filipinos live within their means?Filipino overseas workers, it is said, are not likely to return homesoon, so their source of funds will not be quickly cut off. So if thatis OK, what's this talk about growth sustainability all about?Something to keep the boys better treated for all the tough yearsthey've been having? Or is it simply because, with so many smallFilipinos doing their bit to keep the nation afloat and sustainable, westill need to justify ourselves before yet another level of judges?Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Dept of Envt and Natural Resources okays social forestry rulesfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16By Digna V. VelascoNew rules on social forestry were approved last week by the Departmentof Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).Started during the early years of the Aquino administration, socialforestry was promoted as a livelihood scheme for upland communities.The new rules, spelled out in DENR Administrative Order No. 96-24,series of 1996, are aimed at ensuring "equitable access and sharing ofrights to natural resources development and utilization by giving thepeople, particularly the poorer sectors of society, the opportunity toparticipate actively in forest plantation development."DENR will grant Socialized Industrial Forest Management Agreement orSIFMA to qualified program participants and will include a provision onsecurity of tenure.The concept was derived from the Industrial Forest Management Agreementor IFMA which taps corporate participants.Under the SIFMA, each family can develop and manage forest areas from 1to 10 hectares. For associations and cooperatives, sizes of awardedareas range from 11 to less than 500 hectares.A non-refundable application fee of P500 for every hectare awarded willbe collected by DENR.Filipinos of legal age and preferably residents of the municipalitywhere the project will be located are qualified to apply for concessionareas.Associations and cooperatives applying should have offices located inthe province where the SIFMA is located and are duly registered withthe Securities and Exchange Commission or the Cooperative DevelopmentAuthority.Moreover, they must be financially and technically capable ofdeveloping the area. Applicants should not have had any agreements,permits or licenses to use forest lands or resources cancelled due totheir inability to comply with DENR requirements nor are they holdersof any existing forest permit, license, lease or management agreement.A qualified SIFMA applicant is entitled to the following:* harvest, sell or use all planted crops, mostly trees for woodproduction, non-timber species and other cash crops that may beinterplanted, except those retained for environmental protection;* export logs, lumber and other forest products harvested according tothe government's allocation system;* exemption from paying forest charges derived from the plantation;* reasonable compensation if the SIFMA is cancelled without due cause;* high priority if future rules allow a more permanent tenurialarrangement;* no restrictions on use of the SIFMA as collateral for loans toimprove the area, provided this is approved by the issuing IFMAauthority; and* free technical assistance for SIFMA holders wanting to confederateinto a larger organization.SIFMA is valid for 25 years and renewable for another 25 years.DENR Secretary Victor O. Ramos said SIFMA will promote an adequate andsteady supply of timber and other forest products for the domestic andexport market; accelerate reforestation and rehabilitation of thecountry's open and denuded forest lands and effectively protect andconserve existing natural forests, soil, water and biodiversity; whileat the same time give more equitable access to forest resources andhelp uplift the economic situation of people, particularly in theuplands.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Gov"t seals wastewater tunnels of Mandaluyong sugar refineryfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16By Digna V. VelascoWastewater tunnels of a sugar refinery in Mandaluyong City were closedlast week by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).The Pollution Adjudication Board (PAB) of the DENR ruled the sealing ofthe Noah's Ark Sugar Refinery's drainage tunnels with cement fillingsand steel plates.A laboratory analysis of the refinery's wastewater showed a solidmatter density higher than what the government allows. For DENR, solidparticles emitted into a water system should take an hour to settle atits bottom.The closure order was first served on October 17, 1995 because Noah'sArk failed to install an adequate wastewater treatment plant (WTP).Five days after, the firm filed a motion for reconsideration which theboard denied for "lack of merit."On November 22, 1995 however, a six-week temporary lifting order (TLO)was issued but subject to three conditions including the constructionof an adequate WTP.PAB extended the TLO for 60 days on January 24, 1996 with instructionsto the DENR-National Capital Region (DENR-NCR) to test the firm'swastewater regularly.On June 13, 1996, the TLO was again extended for another month "toallow the respondent to further adjust its WTP and for resamplingpurposes."Last August 6, PAB ordered the reimposition of the standingclose-and-desist order (CDO) which was served 10 days later by DENR-NCRofficials led by Environment Management Engineer Danilo Galagnara.They noted one of the three tunnel outfalls was below the surface ofthe river so they had to come back in the afternoon at low tide to sealit. They reported the firm's administrative manager, Luis Ramos,prevented them from carrying out the said order.PAB made its first endorsement to DENR Secretary Victor Ramos for thefiling of criminal charges against the firm. Last September 11, therefinery's drainage tunnels were finally sealed.Gerardo Reyes, Noah's Ark's public relations officer, denied some ofDENR's accusations. He told BusinessWorld that no wastewater samplingwas scheduled that last week of June when the "organic-ladenwastewater" was taken.Instead, a DENR-NCR monitoring team went to check on the air pollutioncomplaints of Mandaluyong City Congressman Neptali Gonzales, Jr.against the firm. Noah's Ark passed the air pollution test."Unfortunately, a companion of the team saw the wastewater flowing intothe bed which has not yet passed through our treatment plant. He tooksome samples of it and had it tested. Predictably, we failed. Thatbecame the basis of the CDO automatic reimposition," Mr. Reyes related.Mr. Reyes claimed that Noah's Ark had an existing WTP when the CDO wasfirst issued. The firm had failures in operations due to a boilerbreakdown and "we can't assure a 100% operational WTP." Thus, the CDOwas issued.The CDO was temporarily lifted with the firm subjected to closewastewater monitoring. The refinery adopted the biological system whichused activated sludge or bacteria to eat up the wastes in the aerationtank.From the aeration tank, wastewater passes through the resettling tankthen finally discharged into the Pasig River.The TLO was extended for three months so DENR could continue monitoringthe firm's improvements.Mr. Reyes related, "DENR told us that the Biological Oxygen Demand(BOD) level was the critical aspect so we worked on it." BOD is thecapacity of the water to supply oxygen needed by organisms to survive.Mr. Reyes added, "We passed the required BOD but we had a highpercentage of solid particles. We were again told to improve on ourWTP.""But we were nearing the end of the TLO extension. PAB said there is noneed for a written petition for another extension. It was then that theunfortunate testing came, resulting in the CDO automatic reimposition."Mr. Reyes also denied DENR's accusation that Mr. Ramos, Noah's Ark'sadministrative manager, stopped the closure order.He added that on August 21, the firm submitted another motion forreconsideration to PAB, citing that the firm received only last July 16the one-month TLO extension issued last June 13.The motion argued that the TLO should have lapsed only last August 17.The refinery also cited substantial losses due to the "outright closureof production" as the raw sugar worth P10 million in its productionlines would be wasted.A separate sampling and laboratory analysis of DENR's RiverRehabilitation Secretariat last July 1 showed "marked improvements,"with the concentration of solid particles reduced significantly."According to our consultants, DENR's standard is based on tap watersuch as that supplied by the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage System.Can that be expected of wastewater?" he asked.The refinery has also installed a clarifier and screen to furtherfilter the solids before final discharge into the Pasig River.Mr. Reyes said the management decided to voluntarily stop itsoperations about a week before DENR's actual closure.As a last resort, the firm might consider ocean-dumping as analternative and they have already applied to the Philippine Coast Guardfor this.The refinery's wastewater, he said, can be good fish food since it ismostly molasses from the sludge of sugar cane.The firm also has its own tadpoles and barges to transport wastewaterto the sites to be identified by the Philippine Coast Guard.But DENR authorities said this is still subject to PAB's approval andhad to be closely coordinated with the DENR-NCR officers and thePhilippine Coast Guard.On the firm incurring losses due to the closure, PAB argued that otherfirms have always raised this reason which is not enough to stay theCDO. "Economic losses are expected in all firms meted with CDOs," theboard explained.For Noah's Ark refinery, DENR's closure action was "counterproductive"to President Fidel Ramos's program of Philippines 2000."We in the private sector are working hand in hand with the government.But we are confused on the role of the DENR. Is it there to close downfirms?"Shouldn't its role be in helping firms comply with its standards?DENR's role should be a working relationship with the private sectorand not just a police body out to close firms."Will CDO be the remedy? We wouldn't question it if we had beendefiant. But we had spent about P5 million to improve our WTP andcomply with DENR's requirements," Mr. Reyes said.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Congress wants Pagcor to fund Oil Price Stabilization Fundfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2By Manolo A. Serapio, Jr.After the Philippine National Oil Co. (PNOC), Congress is hoping to tapfunds from last year's top earner, the state-owned Philippine Amusementand Gaming Corp. (Pagcor), to wipe out the P2.3 billion deficit of theOil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSF).Early this year, PNOC shelled out P10 billion from its coffers for theOPSF. However, this was not enough to reimburse all pending claims ofthree oil companies.Now, Congress thinks Pagcor, which earned P5.86 billion in profits lastyear, is the next potential OPSF donor.Taguig Rep. Dante Tinga, chairman of the committee on energy at theHouse of Representatives, told BusinessWorld the Lower House hopes tosettle the OPSF deficit before March 1997. This is when the governmentis slated to lift all controls, including on pricing, on the oilindustry."There are actually many sources of funds to (address) the OPSFdeficit. But Pagcor is the most capable to provide money to the OPSF,"he said.Pagcor, a government-owned-and-controlled corporation which runs allcasinos nationwide, is considered the most profitable of all state-runcompanies.The three oil companies - Petron Corp., Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp.(PSPC) and Caltex (Phils.) Inc. - have turned down requests by theDepartment of Energy for them to condone pending claims from the OPSF.Their claims against the fund is estimated to have reached P2.3 billionin August.Officials of the oil firms earlier said they cannot write off theirclaims from the buffer fund since this will affect their balance sheetsand thus hinder plans for expansion.Of the P10 billion PNOC coughed up, only P9 billion was paid to the oilcompanies. The DoE decided to keep the P1 billion as buffer fund tocushion any oil price increase during the partial deregulation of theoil industry.But Energy Secretary Francisco Viray had floated the idea of using theP1 billion, or whatever will be left of it, to pay part of the oilfirms' OPSF claims.Mr. Tinga said the Lower House will be supportive of Mr. Viray'ssuggestion although this will have to be legislated.The OPSF is a buffer fund used to shield domestic oil prices againstradical movements in crude prices abroad and the fluctuations in theforeign exchange rates.The OPSF turned red in May last year given the unexpected increases inthe price of crude oil in the world market.Even with PNOC's substantial contribution, the Energy Regulatory Board(ERB) had to increase oil prices by an average of P0.55 per liter lastFebruary to address part of the OPSF deficit.Officials of the Department of Finance (DoF) said oil prices may haveto be raised by another P0.11 per liter to produce money that will bepaid to the oil companies.The DoF said the government is cash-strapped to provide any more funds,thus the OPSF burden has to be passed on to consumers.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996National Economic and Development Authority Board approves 10 projectsfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2By Ma. Salve I. DuplitoTen projects worth P97.5 billion were approved yesterday by theNational Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board.The NEDA Board, a cabinet-level body, is chaired by President Ramos. Itgives the final approval of projects before they are carried out.The 10 projects will cost the government P33.7 billion in local fundingand P63.3 billion in foreign loans through official developmentassistance and grants.The San Roque Multipurpose Project accounted for the biggest chunk ofthe funding, costing P24.9 billion.The site of the Multipurpose Project is the Agno River Basin inPangasinan. The project includes a 345-megawatt power plant andirrigation for 70,822 hectares of agricultural land.Documents from NEDA, however, show the project is not financiallyviable but the economic rate of return to be gleaned from powergeneration and irrigation is expected to make up for the financialunviability of the project.The Light Rail Transit III was the second biggest project, costing thegovernment P18.3 billion in foreign loans. Local funding is not neededfor the project as the project is identified under thebuild-lease-transfer scheme.The LRT III, which has been delayed for almost a year now because ofright-of-way and squatter relocation problems, is expected to becompleted in October next year with construction starting not laterthan this month.NEDA's Infrastructure Staff earlier questioned its viability as projectcost has ballooned to $655 million from the original $300 million. TheDepartment of Transportation and Communications, however, pushed hardfor the project.The NEDA Board retained the non-separability feature of commercialdevelopment and the train service itself which the Metro Rail TransitCorp. (MRTC) had been proposing to remove.The MRTC, the consortium of some of the biggest developers in thecountry, earlier sought to continue with the commercial development ofthe depot site in North Edsa and other sites even if the rail componentdoes not push through. NEDA, however, blocked the act to ensure thatLRT III construction pushes through.The Sixth Roads Improvement Project, which will be financed mainlythrough a P9.5-billion loan from the Asian Development Bank and JapanExport Import Bank, seeks to rehabilitate the national roads networkthrough repairs and constructions of bridges and roads in crucialpoints nationwide.The other seven approved, with investments totalling P44 billion, are:Third Elementary Education Projects I and II, Agrarian ReformCommunities Project, Growth with Equity in Mindanao Program, and threepower projects under the National Power Corp.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996APEC UPDATE: APEC needs private sector to solve energy problemfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2By Leda A. EsguerraEnergy ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) urgeda tie-up between governments and the business sector to address theregion's rising power demand.The call was contained in a declaration following a meeting in Sydney,Australia, in preparation for this November's APEC summit in Subic.The ministers expect a 50% to 80% increase in the region's electricitydemand from 1996 to 2010, requiring some $1.6 trillion in investmentcapital."If such growth is to be realized, business sector finance for powerinfrastructure will be essential," they said.For a strong partnership with the business industry, the governments ofmember economies need to find means to reduce investment risks for thebusiness community and encourage them to invest in powerinfrastructure, the ministers explained.They stressed, "APEC governments must play a catalytic role in creatingthe project approval, regulatory and financial conditions necessary tomobilize the investment capital required from the business community."Apart from the need to introduce reforms to mobilize private sectorinvestments in the power sector, the ministers identified a series ofobjectives they will be reporting to the APEC leaders.The objectives are: the improvement of regional energy security byopening up the energy markets and expanding current supply capacity andenergy conservation; the need to come up with strategic approach toreducing the environmental impact of power projects.Also to be reported are the need for a framework to reduce businesscosts through cooperation on energy standards; and the adoption ofenergy policy principles to give an impetus to regional initiatives toreform energy policies for incorporation into domestic energy policydeliberations of member economies.APEC members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailandand the United States.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996FVR okays blacklist rules for erring gov"t contractorsfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2Erring contractors of the government's infrastructure projects willhave to shape up or else be blacklisted from future constructionprojects.The guidelines on blacklisting erring contractors were given thePresidential nod during the National Economic and Development Authority(NEDA) Board meeting held yesterday.The government intends to finalize an Executive Order (EO) by the endof the year to implement the guidelines.NEDA director-general Cielito F. Habito told BusinessWorld thePresident bypassed the usual repetitive discussions and approved theguidelines to fast-track the implementation of the EO."The President said it's about time to have a uniform set of guidelinesto weed out misfits in the government's infrastructure projects," Mr.Habito said. Mr. Habito added, however, the President ordered severalclarifications specifically on conflicts of interest."Some contractors are just dummies of local government officials. Wehave to set the rule on how to deal with this," the President wasquoted as saying during the meeting.Before the State of the Nation Address last June, the President visitedthe road construction at the Quezon City Circle and was reportedlydisappointed at the project's slow development.Under the current system, agencies have different guidelines andsanctions for erring contractors and have no common list of blacklistedcontractors.This situation allows contractors to escape detection and repetitivelywin in project biddings despite their poor performance.In the new set of guidelines, a uniform set of guidelines and sanctionshas been set. The sanctions range from suspension to perpetualdisqualification.Contractors can be blacklisted if proven to have used falsifieddocuments or borrowed license during bidding, rigging of bidding,inability to comply with requirements like affidavits on time, delaysin construction and low quality of work.Meanwhile, President Ramos yesterday approved the extension of the 3%duty on portland cement until 1997 to prevent any sudden increase incement prices.The decision was reached upon recommendation by the Committee onTariffs and Related Matters (TRM) of the NEDA Board.The extension was one of the executive actions targetted by NEDA in itsAction Plan Against Inflation. The move is seen to dampen uptick incost of housing and repairs which accounts for 13.3% of inflation.In the earlier plan, cement duty is scheduled to go up to 10% inJanuary 1, as mandated by Executive Order 284.However, since the current cement shortage is expected to stretch until1998, private sector representatives asked the government to postponethe increase in import duty to prevent importations from being tooexpensive and therefore ease cement shortage.Data from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) show demand forcement next year will balloon to 407 million bags from 334 million thisyear, even as supply is only expected to reach 401.8 million bags. Thistranslates to a 5.4 million supply deficit.In 1998, the situation will even be bleaker despite the operation ofnew plants, DTI said. Deficit is expected to shoot up to 42.5 millionbags.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Taxwise or Otherwise: Sellers to Philippine Economic Zone Authority firmsfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2By Romeo B. CruzSellers of goods or services dealing with an enterprise registered withthe Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) are often confronted withthe issue on the proper treatment of such transaction for Value-AddedTax (VAT) purposes. What may appear simple is complicated due todifferences in interpretation of the pertinent provisions of the VATLaw and related legislations.The provisions of the new VAT Law and implementing revenue regulationson effectively zero-rated sale could have provided the ready answer.Under the regulations, sales of goods and services by a VAT-registeredperson to a person or entity who has been granted indirect taxexemption under special laws are, in effect, zero-rated. In theregulations and the memorandum circular, the enumeration of effectivelyzero-rated sales of goods specifies sale to Subic Bay MetropolitanAuthority (SBMA)-and Cooperative Development Authority (CDA)-registeredenterprises, to PEZA registered enterprises, and to Asian DevelopmentBank and International Rice Research Institute, pursuant to respectivelaws and international agreements. However, this specific reference isnot contained in the enumeration of effectively zero-rated sales ofservices to these enterprises.It is our position that while not explicitly stated, it is the intentof the rules that sales of services to these specific enterprises andorganizations are to be treated in the same manner as the sales ofgoods, and are effectively zero-rated.The PEZA law states that all privileges, benefits, advantages orexemptions accorded to special economic zones created under RA 7227(e.g. SBMA and CDA) shall also be accorded to PEZA firms. One of theprivileges enjoyed by SBMA enterprises is that purchases of rawmaterials, capital goods and equipment and services are consideredeffectively zero-rated for VAT purposes (Sec. 4 (A) of Rev. Regs. 1-95).Inasmuch as PEZA firms enjoy this same privilege, the sale of productsand services to PEZA firms should be treated as effectively zero-rated.Thus, the seller is liable to zero per cent VAT on such sale and isstill entitled to claim input taxes. Since the seller will not pass onany VAT, PEZA firms will enjoy a 10% savings on purchases made.The seller is, however, required to submit an application forzero-rating to the Revenue District Office having jurisdiction over itsprincipal place of business. Without an approved application forzero-rating, the sale would merely be considered exempt from VAT,therefore, the seller cannot deduct the input taxes paid on productssold against its output VAT.(Mr. Romeo B.

Clarissa S. BatinoAt least 13 companies have signified their intentions to buy into theNational Steel Corp. (NSC) when the government bids out 20% of the firmon October 2 for an expected take of not less than P4.5 billion.The companies represented in yesterday's pre-bidding conferenceconducted by the National Development Co. (NDC) include four Japaneseconglomerates, three investment affiliates representing big clients,prominent and low-key business names.Among the Japanese firms are Tomen Corp., Kawasho Corp., Mitsui & Co.,Ltd. and Marubeni Corp.ING Barings, Urban Bank and Lunar Holdings of broker Luis Virata werealso present. Sources said they could be representing big names wantingto elude publicity.An example could be plastics tycoon William Gatchalian who is said tobe talking intently with the Malaysian majority group in NSC forsignificant exposure in the country's largest steel firm.The interest of now Hong Kong-based Roberto Ongpin in NSC was alsoconfirmed with the attendance of APC Group formerly Asian PetroleumCorp.APC is 50-owned by Mr. Ongpin's Belle Corp. which is part of his AIAHoldings. Talks are rife at the stock market that Mr. Ongpin will beconverting APC into a holding company which he will use to penetrateNSC and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS).Mr. Ongpin has been eyeing the steel firm, even before the Malaysiansentered the picture. In fact, he participated in the privatization butlost to the Malaysians. He and Mr. Gatchalian have been meeting oftenwith Wing Tiek Holdings Berhad for possible tie-ups, sources said.Shipping magnate Doris Magsaysay-Ho also sent a representative throughher National Marine Corp. Other prospective bidders are Cathay PacificSteel Corp., another firm represented by the Embassy of Spain, currentNSC supplier Reliance Commodities and an obscure firm, Rico Enterprises.NDC, the government's holding arm, will be dividing the 448,683,666shares into four blocks comprising five per cent each of the company.Arthur Aguilar, general manager of NDC explained this is to broaden theownership base of the company and even make it more marketable."At an indicative price of P10 each, this will entail a large sum ofmoney. Instead of doing an all-or-nothing type of bidding, we decidedto split it up," Mr. Aguilar explained.While it is possible a single bidder will get all four chunks, it canalso happen that an entity may bid for the four and not get any, theNDC official noted.A bidder is required to put 10% upfront of his bid price uponsubmission of the bid, 50% not later than October 25 and 40% withinninety days from the awarding.NDC noted the number of shares to be offered may increase depending onthe decision of Wing Tiek's partner, Marubeni Corp. on its pending $50million obligation as part of the Malaysian's second tranche.Wing Tiek is in the process of acquiring 75% of NSC. It has paid formore than 60% but liquidity crunch has delayed its payment of the $90million supposedly due in August.It worked out a strategic venture with Marubeni wherein the latter willbuy 6% of NSC shares the Malaysians earlier committed to take.But Marubeni is said to be having second thoughts on plunking in $50million (P1.3 billion) without the resolution of the land issue.NSC has about P700 million worth of properties it had to spin-off sinceit is now majority-owned by a foreigner. The Constitution expresslystated no foreign entity can own land in the Philippines.As of press time, nothing has been heard of Marubeni's decision. Mr.Aguilar said if Marubeni keeps an uncertain stance, then the NDC boardwill meet this week to decide whether to include the 6% commitment inthe put-option clause.With no takers, this chunk will revert to Wing Tiek again. And NDC willbe left to contend with another round of IOUs.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996PTT of Thailand, Coastal Petroleum joint venture to build local gasstationsfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6By Manolo A. Serapio, Jr.State-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) has firmed up plansto tie up with United States-based Coastal Petroleum to put up 200service stations here, sources told BusinessWorld yesterday.Sources said PTT has secured the approval of the Thai government forthe said project. Officials of the firm are due to arrive this week tofinalize the joint-venture agreement with Coastal.Coastal which runs a large oil depot in Subic Bay Freeport in Olongapowill be supplying the petroleum products to the Thai firm.PTT will concentrate on marketing fuel products in Metro Manila.Initial investments for the project is estimated at $120 million.Coastal operates the Coastal Subic Bay Terminal, Inc. which stores 2.4million barrels of oil. It also runs a similar depot in Clark Field inPampanga that has a storage capacity of half a million barrels.The project will be the first for PTT. Coastal has been operating theSubic depot since 1993 shortly after the US vacated its military basein Olongapo.Coastal has consistently been supplying any shortfall in the domesticpetroleum demand. The firm provides at least 20,000 barrels a day toaugment local requirements which averages 350,000 daily.A Coastal official said plans are under way to for a $20-millionupgrading bid of the firm's existing pipeline in Clark to facilitatetransport of fuel products.Aside from the PTT-Coastal project, no other newcomers in the partiallyderegulated oil industry have finalized plans to invest in marketingpetroleum products. But Department of Energy (DoE) director ZenaidaMonzada said other firms can actually pursue investment interestswithout informing the DoE."This is one of the results of a deregulated industry. They (investors)can opt to come to us when they have their respective projects alreadyin place," she said.The government has eased rules on the entry of new players in thepetroleum industry as part of its economic liberalization program. Thepartial deregulation phase where pricing remains semi-regulated by theEnergy Regulatory Board will last until February next year. With fullderegulation a month later, petroleum pricing will be market-dictated.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Luis Dizon group files cases vs SEC at the appellate court, Ombudsmanfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6By Larina  G. Perez and Norman C. AquinoAfter being prevented from taking control of Dizon Copper Silver Mines,Inc. (DCSMI) because of a recent temporary restraining order (TRO)issued by a hearing officer of the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC), the former management of the company went to the Court ofAppeals (CA) asking that the actions taken during the stockholdersmeeting held last September 4 be nullified.The hearing at the SEC was held to decide whether or not the TRO issuedlast September 16, 1996 by hearing officer James Abugan which iseffective for 72 hours should be extended.At the same time, the former management led by Dr. Luis Dizon alsofiled before the SEC a motion to dismiss the case and an opposition tothe extension of the TRO.The CA earlier issued a TRO preventing the Commission from enforcingits order directing the officers of DCSMI to hold a stockholdersmeeting. The TRO was issued in light of a petition filed by the blocled by Dr. Luis Dizon before the CA last September 3 seeking to stopthe stockholders meeting.However, the stockholders present during the assembly went on with themeeting claiming they constitute the majority. Moreover, they said theywere not parties to the TRO because it was only the SEC which wasenjoined by the CA from enforcing its order. During the meeting, thegroup also elected a new set of directors.Atty. Armando M. Marcelo, counsel for Dr. Dizon's group, said yesterdayaside from asking the CA to declare as null and void the actions takenduring the stockholders meeting, the group also asked the appellatecourt to hold in contempt DCSMI's elected officers led by chairpersonTeresita Dizon.He said they also asked the SEC to dismiss the case because the matterhas been elevated to the CA. "The SEC can't entertain the case anymorebecause only the CA can do that at this point," Mr. Marcelo said.In yesterday's hearing at the SEC, Mr. Marcelo said the TRO issued lastSeptember 16 is "void" and "nonexistent" because it was issued by ahearing officer who is not authorized to do so.Citing SEC's special rules for the issuance of TROs and writ ofpreliminary injunction, Mr. Marcelo said only the director of theSecurities Investigation and Clearing Division (SICD) can issue TROs.The rules read in part: "If the matter is of extreme urgency, such thatunless a TRO is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury willarise, the SICD director shall issue the TRO effective only for 72hours...""I would like to stress, there is not even anything (TRO) to extend.The rules on the issuance of TROs are very clear," Mr. Marcelo said.Atty. Manuel Singson, counsel for the newly elected board of directors,said even if the TRO issued by Mr. Abugan is indeed invalid, the SECcan still issue another TRO.Atty. Efren Moncupa, counsel for the same group, said they will pursuetheir move for the issuance of a TRO because the operations of DCSMIare adversely affected by the ongoing controversy. He said at present,the operations of the company are suspended because its office has beenpadlocked by the former management.He said the group will file a motion with the CA to dismiss the othergroup's petition so that the new directors and officers can assumetheir posts at DCSMI.Meanwhile, a stockholder of DCSMI yesterday filed graft charges beforethe Office of the Ombudsman against SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay, Jr.and five others.Also charged were commissioners Fe Eloisa Gloria, SEC lawyers RubenLadia, Juanito Almosa, Benito Cataran and Rosalina Tesorio.Mr. Sinugbuhan accused the SEC officials of giving undue injury toDCSMI by giving unwarranted benefits to Teresita Dizon, Lourdes Dizon,Fortunata Matsuda, Juvencio Dizon, Ramona Feliciano and DeograciasDatu, also stockholders of the mining company.He claimed the SEC officials conspired to illegally hold back two TROsissued by SEC hearing officer Evilio Pomento on September 4.The first order restrained the holding of a stockholders meeting thefollowing day until alleged tampering of proxy votes and dissipation ofcorporate funds would have been resolved.The second order barred the group of majority stockholder TeresitaDizon from being nominated and elected to the mining firm's board ofdirectors.Mr. Sinugbuhan said by suppressing the TROs, the SEC officials pavedthe way for a romp election by Ms. Dizon's group, causing confusionamong DCSMI stockholders.He also scored the officials for allegedly meddling in the dispositionof the mining firm's cases."It is about time that the corrupt and high-handed acts of thesegovernment officials be exposed and put to an end," Mr. Sinugbuhan said.Mr. Pomento had issued the TROs based on the claims of DCSMI'sincumbent management that there was massive cheating in the validationof proxies, the bone of contention between the two groups ofstockholders.Mr. Ladia, officer-in-charge of SEC's SICD), did not release Mr.Pomento's orders, claiming he saw the copies of the orders on September5 or a day late and that such orders need to be reviewed prior to theirrelease.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Congress to probe Manuela Land and Houses Corp"s ouster in John Haybiddingfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6By Ronaldo F.

Clarissa S. BatinoIn today's cutthroat competition, business guru and strategist MichaelPorter comes with his main edict likened to the classic saying that"the battle is not always to the strong nor the race to the swift."An author of three books in competitive advantage, Mr. Porter was inManila recently to share his insights with Filipino managers.He said a gung ho zest for operational excellence may fatten up profitsfor some years. But without the proper allowance for sustainabledevelopment, the driving force will weaken and like karma, theshortcomings will eventually catch up with the entrepreneur.Mr. Porter encouraged firms to innovate and recreate, to step out ofthe purely profit-driven mold of today's business into a dynamic,well-balanced and prosperous industry ready to face the global battlethat has started.He joined Harvard Business School in 1973 and has advised internationalfirms including AT&T, First Boston, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett-Packard,NEC Corp., among others.In an exclusive interview with BusinessWorld, Mr. Porter shares some ofhis insights into gaining a real competitive advantage.BusinessWorld (BW): What is the formula for competitive advantage youspeak of?Michael Porter (MP): It's hard to give it in a sentence. The simplestway of saying it is that competitive advantage grows out of choosing tobe unique in some way in your business. And choosing to be unique meansthat you must limit yourself by not doing everything in the industry.But by choosing to do a few things that you want to be special at.That's the essence of competitive advantage. Not spreading yourself toothin. Like what most companies do. Basically, in the Philippines wherethere are so many opportunities and so much growth, there is a verystrong pressure to just pursue all these great ideas.BW: You say one has to find a niche for the company?MP: Well its not necessarily a niche. It can serve quite a wide market.But you got to find a particular kind of value that you are offering toyour customers. It might be many customers. It might be just a fewcustomers. And I talked today about the different ways of creating aunique position. But all of them require a choice. All of them requireyou to make trade-offs. You gonna do this but not that. You have todeliberately choose not to serve certain customers, not to offercertain features.BW: In one of your articles you expounded on environmental aspect ofdoing business. You mentioned resource productivity which manycompanies apparently do not want to waste money on. But how do you viewthe situation when one firm tackles sustainable development and theother does not? Isn't this environmental thing supposed to be aconcerted effort? Won't an effort of one cancel out the other?MP: I think what we believe from looking at many products and servicesis that actually environmental improvements lead to greater efficiencyon the part of the company. Sometimes in the short term there is atransition while the company is learning to do something a differentway. So, its cost may be higher in the short term. But in the longterm, less pollution usually needs lower cost. Because pollution iswaste. So, I believe that its just good business for companies to bethinking about how to eliminate or reduce their emissions, and theirdischarges and their dumping. Because if they do that, they will betaking steps that will also improve the utilization of raw materials.And make them more efficient. Now, there is an issue of one companycompeting in an environmentally unsound way and not face any sanctions.And another company is forced to meet certain standards. And therebeing not a level playing field. I do think cases like that exist. Butwhat we found more and more is that the company that is beingenvironmentally unsound actually won't be successful in the long-run.And even in developing countries, countries shouldn't delay theintroduction of environmental standards because they simply reinforcethe process of economic development. Just like karma, you get it in theend.BW: Aside from environment, what other issues should companies todayseriously consider in doing business, those they have been ignoring fora long time?MP: I think that companies in the Philippines need really developedstrategies. They've been opportunistic. They've been doing a lot ofdeals. They've been moving in a lot of fields. They need clearstrategies we're talking of. Number two, I think it's gonna beincreasingly necessary for companies here to at least compete in theregion not just in the country. Thirdly, as I said in the seminar, it'sgonna be necessary to change the nature of the strategic alliances thatcompanies do. I think historically companies in countries like thePhilippines have relied too heavily on their foreign partners. They'regonna have to move to develop more internal capability and bettertechnology. I also believe that almost every company that's diversifiedprobably is gonna need to get more focused. That, for me, are the bigfour issues.BW: Do you discourage alliance with foreign partners?MP: I'm arguing that those alliances need to be shifting in theircharacter. They need to be more selective. They need to give thePhilippine company the opportunity to sell its own brand. In someinternational markets, they need to create more room for Philippinecompanies to start to move to more sophisticated strategies. Alliancesare still gonna be indispensable tools for bringing in technology,bringing in skills, getting access to an international marketing. WhatI'm really saying is that the alliances of five years ago are gonnahave to be changed.BW: How do you view this situation wherein developing countries areracing with much-developed economies and they are faced with prospectof depleting much-abused resources. How do you strike a balance?MP: Again, I believe that the process of successful economicdevelopment requires the country to learn not to deplete its resources.So, for example, one of the problems the Philippines has is in avariety of industries, because of poor regulatory climate and so forth.You're depleting assets like fishing grounds. That kind of strategydon't support increasing economic development. What you need to do isyou need to have a regulatory environment that says no, you can't fishanymore than the fishing stock will permit. And that's a sign thecountry is getting more developed. It has policies and regulations thatencourage conservation and renewal of resources. And ensure theresources are not wasted. The prices set for resources aremarket-driven prices so companies don't waste them. In a lot ofcountries, the countries give away mineral deposits or timber rights.But that's a bad policy. If government owns the land they should besetting prices for timber that are (raw) prices. And that forces thecompany to learn how to be more efficient. I don't think its inevitablethat resource-depletion will occur with economic development. In fact,I think that successful economic development demands that the countrylearns how to avoid depleting resources.BW: I just want to play devil's advocate. Don't you agree with JurassicPark where one of the characters - the scientist - said the earth cantake care of itself?MP: I think the earth can take of itself only if... I think one cancreate an environment and... where we humans do unnecessary damage. Andsee, I think its good business to not deplete the earth's resources. Ithink if we can just get intellectually, the right framework. And if wecan get governments to understand that there's actually quite a brightfuture for the earth.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Housing funds released to banksfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) chief executive officer andpresident Zorayda Amelia C.

It was developed to ensure maximum efficiency,comfort and aesthetic beauty to what will become architecturallandmarks," said Gus Haxton, Jardine Schindler Elevator Corp. generalmanager."Now the Miconic 10TM enhances the Schindler 700's performance bytelling passengers what elevator they should ride before they approachthe car."The Miconic 10TM has a hall call control system. Passengers enter thenumber of their destination floor on a keypad installed in the elevatorlobby. The system will then assign an elevator and display it on asmall screen.The assignment is based on the passenger's known destination. Crowdingin the car and lobby is then avoided, as well as rushing to the nearestelevator door that opens.Mr. Haxton said, "This system also ensures lesser landing stops duringthe journey because the elevator knows how many will be in the car andwhere its occupants are headed. Passengers will then get to theirfloors faster and more comfortably.

However, the Department of PublicWorks and Highways (DPWH) supposedly failed to submit its list ofto-be-constructed national bridges.This is after several national and local officials approached DPWH andthe Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) clamoring forthe inclusion of several areas in the list of project beneficiaries.DPWH and DILG were expecting Malacanang's approval of the list ofbeneficiaries this month. It may be noted the P1.3-billion project isto be financed by the United Kingdom which is expected to release theproject loan this September.In August, UK ambassador to the Philippines Adrian Thorpe and ForeignAffairs Secretary Siazon signed an agreement involving the firsttranche of the loan totalling P360 million.Of the P1.3 billion total project cost, 80% or P1.03 billion will beshouldered by the United Kingdom, 35% of which is deemed a grant to thePhilippine government.The DILG is taking charge of 134 local bridges under the program whilethe DPWH will oversee the construction and rehabilitation of some 73national bridges. It may be noted the bridge program involves theinstallation of some 8,000 meters of pre-fabricated steel bridgesnationwide. It will cover 12 regions and 34 provinces.Materials for bridges will be procured from Mabey & Johnson Limited, asteel bridge producer endorsed by the UK government.Under the original project timetable, the construction of bridgesshould be completed by September 1997.

Murga, PCA president."The heavier requirements for infrastructure investments to support theregion's growth is tremendous," he added.He said government construction projects will account for 43% of totalconstruction demand in the 1996-1998 period.The PCA president noted under the 1993-1998 Medium Term PhilippineDevelopment Plan, the government's infrastructure program requirementwas placed at P594.7 billion.Of the amount, 45% will go to energy, power and electrification; 31% totransportation and 15% to water resources.He also noted residential construction will dominate the private sectorin the coming years given the expected strong demand for affordablehousing.In the urban centers, major projects such as Fort Bonifacio, OrtigasComplex, and several projects in Makati are taking shape.Business activity in urbanizing places such as Cebu, Davao, Baguio,Subic, General Santos will also contribute to the sustained demand forprivate buildings, he said.The PCA is recognized by the government as the active voice of theconstruction industry, and is often consulted by government on policymatters.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Quezon City property values up by 100%from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17By Cecille E. YapJoining the rush of local government units providing for increases inproperty assessment in their respective areas, the Quezon City councilpassed recently Ordinance 357 which provides for as much as a 100% hikein the fair market value of real estate in the city.The increase is expected to pave the way for an increase in the city'sreal property tax collections.It may be noted Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code allowslocal governments to revise property assessments by preparing a new"schedule of fair market values" for different classes of real estatein their respective areas.Provided, however, the new schedule is enacted through an ordinancepassed by the city or municipal council.Under the ordinance, the new schedule pertains to the fair market valueonly of raw land. The city government has yet to formulate a newschedule for property assessment which covers raw land as well asimprovements thereon."The Quezon City government is in need of funds to cover the cost ofthe increasing basic and essential requirements for a rapidly growingpopulation and a highly accelerated urbanization," noted City Ordinance357.Under the ordinance, property assessments are expected to rise by 15%in areas classified as residences and by as much as 40% in areasfalling under commercial and industrial classification.Also, fair market value of real estate in residential areas is placedat between P1,500 and P3,500 per square meter. Commercial areas,meanwhile, is appraised between P4,000 and P6,000 per square meter.Fair market value of real estate used for hotels and residential andcommercial condominiums is placed between P6,000 and P11,000 per squaremeter, depending on the type.Meanwhile, real estate used for restaurants, schools, funeral parlors,gasoline stations, motels, gymnasiums and other recreational centers isvalued between P2,000 and P9,000 per square meter.The ordinance noted the last time the Quezon City government undertooka general revision of the schedule of real property assessment was in1981. Thus, such assessment is now considered unrealistic and obsolete.Data obtained from Quezon City Hall also showed revenue from realproperty taxes increased by as much as 300% from 1994 to 1996.In 1994, real property taxes collected totalled P267.6 million. In1995, this rose to P665 million.This year, the city council expects the tax collection to slightly dropto P626 million due to lesser penalty collections.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Stork Group inks pact to make aircraft partsfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22Stork Group subsidiary Fokker Elmo has signed a contract with AVIC(Aviation Industries of China) subsidiaries China Precision EngineeringInstitute (CPEI) and China National Airborne Equipment Corporation(CNAEC) to manufacture complex electrical wire harnesses for aircraftfor the benefit of both the Chinese and Western aviation industries.The joint venture (60% Fokker Elmo shareholding), named Lang FangFokker Corp., is also the basis for the development and manufacturingof electrical systems for future Chinese aircraft programs, such as the100-seat regioliner.

From a think-tank conducting research ineconomics and business, it set up a graduate school, and a liberal artscollege, all in just 25 years. More recently, people have been talkingabout its unique program-graduating in just five years with a master'sdegree.The former Center for Research and Communication has kept true to itsold name. And just like its flagship, the Institute of Communication isalready setting its sails to establish the School of Communication(SCM).The Institute of Communication is just one of the many schools that theUniversity will set up. Right now, it offers undergraduate studies inCommunication focused on Advertising. Next year, it will already beoffering its five-year program in Advertising.Surprisingly for a young program, barely six years old, the Instituteis already making a name for itself. Its faculty, for instance, iscomposed mainly of notable practitioners from the industry. J.J.Calero, CEO and chairman of J. Walter Thompson and Antonio Mercado,chairman of Basic Advertising, have been teaching in the Institute foralmost two years now. Even today, more distinguished practitioners havecome to form part of the faculty. Some are CEOs and presidents ofmultinational advertising agencies while others are entrepreneurs andpioneers of their own agency. So students also learn to have that nosefor business and to value that skill of private enterprise.The Institute believes in a theoretical and practical approach tolearning. That is why students are given a more first-hand and holisticapproach to education. In fact, the program's curriculum was patternedafter the International Advertising Association, the only globalpartnership of advertisers, agencies, media and marketingcommunications professionals. So the program is not only practical, butalso meets international standards.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Bankard launches double return promofrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22Bankard, Inc., the leading domestic credit card company and issuer ofBankard One, the world's first installment smart card, offers its morethan 41,000 Bankard One cardholders the chance to win back twice theamount of money they spent on their installment purchases using theirBankard One through Bankard One's "Double Your Money Offer" rafflepromo.With this promo, a Bankard One cardholder who purchases a televisionset worth P10,000 will get the chance to win P20,000 in cash.Cardholders who make their purchases during the "Double Your MoneyOffer" promo period from July 1 to December 31 are automaticallyincluded in the six monthly raffles plus the grand raffle draw.

GarciaHave you ever looked at a dollar bill and wondered if it was fake?Roughly 55% of the $360 billion currently in circulation is held bypeople outside the United States, according to regional magazine Asia,Inc. It said nearly $135 million worth of bogus bills were confiscatedoutside the US in 1994, up from just $30 million two years earlier.At the rate demand is rising as a result of increased consumerism andglobalization, don't be surprised if one of these bogus bills lands inyour hand one of these days."The sheer ubiquity of the US currency which has had essentially thesame size, color and configuration since 1929, makes it a primarytarget for counterfeiters," Asia, Inc. reported. And the $100 bill,which accounts for around 60% of the US currency in circulation, hasbeen the most frequently faked.Color copiers, laser printers and high-tech graphics software makebanknotes easier to copy. Computer programs can be designed to generaterandom or sequential serial numbers in the bills.Growing concern over rampant counterfeiting prompted the US FederalReserve Bank to come out with new tamper-resistant bills, starting withthe $100 bill early this year.In a brief on the new dollar bill, the Fed said "the noticeable changein appearance of the dollar bill represents ongoing commitment toprotect the US currency."Among the 14 features incorporated in the new design were an enlargedoff-center portrait of Benjamin Franklin, a polyester security threadrunning through the paper, a translucent watermark, and inks thatchange colors when viewed from different angles.Despite these efforts, many say the US dollar bill continues to beunder threat.In the Philippines, Bangko Sentral has launched an informationcampaign. It holds training seminars for bank tellers, cashiers, branchmanagers and even auditors, and promotes the use of simple, easy-to-useinstruments to check the authenticity of the dollar bills freelyentering the financial system.Training sessions on basic information like the identification ofcounterfeit money can last for a day, while sessions on the commonlyused modus operandi of counterfeiting and measures to counteract themcan last for a week, said Bangko Sentral bank officer Maja Gratia L.Malic."We do not just provide training sessions to anybody interested. Theymust have proper endorsement," Ms. Malic said."We are careful in giving out information as this may be passed on tocounterfeiters themselves... We request participants not to talk aboutthe finer details of their training," she explained.In the training sessions, trainees are also taught how to use basicinstruments in detecting the authenticity of banknotes.These include hand-held lens for examining fine prints and machineswith ultraviolet light which brings out the fluorescent parts of thedollar bills."These are very easy to acquire and benefits outnumber the costs on thepart of the banks. There are also more advanced instruments availableto them which they can acquire at a higher cost," said Henry N. Eisma,Bangko Sentral deputy director for cash.An eyepiece or a simple lens costs around P70 while a desktopultraviolet light can be had at P300 a piece. On the other hand, a moresophisticated machine may cost several thousands of pesos, Mr. Eismasaid.Officials said there has been a substantial drop in the volume ofcounterfeit money the central bank has retrieved.In 1991, there were 5,920 pieces of counterfeit dollar bills estimatedto cost $583,266 that were accumulated, Bangko Sentral documents show.Last year, the volume dwindled to 837 pieces worth $73,630. As ofAugust 1996, Bangko Sentral's cash department, soliciting the help ofthe US Secret Service, accumulated 497 fake bills worth $39,000.Requests to establish the authenticity of the bills usually come fromindividuals, police authorities and owners of large establishments. Thecentral bank then issues a certificate verifying the authenticity ofthe bills.Among the establishments which regularly approach Bangko Sentral arehotels, the Shoemart and Rustan's department store chains, duty-freeshops, the Philippine Amusements and Gaming Corp., and Laguna-basedtheme park Enchanted Kingdom, Mr. Eisma said.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996PDCP Bank bares expansion plansfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9By Dulce J.

All of these are,thankfully, in the traditional form of sculpture. One can actually knowwhat they are meant to be. We have yet to witness anyone attemptingmodern art by welding together those frightful airline butter packs.Of course, it is the active competitions that I enjoy. Watching any manpracticing an art that he has spent many years of his life inperfecting is always a joy. Watching these chefs in action is actuallyexciting. One wonder as to when one of our restaurants will emulatethat now proving popular in London aptly named "Chef's Table." As youare all aware, London and some of its "top people" can display acertain snobbishness, especially in restaurants. To be known by thePatron and shown to the best table displays one's importance to therest of the world. The best table used to be the one in the corner orby the window, where one could see and more importantly be seen byeveryone. That has all changed. To really be "in" one is now offeredthe one and only table that is set up in the kitchen. Here, the chefwill recommend and personally prepare the food and have the correctwines served. All the while, you and your guests can watch him inaction and receive his personal service. Nobody can see you, however,but they all are aware that you are there. A lovely idea though, if onecan afford it as I understand the bill tends to match the meal. Atleast at COP one can watch the chefs in action, even if only the judgesget to try the end result.I read a rather amusing but true story this week about one amateur cookwho had a distressing experiencing. In 1987, a lady, a cottage dwellerin Dartmoor, Devon, popped some scones into the oven and completelyforgot about them.An hour later, just as she was stepping into the bath, she suddenlyrecalled them. Without even grabbing a towel, she dashed stark nakedinto the kitchen and while gripping the oven handle, she heard a knockon the back door. Being in the country, she knew that if it was thebaker and if she didn't answer, he would automatically let himself inand put the bread on the table. In a panic, she nipped into the broomcupboard.Hiding in the darkness, she heard the latch click and footstepscrossing the kitchen, whereupon the cupboard door was opened by thegasman who had come to read the meter. "Oh," said the woman, "I wasexpecting the baker." When she got out, the scones were burnt as well.Some newspaper columnists have of late indulged in attackingrestaurants for their practice of charging the full 10% VAT on thefinal account. Their argument is that the customer should only pay thesame as that remitted by the restaurant owner to the BIR, which isapproximately 6%. This is, of course, nonsense. The reason that thepatron is only remitting the 6% to the BIR is that he has already given4% to his supplier. If he treated this 4% as a cost, we, the consumer,would be considerably worse off. As a simple example to prove thepoint, he pays the supplier P100 plus P10 VAT. He now adds his wages,overheads and profit and sells this to us at P200 plus VAT. We havepaid him P20 in VAT. He deducts the P10 he has already given thesupplier and remits P10 to the BIR. Thus, the full P20 has beenremitted. His mark up is 100% on cost. Should he treat his totalsupplier's invoice as cost, then his selling price to ourselves wouldbe P220 plus VAT. Instead of our total bill being P220 as under thepresent system, it would now become P242. I suggest to all campaignersthat it is a subject best left alone.Most columnists delight in starting rumors. Pickwick, however, delightsin ending them. For months, rumors have been flying that probably themost famous and popular watering hole for both foreigners and Filipinosalike was, after 15 years, about to close its doors. Indeed, part ofthe rumors were true, that being that as so many other businesses inMakati, the owners were being subjected to rapacious and unrealisticdemands for lease renewal. While the property market contains so muchheat, as is currently the case, we will witness many food and beverageoutlets closing their doors in the coming years, especially in theMakati district. Property owners are failing to understand thatrestaurant customers will only frequent an establishment if its pricesare considered reasonable. Thus, there is a ceiling to what can becharged and still attract customers. There is a mathematical percentageof gross turnover that is the maximum one can pay for the business toremain viable. Demands in excess of this mean closure.It is true that prolonged negotiations over the lease of thisestablishment did put the business in danger of closure and thus nofurther investment was made by the owners. This danger is not only nowover, but the establishment is now ensured of a further ten yearstenure. Regular customers may experience some inconvenience however assome extensive refurbishment will be undertaken to bring it to thestandards demanded by today's market. A new general manager has beenappointed whose plans for both cuisine and entertainment are reallyquite exciting. For those of us who have used the facilities for manyyears, it has become part of our personal history and we can now beassured of it remaining so. Thus endeth the rumor!Well, the best made plans for mice and men so oft they go astray. Someweeks ago, during the daytime, my driver had taken me through an areanear Cubao which seemingly contained a number of restaurants thatappeared could well be of interest. I have ventured to my good ladywife that we should visit this area one evening to sample the offeredcuisine. Whether the gods are interfering with my plans, I know not. Itwould seem, however, that every time we plan for this outing, theheavens open and the earth is deluged with rain. Full knowing that theill-drained streets of this metropolis will provide the inevitablefloods that not only cause inconvenience but drain many hours from anotherwise useful life, we thus become reluctant to undertake such ajourney. We are thus committed, until the dry season commences, to onlyexplore within striking distance of our home. As we have covered thisbeat for well over a year, it is becoming increasingly difficult tofind an establishment at which we have not dined. It was a relief,therefore, to find a relatively new restaurant right in the heart ofGreenbelt, albeit offering Chinese cuisine, that of South Villa.South Villa is not only new, it is bright, very, very bright. Thelighting is almost intense and with large uncurtained windows on twosides, is not an establishment to be considered for an intimate mealwith one's paramour, not as though Pickwick would indulge in suchactivity, I hasten to add. The tables are well set, sparkling whitetablecloths, excellent linen and available condiments such as soy andhot sauce available.The menu is not extensive, but interesting. I am unable to tell you asto the province of China from which the type of dishes emulate. It didnot appear to be Cantonese and definitely not that area that I cannever spell correctly but phonetically sounds like, "Says one." (That'sSzechuan. - Ed.) I did ask the Filipino waiter as to where the food wasfrom and he answered, "China." An observant young man, one would think.The range of soups offered was indeed extensive. My good lady wifeselected her favorite Chicken and Corn soup. A good portion presented,but what can one say about Chicken and Corn soup except I admonishedher for failing our readers in the face of such alternatives. AsShakespeare might of said on a decidedly off day, "The soup was good."I had decided on the Beef and Tomato soup and was very pleasantlysurprised. The liquid was thin, but tasty. Quarters of peeled, freshtomatoes were aplenty, amongst which were thin strips of very tenderbeef. The whole was both tasty yet delicate, one of the better soupsthat I have had for a long time. Very, very good.As usual, for our main dishes, we, like all others, selected far toomuch. The menu lists prices for three sizes. I had started to selectthe "Medium" when the waiter politely suggested that for just the twoof us, the small would probably be sufficient. How correct he turnedout to be. The portion of the "Small" is indeed generous.We ordered the Beef with Macadamia Nuts. A delightful combination thatalso contained well prepared vegetables. I adore macadamias, as long assomeone else has opened them. During our sojourn in Australia, at oneplace, we were staying, a tree was in the garden. We would collect thenuts, but the shells are the toughest thing in nature. Normalnutcrackers just snap, hammering them is dangerous as they shoot off,unbroken at any angle. If you do succeed with the hammer, the nut tendsto also be smashed and mixed with bits of shell. The solution turnedout to be the vice in the garage.I digress. The beef was tasty chunks and very tender. The nuts weredelicious and probably the hardest thing that I have ever attempted topick up with chopsticks.We had ordered the rice Fookien style. I would suggest that if you areaccompanied by a lady from the general area of Pampanga, as I was, withmy good lady wife, then you order this by pointing it on the menu. Alook of absolute shock came over her face as she misinterpreted mywords. (Only Filipinos with a knowledge of filthy language willunderstand this comment.) The rice, which is what we would refer to asfried rice, was particularly good and tasty. Good texture and moist,with various vegetables finely chopped. For me, the good thing aboutthis was that it was also served in individual bowls. This allowed methe luxury of spooning the beef dish on top, thus not only enjoying thedish but even adding more flavor to the rice.We had ordered Seafood Rolls, and again, be warned, the "Small" portioncontains eight quite large pieces. The rolls have a crispy, deep-friedcover. Inside, they contain chopped squid and shrimp, with some finelychopped carrot and probably celery. Unfortunately, they have alsoincluded mayonnaise, a sauce of which I am not particularly fond, whosecreaminess overwhelms the seafood flavor. A dish of mayonnaise isprovided as an extra dip. Our American cousins, who tend to have apenchant for this type of dressing, would probably enjoy them, but theyare not for me, nor even my good lady wife.We had also requested the roast pigeon. A pigeon chopped into quarterswas delivered with crisp noodles. A rich dark meat which I enjoy. Ifeel a little revenge when eating pigeon, revenge against all of thatbreed of bird that has throughout my life indicated that they wouldlike to purchase my motor vehicle. Well, they at least leave a depositon it and it is there in black and white. My good lady wife found themeat very tough. I thoughtfully informed her that in England pigeonswere allowed to hang in the garden until it was maggot-ridden and thismade the meat very tender. She, with an unusually pale face asked howone removed the maggots. Upon being informed that one didn't bother asthey had been consuming the meat and therefore tasted the same, shedecided upon a visit to the comfort room. Being married to me hasdecidedly improved her general knowledge.I had consumed two glasses of the Paul Masson Chablis wine during themeal, which was not that bad at all. It definitely goes well withChinese cuisine.While I indulged in Chinese tea, my good lady wife tasted the MangoPuree which she declared delicious. To the delight of our driver, thefairly good portion of the meal that we had failed to consume waspacked for takeaway and we paid our bill of just over P1,500. Very goodvalue.Overall, we had a pleasant meal served by polite and friendly staff. Tobe fair to other cuisines though, Chinese can really never be describedas fine dining, so an award of two top hats is a reasonable assessment.Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESSWORLD (MANILA) via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1996Quezon City"s little secretfrom BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 23By Vladimir S. BunoanAlthough it boasts of a popular restaurant row in Tomas Morato Avenue,home of several old-time favorites like Mario's and Alfredo's SteakHouse, Quezon City doesn't enjoy the same reputation as Makati - andnow the Ortigas Center - when it comes to fine dining.Its restaurants, although doing great business among the many residentsin this part of the town, are generally old-fashioned, which meanshaving menus filled with such classic Filipino fine dining staples assteaks and Caesar Salad. Generally, restaurants in Makati are moreadventurous when it comes to their menus, and with the growingsophistication of Filipino diners, many establishments in Quezon Cityseem dated.But there is one restaurant in Quezon City that is breaking all thepreconceived notions about eateries north of Makati. Established lessthan a year ago, Blue Bacon and Green Eggs has proven that the QuezonCity crowd is just as discriminating as the expense-account foodies ofMakati.While positive word-of-mouth has tempted diners from as far away asAntipolo and Alabang to check out the restaurant, thisdeli-cum-restaurant has built a loyal following among those who eitherlive or work in Quezon City, including celebrities like Pops Fernandez,Ogie Alcasid, and Gelli de Belen, who proudly calls it her "secretlittle place."Increasingly, however, more and more are let in on this secret. Foodcritics like Doreen Fernandez have been generous with praise and arepersonally recommending it to their friends. In the latest edition ofthe Fodor's Guide to Manila, Blue Bacon and Green Eggs made it to thelist of restaurants for tourists to try.That the restaurant is not located on a major street (it sits offBalete Drive, on Lantana Street corner Boston, almost right across theBoston Gallery) makes its success even more noteworthy. In a businesswhere "location, location, location" is considered a mantra, Blue Baconand Green Eggs seems to be more attuned to the "If you build it, theywill come" school of thought.For owner Mike Prado, that seems to be an apt motto. A businessman whomade his fortune in exporting furniture and home accessories, Mr. Pradobelieves that his entry into the food business is providential.A member of the Catholic Charismatic Movement, Mr. Prado noticed thathis exports were not doing as well as before, and in fact seemed to beon the decline. At the point, he prayed and asked God if he shouldstart looking at other businesses.Mr. Prado had dabbled in businesses other than exports. He onceproduced a musical called By George!, a musical tribute to Americancomposer George Gershwin, which was directed by his good friend, BehnCervantes. It was staged at the Metropolitan Theater in 1991. Althoughhe said he didn't lose money on that venture, he feels the theaterscene then didn't have the momentum it seems to be enjoying these days.Mr. Prado admits that his biggest dream was to one day open arestaurant. His friends attest to his skills in entertaining guests athis home. He had the interest although he candidly admits that hedidn't know a thing about opening and running a restaurant.He was asking for a sign from God, although the idea of putting up arestaurant had become increasingly tempting. He knew that the signwould be in the form of flowers, and one day a nun gave him a bouquetof white roses for the little chapel within his residential compound.He knew this was the sign he was waiting for ("Let's face it, a mandoesn't get flowers," he said). Immediately, he called up his architectand had the restaurant built.Everything, he said, just fell into place, as if indeed it was beingguided by a greater power. He had no problems in staffing, the supplierfor the delicatessen even agreed to give a two-week seminar for theemployees, and he got chefs who were trained in Le Souffle. ("I didn'tpirate them," he stressed.)Sans the usual publicity blitz that accompanies restaurant openings,satisfied customers spread the word and quickly the restaurant with thefunny name and the unusual location became a surprise hit. From a small30-seater restaurant inside the deli, it has since been expanded toaccommodate around 100 guests, scattered in three areas. The originaldining area beside the deli, an al fresco garden setting with views oflush greenery and a small waterfall (also the smoking area), andanother air-conditioned area, which was rushed to accommodate thevolume of Valentine's Day reservations.(About the name, he explained he didn't know of the Dr. Seuss book,Green Eggs and Ham, until after he opened the restaurant, and deniedthat he is affiliated with La Salle and Ateneo. "Bacon and Eggs" wasalready decided on, but he literally added more color to the way itsound.)Mr. Prado believes there are two important elements in the restaurant'ssuccess - creativity and consistency. As the restaurant is connected toa deli, the chefs have more ingredients to play around with. Forinstance, Mr. Prado is proud that his is the only one in Quezon Citythat offers goose liver (done pan-fried with scallops and served withgoat cheese, Parma ham, lettuce and Madeira dressing). A new additionto the menu is Penne al Gorgonzola, a pasta dish flavored with thestrong Gorgonzola cheese plus Parmesan, with strips of garlic Italiansausage, sundried tomatoes and fresh cream.The menu is quite extensive, offering the usual deli sandwiches andcold cuts, a long list of pasta dishes, and chef's specialties, plus avariety of desserts, imported beer, souffles and coffee.Mr. Prado, whose office is just next door to the restaurant, is nowmaking sure of the consistency. He is aware that the usual pitfall ofrestaurant owners is expanding too fast, and he is careful not to betempted by this success.He states confidently that he will continue with his export business,which has since rebounded, thus calming the fears of his export clientsthat he has not turned into a full-time restaurateur. He is, in fact,planning to put up an IKEA-style furniture shop to cater to newhomeowners.He is also thinking of converting another section of his compound intoa ballroom for shows and family-style entertainment.Who says you can't have the best of both worlds?Copyright 1996 BusinessworldBack to Headline List WT03-B04-5IA086-000616-B001-126http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it125.html 205.156.212.5 19970122023140 text/html 65686HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:29:35 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:27 GMTContent-length: 65499Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it125.html Sample Issue Copyright THE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNet October 13, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Cambodia: Inside the KR: Innocent people tortured into confessing to 'crimes' and executed by the Pol Pot regime (899 words) Cambodia: Govt appeals for help as floods worsen (197 words) Cambodia: Floods hit 1.3 million people (569 words) Cambodia: US$5 mil needed for flood relief operations (591 words) Cambodia: Appeal for donations (112 words) Cambodia: When it rains, it pours (469 words) Cambodia: Willy brings the rain that causes the floods (321 words) Cambodia: Reprieve illegal workers (888 words) Cambodia: US may help rebuild highway (127 words) Cambodia: Abortions a major cause of death (432 words) Cambodia: King donates bicycles (97 words) Cambodia: Only one school (82 words) Cambodia: 'leng Sary had no power' (191 words) Cambodia: 25 killed by mines in three provinces (390 words) Cambodia: No more lessons on genocide (744 words) Cambodia: Charting the nation's course (700 words) Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace (108 words) Cambodia: CICP mission statement (146 words) Cambodia: Destruction of mines on record (285 words) Cambodia in nuke ban treaty (113 words) Cambodia: It's only natural (1054 words) Cambodia: No let-up on illegal logging: Govt officials and military personnel also involved, says minister (806 words) Funcinpec wants Sirivudh to return to Cambodia (780 words) CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Cambodia: Inside the KR: Innocent people tortured into confessing to'crimes' and executed by the Pol Pot regimefrom THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996Chiep MonyMany innocent people were tortured into confessing to various "crimes"against the state during the four-year genocidal regime under the KhmerRouge.After confessing, these people were summarily executed. Among those whohad fallen victim were officials of the Sangkum Reastr Niyum era of thethen-Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Republican regime of Lon Nol, anyonebelieved to be an intellectual, such as students and teachers, as wellas all the civil servants of the previous governments.Others who were considered "unimportant" people to the Pol Potists werenot even interrogated after being arrested by the authorities. They werejust executed immediately, said former Khmer Rouge information officerNhem Ein.Nhem Ein met with the Cambodia Times again last week and revealed thestories of the Khmer Rouge rule between 1975 and 1979.He said that to monitor the many interrogations and executionsthrough-out the country, the Pol Pot government had set up the Toul Slengtorture centre in 1977."The chief of the centre was Duch, his deputy was Hea while the personin charge of translating documents from Vietnamese to Khmer was Chan,"he said.He said the three men led the executions carried out at the centre byreceiving orders direct from the central Khmer Rouge leadership.Toul Sleng, measuring a square km, was the main Khmer Rouge interrogationand torture centre and could be considered the ministry of interiorduring the guerilla regime.Nhem Ein said the men at the centre were assigned a special mission to"destroy the internal enemies" of the Khmer Rouge.He said these "enemies" were normally people who were suspected of beingCIA or KGB spies or Vietnamese agents deployed in Cambodia. There werealso other "secret agents" who were "attempting to act against the PolPot regime".He said the Khmer Rouge personnel at the Toul Sleng centre were alsoassigned to look for officials who had worked for the Prince Sihanoukregime or the Lon Nol government and to file charges against them.Nhem Ein said that under the maoist and dictatorial leadership of PolPot, the Khmer Rouge had also created a "formula" to determine who wereintellectuals and to execute them."As a result, students and teachers, as well as officials who had workedfor the Prince Sihanouk and Lon Nol governments were arrested andexecuted.He said the Khmer Rouge devised various methods to interrogate prisoners."Some victims had their nails removed, others were electrocuted, somewere forced to drink fish brine, or had water poured into their noses,while yet others were starved," he said."In fact, the interrogations were so cruel most of the prisoners endedup confessing to crimes they did not commit," Nhem Ein said. "They couldnot stand the suffering any more."He said those who were regarded as unimportant persons were also arrestedbut they were not interrogated. "Photographs of the victims would betaken and they would be sent for execution immediately," he said.Nhem Ein said the victims could be killed in any one of the prisons inToul Sleng, Prey Sar, Prek Hou or Choeung Ek.He said that when youths were arrested, they were sent for executionwithout their photographs being taken. However, if they were governmentofficials or military officers, their pictures were taken and sent asevidence to the Khmer Rouge leadership.Nhem Ein said the Khmer Rouge officers worked day and night to tortureand question the victims.He said that in mid-1978, 30 Thai fishermen and three Europeans wereexecuted at the Toul Sleng centre.He said random executions were also carried out against popular singers.One was a famous singer Chhorn, who was ordered to sing the DemocraticKampuchea songs together with Mai, a woman artiste.Nhem Ein believes that another well-known singer Sin Sisamuth, known forhis "golden voice" was executed in either Prey Sar or the Tonle Batiprison in 1976.He said the singer had been executed for singing songs from the SangkumReastr Niyum era while working in the padi fields. These songs had beenbanned by the Khmer Rouge.Also purged and killed were the commanders of Divisions 18 to 24, namelyHuo Nim, Vorn Vet, Hock, Chek An, Nat and a general Som. These were thepeople who led the resistance movement in the 1970s. A former informationofficer close to Huo Nim was also killed."Also executed were several commanders accused of being CIA or KGB spiesor Vietnamese agents such as Sok, Ya, Chakry, Nhem Phoem and Sy," NhemEin said.He said another objective of Pol Pot was to screen all students andintellectuals and information on them was documented."The data and pictures of these students could fill 20 bus-loads," hesaid."The students were called the "newly-liberated" people or the "17 April"people. They were regarded as important and were sent to prison in PhnomPenh."Those who were found to be involved in education were executedimmediately because they were thought to be in the way of the regime toachieve its dream of a nation of agrarians," Nhem Ein added.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Cambodia: Govt appeals for help as floods worsenfrom THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996The Royal Government of Cambodia has sent out an urgent appeal forassistance as the floods continue to worsen in several parts of thekingdom.This year's floods, the worst in several years, have since taken 16lives, and up to 1.3 million people are believed to have been affected.Seven people have been reported missing and at least 500,000 people, whoare in the worst hit areas, require emergency assistance.The government estimates that it needs more than US$5 million to carryout relief operations and it is appealing for donations in cash, kind andservices to help the victims.The deluge has since affected six provinces that lie in the Mekong basin,namely Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Kratie, Kompong Cham, Kandal and PreyVeng, as well as the outskirts of Phnom Penh.In addition, at least 232,000 hectares of rice fields have been floodedand the government reported that about 120,000 hectares have beendestroyed in the floods.A total of 25 cases of diarrhea and vomiting have also been reported inone village.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Cambodia: Floods hit 1.3 million peoplefrom THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996Cheang SophengA total of 1.3 million people from six provinces have been affected bythe floods this year, and at least 500,000 of them require emergency aid.The victims are from the provinces of Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Kratie,Kompong Cham, Kandal and Prey Veng, which are located along the MekongRiver.Also affected are those living on the outskirts of the capital city,Phnom Penh.Most of the victims have been evacuated to higher ground or have madetheir own way to areas which are still not flooded.However, the worst may already be over. Reports received from theaffected areas showed that the water level is already receding, albeitslowly, though the situation is still grave.Vast areas cultivated with padi have also been badly affected by thefloods. Based on reports received from the affected provinces, thegovernment estimates that a total of 232,000 hectares of padi fields havebeen affected.Of the total area, an estimated 120,000ha of padi fields, located closestto the Mekong River, have been destroyed.Figures that have reached Phnom Penh from the affected provinces showthat in Kompong Cham province, 25,212ha of padi fields have beendestroyed. In Kandal province, farmers lost 9,200ha and in Prey Veng,another 50,000ha have been destroyed.Details on the damage caused in the other provinces are expected to bemade available by the government this week.The governor of Kompong Cham, Hun Neng, said the floods had affected atleast one third of the population who live in 12 of the 16 districts inthe province.He said 274 dwellings in the province were already under water, and28,960ha of padi fields have been badly damaged by the floods.He estimated that about 2,400 tonnes of rice seeds would be needed fornext year's planting season.Hun Neng said a stretch of 150m on the National Route 6, between PhnomPenh and Kompong Cham, as well as a bridge, have already been damaged bythe floods.Stretches along National Route 7 which runs through Kompong Cham town,have also been severely damaged.The governor of Prey Veng, Tep Nonary, said five districts in hisprovince have been seriously affected by the floods and more than50,000ha of padi fields have been destroyed.

Hisfamily lost everything except two sacks of rice which they managed tocarry with them.A week later, when the food supply was running out, his parents told himthat he had to leave for Phnom Penh to try to get a job.He said he then decided to leave for the capital city with a neighbour,22-year-old Chon Ra, who told him that he could get a job washing carsin Phnom Penh."Chon Ra told me we could earn 12,000 riels per month," he said. "He saidhe could get a job in Phnom Penh but he needed an advance from my family.Finally we agreed to give him 12,000 riels."However, Neun Run said, when they reached Phnom Penh, Chon Ra ran awaywith all the money and he was left for four days without food. "I slepton the roadside and drank water from the potholes. I was living like ananimal," he added.Neun Run said this was his first trip to the capital city and he does nothave any relatives there."I have no alternative now but to go back to my family to help them plantrice after the floods have receded, but I do not have any money fortravelling," he added.Meanwhile, in Prey Veng province, victims told the Cambodia Times thatseveral families were experiencing a shortage of food and medicine.They said 25 people from the village of Angkor Ang had been hit bydiarrhea and were vomiting after eating stale food and drinking dirtywater. However, they have been treated at a local clinic."We will die if there is no emergency supply from the government. We needfood and medicine now," said 48-year-old Chhun Hear.

However, when there is excess water in the Mekong, the water flowsback into the lake, thus preventing areas downstream from being flooded.Lim Kean Hour said Phnom Penh would only be flooded if the water levelin the Tonle Bassac river rises above the 11.2m mark.As of last Friday, the level had reached 10.9m, so excess water couldflow back into the Tonle Sap lake, thus averting floods in the city andareas downstream of the Mekong River, including southern Vietnam, headded.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Cambodia: Reprieve illegal workersfrom THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996Chheang SophengCambodians will be allowed to work in Thailand under an agreement to besigned between the governments of the two countries soon.This move will mean a reprieve for the more than 30,000 Cambodians whoare currently working illegally in the neigbouring kingdom.The relaxation on the import of foreign labour by the Thai governmentwill also cover those from Myanmar and Laos - the other two countrieswhich share common borders with Thailand.The new regulation will also cover those workers from Cambodia, Laos andMyanmar who are at present illegally employed in Thailand.Prasitt Caitong Pan, the director-general of the Thai Department ofEmployment in the Ministry of Social Welfare explained that thegovernment had decided to allow the illegal workers from these countriesto work legally in Thailand because of the geographical proximity betweenthem and their cultural and traditional similarities.Besides, the governments of the four countries have a history ofcooperation and good relations, he added.The Thai government and its Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour havecome up with regulations on how to deal with the illegal workers from thethree countries.An agreement is expected to be signed between the Cambodian authoritiesand their Thai counterparts pertaining to the Cambodians who are nowworking illegally in Thailand.To expedite matters, the Royal Government of Cambodia will be setting upan inter-ministerial committee to study the problem of the Cambodianworkers who are living and working illegally in Thailand.Suy Sem, the Secretary of State for the Cambodian Ministry of SocialWelfare, Labour and Veterans said that it has been decided that once thecommittee's study is completed, the agreement will be signed between theThai and Cambodian authorities to legalise the status of all the illegalworkers from each country working in the other.The regulations will allow Cambodian workers to stay in Thailand for atwo-year period. Thai workers will also be allowed to be employed inCambodia for a similar length of time.After the two years is up, the workers will be sent back to their owncountries.However, those who wish to stay on in Thailand will have to go throughthe correct procedures for obtaining a permit to remain legally inThailand.Prasitt explained that in the case of Cambodian workers who want toremain in Thailand after the two-year period is up, both governments arein the process of drawing up further regulations so that these workerscan continue working in Thailand in accordance with Thai law.These conditions will require all the Cambodian workers in Thailand toregister with the Ministry of Social Welfare within a 90-day period fromSept 1, 1996.The Thai authorities will issue "living permission cards" and workingcards to these individuals. The workers will also be required to pay 500bahts to the Thai Ministry of Social Welfare, 1,000 bahts a year for theworking permission card and another 1,000 bahts as "guarantee fee" whichis refundable after the two years is up.Prasitt added that most of the illegal immigrants in Thailand were fromMyanmar, numbering about 400,000. There are 10,000 from Laos and about200,000 from India, China and Sri Lanka.On the other hand, there are about 1,000 Thai workers in Cambodia, ofwhich only 189 have registered with Cambodia's Department of Labour.Suy Sem said however that all foreign workers who come to Cambodia haveto register with the kingdom's Ministry of Social Welfare. This, ofcourse, includes the illegal Thai workers in Cambodia.Suy Sem explained that there are many legal and illegal workers in thekingdom, most seeking employment with foreign companies, while there areothers who only stay for short periods while waiting for jobs in thirdcountries.The Thai government has said that over 30,000 Cambodian workers haveentered Thailand without the necessary travel documents and are thusillegally employed.Of the total number of illegal workers, about 3,000 are in theconstruction sector, while 2,000 are involved in the agricultural sector.According to the Thai authorities, most of the illegal workers areemployed in the ports or as construction workers, especially in Bangkokand Pra Chun Bory province.Jobs are more easily available in these areas and the workers can earnat least 160 bahts a day.Thai government officials claim that the actual number of illegalCambodian workers could very well be far more than the statistics show.The problem of the illegal workers was discussed last month by Suy Semand Prasitt.According to Prasitt, Thai law now provides for the immediate deportationof illegal workers, whether or not the Cambodian government is aware ofthe situation.Suy Sem, meanwhile, said he will brief the Royal Government on thematter.He added that he personally cannot accept that there are over 30,000illegal Cambodian immigrants living in Thailand.He explained that in any event, his ministry alone cannot deal with theissue and needs the inter-ministerial committee to decide whether or notthe so-called Cambodian illegal workers are indeed Khmer.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Cambodia: US may help rebuild highwayfrom THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996The United States has expressed interest in helping rebuild a nationalhighway to Pailin, an important trading town that until about a month agowas a stronghold of Khmer Rouge guerrillas and off-limits to mostCambodians."The US ambassador told Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen that hisgovernment would like to help repair the road to develop the area," saidOm Yu Tiang, an adviser to the co-premier.The 85km stretch links Pailin and the north-western provincial capitalof Battambang.

Thus, indesperation, women are forced to resort to the services of the untrainedand unskilled, often with fatal results, the FPIA study said.Kien Sereyphal of the Cambodian Women's Development Association (CWDA),explained the local problem."The abortions are often performed by trained birth attendants, inill-equipped homes. When complications arise, these attendants do nothave sufficient expertise or training to salvage the situation and savethe mother," she said.The solution to the problem, according to the study, lies in familyplanning."No law, no religion has proven to be effective when it comes todecreasing the number of abortions. Only increased access to reliablefamily planning services, combined with high quality information can dothis," the FPIA revealed.Successful planning programmes take time to be formulated and thenimplemented and could not emerge within a matter of months. Accordingly,for the programme to be truly effective, the attitude of parents towardschildren - the number they intend to have and the age gap between eachchild - and the opportunities they may have later in life, must all beexamined. "This all begins at birth," the study pointed out.The FPIA study also revealed that the problem is not restricted toCambodia.An estimated 25 million abortions are performed each year in developingcountries, most under unsafe conditions.Among married women, who do not want to get pregnant, at least 100million face an unmet need for contraception. Most of these women livein the third world.Every year, about 500,000 women die from pregnancy related causes."This means that every minute of the day a women dies as a result of herpregnancy or in childbirth," Paul Hamilton, a country representative ofthe FPIA, said.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Cambodia: King donates bicyclesfrom THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monineath donated bicycles, clothes andstudy materials to 260 students from poor families around Phnom Penh lastweek.Other students, who were not given bicycles, received cash amounting to100,000 riels each from the king and queen.King Sihanouk advised the students to study hard in the new school year,not just for their own good, but also for the future good of the nation.The bicycles were donated by the Japanese government.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Cambodia: Only one schoolfrom THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996In our report Cambodia to get elite school in the Sept 30, 1996 issue,it was stated that Northbridge Communities presently runs a number ofschools in South-East Asia.It has been pointed out to us that although Northbridge has affiliationswith a number of schools, at this time Northbridge runs only one school.This school is the International School Eastern Seaboard in Thailand.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Cambodia: 'leng Sary had no power'from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, once believed to be the second and thirdmost powerful men in the Khmer Rouge, were, in fact, powerless.Every ministry and institution of the Democratic Kampuchea government wasunder the control of Pol Pot, the shadowy leader of the Khmer Rouge, saidNhem Ein, the former information officer of the Maoist group.The only other people allowed to make decisions and implement them wereNoun Chea, who was the president of the National Assembly, and Son Sen,the deputy prime minister and defence minister.Nhem Ein said Ieng Sary, who was the foreign minister, had no authorityto decide on anything.

The break-up of the Khmer Rouge has also changed whatchildren learn in school.For a start, there will no longer be any references to the genocidalregime of the Maoist group.All illustrations and text of Khmer Rouge atrocities have been removedfrom the textbooks for pupils in the first, sixth and seventh grades.In addition, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports has instructedteachers to discontinue lessons on the subject in all other grades eventhough such references have yet to be expunged from the textbooks.In place of this subject, pupils will be given instructions on theenvironment, human rights and moral instructions.Stories of the genocide carried out by the Khmer Rouge regime, led by PolPot, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, were contained in the textbookspublished by the State of Cambodia government, which ousted the maoistregime in 1979.These textbooks contained criticisms of the Khmer Rouge's reign of terrorand pupils studied the atrocities committed by the Pol Potists. In thetextbooks, Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan were also portrayed astraitors of the country.The vice-director of the research institute of the education ministry,Ly Somony, said one of the subjects, Social Studies, carried lessons onthe Khmer Rouge's atrocities. It explained how the Khmer Rouge torturedand starved Cambodians during their rule of the country from 1975 to1979.Under the Cambodian education system, there are six grades - 1 to 6 - inthe primary school level. At the secondary school level are Grades 7 to9 and the high school level are Grades 10 to 12.Ly Somony said textbooks to be given to pupils in Grades 1, 6 and 7 willno longer contain anything on the Khmer Rouge. The new school yearstarted last month, but the pupils are only expected to get their booksthis month."The word `genocide' will no longer be seen in the newly publishedtextbooks," he said.However, the move to remove all references to the Khmer Rouge in schooltextbooks has also drawn some criticisms.Ly Somony said he had been approached by several intellectuals who heldthe view that subjects on the genocide should remain in the schoolsyllabus.He said the intellectuals, some of whom were also from the ministry, hadreminded him that many Cambodians were killed and the country was ruinedduring Pol Pot's reign and that "we should not forget the horribleregime".He said his institute had conveyed the message to the minister but therehas yet to be any response. "We are only the writers of the books, andwe always abide by the government's policy," he said.The minister, Tol Lah, could not be reached for comment as he is out ofthe country, but a ministry official said the government was not likelyto go back on its decision to discontinue lessons on the Khmer Rouge."The Royal Government is carrying out a policy of national reconciliationand thus would like to see that such subjects on Khmer Rouge atrocitiesbe removed from the education syllabus," the official said.Meanwhile, the deputy director of the ministry's publishing house, KoeuNay Leang, said the new books for the three grades would be printed bythe third week of this month.He said a total of 1.28 million books in eight subjects would be printedfor pupils in the first grade. In addition, there are 410,000 books infive subjects for pupils of Grade 6 and 210,000 books in 12 subjects forthose in Grade 7.All books are given free of charge to the pupils.Ly Somony said that next year, the ministry would publish new books forpupils in the second and eighth grades while those in the fourth and 10thgrades would get new books in 1999.In the year 2000, new books will be published for pupils in Grades 5 and11 and in 2001, a new edition of the books will be published for pupilsin Grade 6 while pupils in Grade 12 will also be given new books withoutthe subject on the Khmer Rouge.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Cambodia: Charting the nation's coursefrom THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996Mehran ChinniahIt is not easy locating the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace(CICP).Squeezed between the rows of pre-fabricated cabins at the GovernmentPalace at Wat Phnom, the office is a legacy of the United NationsTransitional Authority in Cambodia - a memorial to the Third World.You have to manoeuvre past numerous potholes and puddles of water beforearriving at the CICP workplace where the wooden pathway creaks with eachstep.Founded in June 1994, the CICP's objectives are to help the governmentin its public policy and nurture regional and international cooperation.The institute thrives on cutting corners: it operates with a skeletalstaff of four. Materials that need to be photocopied have first to beverified and personal phone calls are limited to two three-minuteconversations per day."If you have to talk to your girlfriend or boyfriend, don't do it oncompany time," reads a terse memo on the wall.The CICP's frugality is as a good a metaphor as any for CICP's place inCambodia's lengthy list of non-governmental organisations. It is a smallthink tank that has grown in a manner more spectacular than most wouldhave imagined.CICP executive director Kao Kim Hourn has a decidedlysimple explanation for all this.Sitting at his cluttered desk, dressed in his trademark white,short-sleeved shirt and tie, he says: "We are small because smallsometimes means beautiful. We are small so we can work effectively andmove faster."It is no mere puff. In the short two years since CICP was established,it has organised five major conferences and seminars in Cambodia,produced more than 10 papers and journals and has presented more than 20working papers in conferences throughout the region.In Kao's words, the research papers, seminars and conferences "will helpus to re-think what we have been thinking". "That's what we have beendoing. Whether it is conferences, seminars, workshops or lectures, weprovide a forum for consultation and dialogue for policy makers andacademics on one hand, and students and the younger generation, on theother, to bridge the gap," he said.The research, Kao said, is not for research's sake. "The research we dois to give some new ideas and perspectives to our public policy. It isthe future that we are worried about."Its recent publication - theCambodian Journal of International Affairs - is the first publication ofits kind by any non-governmental organisation in the kingdom.But the feather in its cap is, by far, CICP's appointment as the seventhmember of Asean-ISIS (Institute of Strategic and International Studies),a prestigious group of policy-oriented think tanks.The other six are ISIS Malaysia, ISIS Thailand, the Singapore Instituteof International Affairs, the Institute of Strategic and DevelopmentalStudies Indonesia and Institute of International Relations Vietnam.The CICP will be Cambodia's official representative in the South-EastAsian economic grouping in March next year.It is, fellow NGOs concur, a fitting testimony to CICP's efforts inCambodia's foreign policy in the international arena.Says Kao: "It means that we are part of an important regional process.We will be able to assist the government better in terms of ideas andvision."Clearly, the future lies with Asean, as far as the CICP is concerned. Theworld is working towards regionalism and Cambodia has to be part of thegroup to develop quickly, Kao said.Although Cambodia will become a full member of the regional grouping inJuly 1997, the CICP's work is far from finished."CICP's work is now at the next level. We have to reach out to morepeople in our meetings, seminars and conferences. We have to look beyondAsean, to our relations with the United Nations, with the European Union,Apec and WTO."The role of forward looking diplomacy is vital if Cambodia wants toprotect its interests. We cannot be left out. We have to be part of aregion that is changing and developing quickly," Kao said.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peacefrom THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996Executive DirectorKao Kim HournResearch FellowsSophal Ear, Matthew SiegelAdjunct Research FellowDin MericanAddressRoom 1G, Government Palace, Sisowath Quay, Wat Phnom, Phnom Penh.FundingThe institute is a non-profit organisation and receives most of itsfinancial assistance and cooperation from the Friedrich Ebert Stiftungin Bonn, Germany.

It is the Cambodian roll-up, a non-filtered, 100 per centtobacco cigarette and it can be found just about anywhere in the capitalcity of Phnom Penh, wherever a roadside vendor seats herself.Last week, Lifetimes went looking for these cigarettes and found thatmost of the vendors are women.These women deal with the tobacco suppliers, they buy the paper, theyprepare the flour-based paste to stick the cigarette paper together, theyspread the tobacco on the paper and roll them up into foot-longcigarettes and then cut them into pieces of four or five, and then theysell them.These women always look very busy. Several of them can be seen sittingat their makeshift stalls under the trees on the corner of SamdechMonireth Boulevard and Jawaharlal Nehru Boulevard, near the OlympicStadium, and they will be rolling the cigarettes.One of these vendors is 53-year-old Sok Ouy who has been selling theroll-ups for six years already. Everyday, for 15 hours a day, from 6amto 9pm, she sits under the tree selling the hand-rolled cigarettes.Her fingers may seem gnarled, but they are nimble. She call roll 500cigarettes in an hour. At 100 riels for five cigarettes, that means50,000 riels worth of cigarettes.Sok Ouy sells anything between 500 and 2,000 cigarettes per day. Afterdeducting her costs, she makes between 3,000 and 15,000 riels. In a week,she can sell about 50kg worth of tobacco.Contrary to popular belief, smokers of the Cambodian roll-ups come fromall walks of life."It is not true that only the poor people smoke these cigarettes. I alsohave some very wealthy customers," Sok Ouy said."They say the cigarette has a distinctive flavour, is strong and smooth.They can get full satisfaction with just a few puffs," she added.Although she has never had someone instruct her on rolling cigarettes,with regular practice over the years, Sok Ouy has made it into an artform."I watched and I learnt. The old hands were always there doing it andafter having seen it done a few times, I did it too," she saidmatter-of-fact.Despite the fact that she only has a makeshift stall at the roadside, SokOuy also has to worry about overheads.To keep her spot on the roadside, she has to pay a daily "rental" of1,000 riels to the owner of the house in front of which her stall islocated. She also has to pay 100 per day to the contractor who keeps thestreets clean and a weekly tax of 500 riels to the local authorities.The tobacco is delivered to Sok Ouy by the supplier. She buys in bulk -500kg of tobacco at a time, at 6,000 riels per kilogramme.The paper can be bought from the markets, already cut into the correctsize, at 5,000 riels per 10,000 pieces of paper.The cooked flour costs 600 riels per 500g. The flour is boiled until itbecomes thick like a porridge. This gluey concoction is then used tostick the cigarette paper together. The "rolling instrument" cost about15,000 riels.Selling cigarettes has proven to be more lucrative for Sok Ouy. Beforeshe embarked on this venture, she used to sell banana fritters."It was too difficult selling banana fritters. I had to do everything bymyself," she complained.However, its does not seem very much easier selling the roll-upcigarettes. During the 15 hours at work, Sok Ouy is bent over rollingcigarettes.In addition, she has to see that her tobacco supplier is paid every week.The amount of money she pays the supplier, of course, depends on theamount she earns each week. She only takes delivery of her nextconsignment of 500kg of tobacco when she pays in full.These days, however, life is a little easier for Sok Ouy. She now has twoassistants to help her roll up the cigarettes."I have found that I cannot do this for long anymore. Bending up and downwhile rolling the cigarettes has given me a backache and a pain in thewrist," she said.She pays her two workers a salary of 30,000 riels per month. In addition,they are provided meals. The work in Sok Ouy's house, located not faraway from her stall. Her husband also helps."I need to work hard for the sake of my family. I have four children -three boys and a girl. My eldest, aged 26, is a policeman but his salaryis very low. My other children are not working," she said.Her youngest child is already 18 years old. Her three younger childrenare still living with her.Another one of these women entrepreneurs is Phim Sokoun, 46, who comesfrom Kompong Cham province.Phim Sokoun is still new to the trade as she took over the business fromher daughter who retired after her marriage six months ago.She buys about 50kg of tobacco a time. Everyday she rolls cigarettes from7am to 2.30pm. Phim Sokoun, still relatively inexperienced, can roll onlyabout 100 cigarettes per day.She is further hampered by the fact that her cigarette roller has thecapacity for only one cigarette at a time. She earns between 2,000 and10,000 riels a day."The best type of tobacco comes from Kompong Cham province," she said.Phim Sokoun lives with her daughter in Steng Meanchey district, PhnomPenh. She has nine children, five of whom live in Phnom Penh while theother four live in Kompong Cham with her husband. The oldest is 28 andthe youngest is 10.Phim Sokoun seems to accept her lot in life. "I do not have the kind ofmoney to venture into the world of big business. That is why I chose tobe in this business. It is more profitable than selling sweets in KompongCham," she said, smiling.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Cambodia: No let-up on illegal logging: Govt officials and militarypersonnel also involved, says ministerfrom THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996Reaksmey KongkeaIn addition to waging a guerrilla war against the Royal Government in thepast three years, the Khmer Rouge was also causing a major environmentalproblem - the depletion of the kingdom's forest cover.However, the mass defection and rebellion of the guerrilla fightersagainst the Maoist group's hard-line leadership has not eased thepressure on Cambodia's natural heritage.Areas formerly under Khmer Rouge control are still losing their foreststhrough illegal logging and the culprits now are local governmentofficials and military personnel, according to officials in the Ministryof Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.These provincial officials and military officers are, in fact, conspiringwith foreign traders and loggers to exploit the Cambodian forests forprofits, the minister Tao Seng Hour told the Cambodia Times.These illegal activities are rampant in the north-western provinces ofPreah Vihear, Kompong Thom and Koh Kong and as a result, vast areas offorests have been destroyed, the deputy director of the ProvincialForestry and Fisheries Department, Kim Samol said.He said the illegal loggers, who used to work with the Khmer Rouge,continued to fell trees and transporting the logs across the borders toThailand and Laos.These areas, he said, were formerly under the Khmer Rouge, but came underthe Royal Government's control near the end of last year.Kim Samol said that in some cases, soldiers of the Royal Cambodian ArmedForces (RCAF) were cutting down the trees and transporting the logs toforeign timber traders."Thousands of dollars are collected each day from the sale of the logsand the money goes into the pockets of corrupt government officials, hesaid.A foreign forestry expert in the ministry alleged that the illegalloggers were, in fact, RCAF soldiers who were conspiring with provincialofficials to cut down new trees and transporting the logs across theborder."Their actions are illegal and causing the destruction of the forests.It is also against the decision of the government not to export anymorenew logs," the expert, who declined to be named, added.(Earlier this year, the government had stated that it would not allowanymore exports of logs once the existing stock of one million cubicmetres have been sold. Eight Thai companies have been given permits toexport the logs, which had been cut earlier but not exported yet.)He said the areas which had been badly affected by the illegal loggingactivities were forests in Kompong Thom and Koh Kong.Sources in Preah Vihear province have alleged that each night, the logswould be transported in four or five trucks to the border where they wereloaded into waiting boats to be sent to Thailand.The sources added that hundreds of hectares of forests have beendestroyed as a result of the illegal logging operations.A report from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries showsthat about 30 logging concessions, covering a total area of 6.4 millionhectares, have been given out by the government.The foreign forestry expert estimated that this was roughly equivalentto the kingdom's remaining forest cover.All sides in the Cambodian civil conflict have, in the past, sold timberto help fund their military operations.The Khmer Rouge reportedly earned millions of dollars every month, partof which they used to buy arms, from selling logging and gems miningconcessions in areas under their control to Thai companies.However, the forestry expert blamed the Khmer Rouge for most of thecountry's deforestation, especially around Pailin where theirheadquarters is located."The Khmer Rouge are the main factors in the destruction of the forestsaround Pailin. They also cooperate with foreigners to exploit gemstonesand these activities cause environmental deterioration," he said.However, the expert admitted that the ill-disciplined elements in thegovernment forces were also responsible for the illegal loggingoperations. He alleged that sometimes they also deal with the KhmerRouge.Tao Seng Hour said the Thai and Cambodian governments had agreed tocooperate in efforts to stamp out the illegal export of timber toThailand.He said his ministry was taking action to stop the illegal loggingoperations by local officials and military personnel. He said actionwould also be taken to stop the export of logs and sawn timber from PreahVihear, Kompong Thom and Koh Kong provinces.However, he did not outline the measures that the ministry was taking."If we find proof that local officials are involved in these illegalactivities and conspiring with foreign traders, we have to fine them andput them in jail," Tao Seng Hour added.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CAMBODIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 13, 1996Funcinpec wants Sirivudh to return to Cambodiafrom THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996Chheang SophengThe announcement by the co-premiers that the former Khmer Rouge numbertwo man Ieng Sary will be pardoned has renewed calls for the return ofPrince Norodom Sirivudh.The steering committee of the Funcinpec party has urged its president,Prince Norodom Ranariddh, to invite his half-uncle to return to Cambodia.Prince Sirivudh, a former secretary-general of the party, was exiled toFrance after being accused of involvement in a plot to assassinate SecondPrime Minister Samdech Hun Sen in December last year.The Phnom Penh Municipal Court tried Prince Sirivudh, a half-brother ofKing Norodom Sihanouk, in absentia. He was found guilty and sentenced to10 years in prison.At a two-day meeting of the party's national council, the Funcinpecsteering committee urged Prince Ranariddh, who is the First PrimeMinister, to write a letter to Prince Sirivudh to invite him back to thekingdom.Committee member Lu Lay Sreng also proposed that the exiled prince beallowed to rejoin the party's steering committee.He also expressed hope that King Sihanouk would grant an amnesty to theprince considering that Ieng Sary, who had been found guilty andsentenced to death on charges of killing people during the four-yeargenocidal regime, would also be pardoned."Compared to Ieng Sary, Prince Sirivudh's case is less serious. If wewant national reconciliation, the prince should be granted amnesty," LuLay Sreng said.He said that although the National Assembly had stripped Prince Sirivudhof his immunity, he was officially still a member of the house andremained a very important person to the Funcinpec.He said that in a letter to the prince recently, the party had urged himto write to the king to ask for amnesty.Prince Ranariddh said it was now up to the prince to request for a pardonfrom the king."If there is a request from Prince Sirivudh in his own handwriting, Ibelieve the king will pardon him. The Funcinpec will support him," hetold reporters at the Funcinpec headquarters in Phnom Penh after themeeting last week.To questions from newsmen, he said the decision to pardon Ieng Sary wouldensure that his half-uncle would also be granted amnesty."Whether Hun Sen agrees or not, it is up to him, but I will supportPrince Sirivudh and it is my understanding that King Sihanouk will alsoagree to the pardon," he added."A pardon for Prince Sirivudh will be justice for him and for theFuncinpec party. If Ieng Sary can be pardoned, why not Prince Sirivudh,who has not even killed anyone?" Prince Ranariddh asked.He said the prince could resume his duties as member of parliament andrejoin the Funcinpec steering committee, but he would not be reappointedparty secretary-general."We have already appointed Loy Sim Chheang to the post," he added.At the meeting, the members also unanimously approved the appointment ofan additional 13 members to the steering committee, bringing the totalmembership now to 33. The move is to strengthen the party for the nextgeneral elections in 1998.The new members are Princess Marie Ranariddh, Hong Sun Huoth, Tao SengHour, Chum Chheang, Man Bunthon, Chea Rithy Chhuth, Keang Vang, Ho Sok,Ek Serywath, Kheat Vandy, Khan Saveourn, Ly Seng Hong and Sum Nipha.First deputy secretary-general Chhim Seak Leng said the party needed moreactive officials to carry out its activities and to prepare for theelections.He said the decision to enlarge the steering committee was made toovercome the problem of the lack of quorum when meetings had to be heldto discuss important internal issues.The party also adopted several resolutions. They are:- to adopt a political platform outlining the principles and guidelinesin the implementation of political, economic, social and culturalprogrammes;- to nominate Prince Ranariddh to continue his "noble mission" as premierof the government for a second term after the general elections of 1998;- to determine that the general elections will take place in 1998 asstipulated in the constitution;- to appeal to all international organisations, in particular the UnitedNation, and all friendly countries to send personnel to observe thepreparation and conduct of the elections, the counting of ballots and toprovide the necessary technical assistance, and- to appeal to all Cambodian political parties to appoint and make knownto the public their candidate for the post of premier.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TimesBack to Headline List WT03-B04-6IA086-000616-B001-164http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it126.html 205.156.212.5 19970122023205 text/html 41406HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:30:08 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:20 GMTContent-length: 41219Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it126.html Sample Issue Copyright CAMBODIA TODAY via NewsNet October 25, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Cambodia: Protest against release (435 words) Cambodia: UN celebrates 51st Anniversary (396 words) Cambodia: Marubeni urged to construct industrial zone (343 words) Cambodia: Request for return of 1993 ballot papers (344 words) Cambodia: Nobody can move our people, says Y Chhien (828 words) Cambodia: 40 RCAF lives for a month's leave (373 words) Cambodia: Deputy Governor dismisses allegations (191 words) Cambodia: Ties with Malaysia essential says First PM (310 words) Cambodia: French tourist goes berserk (435 words) Cambodia: First nine months net US$72 million in exports (304 words) Cambodia: Cottage industries provide 57,000 jobs (312 words) Cambodia: Hotels gearing up for competition (199 words) Cambodia: 5th Anniversary of Paris Accord celebrated (673 words) Ranariddh says reconciliation comes first (377 words) Ranariddh warns against poll violence (315 words) Cambodia: Marines prepare for Marlboro Cup (297 words) CopyrightCAMBODIA TODAY via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996Cambodia: Protest against releasefrom CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996by Kong VaraPHNOM PENH: The request made by King Norodom Sihanouk for the release ofprisoners has came under protest from University and Faculty students.The protest is in the form of a petition dated 23 October and addressedto the King, a copy of which was made available to Cambodia Today."Recently, we heard and read your message on the request made to theJustice Ministry for a list of prisoners to be released."The message has aroused our concern over security and safety of peoplein the whole society of Cambodia," stated the two-page petition signedby 8 students, representing eight institutions of higher learning here."The amnesty could lead to the increase of robbery, terrorism, murder andother offenses, for perpetrators would assume that after theirprosecution, there will be a pardon granted by the King," continued thepetition.On 19 October, King Sihanouk sent a letter to Justice Minister ChemSnguon to request the draft of a Royal Decree to render amnesty to thosewho are being imprisoned across the Kingdom.However, the third paragraph of the letter, bore inflexible contents onthe nature of the criminals to be freed."Concerning criminals that could not be freed from imprisonment, for theymight pose enormous danger to the national and international societiesplease, Your Excellency, request the two Prime Ministers for the namesof these criminals," the King said.In an unrelated issue, the students are also opposing the granting of anamnesty to Prince Norodom Sirivuddh."We have read and heard about this."If the request is true, we would like to state that he should not bepardoned," the petition stressed.However, several politicians share the opinion that amnesty should begranted to Prince Sirivuddh given the fact that Ieng Sary, the formerBrother Number 2 of Pol Pot's regime has been granted amnesty."If the King wants to pardon Prince Sirivuddh, no one can object to thisas we are all committed to follow His Majesty's advise," said MP KemSokha, from Son San's BLDP faction,when speaking to Cambodia Today."Between Ieng Sary and Prince Sirivuddh, who has carried out moredestruction to the national interest and humanity?" the MP questioned.Prince Sirivuddh was prosecuted by the Phnom Penh Court and sentenced to10 years imprisonment in absentia on charges of illegal arms possessionin February this year.

Previously, Thai based Ban ChangGroup had carried out a feasibility study on the proposed industrialzone."However, they have yet to confirm whether they are going to go aheadwith the project or otherwise," Sothirak said.He said that there were ample opportunities for Japanese corporations todevelop Cambodia's agro-based and fisheries sector."There is ample arable land for agricultural development and since Japanis a huge importer of food products, it could use Cambodia as a supplybase."He added that current laws enabled foreign investors to lease land forperiods up to 70 years.

people to other areas."Nobody can move them to other camps and nobody can seize our people'sterritory which is their own property," Y Chhien, the commander of break-away Khmer Rouge Division 415 said during the visit of Hun Sen to Pailin.He added that the people residing in Pailin, Phnom Malai, Samlot, KohKong and Sisophon had to clear the land and these had caused numerousinjuries which later resulted in disablement."Numerous others had died because of mines and exposure to killerdiseases such as Malaria and furthermore, the people in these territorieshad to sacrifice their lives to preserve their territory during the war,"he pointed out.Y Chhien added that given these facts, the Royal Government would surelyprotect the people's land and crops, especially since the people hadagreed to abide by the National Constitution promulgated in 1993."The ceasefire between the DNUM and the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces(RCAF) has been in place for two months and the people are delighted asthey no longer have to fear the roar of weapons and gunfire."I am sure that our people here and the RCAF are both happy as there isno more war and killing and Khmers do not have to kill

into a permanent peacewith no losers or victors as Khmer people would be living in harmony."In this, we must recognize that the tasks in bringing about nationalreconciliation, national unity and putting and end to the war is stilla heavy task."Though all our people desire peace, it is unfortunate that the countryhas been destroyed to a large extent because of the many years of war andthis has brought to a standstill, development," he said.Y Chhien added that though there were various ways of ending the war, henevertheless was confident of the final result as well as the progressattained thus far.He pointed out that these efforts could only push the country forward andthat the momentum will be maintained with no turning back."The decisive factor is the will of the whole Khmer nation to stopspilling the blood of Khmers," he said.Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said that there was no question of peopleliving here and elsewhere being moved from their homes and their land."Our policy of national reconciliation has drawn many critics, bothlocally and abroad."However, what is important is for Khmers to resolve their problems amongthemselves," Hun Sen said.He added that politicians should not be branding their fellow Khmers aspuppets of Vietnam, China, Australia, USA and so forth."This is an act in futility as it benefits no one and will only fuelunnecessary hatred among Khmers," Samdech Hun Sen said.He also added that there may be conflicting views on how to resolve theproblem but what mattered most,was the end result, in this case, the endof hostilities between Khmers."The people in Anlong Veng will be liberated. The hard-liners would haveno where to go and they could not hide for ever as the winds of changeare now blowing through Cambodia," the Second Prime Minister said addingthat the people in the country had suffered enough because of war andthat they were tired of the prolonged suffering.A member of the break-away family, Mrs Chan Thorn said that she wasdelighted that peace is finally settling in Pailin and that family lifecould return to normal.She said that the family has been separated for long as her husband hadto defend their home and the children were fearful of going to school aswar could have broken out at any time."I am looking forward to travelling outside Pailin and I hope NationalRoad 10 would be cleared of mines soon to enable this," Mrs Thorn said.Her comments were shared by many of the people who had converged on thearea to witness the arrival of the Second Prime Minister and the historicexchange of greetings between the Second Prime Minister and DNUM leader,Ieng Sary."The once bitter enemies have decided to forgive in the larger interestsof the Cambodian people," a senior RCAF general said, adding that thiswas a gift to the country.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TodayBack to Headline List CopyrightCAMBODIA TODAY via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996Cambodia: 40 RCAF lives for a month's leavefrom CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996by Sok PovPAILIN: Each Khmer Rouge soldier must kill as many Royal Cambodian ArmedForces (RCAF) men as possible to be entitled to lengthy periods of restand leave."In the event a Khmer Rouge soldier could kill as much as 40 RCAF men amonth, the successful Khmer Rouge soldier is granted one month's leave."Our orders are to kill at least one RCAF man a day.

The SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros Ghali said that the peaceaccord served as an eloquent testimony to what the internationalcommunity could achieve when there is unity of will."The international community continues to help Cambodia build upon thegains made during UNTAC and the emphasis of our role has rightly shiftedfrom that of being Cambodia's guardian to that of being the country'sfriends."Without doubt, the biggest contribution to the country's rebirth hasbeen the Cambodians themselves who are setting in place and strengtheningthe elements of a civil society whilst beginning to reap the dividendsof an ever-strengthening economy," the UN Secretary General said.He added that challenges lied ahead but the UN was confident that theRoyal Government and the people are prepared to tackle them.Boutros Boutros Ghali added that the United Nations will provide help inthe coordination of technical assistance for the forthcoming electionsand that several member states had already agreed to assist in theprocess."In short, the future will depend upon Cambodia's ability to build uponthe achievements of the past half decade: namely its economicrejuvenation, national reconciliation, universal respect for human rightsand the maintenance of political pluralism," he said.Foreign dignitaries who gathered in front of the Royal Palace toparticipate in the celebrations were representatives from Malaysia,Australia, United States of America, Brunei, Lao PDR, Thailand andVietnam.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TodayBack to Headline List CopyrightCAMBODIA TODAY via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996Ranariddh says reconciliation comes firstfrom CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996by Has Sam AthPHNOM PENH: First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh said thatnational reconciliation must be achieved before all else as it was thekey to political and security stability. Speaking to an Asia Foundationdelegation led by Lucian Pye he stressed reconciliation with the KhmerRouge would lead to a complete ceasefire in fighting and this auguredwell for national development."However, the criminals responsible for the death of millions ofCambodians in the seventies must face an international court for theiractions," he said.Prince Ranariddh pointed out that reconciliation with the Khmer Rouge andtrial for those responsible for the genocide were two separate issues."We can forgive but not forget," he said.The First Prime Minister went on to brief the delegation on the variouschallenges being faced in the country such as rejuvenating the educationsector, preparing for the forthcoming commune and general elections aswell as human rights issues.He said that education is the key to resolving the human rights issue asit would help strengthen democracy, social values and this in turn wouldlead to greater respect for human rights."Our police, armed forces and the members of the military police must betrained in these aspects so that they can uphold the law, justice and thefreedom of the people," Prince Ranariddh said, adding that human resourcedevelopment was another area where attention is needed immediately,stressing that Cambodia's imminent entry into ASEAN would requireimmediate upgrading of human resources and capacity development.As far as the election is concerned, the Prince said the communal andgeneral elections must be held in 1997 and 1998 respectively as providedin the constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia.He highly appreciated the Asia Foundation's efforts and assistancegranted over the years, and especially for sending Cambodia's seniorgovernment officials to study the elections in Bangladesh as it is animportant experience for holding the elections in Cambodia in 1997 and1998.Lucian Pye said that Asia Foundation would continue to assist the RoyalGovernment in various aspects, particularly in human rights developmentand capacity building.Copyright 1996 Cambodia TodayBack to Headline List CopyrightCAMBODIA TODAY via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996Ranariddh warns against poll violencefrom CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996PHNOM PENH: First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh on Tuesday saidhis party would win the next general elections in 1998 but warned againstintimidation and violence ahead of the polls.Analysts believed the words of the head of the royalist FUNCINPEC partywere aimed at the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Second Prime MinisterHun Sen, a battlefield foe turned coalition government partner.The two parties formed a fragile alliance after FUNCINPEC narrowly edgedout the incumbent CPP in a landmark 1993 election organised by the UnitedNations.Their partnership turned sour in March when the royalists demanded agreater share of power."FUNCINPEC won the 1993 election and I am pretty sure that in 1998FUNCINPEC is going to win the election again. It will not fail, "thePrince said at his party headquarters."We must take the bitter lessons of the 1993 election and apply them forthe 1998 election, "he said."I would like to say, as president of FUNCINPEC, that during the 1997(local elections) and 1998 election, we will not allow anyone to suppressFUNCINPEC as in 1993," he said.He reiterated, at a seminar earlier this week to discuss the fifthanniversary of the October 23,1991 Cambodian peace pact, that the nextelections should end the current system of two premiers and introduce asingle Prime Minister.The coalition rift earlier this year saw Hun Sen at one stage warning hewould use force to prevent any attempt to break up the government afterRanariddh had threatened to pull out.The tension has abated in the past three months but the two leaderscontinue to snipe at each other, normally in closed doors meetings whoseoutcomes are often leaked.

His view was shared by many observers, who noted that the Caribbean leaders had gone into the four-day meeting on 4 July with high hopes of settling some long-standing issues, but emerged disappointed. The single market was, as ever, at the top of the agenda but, as always,  little or nothing was achieved. Islands fear their domestic production will be damaged unless safeguards are built in to any accords, and the unanimity rule means that the 14-strong community as a whole can only go at the pace of the slowest member. Proposals to speed things up by revising the founding Treaty of Chaguaramas got nowhere. Some ground may even have been lost: Trinidad and Barbados engaged in a heated dispute on alleged protectionism by the latter, which had imposed controls on imports of milk, juices and pasta from Trinidad. One concrete achievement was the establishment of the Caribbean Investment Fund (CIF), which is designed to channel investments into the region, mainly as replacements for the dwindling economic aid from the developed countries. Total aid from the United States, for example, was only US Dollars 22m last year, compared with US Dollars 226m in 1985. An agreement to arrange a meeting with Latin American banana producers, in an attempt to forge a united position on the US challenge to the European Union banana market regime (see Page 7, inside) was also welcomed by delegates. Another plus point was an agreement on cooperation against drug-trafficking, which was the US's main concern at the meeting. About 40% of the cocaine reaching US markets goes via the Caribbean, with Puerto Rico acting as the last staging-post for much of it. A number of bilateral accords are already in place, or being negotiated, which give the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) the right to patrol islands' territorial waters and airspace. 'I think we have to err on the side of limiting sovereignty to some extent, in order to facilitate a greater attempt to catch these people,' said Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister, Lester Bird. Basdeo Panday of Trinidad and Tobago agreed: 'If we are not prepared to sacrifice some of the eighteenth and nineteenth century concepts of sovereignty, then we will lose our sovereignty to the drug lords,' he said. But other countries, such as Guyana, Belize and Jamaica, are less willing to hand over control to Washington.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARIBBEAN & CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT via NewsNetJuly 25, 1996 CUBA: DIPLOMACY: HELMS-BURTON PUTS PRESSURE ON EU LINK: CLINTON HESITATES OVER PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER President Clinton was due as we went to press to announce whether he would be exercising the presidential waiver on parts of the Helms-Burton law (see RC-96-05 & 03) that would allow US nationals to sue in US courts foreigners 'trafficking' in assets confiscated by the Cuban government since 1959. Pressure from trading partners (and US businesses) to tone down the provisions of the law had been mounting -with threats of retaliation- but Clinton was known to be reluctant to do anything that might alienate the Florida Cuba lobby in an election year. ING pulls out. The law, which is designed to discourage third countries from trading with and investing in Cuba, had already scored one important success. On 4 July the ING banking group, of the Netherlands, announced that it was pulling out of financing the Cuban sugar industry because of the Helms-Burton legislation. ING, which has been expanding its presence vigorously in Cuba in recent years, was one of the foreign banks whose financial support was vital to Cuba's efforts to recover from last year's disastrous sugar harvest (see RC-96-01), by enabling it to import fertiliser, spare parts and other inputs. But the group has now said that it will not renew US Dollars 30m in loans to the Cuban state sugar marketing company, Cubazucar, because its subsidiaries in the US could be exposed to legal action there. The ING's decision must cast doubt on the financing of the 1996-97 sugar harvest, for which the target is over 5m tonnes. The Cuban government maintains that hardly any of the foreign companies active in Havana are at risk of prosecution in the US courts under what is formally known as the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, and ING insists that it will continue all its other operations in Cuba. Recognising the possible impact of the Helms-Burton law, Vice-President Carlos Lage, who is in charge of the economy, said on 6 July that Cuba would have to rely more on a combination of greater efficiency and domestic savings for investments in future. EU doubts. Helms-Burton has also cast a further cloud over the European Union's economic cooperation with Cuba, which was already faltering because of the slow pace of democratic reforms (see RC-96-05). The Italian government, which occupied the presidency of the Union until the end of June, insists that the EU will defend its interests if Washington attempts to apply the law against the companies of member countries. But a seminar in Sitges on 10 July, organised by the Institute of European-Latin American Relations (Irela), concluded that the prospects of an economic accord with the island were becoming more remote.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARIBBEAN & CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT via NewsNetJuly 25, 1996 BOTH SIDES CLAIM  AIR INCIDENT VICTORY: HIJACK ENABLES HAVANA TO SEIZE BACK THE INITIATIVE The outcome of the international civil aviation organisation's inquiry into the downing of two light aircraft in February by the Cuban air force -an event that hastened the approval of the Helms-Burton law by the US Congress- had good and bad aspects for Cuba. On the one hand, the resolution issued on 27 June did not explicitly condemn Cuba, and did not confirm the US contention that the planes, operated by a Miami-based Cuban exile organisation, Hermanos al Rescate, had been shot down over international waters. On the other, it did condemn the use of force against unarmed civilian aircraft. Cuba's public position was that the resolution was a vindication of its arguments and a setback for Washington. The Castro government insisted that the inquiry report only accepted the US version of events and distorted what had really happened, and the resolution had tacitly recognised this. Cuba maintained that the aircraft had violated its airspace several times and had been shot down after repeated warnings. It further noted that the resolution urged states to control flights that violated other countries' airspace, and was preparing to challenge the US at the United Nations Security Council as we went to press. The meeting was expected to begin on or around 22 July. Guantanamo hijack. Any triumphalism in Washington over the report proved to be short-lived. At the end of June a Cuban gunman hijacked a domestic airliner to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay and claimed political asylum. This immediately put the Clinton administration in an uncomfortable dilemma: to grant asylum to a hijacker would be in contravention both of international accords against air piracy and of bilateral agreements between the US and Cuba. It would also give Cuba the opportunity to go back on the diplomatic offensive. However, to hand the hijacker over to the Cuban authorities, or take him to court, as Havana was demanding, would outrage the same exile groups that Clinton has been so anxious to keep onside. To make matters even more complicated, the hijacker identified himself as a senior officer in the Cuban security forces: Lieutenant-Colonel Jose Fernandez Pupo. The Cubans maintained that he had been an officer in the interior ministry forces, but had been dismissed earlier this year on suspicion of embezzlement. Under the May 1995 migration agreements between Washington and Havana, which put an end to the outflow of 'raft people' from the island, all would-be migrants attempting to enter US territory (including Guantanamo) without a visa should be returned to the island.PILOT BAN REDUCEDThe indefinite suspension of the pilot's licence of Hermanos al Rescate president Jose Basulto by the Federal Aviation Administration was reduced to 150 days by a US federal judge on 5 July. The court ruled that Basulto had only violated Cuban airspace 'slightly and unwittingly' in July last year. His was the only one of three planes to return to Miami on 24 February this year.LIST OF 'SUSPECTS'A Miami law firm, Nicolas Gutierrez, has notified the State Department of a supplementary list of foreign companies suspected of trafficking in confiscated property. They include Pemex (Mexico), the Sol-Melia hotels group (Spain), Sandoz pharmaceutical laboratories (Switzerland), Pernod-Ricard distilleries (France), BM Industries, an Israeli citrus fruits producer, and Monte Carlo Real Estate Investments of Monaco.ECONOMIC GROWTH 'TO CONTINUE'Carlos Lage said in mid-June that, despite Helms-Burton, he expected first-half figures to show the economy maintaining the 7% growth rate recorded in the first quarter. He put the 1995-96 sugar harvest at 4.45m tonnes, and said nickel production for the year would probably reach a record 50,000 tonnes, 40% more than in 1995. In addition, tourism had grown by 40%, tobacco production by 25% and agricultural output in general by 22%. The official target for GDP growth this year is 5%, compared with 2.5% in 1995 and 0.7% in 1994. Between 1990 and 1993 the economy contracted by 34.3% in relation to 1989 levels. Economy and planning minister Jose Luis Rodriguez said on 7 July that economic recovery was 'irreversible.' Canadian entrepreneur Wally Berukoff announced at the beginning of July that he was entering a joint venture to build 11 tourist hotels with the Cuban state hotels company.NO MULTI-PARTY SYSTEMApparently confirming the impression that there has been a political clamp-down in the island since the Helms-Burton law was passed in March, Communist Party first secretary Esteban Lazo said at the end of June that the introduction of a multi-party political system would 'fragment' the unity of the Cuban people. In present circumstances, he said, that would be 'suicidal' and 'unforgivable.' He said the overwhelming majority of Cubans had no wish to see any more parties.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARIBBEAN & CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT via NewsNetJuly 25, 1996 HAITI: HUMAN RIGHTS: OUTRAGE OVER RELEASE OF CONSTANT: WASHINGTON RELUCTANT TO HAND OVER FRAPH LEADER The government of President Rene Preval has demanded the extradition from the US of Emmanuel 'Toto' Constant, 39, leader of the right-wing paramilitary organisation Fraph, who was released from a Maryland detention centre in mid-June. Washington is reluctant to hand Constant over to the authorities because of what a State Department spokesman described as the weakness of the Haitian judicial system. US ambassador William Swing has, however, assured the Haitian government that Washington has no wish to keep Constant, who describes himself as a CIA informer, a moment longer than necessary. He is wanted in Haiti in connection with hundreds of atrocities committed by Fraph members in the wake of the military coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. Constant was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service after entering the US illegally in 1995.

Amory said he had instructed lawyers to prepare a separation bill, under section 113 of the constitution. Long-standing resentment. Amory claimed there was no alternative to separation. Nevis has long complained of being dominated by St Kitts, and Amory took particular exception to the federal government opening an office in the Nevis capital, Charlestown. He described the move as unconstitutional and an affront to the rights of Nevisians. To make matters worse, the government of Prime Minister Denzil Douglas, elected last year (see RC-95-06), has also introduced legislation requiring all outside investments in Nevis to be channelled through St Kitts. The federal government insists that the opening of an office in Charlestown is merely intended to improve communications between the two islands, and will not undermine Amory's position. The constitutional procedure for dissolving the federation apparently includes a referendum, which means the process will be protracted. A two-thirds majority in favour of secession is required. Nevis has a population of about 10,000, an area of 93sq km (half that of St Kitts) and considerable autonomy within the federation. It has three seats in the 11-seat federation parliament, as well as an assembly of its own. Both islands' economies are based on sugar cane, and increasingly on tourism. Trans-shipment of drugs is a growing problem, bringing with it violence and a succession of scandals in recent times (see RC-96-05). Back to Headline List CopyrightCARIBBEAN & CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT via NewsNetJuly 25, 1996 FOCUS: CARIBBEAN TOURISM AFTER THE HURRICANES: DISASTERS EXACERBATED TRENDS ALREADY UNDER WAY With the new hurricane season already upon us, there is a good deal of understandable apprehension in the Caribbean countries whose tourist industries were hard hit by last year's high winds. With more statistics now available, it is now possible to assess the impact -at least in terms of visitor arrivals, if not yet always in terms of the associated economic impact. The countries which suffered most were Anguilla, with total arrivals down 14.9%; Antigua & Barbuda (-8.9%), the Bahamas (-8%) and St Kitts-Nevis (-3.2%). If the focus is shifted towards the most lucrative portion of that trade, the stop-over arrivals, the picture changes somewhat. The hardest hit was Antigua & Barbuda (-18.5%), followed by Anguilla (-16.5%), St Kitts-Nevis (-10.4%), Montserrat (-3.5%) -and Grenada, where stop-over arrivals declined by 2.5%, while total arrivals increased by 25.2%. The Bahamas appears as an anomaly: though total arrivals fell, the lucrative stop-over arrivals increased by 4.3%. The economic impact of these developments varied quite considerably, as the tourist industry does not have the same weight in the various economies. It was greatest in Anguilla and Antigua & Barbuda, where tourism earnings in 1994 accounted for 83.4% and 79.6% of GDP, respectively. In the Bahamas it accounted for just over 40%, in St Kitts and Montserrat for 36-38%, and in Grenada for just under 22%. Antigua & Barbuda, which had seen its GDP grow by 5.5% in 1994, registered a 3.8% contraction in 1995. The picture for Anguilla is less clear: in 1994 the economy grew by 8.1%, but all that the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) records for last year in its recently published annual report is, 'Preliminary indications are that GDP contracted in Anguilla in 1995.' At least a slowdown, perhaps even a contraction, took place in Montserrat, which had grown by only 0.8% in 1994. In St Kitts & Nevis the effect ws a slowdown in the rate of growth, from 3.2% in 1994 to 2% in 1995. On the other hand, in both the Bahamas and Grenada there were slight accelerations of the growth rate; from 0.6% to 1.5% in the former, 2% to 2.3% in the latter. It is well worth noting that the hurricanes cannot be blamed for everything; in fact, as the CDB underlines, they seem to have exacerbated trends which were already visible before 1995. The most important one of these is 'the increasing importance of the cruise segment of the industry', to the detriment of the higher-spending stop-over segment. The one stop-over bracket that has been showing positive signs is that of the all-inclusive resorts (on the model of Club Med), though their impact has been chiefly to erode the appeal of the traditional hotel trade. The CDB notes in its annual report that a number of Caribbean countries have tried to act upon this main trend by investing heavily in duty-free facilities for visitors, and that 'these operations appear to have enjoyed a successful year, despite competition from on-board facilities on cruise liners.' Coping successfully with the trends within the tourist industry has become critical because of a broader macro-economic trend noted by the CDB: the continuation in 1995 of 'the shift away from traditional merchandise production to services and tourism, particularly in the smaller BMCs [borrowing member countries].' The economic performance update on the following page incorporates the latest data from the CDB and other sources: please note that in many cases the figures for 1994 have been revised. Back to Headline List CopyrightCARIBBEAN & CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT via NewsNetJuly 25, 1996 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: ELECTIONS: BALAGUER-BOSCH ALLIANCE TRIUMPHS: BUT FERNANDEZ PROMISESNATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT The 'stop Pena Gomez' strategy devised by President Joaquin Balaguer and his old enemy Juan Bosch, outlined in our last issue, was completely successful. Leonel Fernandez, Bosch's youthful (42) protege, duly defeated Pena Gomez in the run-off on 30 June. Fernandez received just over 51% of the votes against Pena Gomez' 48.75%. In the first round on 16 May, Pena Gomez had won 46% to Fernandez' 39%. It was Balaguer's support that made the difference. Fernandez' Partido de la Liberacion Dominicana (PLD) has only one seat in the senate and 12 in the 120-seat lower chamber (see box), which means that the new President will be forced to rely on the backing of Balaguer's Partido Reformista Social Cristiano (PRSC) to get his legislative programme through -at least until the next congressional elections in 1998. Fernandez has talked of wanting a 'government of national unity,' which suggests that he does not relish the prospect of being completely beholden to the octogenarian former President -whose support, he said, was given 'without conditions'. Whether and how Pena Gomez will agree to take part in the new administration remains to be seen. His prompt recognition of his opponent's victory, and pledge to constitute a loyal opposition, were at least a good start. But it is certain that Balaguer will retain a strong influence over whatever government takes shape. One area where the incoming President's resolve will be tested is that of privatisation. He, like Pena Gomez, pledged during the campaign to speed up a process that was begun only reluctantly by Balaguer, who found state-owned enterprises useful instruments of patronage, not to mention revenue. But foreign capital will have to be pumped into the electric power utility if the country's chronic energy crisis is ever to be resolved. The Balaguer-controlled congress has been sitting on the enabling legislation for the past two years. And the sugar marketing monopoly is such a disaster that there is no alternative to divestment. Fernandez has also promised to tackle the corruption that was endemic under Balaguer, and to remove the state budget from the President's personal control. If Pena Gomez is to have some part in the new government, he will insist on electoral reforms, to ensure that opposition candidates have equal access to the media in future, and do not have to fight against the state apparatus as well as the government's candidate.PROFILE: LEONEL FERNANDEZLeonel Antonio Fernandez Reyna is a 42-year-old lawyer, who spent six years of his childhood in New York. He joined the PLD when it was founded in 1973 by Juan Bosch. He worked his way steadily and silently up the party hierarchy, and was Bosch's running-mate in the 1994 presidential elections. A year later he was selected as presidential candidate with 93% support within the PLD. As a relatively young man in a gerontocracy, Fernandez is particularly popular with Dominican youth and -they say- with women (he is divorced).Back to Headline List CopyrightCARIBBEAN & CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT via NewsNetJuly 25, 1996 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO: POLITICS: PNM LOSES GROUND IN LOCAL ELECTIONS: BUT RULING COALITION FAILS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS POSITION The opposition People's National Movement (PNM) won a narrow victory in the local and regional elections on 24 June, but lost some ground overall. The party maintained its dominant position in the urban areas, and retained control of Port of Spain city council. It subsequently chose John Rahael, who owns a chain of clothes shops, to succeed Ethelbert Paul as mayor on 4 July. UNC wins two more councils. Despite winning 63 of the 124 seats at stake in five municipal districts and nine regional councils, the PNM ended up in control of only seven of the country's 14 councils, compared with 10 after the 1992 elections. The United National Congress (UNC), which is stronger in rural areas, now controls six, compared with four last time out. In the previous regional elections, the PNM had won 75 seats to the UNC's 40. The results did not, however, represent the consolidation of the ruling party's position that Prime Minister Basdeo Panday had been hoping for. The UNC's fractious partner in government, A. N. R. Robinson's National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR), which only put up 36 candidates, won no seats at all. Attorney-general Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj commented that the UNC had done as well as could be expected, given the PNM's strong regional organisation. PNM leader Patrick Manning, under fire after losing last November's general election, insisted that his position was not in danger following the latest setbacks.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARIBBEAN & CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT via NewsNetJuly 25, 1996 REGION: BANANAS: PRODUCERS HOPE FOR ACCORD WITH LATINS: CLINTON REFUSES TO WITHDRAW WTO COMPLAINT OVER EU REGIME The Caribbean producers' lobbying of Washington, in an attempt to persuade the US to withdraw its complaint to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) about the European Union's banana market regime (see RC-96-03), is growing increasingly desperate and forlorn. Some sort of agreement with Latin American growers may be their last resort. Clinton sympathetic, but ... When Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson, speaking for all the regional producers, appealed to President Bill Clinton to give the small island producers a break, he received a dusty answer. Despite Clinton's promise that the US does not seek to damage the economies and societies of the Caribbean, it seems unlikely that it will back off from the WTO action. His letter spoke of 'discriminatory and unnecessarily restrictive regulations' in the EU regime. The recent Caricom summit approved plans to convene a meeting with Latin American producers, in Belize in October. The running is being made in Central America by former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico joined Ecuador (the world's biggest banana producer) in supporting the US complaint to the WTO. But bringing the two camps together will not be easy. The low-cost Latin American producers feel that the EU regime, under the Lome Agreement, unfairly discriminates against them as much as it puts US marketing companies, such as Chiquita Brands, at a disadvantage. Lome rules. Under the Lome Agreement (Lome IV), the EU allows 857,000 tonnes a year of Caribbean bananas into its market, while imposing both quotas and duties on Latin American ('dollar') bananas. A framework agreement with four of the Latin American producers -Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela- grants them preferential quotas. Belizean Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel, at least, is optimistic. He says the October meeting 'will allow the two major players in this issue a greater understanding of the problems we face and, perhaps, show us a way forward where we could confront this issue ... from a common understanding rather than the current situation, in which some Central and Latin American producing countries are on one side ... and some others and ourselves are on the other.' The Caribbean producers fear that the EU is wilting under US and Latin American pressure. For the last quarter of 1996, the EU has increased the 'dollar' bananas quota from 2.2m tonnes to 2.55m. This, they say, will both contribute to driving prices down further and take market share away from struggling Caribbean producers. Quality problems. The Windward Islands, in particular, have been struggling with quality-control problems, and recently had to buy fruit from Latin American producers to enable them to fulfil their EU obligations. The Windward Islands Banana Development and Exporting Company (Wibdeco) admitted that it was receiving a premium price from British supermarkets for only 60% of its sales. St Lucia's Prime Minister, Vaughn Lewis, who has good contacts in the US, has now taken on much of the Windwards' lobbying efforts there. He has also been leading discussions with EU representatives on European aid for 'rehabilitation' of the banana industry. At the same time, Grenada's Prime Minister, Keith Mitchell, visited Japan in mid-July in an attempt to persuade Tokyo to use its influence on the Caribbean's behalf at the WTO. Grenada, St Vincent and St Lucia back Japan's demands for a relaxation of international controls on whaling. The burden of this effort, as ever, is to persuade the outside world that the islands depend on bananas for agricultural, economic and social stability -with the threat of increasing problems with drug-trafficking and illegal migrations if that stability is destroyed. Banana exports to Europe account for 50% of the Windwards' foreign exchange earnings. Jagan warning. Guyana's Cheddi Jagan put it in a nutshell at the Caricom meeting when he warned that marijuana was an obvious alternative to bananas for farmers throughout the region. While Clinton's reply to Patterson offered to 'meet informally with Caribbean countries to search for mutually acceptable alternatives to the current EU system,' such vague expressions of good will cut little ice in the Caribbean: the Jamaica Gleaner called it 'double speak'. 'We are comfortable with the EU regime, and if they have an alternative ... which will not damage us, then they must come forward with that ... but they are not doing that,' said Dominica Prime Minister Edison James.GUYANA MILITARY STAND-OFFThe Jagan government found itself in an unexpected confrontation with the military in June, when the dismissed second-in-command of the army (GDF) threatened 'serious instability' unless he was reinstated. The People's Progressive Party (PPP) government held firm. Colonel Goodwin McPherson was suspended after allegations of misappropriation of funds in 1995, while he was temporarily in command of the GDF. The move led to mutterings in the ranks about 'political opportunism'. Some officers say McPherson is being victimised because he is regarded as a supporter of the opposition People's National Congress (PNC), which ruled the country for 28 years. The PPP regarded the predominantly black GDF as an arm of the PNC during the long Forbes Burnham regime, but has praised its 'professionalism' since Jagan's election victory in 1992 -when the military voted overwhelmingly for the PNC.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARIBBEAN & CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT via NewsNetJuly 25, 1996 POSTSCRIPT BAHAMAS/ Cubans repatriated. Thirty-eight Cuban refugees were sent home in June, under a bilateral agreement signed in January on the repatriation of illegal immigrants. A total of 80 people have now been deported since then. Immigration minister C.A. Smith says the process will continue until all the 200 Cubans still in the Bahamas have been returned home. BARBADOS/ Jobless fall. Unemployment in the last quarter of 1995 registered 16.4%, down from 21.7% in the first quarter of the year, according to the latest figures from the central bank. Labour movement. The government has removed work permit requirements for skilled workers from other Caricom member states. The amendment, which fulfils a 1989 agreement by Caricom leaders to move towards the free movement of labour throughout the region, follows similar legislation adopted in Trinidad and Tobago.  BERMUDA/ Burger blockade. The government's controversial decision to allow McDonald's restaurants to open a branch on the island has been overturned by a censure motion passed by the opposition and a group of five government rebels, including former tourism minister Jim Woolridge.  CUBA/ Island online. The government has approved public access to the internet and other information facilities. Businesses and institutions involved in 'national development' will have priority, and users will have to register with the science and technology ministry, reports the official newspaper Granma.Drug seizures. So far this year the authorities have made 24 drug-busts, seizing one and a half tonnes of cocaine and a tonne of marihuana, the national antidrugs commission announces. Though it says it is concerned about the increased use of the island by smugglers, it insists that drug consumption is not a problem in Cuba.Infant mortality falls. Infant deaths in the first six months of the year fell to 8.2 per 1000 births, from 9.4 in the same period of 1995, according to the public health ministry. The World Health Organisation places Cuba among the 25 countries with the lowest rates.Student labour. Nearly one million students belonging to the 'Fuerzas De Accion Pioneriles' and the 'Brigadas Estudiantiles de Trabajo' youth groups, as well as 108,000 teachers, were mobilised on 8 July for a two-week work stint on farms and sugar plantations. According to the organisers 10,000 more students volunteered to help this year than in 1995.  GUYANA/ Gold investment. Government officials say the Canadian mining giant Placer Dome is once again interested in gold mining in Guyana, following a meeting between company director Robert Franklin and President Cheddi Jagan during the latter's recent 12-day visit to Canada. Six years ago the company halted its operations in the country saying the Omai mine was insufficiently profitable.  HAITI/ EU aid boost. Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European Development Commissioner, has promised a 'clear increase' in financial aid for the island over the next five years. He told visiting President Rene Preval that the EU is determined to strengthen democracy and economic development in the Caribbean nation. Haiti has received US Dollars 180m in aid from the EU since 1989.Mixed results. GDP grew by 4% during 1995, following the lifting of the international trade embargo against the former military regime, though unemployment was 50% and the budget deficit increased considerably, Eclac reports. It says most sectors registered growth, with the exception of agriculture, which shrank by 8.5%, partly due to hurricane damage. ST. LUCIA/ Opposition alliance. Julian Hunte, the former leader of the St. Lucia Labour party, will form an alliance against the present government at the upcoming general elections with his one time rival George Odlum, leader of the National Front. Hunte, who recently announced his resignation from politics, said he had a change of heart, and would be standing for the Gros Islet seat. SURINAME/ Parties unite. Three of the main political parties, the New Front, Democratic Alternative 91 and Pendawalina, have begun talks on forming a coalition government, following inconclusive results in May's general elections. The three parties won 32 of the 51 seats in the national assembly. TRINIDAD & TOBAGO/ Trade figures. A trade surplus of US Dollars 133.5m was recorded in the first quarter, a 61% fall on the US Dollars 336m surplus registered in the same period of the previous year, according to the statistics office. The United States is still the major recipient of the islands' exports, receiving 43.6% of the total, though exports to Caricom countries have risen to 27.8%. REGION/ Hurricane strikes. Hurricane Bertha, the first of the Atlantic season, brought winds of up to 160km/h to the region.  Worst hit so far has been Puerto Rico and the British and US Virgin islands, with flooding, downed power lines and damage to property. In Puerto Rico the hurricane left three dead, including one man who drowned while surfing. The island was saved from further damage by a high pressure front which forced the hurricane northwards. A Venezuelan ship got into difficulties off the coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin islands, and 20 of the 42 crew members went missing, feared drowned.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARIBBEAN & CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT via NewsNetJuly 25, 1996 LACAYO FAILS IN BID TO OVERTURN BAN ON HIS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF Nicaragua The decision by the Consejo Supremo Electoral (CSE) to rule out the presidential candidacies of Antonio Lacayo, Alvaro Robelo and Eden Pastora was hailed by Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo on 7 July as a sign that 'the law is beginning to be obeyed in Nicaragua.' After much vacillation, and with violence continuing in many parts of the country, the stage at last appears to be set for a reasonably orderly electoral process in October. The elimination of Lacayo from the contest was no more than an application of the constitutional ban on relatives of the President standing for the office -he is President Violeta Chamorro's son-in-law. But he had hoped until the last moment to mount a successful legal challenge to the ruling. Lacayo, who is 48, will now have to wait until the year 2001 before he can run again for President. His failure, whatever the merits or otherwise of the constitutional provision, introduced last year, is a triumph for the rule of law. The other two hopefuls were ruled out on the grounds that they had adopted foreign citizenship: Robelo, candidate of the right-wing Alianza Nicaraguense, is regarded as an Italian (which he denies) and the former guerrilla leader Pastora ('Comandante Zero') is Costa Rican. Obando y Bravo was encouraged by the fact that the candidates appeared to have accepted the CSE decision 'with resignation', a sign of growing political maturity. Such signs were long overdue, after months of squabbling, delays and factional disputes (see RC-96-04). But the armed groups roaming the central and northern regions have not demonstrated comparable progress. On the contrary, 33 electoral officials were kidnapped and held by one such group in mid-June. Their release, after the intercession of both the church and the Organisation of American States (OAS), was a reminder that Nicaragua's future political stability still rests heavily on the intervention of benevolent outside forces. The army is doing its best to hold the ring, but has its hands full. At the end of June the high command reported that it had been involved in 63 operations against armed bands since the beginning of the year, inflicting more than 80 casualties and detaining a further 200. The gangs, many of which operate close to the Honduran frontier, are pressing for the army to be withdrawn from their areas of influence, and have prevented the electoral authorities from registering voters and distributing identity documents. The authorities estimate that there are 69 armed bands in the centre and north, with a total strength of about 460. Many are former combatants, both Sandinistas and Contras, who now make a living from robbery and kidnappings. The resignation shown by Lacayo's Proyecto Nacional (Pronal) organisation has extended to holding a hastily-arranged convention on 7 July to select a replacement for Lacayo as presidential candidate. Banker and construction company chief Benjamin Lanzas was the only serious contender. The party is not expected to get much more than 2% of the votes on 20 October. A total of 19 presidential candidacies have been approved by the CSE. The leading contenders are Arnoldo Aleman, former mayor of Manuagua, standing for the Liberals, and former President Daniel Ortega, for the Frente Sandinista de Liberacion Nacional (FSLN). Both emerged unscathed from attempts to have their candidacies ruled out by the CSE.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARIBBEAN & CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT via NewsNetJuly 25, 1996 PANAMA: DRUGS & POLITICS: PRESIDENT OBLIGED TO EAT HIS WORDS: 'DIRTY' MONEY DID FIND ITS WAY INTO 1994 ELECTION CAMPAIGN Drug-trafficking and money-laundering, which optimists thought had been brought under control since the removal of General Manuel Noriega in 1989, have elbowed their way back onto the centre-stage of Panamanian politics. President Ernesto Perez Balladares, initially defiant, has been forced to make an embarrassing climb-down. Campaign contribution. The episode began with a resounding success for the Panamanian anti-drugs police when, in cooperation with forces from several other countries, they uncovered a drug shipping and money-laundering operation in the heart of Panama City. It later transpired that the suspected boss of these rackets, Jose Castrillon Henao, a Colombian, had contributed to the President's 1994 election campaign. When the New York Times, Miami Herald and the British weekly The Economist suggested as much, Perez threatened to sue the last-named, but had to back off when it turned out that the publication's charges were, if anything, understated. One positive, if indirect, outcome may be a tightening-up of Panama's banking and company registration laws. Castrillon Henao, who had apparently been running maritime shipping operations for Valle del Cauca cocaine interests out of Panama for at least eight years, had set up dozens of phoney bank accounts in Panama's international financial centre, and used the funds to accumulate an impressive portfolio of property and other interests in Panama, controlled through paper companies. The alarm about what might be going on in the banking centre, where 120 financial institutions have set up shop in the past 25 years under a very relaxed regime, had already been sounded in January. The Banco Agroindustrial y Comercial (Banaico), a small institution with links to the ruling Partido Revolucionario Democratico (PRD), was taken into administration by the national banking commission after a liquidity crisis, and its managers were subsequently charged with fraud. Economy minister Guillermo Chapman explained that the current banking legislation, dating back to 1971, gives the government very limited powers of regulation and supervision. He said changes were needed to make sure there was no repetition of the Banaico scandal. There are currently no controls at all on banks' credit policies, and very undemanding liquidity and reserve requirements. Perez Balladares has insisted that the new legislation must include strong anti-money laundering measures. He is no doubt mindful of the remarks by the State Department's anti-drugs chief, Robert Gelbard, who said in April that 'billions of dollars' were being laundered through the Panamanian financial centre, and the country ran the risk of falling into the clutches of the drug cartels once US forces completed their pull-out at the turn of the century (see RC-96-04). Castrillon's empire. Investigations into Castrillon Henao's activities in Panama revealed that he controlled more than 50 limited companies, and had opened dozens of accounts in at least nine banks, Banaico among them, under a variety of assumed names. One of these companies, the tuna-fishing enterprise Fuji Investments, had paid two cheques totalling US Dollars 51,000 into Perez Balladares' 1994 campaign funds. The payment was made through Felix Estripeaut, a businessman friend of Vice-President Felipe Virzi, who was subsequently appointed ambassador to Costa Rica. Perez Balladares was forced to concede as much in a TV broadcast on 21 June, two weeks after the allegations had appeared in the foreign press. He insisted he had known nothing of Castrillon Henao's narcotics connection, and vowed to get to the bottom of the matter at all costs. Attorney-general Jose Antonio Sosa is now carrying out an inquiry, beginning with depositions from Estripeaut and Virzi. Comparison with Colombia. By insisting that he had nothing to hide, Perez Balladares hoped to avoid a narcoescandalo of the sort that has been obsessing Colombia for the past year, nearly bringing down President Ernesto Samper in the process. The President has also made clear that he wants to see Castrillon extradited to the US. Another possible outcome of this episode is a reform of the financing of election campaigns. The PRD has been pressing for legislation to permit examination of party accounts, to head off opposition accusations that it has accepted 'dirty' money. As with the banking laws, current legislation on campaign funding is extremely lax. At least one other party, the opposition Partido Renovacion Civilista (PRC), has admitted receiving a donation from a Castrillon Henao front company.COLOMBIANS HELDTwo further Colombian drug suspects, Jaime Revello and Vilma Escobar, were arrested in Panama on 4 July, after a six-month police operation. They were described as 'high-level South American mafia' figures. Escobar is the wife of Colombian drug boss Julian Garcia.COSTA RICA WARNINGThe US ambassador in San Jose, Peter de Vos, said on 5 July that Costa Rica was an 'important bridge' in the transport of drugs to the US from South America. He said the port of Limon was used for shipments, while light aircraft and road transport were also used. He added that he was 'very satisfied' with the cooperation of the Costa Rican government against such activities, but noted that much remained to be done.TREATY ROW IN HONDURASAn anti-drug and money-laundering treaty under negotiation with the US has provoked objections from government, opposition and military figures that some of the US demands would damage Honduran sovereignty. US personnel would be permitted to operate freely in Honduran territory and DEA agents would enjoy diplomatic immunity under the agreement. Honduran police had confiscated more than 3 tonnes of cocaine by mid-June; some 90% of the cocaine heading for the US market is believed to pass through Honduras.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARIBBEAN & CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT via NewsNetJuly 25, 1996 COSTA RICA: POLITICS: FIGUERES RESHUFFLES HIS CABINET PACK: PRIVATE SECTOR APPROVES BUT PUBLIC LESS IMPRESSED The sudden cabinet reshuffle at the beginning of July by President Jose Maria Figueres was variously described as 'profound' by the President, as 'window-dressing' by the opposition and as something in between by respondents to opinion polls. The new-look cabinet contained only three fresh faces. More liberalisation. Figueres explained in a radio and television broadcast on 1 July that he had asked for the collective resignation of his government to enable him to deepen the processes of economic and trade liberalisation already initiated, and thereby to hasten the insertion of Costa Rica into the new, 'globalised' world order. His aim, he said, was to achieve these aims with the minimum 'social' impact and without harming the environment. He promised to concentrate, during the remaining 22 months of his four-year term, on four issues: Modernisation of the telecommunications system; Improvements to the road network; Reinforcement of health and education programmes; and Progress towards a national pensions system.  The President's plea for a national consensus on these issues came at a time when his own party was riven by dissent and congress was deadlocked. Members of the ruling Partido Liberacion Nacional (PLN) had brought legislative work to a halt in mid-June in a dispute over the election of a new comptroller-general and his deputy. Figueres and PLN deputies were outraged when their colleague Walter Coto, the chairman of congress, allied with the opposition Partido Unidad Social Cristiana (PUSC) to ensure the election of Luis Fernando Vargas and Jorge Corrales, the latter from the PUSC. The President had backed his close friend Rodolfo Silva for the top job, but his appointment was blocked by the opposition, while Corrales was unacceptable to the PLN, who blamed him for failing to head off the collapse of the Banco Anglo-Costarricense in 1994. Unpopular President. The opposition pointed out that Figueres' move smacked of desperation, at a time when, partly as a result of all this wrangling, his popularity had slumped to an all-time low (see RC-96-05). More than 50% of respondents to opinion polls in June described his performance as bad or very bad, and more again thought there was no prospect of an improvement. At least Figueres succeeded in winning the approval of the private sector for his bold move, with the Union Costarricense de Camaras y Asociaciones de la Empresa Privada (Uccaep) saying that economic reactivation would be impossible as long as rumour and uncertainty gripped the country. Business approval increased when Figueres appointed the former president of the Camara de Industrias, Jose Leon Desanti, as economy minister on 4 July -the last appointment to be announced. The President said he hoped the appointment would symbolise an alliance with the private sector to improve output and competitiveness. Desanti had been an outspoken critic of the government's lack of a coherent industrial policy, singling out tax increases and poor infrastructure for particular attention. The replacement of only three ministers was taken by the opposition to mean that new initiatives would be strictly limited, and public opinion seemed to be unimpressed: 80.9% told the Demoscopia polling firm that the changes were superficial. The disappointment extended to the ruling PLN: Walter Coto complained there had been no change of attitude or style in the government team. Lorena Vazquez, general secretary of the PUSC, said Figueres was guilty of a political swindle. They noted that Figueres had kept faith with his inner circle of friends and advisers: security minister Juan Diego Castro, censured last year by congress, had been moved to justice, while his replacement at security was former transport minister Bernardo Arce -a graduate, like Figueres, of West Point. Marcos Vargas, Figueres' campaign treasurer, was transferred from the economy ministry to the presidency, and another crony, Ricardo Garron, was given the agriculture portfolio.

Costa Rica's manufacturing industry, after growing at 40% a year in the 1980s, is slowly being replaced by high-tech industries, which benefit from the country's skilled workforce and proximity to the US market. The textile industry, accounting for 70% of manufactures, has particularly suffered, being undercut in the US by duty-free Mexican textiles since Nafta came into force. The tourism sector is also in recession, with 70% of hotels expected to end this year with losses.IMF agreement. The new finance minister, Francisco de Paula, travelled to Washington in early July to explain to IMF officials his government's failure to keep the fiscal deficit to 0.5% of GDP as agreed. The more realistic prediction of 2% was put down to external factors, despite the comptroller-general's report which condemned the government for its lack of fiscal discipline, especially the issuing of bonds well beyond the limits authorised by congress.EL SALVADOR/ Prison protest. President Armando Calderon Sol announced several measures to tackle the growing prisons crisis, including the construction of a new penal centre. Seventy inmates of Santa Ana prison have been taken to hospital after a month-long hunger strike in protest at overcrowding, long sentences and slow judicial procedures. Almost 74% of the country's prison population still await sentencing, and prisons are at over double their capacity.Death threats. The extreme-right Furoda (Fuerza Nacionalista Roberto D'Aubuisson), named after the alleged creator of the 'death squads', has reiterated its death threats to 15 prominent public figures. President Calderon Sol has denied any involvement of his Arena party, and has promised a thorough investigation. Meanwhile, two of the four students arrested in mid-June after bomb attacks on property belonging to former president Alfredo Cristiani have been released.GUATEMALA/ Death penalty. Two men convicted of the rape and murder of a four-year-old girl in 1993 are to be sent to the gallows after the constitutional court turned down their appeal. President Alvaro Arzu's subsequent refusal to pardon Roberto Giron and Pedro Castillo has provoked consternation in human rights groups at what will be the first judicial execution in Guatemala for 13 years. Amnesty International deeply regretted 'this step backwards' and criticised Guatemala's contravening of the 1978 American Convention on Human Rights, which stipulated that the death penalty could not be extended to cover additional crimes. Last year however, kidnapping was added to the offences punishable by death, and following a police operation in June in which two gangs were arrested and charged with kidnapping, the interior minister, Rodolfo Mendoza, called for the death penalty to be applied as a deterrent.Military exemption ends. A new law, passed unanimously by congress, has effectively ended a century of privilege for the military, who are now to be tried in the civilian courts for all but strictly military crimes. This assault on military impunity was followed by President Arzu's decision to remove six colonels and a general from their posts, as part of his continuing 'cleansing' of the armed forces. The next step is to be a three-phase disbanding of the civilian self-defence patrols (PACs), a key element in the army's counter-insurgency strategy.HONDURAS/ Corruption. A former minister and a labour leader were the latest figures of the Callejas administration (1990-1994) to be accused of corruption in President Roberto Reina's 'moral revolution' campaign. Former President Rafael Callejas, also accused in spite of his parliamentary impunity, complained of Reina's 'purely political persecution'. Meanwhile, a further 13 military officers, charged with murdering two civilians in 1982, are on the run, joining the three fugitive officers accused of human rights violations who are suspected of hiding out in Chile, the US or Spain for the past eight months.Coffee rise. Coffee exports will have increased 30% by the end of this harvest-year to reach 2.8m bags, generating some US Dollars 300m, and confirming coffee as the country's main export. Other sectors are suffering from the economic crisis provoked by a US Dollars 4.1bn debt burden and a growing trade deficit.NICARAGUA/ Tax reform. President Violeta Chamorro has asked the national assembly to approve the delayed tax reform law as soon as possible, to free US Dollars 115m in new credits from multilateral organisations that await passage of the reform. But public finances were further squeezed when a special commission of the assembly rejected the presidential veto on allocating 6% of the budget to the universities.Delincuents clampdown. The Managua police are to launch a campaign to contain the growth of armed youth gangs in the capital over the last year. There are estimated to be around 66 bands in the city, with members ranging between the ages of 11 and 15, armed with firearms and knives. A significant number of the gangs' members appear to have recently returned from the United States. Four teenegers were killed at the end of June as a result of gang infighting. PANAMA/ Tax climbdown. The government looks set to reverse a decision to impose an additional income tax on businesses in the Colon free zone, following several managerial-level strikes. The free zone, which generates revenues of US Dollars 11bn from imports and re-exports, has seen a 21.3% drop in commercial activity over the past five months, reflecting the nationwide recession. However, the Panama Canal authorities are expecting record toll receipts this year, after last year's figures showed a 6.7% increase over 1994. A total of 13,631 ships paid US Dollars 462m.Arms for guerrillas. Police confiscated 11 AK-47 assault rifles and 28,000 ammunition cartridges from a Panamanian man en route to the port of Colon, from where the authorities believe the weapons were to be shipped to the Colombian Farc guerrillas.REGION/ Military peace.

Fridaysealed  a  joint-venture agreement with three Japanese enterprises tobuild a circuit foil plant in Taiwan.    The  plant, estimated to cost NT$2.25 billion (US$81.81 million),is  scheduled  to  come on line before the end of 1997, with a yearlyoutput of 5,100 metric tons of circuit foil.    The  production  facility will be located in the Toliu IndustrialPark, central Taiwan, occupying an area of 3.1 hectares. Constructionof  the  plant  is slated to begin in July. The investment project ispending the final approval of the Economics Ministry.    Taisugar  will  hold  a  45  percent  stake  in the joint-ventureproject  while  Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. will control a 25 percentinterest  and  Nichimen  Corp.  and  Circuit  Foil  Japan will own 20percent and 10 percent, respectively.    "The  design  of  the  plant and manufacturing technology will beprovided  by  Circuit  Foil Japan," Taisugar President Chien Pin-tsaisaid,  adding  that  except  for  some  machines,  the  bulk  of  themanufacturing equipment the plant needs is available in Taiwan.    According  to Chien, Taiwan consumes about 25,000 tons of circuitfoil a year, 12,000 tons of which relies on import. Circuit foil is akey  material  used in circuit boards and a wide range of electronicsproducts.    Masaya  Imayi,  standing  board director of Furukawa Electric andwho  was  present  to ink the agreement, said the investment decisionwas  prompted  by the booming development of the electronics industryin Taiwan and elsewhere in the Asian region.    "Taiwan is expected to play a pivotal role in Furukawa Electric'sglobal operation strategy," Imayi said.    Furukawa  has been manufacturing and marketing circuit foil since1961 and has emerged as the largest supplier of foil used in printingcircuit boards in Japan.    Furukawa has NT$160 billion (US$5.81 billion) in annual revenues,while  Nichimen,  one of the top eight trading firms in Japan, boastsNT$2 trillion. Of the 10,000 tons of circuit foil Taiwan imports fromJapan each year, 50-70 percent is transacted through Nichimen.(By Benjamin Yeh)Copyright 1996 Central News AgencyBack to Headline List CopyrightCENTRAL NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 14, 1996TAICHUNG EPZ EXPORTS UP IN FIRST 8 MONTHSfrom CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  The  Taichung  Export  Processing Zoneexported  US$536  million worth of products in the first eight monthsof  this  year,  up from US$526 million in the same period last year,according  to  statistics released Saturday by the EPZ Administrationunder the Economics Ministry.

Johnson said Taiwan once imported 10 containers of crocodile meatfrom  the  United States in 1992, but the meat was banned from importin 1993 because of wildlife protection issues.    He  said  crocodile meat produced in the US comes from farms thatalso raise chickens and cows, so the crocodile meat, like chicken andbeef, has nothing to do with wildlife protection.    Hong Kong, Britain, Belgium, and Germany also import US crocodilemeat,  while  South  Korea,  Hong  Kong, Singapore, Italy, and Franceimport crocodile leather.    American  businessmen  once  tried  to  export  crocodile meat toShanghai, but the deal fell through because of price differences.    Resumption  of  crocodile meat exports to Taiwan was raised whileLin  Yung-loh,  director-general  of the Taipei Economic and CulturalOffice in Boston, was visiting Louisiana.(By Eddie Shay and Danielle Yang)Copyright 1996 Central News AgencyBack to Headline List CopyrightCENTRAL NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 14, 1996'NEW TAIWAN EXPERIENCE ERA' HAS BEGUN, SAYS LEEfrom CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996    Taipei,  Sept. 14 (CNA) President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday thata  "new  Taiwan  experience  era"  began  when  the Republic of Chinacompleted  the  first popular presidential election in 5,000 years ofChinese history in March.    The pivotal task for Taiwan now is to ensure a solid existence ofthe  Republic of China in the face of a volatile future, Lee said. Toreach  that  goal,  he noted, "We must stabilize society, broaden ourinternational   horizons,  and  accelerate  exchanges  with  mainlandChina."    Addressing  the  Third  National  Management  Forum  which openedThursday  at the Grand Hyatt Taipei, Lee called on the Taiwan public,particularly  the  business  sector  to  "avoid  jumping  the gun andexercise  patience"  in the face of a renewed economic offensive frommainland China.    Lee  said Beijing has recently stepped up its economic offensive,a  strategy designed to gain political aims through commercial means.While luring Taiwan civilians and businessmen to press the governmentto adopt policies in its favor, Beijing is also trying to agitate thesociety of Taiwan, he pointed out.    Lee  told the forum, which pulled together more than 400 businessand industrial leaders of the country, that the government will spareno effort to improve Taiwan's investment climate.    He said he will ask related government agencies to see to it thatall   investment   barriers,   including   the   difficulty  in  landacquisition,  are  addressed within six months to expedite investmenthere at home. A special desk will be established soon exclusively forhandling land-related problems, and the processing for each case willbe handled in no longer than two months, Lee promised.    Outdated  and  inefficient regulations must go to create a betterinvestment  environment,  he  added.  Taking Japan as an example, Leesaid  that  despite  government's  efforts to cut interest rates, theJapanese  economy  has not been able to break out of its recession inseven  or  eight years because superannuated regulations and statutesthere have blocked the way and choked off investment willingness.    During  the  three-day  forum,  Taiwan's  business and industrialleaders  expressed  confidence  in the country's future and agreed topitch  in  more  than NT$100 billion (US$3.6 billion) in the next twoyears for investment projects on the island.(By Debbie Kuo)Copyright 1996 Central News AgencyBack to Headline List CopyrightCENTRAL NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 14, 1996TAIWAN 'KAMIKAZE SQUAD' VOWS TO BLOW UP DISPUTED LIGHTHOUSEfrom CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  Six men with criminal records Saturdayformed  a  death  squad  and  pledged  to destroy the lighthouse theyclaimed  was  erected illegally by a Japanese right-wing group on oneof the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands.    The  six  men,  all of which received diving and bombing trainingwhen  they  served  in  the  army,  met  the  press and displayed thetestament they signed.    The  group  guaranteed  they  would  blow  up  the  solar-poweredlighthouse  set  up  on one of the Tiaoyutais in the middle of May bythe Japan Youth Federation.    The uninhabitated islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan, lie inthe  East  China Sea about 200 kilometers northeast of Taiwan and 300kilometers west of Japan's Okinawa Island. Taiwan, mainland China andJapan all lay sovereignty claims over the islands.    "Should  any  one  of  them  die of natural disaster or any otherreason  on  their  voyage  to  the  Tiaoyutais,  their families wouldreceive  NT$600,000  each,"  said  Tung Nien-tai, head of a center toprovide  services  to  former  inmates.  Tung said he would raise themoney from the public, if needed.    The  blitz  plans  are  underway,  Tung  said,  adding  that  theoperation would be launched soon.    Tung said that under his draft plans, the group would swim ashoreafter  being  brought  by a boat to waters about a nautical mile fromthe lighthouse.    No government officials were immediately available for comment.    Saturday's  announcement  came  as the international dispute overthe  Tiaoyutais  was  escalating.  After  the  lighthouse was set up,another  Japanese  ultra-right  group,  the  Senkaku  Islands DefenseAssociation, in mid-August planted a wooden Japanese flag and erecteda war memorial on the largest of the islands.    The  provocative moves  have  triggered  a  strong  response fromChinese  communities  in the United States, mainland China, Hong Kongand  Taiwan.  While  some  groups  protested  to  Japanese governmentofficials stationed in their area, others have called for an allianceof  the Chinese throughout the world to stand tough against what theycalled a "Japanese invasion" of Chinese territory.    In  Taipei,  the  government  of the Republic of China, saying itwants  to  settle  the  dispute with Japan peacefully, has repeatedlyurged  the  Japanese  government  to  restrain its people from takingfurther provocative actions.(By Benjamin Yeh)Copyright 1996 Central News AgencyBack to Headline List CopyrightCENTRAL NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 14, 1996NO CONSENSUS IN US-TAIWAN MEDICAL EQUIPMENT CONSULTATIONSfrom CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  While Taiwan has just been told by theUnited  States  that  it  will  be  removed  from  the  "Special 301"blacklist  for  having achieved satisfactory progress in intellectualproperty  rights  (IPR)  protection,  it may face a fresh threat fromWashington over its new medical equipment pricing policy.    No  consensus was reached Saturday in a US-Taiwan consultation onTaiwan's pricing policy for medical equipment, and whether Washingtonwill  list  Taiwan  under  its  "Super  301" bill for trade sanctionsremains to be seen.    David  Burns,  chief officer in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs atthe  office  of  the  US Trade Representative (USTR), on Saturday metwith  officials  from the Department of Health (DOH) and the NationalHealth  Insurance  Bureau (NHIB) on NHIB's pricing policy for medicalequipment and related products.    The  two  parties  failed  to reach any consensus, and decided tomeet again on Monday for another round of talks.    The  USTR  office  was  reported earlier this week to have listedTaiwan  as a "priority country" under its annual "Super 301" bill fortrade   sanctions   after   the   US  Health  Industry  ManufacturersAssociation filed an accusation saying Taiwan's new medical equipmentpricing policy is "non-transparent and discriminates against Americansuppliers."    Burns   said  Taiwan's  implementation  of  the  national  healthinsurance  program  is  highly  commendable.  But it takes effort andexpertise  to  ensure  the  public's  access  to quality medicine andmedical  equipment.  He  said  American  medical equipment comes withquality,  and  Taiwanese  patients  have  the  right  to  use qualityproducts.    USTR  officials will continue to exchange views with DOH and NHIBofficials  in  the  next two weeks on the pricing policy, Burns said,adding  that  his office will not make any decision until Sept. 30 onwhether to recommend a "Super 301" listing for retaliation.    Yeh Chin-chuan, general manager of the NHIB, said the new medicalequipment  pricing  policy  is consistent with the national treatmentprinciple  set by the World Trade Organization, as it applies to bothlocal and foreign suppliers.    Foreign  suppliers  can  file  their complaints to Taiwan if theywant  to  challenge  the  policy, and the NHIB will review the policyperiodically, Yeh added.    Yeh  hoped  that all misunderstandings will be solved in the nextround of talks on Monday. If not, he said, NHIB officials will travelto the United States later this month for further talks.(By Debbie Kuo)Copyright 1996 Central News AgencyBack to Headline List CopyrightCENTRAL NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 14, 1996CHANG ASKS JAPAN TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN TERRITORIAL DISPUTEfrom CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  Foreign Affairs Minister John Chang onSaturday  reiterated  his  call  for  Japan  to exercise restraint inhandling  the  territorial dispute over the Tiaoyutai Islands, or theSenkakus to the Japanese.

Observers  from  here  and  abroad have urged Taipei and Beijing,which  are  still  technically at war since 1949, to work together innegotiating with Japan.    The  Tiaoyutais  lie  in  the East China Sea about 200 kilometersnortheast  of  Taiwan  and  300  kilometers  west  of Japan's OkinawaIsland.  Taipei,  Beijing  and  Tokyo  all claim sovereignty over theuninhabitated islands.    Chang  also  declined  to  comment on  the  report  that  a localrightest  organization  is  planning to send a death squad to blow upthe  lighthouse erected by a Japanese group on one of the islands. "Ihave no knowledge of the report," Chang said.    Cheng  said  he  could understand the patriotism some people havetoward  the  country,  but  he  stressed  that calmness is definitelyneeded to settle the issue.    He  also  urged the public to have faith in the government. "Fromthe  government's  point of view, the priority we always have in mindis what is in the best interests of the country and people."

INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996Japan should understand that the Chinese people's determination todefend China's State sovereignty and territorial integrity isunshakable, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday in Beijing.Spokesman Shen Guofang warned Japan to be fully aware of theseriousness of the matter and not to provoke any new incidents.His remarks came in response to the report that Japanese coast guardand police vessels expelled Hong Kong vessels which tried to approachthe Diaoyu Islands.Japan has created disturbances continuously on the Diaoyu Islandsissue, seriously infringing upon China's sovereignty and territorialintegrity, Shen said.This of course arouses strong indignation among the entire Chinesepeople, including compatriots of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, he said.When asked to comment on Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda'sclaim at the UN General Assembly of the United Nations that the islandsare Japan's territory, Shen said that China's position on this issuehas never changed.It is indisputable that the Diaoyu Islands and its adjacent islands arean inalienable part of China, he said.He urged Japan to take steps to stop activities which infringe onChina's sovereignty and said that Japan is responsible to make surethat no new incidents will take place.Referring to Australian Prime Minister John Howard's upcoming meetingwith the Dalai Lama on coming Thursday, Shen reiterated that thisconstitutes an interference into China's internal affairs.Whatever the outcome, a shadow will surely be casted over bilateralrelations, Shen said.China has made many representations with the Australian government andhopes that it will take a correct attitude, he said.Commenting on the report that Taiwanese leader Lee Teng-hui has askedto hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Shen saidAsian-Pacific countries have conducted fruitful dialogues on securityissues, which can only be held among sovereignty countries.Taiwan, which is part of China, is not at all qualified to take part insuch activities, Shen said.Also at the briefing, Shen said that, looking back at history, thecountry which had constituted a threat to the Asia-Pacific region wasnone other than Japan."Peace in the Asia-Pacific region should be maintained by this region'scountries and peoples," Shen said.These remarks were made when Shen was asked to comment on theUS-Japanese security communique released last week.He said if this agreement, which is a bilateral arrangement, exceedsbilateral range and is aimed against a third country or involves othercountries' interests, complications will result in the development ofthe matter.He expressed the hope that Japan will have a clear understanding of theissue.Copyright

Allnuclear weapon states should undertake not to be the first to usenuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstance, committhemselves unconditionally to the non-use or threat of use of nuclearweapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones,and conclude, at an early date, international legal instruments to thiseffect."China called on all nuclear weapon states to pledge their support toproposals for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, respecttheir status as such and undertake corresponding obligations.The statement said no country should develop or deploy space weaponsystems or missile defense systems undermining strategic security andstability.And an international convention on the complete prohibition andthorough destruction of nuclear weapons should be concluded throughnegotiations, it added.The statement said that the Chinese government endorses the applicationof verification measures consistent with the provisions of the CTBT toensure its faithful implementation and at the same time it firmlyopposes the abuse of verification rights by any country, including theuse of espionage or human intelligence, to infringe upon thesovereignty of other countries and impair their legitimate securityinterests in violation of universally recognized principles ofinternational law.It said that in the present day world where huge nuclear arsenals andnuclear deterrence policy based on the first use of nuclear weaponsstill exist, the supreme national interests of China demand that itensure the safety, reliability and effectiveness of its nuclear weaponsbefore the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons is achieved.Copyright 1996 China Business Information NetworkBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK via NewsNetSeptember 25, 1996China: High-tech code system developed to combat fake goodsfrom CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996A high-tech system that uses secret codes to combat fake goods in Chinais to go national after a successful trial operation.The system, invented by Chinese experts, uses a telephone network andelectronic codes to identify genuine articles. A national workconference held in Haikou of Hainan Province to discuss the system hasbeen told it is to be spread nationwide after been proved successful.Its trial operation in parts of the country since January this yearreceived positive response from users.China Anti-Fakes Association is entrusted by the State Bureau ofTechnical Supervision to popularize it throughout the country.Hainan Tenglong Anti-Fake Technology Company, which is based in Haikou,capital of Hainan in South China, is responsible for implementing theproject.The system, based on computerized data banks and the nationalcomputerized telephone information retrieval network, will providemanufacturers of quality products with special data codes and secretcodes.Commodity dealers or buyers can check up the goods they have purchasedby telephone, after tearing off the cover on the codes.Since it is a hi-tech system, it is impossible for anyone to producefake codes, according to experts.The Hainan-based company has invested 40 million yuan ($4.8 million) toset up a data bank capable of holding 50 billion different electroniccodes. Terminals will be built in major cities across the country.Some experts say the network will help protect quality and brand-famedproducts in the country.Copyright 1996 China Business Information NetworkBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK via NewsNetSeptember 25, 1996China: New Xuzhou railway station goes into operationfrom CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996A new railway station in Xuzhou, a major city in east China's JiangsuProvince, went into operation Monday.The station, covering a floor space of 33,000 square meters, is locatedat the intersection of the Beijing-Shanghai and Lanzhou-Lianyunganglines.Investment in the station, the largest and the most advanced among allcities the same size as Xuzhou, surpassed 500 million yuan (about 60million US dollars).The station has a range of modern services and management facilities,and is six times larger than its predecessor.

Chen, President of Lingnan College at a news conference inHong Kong yesterday, who gave a general introduction to the annualreport, the fifth published by UNCTAD since 1992.In his view, the figures simply reflect normal commercial activities torationalize production and accumulate wealth. Hong Kong is a fundingcenter which draws money from other places of the world and then poursinto China, so the big outflows are not all from Hong Kong investors,said Chen.Touching on Hong Kong after 1997, the reports says the city shouldcontinue to be a separate customs territory and an independent memberof the World Trade Organization (WTO). According to Chen, there is goodevidence that the whole world has confidence in Hong Kong so long as itmaintains the current economic independence as stipulated in the BasicLaw, the de facto constitution of the future Special AdministrativeRegion.UNCTAD plays an important role in promoting trade and investmentthroughout the world.Copyright 1996 China Business Information NetworkBack to Headline List WT03-B04-10IA086-000616-B001-318http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it128.html 205.156.212.5 19970122023422 text/html 59758HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:32:01 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:39 GMTContent-length: 59571Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it128.html Sample Issue Copyright CHINA DAILY via NewsNet September 24, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES China: Chemical industry shows off (341 words) China: Domestic bourses see jump HK shares close higher (914 words) China: Scientists to document earliest dynasties (758 words) China: Uncovering the start of history (1173 words) China: Poverty relief high on Party's agenda (397 words) China: Jiang hails relations with Kiribati (337 words) China: Environment key to sustaining economic progress (374 words) China: Ministry calls for efficiency in heating (395 words) China: Weather reports ( Page 2, Date: 09/24/96 ) (305 words) China: Highway vices curtailed (226 words) China: Children's book fair to be held in Beijing (290 words) China: Poor girls get school aid (391 words) China: 38 die as Typhoon Willie wreaks havoc on Hainan (328 words) China: Japan must try to win trust of others (939 words) China: More State firms turn to high-tech (455 words) China: Time to counter negative views on China (607 words) China: Agreement focuses on electrical insulators (406 words) CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: Chemical industry shows offfrom CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 5THE latest chemical industry products, equipment and technology are onshow and investment co-operation is being sought at an internationalindustry fair which opened in Beijing yesterday."Current development has already been restricted by problems in fundsand technology, which indicates we must continue to firmly implementthe policy of opening up to the outside world, and fully use theresources, funds and markets available both at home and abroad," saidHe Guoqiang, vice-minister of chemical industry at the fair'sopening.According to He, the fair, which runs from September 23 to 27 in theChina International Exhibition Centre, has so far drawn 95 overseaschemical industry enterprises from 20 countries and regions, as wellas about 2,000 domestic enterprises.Domestic participants are profiling about 120 projects forco-operation and highlighting nearly 160 types of technology andequipment for export."I am very happy to see there are new trends in co-operation betweenforeign chemical circles and China's chemical industry over the lastcouple of years," He said.He cited four obvious changes, including the shifts: from simpleimport of technology to all-round co-operation in scientificresearch, production, personnel training and environmentalprotection; from investments in individual projects to participationin regional development of economic zones; from small projects tothose on a larger scale with a substantial amount of investment andhigh technology content; and from co-operation with only a few largecompanies to co-operation including medium and small-sizedenterprises.In the ongoing Ninth Five-Year Plan, the industry will stress threepriorities: agrochemicals, such as fertilizer and pesticides, will befurther developed to meet the growing demands of agriculturalproduction; the petrochemical industry will be vigorously developedby accelerating the production of organic raw materials, organicintermediates, synthetic materials and fine and specialty chemicalsto support other pillar industries like the mechanical, electronic,automobile manufacturing and building industries; and production ofhigh-tech and high value-added products will be expanded.Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: Domestic bourses see jump HK shares close higherfrom CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 7SHANGHAI -- The market opened the week in a bright mood.The composite index yesterday jumped 46.45 to end at 851.99 points inactive trading.Shenma Industry was yesterday's best performer, gaining 19.46 per centto reach 8.9 yuan ($1.07).

Theproject, which is meant to give a clear, coherent picture of China'sbeginnings, is the first of its kind supported by the government. Itis also considered an unprecedented co-operative effort between twofields -- science and history.Feature writers of China Daily have talked with the project'sinitiator, State Councillor Song Jian, as well as project leader LiXueqin, archaeologist Li Boqian, astronomer Zhang Peiyu, Chineselanguage professor Qiu Xigui and other scientists concerned. Thefollowing is a series of articles on the interviews in today's andtomorrow's page 9.By Li Xing and Gong QianCHINA'S top historians and scientists will put their heads together todevelop a cohesive chronology of early Chinese history.The project, which will be concluded in about three years, is intendedto create a dynasty outline dating to the Xia and early Shang eras,noting the dates of each king's reign from Shang to Zhou dynasties.The project is the brainchild of State Councillor Song Jian, ascientist who specializes in astronautics and system control."We work together and apply modern science to the study of history,provide convincing scientific bases, and give a more clear history toour children," he said.The project faces several hurdles because of differing historicalviews.For example, some ancient documents cite the 21st century BC as theorigin of Chinese history. But the documents don't corroborate witharchaeological and scientific evidence.Furthermore, some early 20th century accounts may have been distortedby revolutionary views that often discounted traditional ideas. Fordecades, individual historians clung to their own views and couldn'tagree on early history.But Song is determined to sort it out."We can't go on saying that we have a 5,000-year-old history whiledenying its existence," he said.Similar efforts to substantiate history have been successful elsewherein the world, so Song believes his project is possible.He developed the idea after a trip to Egypt two years ago, when hevisited an ancient papyrus mill and marveled at the Rosetta Stone,which bears the decree of an Egyptian king in hieroglyphics. He wasimpressed by the sophistication of Egyptian studies, the result ofconcerted research by Egyptian and European scholars.When Song returned to China, he sent his opinions to historians andarchaeologists and found that some of them agreed with him.Among them was archaeologist Kwang-chih Chang. He responded that nosingle scholar was capable of such a big project, but that it couldbe accomplished through teamwork and strong leadership.Too often, Chinese scholars have concentrated on an obscure area orspecific subject. While the practice produced endless details, it didlittle to give a complete portrayal of Chinese history.Song believed historians could apply the same methods used byscientists who measure geological time. He suggested that historiansspecializing in the same time periods should join together to discussdivisions in that era. The results of their consensus would then bepublished as a reference document, which could later be revised."It's like building a basic co-ordinate," Song said. "To ascertain aking's rule ended in this year or the next has little significance,but obvious events that reflect political or dynastic changes must bein accord."Most experts welcomed the idea, but a few have reservations. Songbelieves that their different recommendations are valid, but that theapplication of modern science must take precedence.With the rise of modern astronomy, which can reconstruct ancientcelestial phenomena, and the use of advanced dating techniques, Songbelieves the two fields should be combined to study history.He also sees great potential in archaeological work. Unfortunately,Chinese houses and tombs, made from earth and wood, often failed toendure harsh weather and time.Despite the project's intimidating scale, Song is confident."With more money flowing into field work and research, I believe itwill bear some result," he said.Song also believes the project can help boost the nation's morale."Respect for our national culture is crucial to the country'sprogress," he said. "In this respect, historians should be the firstto do their part."Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: Uncovering the start of historyfrom CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 9MODERN archaeology has helped push back the earliest known dates inChinese history at least 1,000 years by authenticating the existenceof the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th century BC) through the discoveriesof its capitals below modern Zhengzhou and Anyang.Will archaeologists create history again in a huge chronology project?Archaeologist Li Boqian, one of the leading experts working on theproject, believes the evidence points to an even earlier startingpoint for Chinese civilization, but says that this will be hard toprove.Before modern archaeology was introduced to China, historians basedtheir theories on such ancient books as "Records of the Historian"written by Sima Qian and "the Bamboo Annal." These texts suggestChinese history begins with a dynasty called Xia, which dates back tothe 21st century BC.But here lies the snag: there is no evidence of this ancient kingdom.If Xia ever had a written language, no traces of it have been found.Virtually everything that scholars know about them is based on theancient books.It is therefore not surprising that while experts have plenty oftheories about the origins of the Xia, few are universally accepted.From early this century, a group of scholars began to attack theauthenticity of these written records, dismissing them as merelegends. Some even regard the investigation of the dynasty as a wasteof time.As this view gradually came to prevail, the more cautious experts havepushed back their estimates of the beginning of China's socialhistory by more than 1,000 years.Then, in the early part of this century, the increasing use ofarchaeological techniques located the Shang capital in Anyang inCentral China's Henan Province. This proved that what the books sayabout this dynasty is largely true. Pictograms inscribed on cattlebones and tortoise shells found in Anyang provide firmer proof.The discovery once again raised hopes in the minds of some historiansthat the account of the Xia given by the "Records of the Historian"may also have some truth in it.Artifacts and images have been found which are sufficiently older, andmarkedly different from those of later civilization. For instance,the earliest Chinese cooking utensils were jars or ding -- cookingvessels with two loop handles and three legs. Shang people used li(cooking tripods with hollow legs) and yan (steamers with a bowl-likeupper part and a ding-tripod lower part).These objects came from a series of ancient sites found since the1950s. Known as the Erlitou sites, they are scattered across centraland western Henan and northwest Shanxi, on the fertile plainsoverlooking the Luohe River and Yihe River -- exactly where the Xiapeople lived according to the old books. Carbon-14 techniques datethe Erlitou culture as existing between the 21st century BC and the17th century BC.Two large excavations in the '60s and '70s resulted in the discoveryof a palace foundation.A rammed earth base, 80 centimetres thick, and remains of walls and acolonnade have been identified. The whole structure and layoutprefigures the structure of later Chinese palaces. The scale andcomplexity of the engineering would demand a large group of peopleunder rulers able to direct the labour project -- probably a state."Understanding the Erlitou culture is the key to the chronology of theXia," said Li Boqian. "Most experts now tend to believe Erlitouculture belongs to the late Xia Dynasty."Li said that even if the Xia language has not been unearthed, thereare other elements that might well prove the existence of the XiaDynasty. Archaeologists will take samples from the different stagesof the Erlitou excavation and compare them with samples from the sametime-band elsewhere."The results may not be final, but they are certain to be moreunanimous," said Li.The beginning of the Xia kingdom -- if it existed -- is even moreelusive than its end. Some scholars believe it shows affinity withthe older neolithic Longshan culture, a culture characterized byblack pottery dating between 3000-2000 BC.Archaeologists have found Longshan household objects, such as potterywine cups and a kitchen range buried in big tombs and walled cities.Longshan rulers turned to priest-advisers for predictions ongovernment matters and the outcome of hunts and battles. The priestsapplied red-hot rods to the bones of cattle until they cracked, theninterpreted the cracks as auguries from the spirits.Some of the symbols found on the pottery have caused argument amongscholars. Some believe they are artistic designs, others take them asearly pictograms."They are not decorative designs, for sure," said Li. "It's only thatthere are not enough of them for us to decipher them and understandtheir meaning."Another fact may help to pinpoint the early Xia. Historical recordshave it that the third king of the Xia, Zhong Kang, was once unseatedfrom the throne by a leader called Hou Yi from Shandong in EastChina. Archaeologists believe that this important political eventwould certainly leave its traces. If any evidence of the invasionfrom the east can be unearthed, it will help sketch the early periodof the Xia.Much will depend on co-operation across academic disciplines. Forexample, a solar eclipse was said to have occurred during the reignof Zhong Kang. If astronomers could give comparable dates, it wouldassist the archaeologists.Compared with the Xia, archaeological discoveries about the Shang area lot richer. More than 10,000 tombs have been found so far.Originally, the Shang kingdom was thought to extend over the wideplain formed by the Yellow River. They seemed to be militarily strongand to have a cruel caste hierarchy. Their bronzework shows they werehighly artistic.But discoveries in recent decades may rewrite the features of theShang. The sites in East China's Jiangxi Province and SouthwestChina's Sichuan Province are especially fascinating forarchaeologists. The artifacts unearthed there demonstrate thesophisticated level Shang society had attained. The influence ofShang culture may have extended as far as Viet Nam."These archaeological finds really make us reassess the level of thesocial development the Shang reached," said Li Xueqin, director ofthe History Department of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.At the heart of the attempt to untangle the chronology of the Xia,Shang and Zhou dynasties is the uncertainty about when the Shangended. It is known that the Zhou King Wu annexed the lands of thelast king of Shang and extended his own dominion. There are currentlyabout 30 different opinions about when this happened.Li Boqian said the question will be solved largely through the jointefforts of astronomers, historians and scientists. In fact, the wholeproject depends upon co-operation between scientists, he said.Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: Poverty relief high on Party's agendafrom CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 1THE Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee and the StateCouncil are determined to keep every Chinese adequately provided withfood and clothing by the end of this century."This target is unchangeable," Jiang Zemin, general secretary of CPC,pledged yesterday at a national conference on poverty alleviation.Premier Li Peng told conference participants that the country's poorareas should list poverty relief high on their economic developmentplan, and assign the task of providing enough food and clothes to themasses as the first priority.Presiding over yesterday's conference was Zhu Rongji, member of theStanding Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC CentralCommittee and the vice-premier of the State Council.Participants included high-ranking Chinese officials, such as HuJintao, Ding Guangen, Wu Bangguo, Zou Jiahua, Jiang Chunyun and majorcadres from the provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.The CPC Central Committee and the State Council called upon the Partyto unite and mobilize all Chinese people to work for the common goalin eliminating poverty in this country, Jiang declared.From 1978 to 1995, China successfully reduced the country'spoverty-stricken population from 250 million to 65 million.However, Jiang said, the task remains arduous and time is pressing forrealizing the goal of providing food and clothing for all poor peoplein China by the year 2000."The CPC Central Committee is determined to win the hard battle,"Jiang said.Speeding up the development of poverty-stricken regions is not only aneconomic issue, but also an issue concerning sustained nationalstability, Jiang pointed out.He said that with hard work, the goal can be achieved, because theParty and the government pay paramount attention to povertyalleviation and have adopted a series of major policies.He suggested that a combination of State support and the developmentof local resources is the basic solution for overcoming poverty.He urged people in the poverty-stricken areas to pay more attention tograin production, and to take advantage of local resources to developdiversified operations that would increase the income of farmers.Jiang also called for greater efforts to mobilize resources of thewhole society in the move to wipe out poverty.(To be continued on Page 2)Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: Jiang hails relations with Kiribatifrom CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 1ALL countries of the world, regardless of size, should enjoy equalpolitical status, President Jiang Zemin said yesterday, when he metwith his Kiribati counterpart.Every member of the world community is entitled to participate equallyin world affairs, Jiang told President Teburoro Tito of the islandcountry in the southern Pacific Ocean .He met formally with Tito after an afternoon welcoming ceremony forthe six-member Kiribati delegation.Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1986, the countrieshave co-operated in trade, health care, science and technology andculture, Jiang said, and they have yielded satisfactory results andshown good development trends.The two countries have also been understanding, supporting each otherin world affairs, he added.Jiang said that both China and Kiribati are developing countries inthe Asia-Pacific region, have suffered from foreign invasions in thepast and are faced with the common task of developing nationaleconomy.Therefore, there is no conflict of interest between the two. GoodSino-Kiribati relations will benefit not only both peoples, but alsoAsia-Pacific stability.China is willing to boost bilateral relations to a higher level on thebasis of mutual respect, friendly trust, and mutual benefit, theChinese president said.Tito, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday for an eight-day State visit toChina, thanked Jiang for his invitation, saying he is happy to visitChina.Kiribati cherishes its friendship with China, Tito said. He thankedChina for the unselfish aid to his country, which has a population of80,000, has received in the past decade.Kiribati hopes that China, as a big country, will continue to play asignificant role in the world, safeguarding peace, equal co-existenceand the common development of all countries, the guest said.After the meeting, the two presidents attended the signing of abilateral economic agreement.Kiribati is a major exporter of tuna fish.Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: Environment key to sustaining economic progressfrom CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2SHANGHAI -- Environmental protection is "the key for China to sustaineconomic development," the country's strategic task, State CouncillorSong Jian affirmed yesterday.Song made his remarks at the fifth meeting of the China Council forInternational Co-operation on Environment and Development (CCICED).The meeting began in Shanghai yesterday and ends tomorrow.In his report to the conference on China's environmental protectionand economic growth, Song said the State Council has asked governmentofficials at all levels, and all large enterprises, to increase theirefforts to protect the environment.Though much progress has been made in environment protection, theoverall situation in China is still grave, Song said. Environmentalpollution, which began in urban areas, is spreading into rural areas.In some areas, pollution is hampering economic development and evenposing a direct threat to people's health.To combat pollution and improve the environment, Song said effortsshould be focused in seven areas:o Policy-making by the central government and the legislative workneeded to draft stricter environmental laws and regulations;o Increasing investment to finance environment projects through allpossible channels;o Protection of ecosystems and controls over the exploitation ofnatural resources;o More research and development;o Publicity campaigns to make people more conscious of theenvironment;o More international co-operation and exchanges to make China a keyparticipant in international environmental programmes;o Development of China's environmental-protection industries.During the Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-95), many old factories thatwere high energy consumers and had caused serious pollution weremoved out of urban areas. Several important environmental programmeswere also completed in that period.For each 10,000 yuan ($1,200) worth of gross domestic product value,the average energy consumed has been reduced from the equivalent of5.3 tons of coal to 3.94 tons.The sewage-treatment rate was improved from 32 per cent to 76 per centamong industrial enterprises above the county level.Hygiene and sanitation in urban areas were improved, and the nationalforest-coverage rate was raised from 12 per cent in 1980 to thepresent 13.92 per cent.Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: Ministry calls for efficiency in heatingfrom CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2WITH the growing threat of increasing energy consumption by buildingprojects, mainly in home heating and air conditioning, the Ministryof Construction is encouraging the erection of energy conservinghousing and the introduction of new technology and products to easethe problem.The issue has become more urgent as 5.5 billion square metres of newhousing will be built in the country by the end of the century, whilethe 29.7 billion square metres of housing projects that already existare consuming increasing amount of energy.Home heating in winter in the north and air conditioning in summer inthe south have become major energy consumers, Minister ofConstruction Hou Jie told the opening of a national workingconference in Beijing yesterday.Despite the fact that warm housing is far from adequate in northernChina in winter, Hou said, the amount of coal burned for warmth lastyear exceeded 127 million tons, or 10.7 per cent of the nationaltotal energy consumption.The rate is as high as 20-50 per cent in some extremely cold places,Hou said.In hot southern areas, 25-40 per cent of urban residents have airconditioners in their houses, which contributes to the shortage ofelectricity in those places.Hou attributed the problem to old buildings and a growing number ofnew construction projects.Energy consumption does not take into account illumination and the hotwater supply yet.He urged improvements to buildings to make sure they were warm inwinter and cool in summer while saving energy.According to Vice-Minister of Construction Ye Rutang, the ministryplans to build more energy-saving housing projects nationwide.Experiments have been conducted in eight cities in northern China,where home heating systems are widely used, he said.Ye said that the ministry hopes that by the year 2000 the energyconsumption rate of newly-built urban housing projects with heatingsystems will drop by 50 per cent, as compared with the standard inthe early 1980s.During the State's Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000), Ye said hisministry will focus on spreading new technologies and products suchas new thermal insulation building materials for walls and ceilings,heat conserving windows, a concentrated heat supply system and solarenergy.Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: Weather reports ( Page 2, Date: 09/24/96 )from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2THERE is little chance of rainfall occurring in the southeast coastand South China.

Her familyhad sold its only pig to pay for her tuition after she was acceptedto the local middle school.Guo, born in a small village by Lugu Lake on the border of Sichuan andYunnan provinces, was worried that she might not have tuition for thenext semester.But thanks to the members of the Association of Businesswomen of theAll-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ABACFIC), Guo willreceive 300 yuan ($36) a year for books, tuition and meals."Now I can keep my mind on my studies," Guo said with tears in hereyes.Guo is among 20 girls at the Luguhu Middle School who receiveddonations from the businesswomen's group. The entrepreneurs visitedthe region from September 15 to 20 to investigate the status of localeducation and the economy.The programme is part of the Spring Bud Plan, which helps poor ruralgirls finish their primary education, especially in poverty-strickenareas."Poor education, transportation and communication are the mainproblems that hinder economic development in these areas," said AnnieS. C. Wu, head of the group and Vice-chairwoman of the ABACFIC."Local people need more help from all circles, including thebusinesswomen of non-State firms."ABACFIC donated 300,000 yuan ($36,150) to establish a professionalskills school in Sichuan Province's Luguhu Town and in YunnanProvince's Lijing prefecture."All the members of the ABACFIC understand that educating a girl meanseducating a future mother, which is extremely crucial for improvingthe quality of the next generation," Wu said.In the last five years, the Spring Bud Plan has aided more than100,000 girls in 28 provinces and autonomous regions, according toofficial statistics.Last year, the programme received 3.7 million yuan ($430,000) in cashdonations and 5 million yuan ($600,000) in goods.Students like Guo may not be able to repay their benefactors in cash,but they will reap huge returns through their successes.Guo intends to study hard and go to a teachers college.

As of yesterday, 30 people had drowned, and 96remain missing.In Qiongshan City, 26 villages along the Niandujiang River wereflooded and more than 38,300 hectares of farm land swamped. Somecrops were completely destroyed.Over the past two days, more than 680 houses in the city collapsed andover 3,100 houses were damaged either by floods or fierce windsaccompanying the typhoon, local officials said.Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: Japan must try to win trust of othersfrom CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4THE Japanese Government's tolerance of the landing by right-wingers onthe Diaoyu Islands indicates the regression of its policy towardsChina, in some aspects, back to the days before the normalization ofbilateral relations, according to some observers in Beijing."Whether the Diaoyu Islands issue will be resolved amicably depends onwhether the Japanese Government adopts a wise attitude on theterritorial dispute," said Zhao Jieqi, deputy director of theJapanese Studies Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.The Japanese Government's abetment of the right-wingers' rampantencroachment on China's territorial sovereignty has been deepeningmutual misunderstanding and is putting Sino-Japanese relations atrisk.The explosion of the conflict on the Diaoyu Islands issue is notsudden but is related to the changes in the macro-environment of theinternational community and Japan itself, said Liu Jiangyong,director of the Northeast Asia Division of the China Institute ofContemporary International Relations.Since the end of the Cold War, Sino-Japanese relations have beenfacing many challenges.The disappearance of the "Soviet threat" undermined the basis of theJapan-US military alliance. Japan had to find an excuse to justifythe presence of the US troops in Japan.Thus in the early 1990s, the "China menace theory" began to emerge inJapan and was deliberately spread by some Japanese, includingprominent politicians.Also with its growing economic clout, Japan began to seek politicaland military status commensurate with its economic strength.Some Japanese government officials not only denied the crimescommitted in World War II by their militarists but also encouragedthe government to put pressure on other countries, using loans andsanctions as weapons.This strategy is a divergence from Japan's previous approach ofhelping war-afflicted countries develop their economies as some sortof compensation.Relying on its financial power, Japan is now taking a less restrainedand discreet attitude towards its war crimes and other sensitiveissues. It is also boldly bypassing the restrictions set by itsConstitution and is strengthening its military forces.Japan's military expenditure is the second largest in the world inrecent years.Some Japanese politicians believe that the atonement for the historyof invasion will not only hurt "national pride" but also harm Japan'simage as a "power." Therefore, headed by prominent governmentofficials, some Japanese blatantly denied the existence of theNanjing Massacre, "comfort women" and even Japan's invasion of othercountries."A mood of reversion against China is growing among the misledJapanese because China is constantly urging Japan to re-examine thepast mistakes," said Liu.Last year, when the whole world commemorated the victory of theanti-fascist war, Japan, as an initiator of World War II, passed anindecent resolution against the theme of the anniversary.In July, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the first Japanese Prime Minister to beborn after the war, paid homage to the Yasukuni Shrine where class-Awar criminals are enshrined, heavily hurting the feelings of otherAsian peoples.So strong is the non-recognition of crime sentiment in Japan thatpoliticians or ordinary Japanese who try to reveal the truth ofJapan's history of invasion would become the targets of attacks,according to Liu.Thus some politicians who treasure Sino-Japanese relations andunderstand the friendship is in line with the interests of bothpeoples find it more and more difficult to reverse the dangeroustrend.Recent Japanese right-wingers' aggressive provocations on the ChineseDiaoyu Islands further reflect their ambitions in internationalpolitics, military development and territorial expansion.A few Japanese are reluctant to see China, once a weak and bulliedcountry in modern history, grow stronger."These right-wingers hope to see, and also actively make troubles inSino-Japanese relations in order to propel Japan to turn right. TheDiaoyu Islands gives them a stage to perform," Zhao pointed out.Every country and its people is sensitive about territory. That theDiaoyu Islands belong to China since ancient times can be proved byplenty of historical papers and facts, including those from Japan.Therefore Japanese right-wingers' rampant trampling on China'ssovereignty stirred great indignation of both domestic and overseasChinese.Japanese government officials' claim of sovereignty over the DiaoyuIslands and threatening to use force will not help resolve theproblem but will worsen the conflict and harm Sino-Japaneserelations, said Zhao.As for the Japanese government officials' claims that the governmentcannot interfere with the activities of its people on its ownterritory, Zhao believed it is mere subterfuge."International relations which involve ties with other countriescannot be resolved as domestic affairs," said Zhao.The Japanese Government should show sincerity in resolving the DiaoyuIslands issue and take effective measures to prohibit the provocativeacts of the right-wingers.China and Japan should hold dialogues on this issue and reachconsensus at the highest level. The dispute can be shelved until asolution acceptable to both sides is found, Liu suggested.The two countries' common interests dictate that partial disputesshould be resolved rationally and should not harm overall relations.Sino-Japanese relations are significant for the peace and prosperityof East Asia. Both of them will find it tough to co-exist as enemies.For Japan which is seeking an increasingly important role on theinternational stage, the primary concern of its foreign policy shouldbe how to win the trust of neighbouring countries.But the point is whether Japanese politicians know this clearly, saidLiu.Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: More State firms turn to high-techfrom CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4THE introduction of high-technology is considered a cure for economicills by more and more deficit-stricken enterprises.Before the recent exhibition of China's high-technology achievementsin Liaoning, a province with a high concentration of State-ownedenterprises, there was widespread skepticism that there would be anaudience for the expo since most State-owned enterprises are busytackling problems like rising deficits.On display are high-tech achievement of a State programme dubbed"Project 863" because it was first advocated in March 1986 by a groupof scientists who suggested that the government put more efforts intohigh-tech research and development.Despite the low expectations of some people, the week-long exhibitionproved a big success, and hosted an average of 7,000-plus visitorseach day. Among the visitors were government officials, enterprisemanagers, professors and even peasants.The exposition was aimed at the revitalization of traditionalindustries by means of introducing advanced and new technologies.The exposition wound up with 309 contracts for technology transfervalued at 3.29 billion yuan ($396.3 million).This co-operation between "Project 863" and State enterprises inLiaoning signals the advent of mutual support between technology andeconomy during the process of transition from a planned economy to amarket one, and from an extensive economy to an intensive economy,according to an article in the Economic Information Daily.The darlings of the traditional planned economy, many Stateenterprises in Liaoning were ill-prepared for reform aimed at makingChina's economy more market-oriented. While some firms have survivedthe trials of the market, many others are on the verge of bankruptcy.Now that factory directors and managers have finally realized they canno longer depend on government coffers, they are starting to acceptthat introduction of advanced sciences, and high-technology can betheir economic saviour.This explains why the exposition was so well received in Liaoning.The example of the Shenyang Air-blower Factory related at the expoconvinced many local managers that high-technology is something theycan turn to.A small factory several years ago, Shenyang Air-blower Factory hasbecome China's largest producer of compressors and blowers thanks tothe introduction of high-tech operations.After visiting the exhibition, many factory and company officials saidthey are keen on technological upgrading to shake off their problems.The Liaoning provincial government has showed great interest inhigh-tech projects.Before the exhibition had even ended, the local government had struckan agreement with the State Science and Technology Commission tousher in a system of joint meetings to promote the application of theresearch achievements of "Project 863" in Liaoning.Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: Time to counter negative views on Chinafrom CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4"China Through My Eyes" is sponsored by the State Bureau of ForeignExperts Affairs and China Daily. It features our foreign readers'impressions, suggestions and criticisms regarding developments inChina. Contributions are welcome.By Zhang YanyanAS an overseas Chinese, I cannot help feeling insulted and concernedover the way Western journalists and politicians continuously try totarnish China's image.They do not accept Chinese views which are rational and based ontraditional concepts of philosophy and righteousness, but want toturn everything concerning Chinese affairs into nasty, negativenothings.US's policy towards China is one of sabotaging, bullying andtrouble-making. That is why the US tells China off and spreads badpropaganda about the lack of human rights in China.As an overseas Chinese well-read in history and literature, I havedeep sympathy for the Chinese people. There is much that is good anddeep in Chinese traditions and history to learn from and build uponbut also much that is bad and evil to analyze and reflect upon, sothat evil will not be repeated.To realize the Chinese utopia, a dream of past generations, theChinese must stay united. China must have stability.However, that is difficult, for the Western politicians andjournalists, as well as many naive Chinese, are hacking at it. TheWest propagates the uncertainty of stability in the future becausethey profit economically in all ways from a weak and unstablecountry. Some Chinese regard this to be a fact and unwittingly echothe damaging intent in their naivety. This is certainly not good forthe Chinese people and for business. That would be like playing intothe enemy's trap.The Chinese Government should be strong and knowledgeable about how tostrengthen the stability and security of China in all areas of lifeand politics. There should be an intelligent body of scholars,administrators, scientists, soldiers, journalists, professionals andrepresentatives of the districts and villages including overseasChinese and business people.There are strong grounds in traditional, revolutionary andpost-revolutionary Chinese history, culture and politics to signalthe important contribution China can make towards universal peace andadvancements in all areas of human civilization. This is the onlytruly political message that everyone, East and West, will accept andcherish.There are many good people and good things in the West and there aremany Western intellectuals who have loved, supported and hoped withChina and for China. Let China live up the best of everyone'sexpectations. China will also need the continuation of her pastideologies and excellent organization that once established acrime-free, honest, supportive and universal humanitarian society asin the 1950s.I believe China should and can expand its influence in peaceful,useful and intelligent ways for the benefit of its own people as wellas human kind. In China, there must be a good, strong and confidentgovernment open to the views of the Chinese, Western and others whoserole is to ensure peace and unity and the security of all Chinese,and everyone else in China.China should have good, strong and effective defence featuring thelatest technological innovations. (This is to ensure that China willnot be bullied by aggressors.)However, the most universal of human ideals -- happiness, peace and agood quality of life -- should be the priority in all Chineseaffairs. China should work more intelligently to make and cultivatefriendships with the developed and less developed nations of theworld.Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA DAILY                                   via NewsNetSeptember 24, 1996China: Agreement focuses on electrical insulatorsfrom CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 5A CONTRACT for establishing a $25 million tripartite joint venture wassigned yesterday in Beijing by Chinese and Japanese companies.The NGK Insulators Tangshan Co Ltd will be jointly invested by theTangshan High Voltage Insulator Works in Hebei Province, and by NGKInsulators Ltd and Itochu Corp of Japan.The Chinese side holds only a 5 per cent stake in the investment,while NGK controls 76 per cent. The remaining 19 per cent is held byItochu.The joint venture, scheduled to start production in 1998, will have anannual production output of 1.8 million units of suspensioninsulators used for electrical transmission lines.The venture will employ 400 people and is projecting annual salesincome of $30 million by 1999.Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the National People's CongressStanding Committee, encouraged the Japanese investors during ameeting before the signing of the contract, saying that developmentof the power industry in China will have a bright future.Hebei Provincial Governor Ye Liansong told the Japanese investors thatin the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the power industry will bethe key sector of development in the coastal province.In the coming five years, Hebei plans to meet growing power demand byconstructing plants with a total electricity generating capacity of 6million kilowatts.The country as a whole will increase its electricity generatingcapacity by an estimated 80 million kilowatts during the period, Yesaid.Ye said these trends augur well for the joint venture, whose productsare widely used by power plants and electricity transmission lines.Products of the joint venture will eventually be exported to theinternational market, according to Mike Shibata, president and chiefexecutive officer of NGK Insulators.Itochu Corp, one of the largest Japanese trading companies, is thefirst Japanese company to open a representative office in China after1949. Last year, its trade volume with China reached about $5.5billion.In addition to trade, Itochu has also been active in committinginvestment in the Chinese market.So far, it has established about 150 joint ventures on the Chinesemainland, involving textiles, food, metals and machinery.Itochu says it plans to establish more joint ventures in the comingyears as more than 100 new projects are under negotiation withChinese partners.Copyright 1996 China DailyBack to Headline List WT03-B04-11IA086-000616-B002-27http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it159.html 205.156.212.5 19970122023437 text/html 39897HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:32:44 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:16 GMTContent-length: 39710Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it159.html Sample Issue Copyright CHINA FOCUS via NewsNet November 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES The End of the "Flying Peace" (389 words) The Water Shortage in Xi'an (1234 words) Leaking Housing Projects (166 words) New Party Members (174 words) A Free Ride (225 words) A New Wave of Persecution Against Catholics (163 words) Bitter Fruit of the One-Child Policy (267 words) Spending 20,000 RMB to Win 4,800 RMB (193 words) Fake Medicine from the Red Cross (200 words) Letter From China: Adventure in a Small Township (424 words) The Red and the Black (725 words) The Two Chinas - In the Media and in Reality (1068 words) An Event Fueling the Power Struggle (878 words) CopyrightCHINA FOCUS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996The End of the "Flying Peace"from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996by Zhang ShuangwuRecently, a lovely project at the Guangxi Nanning Zoo vanished likea soap bubble.  In October 1995, in order to create a "new scenicspot," the zoo invested 15,000 RMB to introduce 850 chick dovesinto the zoo from other places.  After two months of meticulousnurturing and taming, the full-grown white doves were released intothe zoo's green trees and tender lawns to sport freely with thevisitors.  The white doves, green lawn, and blue sky became a majorattraction at the Nanning Zoo.However, during the time they were allowed to fly free every day,quite a number of the doves were injured when they were chased bythe visitors.  The worst was that some visitors even stole thewhite doves when the zoo keepers were not around.  Once, over onehundred white doves were stolen in a single day!The deputy director of the zoo, Zhang Caichang, was forced toremark: "In fact, one white dove is not worth that much, at themost 10 RMB.  I assume that the visitors who stole the doves werenot going to sell them for money, but rather to make a side dishfor their drinks."  The public security police of the zoo noticedthat in early July this situation had become worse.  The reason wasthat during the summer vacation, the number of children visitingthe zoo had increased; with their parents' tacit permission as wellas connivance, some young visitors repeatedly broke the rules.According to the count, among the 850 white doves which were firstintroduced into the Nanning Zoo, besides the 200 that suffered fromnatural deaths, another 500 doves were stolen by visitors.Starting from August 20, the zoo decided to lock the 130 survivingdoves into a specially built and well-sealed wooden house.  Theproject of releasing the "Flying Peace" thus came to a prematureend.In the Nanning Zoo, the white doves are not the only animals tohave suffered such misfortunes. Sea lions, tigers, and red-crownedcranes are sometimes injured or blinded by visitors.  The medicalbill of the zoo to protect these animals is increasing every year.(Translated by Joy C.

As soon as they received a notice that their water wasbeing turned on they bustled around to fill containers of all sizesthat they could find in their homes.  They finally became used tousing water this way.  On one occasion, in the summer of last year,water was the most rare life-sustaining source for people in Xi'an.Water storage jugs, which cost 35 RMB, were one of the hottestconsumer goods.  Water traffickers also took advantage of thesituation to profiteer.  Even the officials who never had a need toworry about food would not forget to carry two water buckets in thetrunks of their cars.Water is threatening the survival of this ancient city.  Theexcessive extraction of underground water has already producedserious consequences: across the city, a total length of 55kilometers, 13 ground fissures from east to west have destroyedseveral thousand houses; the famous cultural relic, the Big GoosePagoda, now tilts soberly; and the deterioration of the earth'ssurface at the Clock Tower and at three other historic sites hasbeen exacerbated.The daily extractable ground water in Xi'an city is 120,000 to140,000 tons at the most, but this only meets one-third of therequired demand of the city.  So by the time 260,000 tons areextracted daily, the water level has dropped dramatically.  Thewater level is now dropping between two and three meters annuallyin the metropolitan area and between three and five meters in thesouthern suburbs.  This overextraction has produced a series ofother problems.  First, as the water quality deteriorates, theshallow water can no longer be used for human consumption becauseof the discharge of industrial waste and because of the excessiveuse of agricultural pesticides and chemical fertilizers.  Second,the earth has begun to subside seriously.  From 1986 to 1991, theearth in the metropolitan area subsided from 30 millimeters to 210millimeters, and the annual rate increased from 10 millimeters to70 millimeters.The drop in the level of the ground water and the deterioration ofthe water quality greatly raised the costs of water extraction andpurification for the city water company.  Currently The cost forwater purification has reached 0.47 RMB per cubic meter, while thewater company can only charge city residents 0.45 RMB per cubicmeter of water.  Whereas the 2.3 hundred million cubic meters ofthe the total annual natural water supply cannot be changed, thewater supply enterprises are pinched to their limit.Xi'an was called "Chang'an" in ancient times.  Our forefathersoften described the beauty of this ancient city as "Eight RiversSurrounding Chang'an."  But today, of the eight rivers which usedto encircle Xi'an, some have long ago been cut off, and some canonly barely be called "rivers" during the rainy seasons.  Today,only the Feng River is still flowing year round, but because theweather has been continuously dry, the water source of the FengRiver has also dropped two meters.  In addition, Chang'an county,through which the Feng River flows, has built a simply-constructeddam at the river's upper stream for its own benefit.  This fivemillion RMB dam pushed the Xi'an water company, which had investedseveral dozen million RMB, into a tight corner; even with fortydeep wells, the quantity of water this company could producedropped sharply.In general, when the water supply is insufficient, it is natural toration it.  But the Water-Ration Office is plagued by numerousdifficulties.  The same people who sometimes do not have enoughdrinking water still do not have a conscience about saving water.The Water-Ration Office manages 300 work units with self-containedwells, and supplies 1400 planned water customers each with over 20cubic meters for daily usage.  Every year, the office readjusts thewater usage quota, and water meters are checked monthly.  Thecharge for overquota water is two to six times the normal price.The Water-Ration Office also sets a quota for water usage for waterfor daily living; residents who get water from outdoors receive adaily quota of 50 liters per person; those have indoor hygienefacilities receive 120 liters per person; people have bath orshower facilities get 150 liters per person; students boarding atcolleges get 220 liters (including for the use of labs); gradeschool and high school students get 80 liters (also including thatfor lab use).  However, because of the lack of funds and the lackof water supply engineering and due to the unfinishedreconstruction of the old urban pipeline, there is still a gap interms of managing water usage in residential areas.  Furthermore,ground water management within the city is chaotic, as somedepartments arbitrarily give permission to dig wells.With the number of water consumers increasing constantly, the watersupply in Xi'an is becoming more and more short every year.  Whensummer comes, it is almost as if eyebrows are about to catch fire.The peak water supply has become a serious social problem.  In1991, when there were forty days of summer drought, the dailydifference between the need and the supply of water exceeded 0.4million cubic meters.  This directly affected the everyday life of500,000 people living on 20 square kilometers;  202 enterpriseswere also affected, and it was estimated that they incurred 42.5hundred million RMB in losses in industrial output that year.On July 15, 1991, the city government issued five emergencypolicies to deal with the shortage of the water supply: limit dailyuse per person to 100 liters; put an end to waste due to runningwater, leakage, dripping, and overflowing; ban garden watering andcooling off with tap water; close down all the city swimming poolswhich use tap-water; reduce by 20 percent the supply to customersusing large quantities of water.  By 1995, the condition hadworsened, and Xi'an was inescapably caught in a water crisis.The daily demand for water in Xi'an is 1.2 to 1.25 million cubicmeters, but now only 0.75 million cubic meters of water can besupplied.  This shortage of water is 43 percent of the watersupplied.  Now, people are placing their hopes on the Black Riverthat originates in the Qin mountains.  But until the water from theBlack River can get to Xi'an, there is no way to solve the watershortage problem.  The total investment in the Black Riverdiversion work requires 2900 million RMB; although 1000 million RMBhas already been spent, the work has not been finished.In fact. there are many other cities with water shortages moreserious than Xi'an.  Taiyuan is one such city, but without anypractical scenario to solve the problem, some people havetentatively suggested relocating the city.  The capital of Beijingis also short of water, as the average water supply per capita inBeijing is only 1/30 of the world's average. By the year 2010, thegap between supply and demand will be over 1000 million cubicmeters.(Translated by Joy C.

But the quality of the houses has become lower andlower.  According to a survey conducted by the "China Technical andDevelopment Center of the Building Industry," in the twenty-twocities surveyed, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, etc., 53percent of the houses leaked in the very first year aftercompletion.  According to the official Xinhua News Agency, in the1950s, leaking began after an average of sixteen years aftercompletion; in the 1960s, leaking occured after seven to nineyears; in the 1970s, after three to five years.Due to the poor quality of the housing projects, a great amount ofmoney has been spent on repairs.  In the survey of the twenty-twocities, it was estimated that the money spent on repairs in oneyear exceeded the original budget by 1.2 billion RMB.Copyright 1996 The Princeton China InitiativeBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA FOCUS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996New Party Membersfrom CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996Recently, to the elation of Party officials, there has been a newupsurge in the number of students applying to join the CommunistParty.  But, on closer scrutiny, it was found that the motivesbehind the applications were of a dubious nature.According to a survey, 30 percent of those answering the questionregarding their motives for joining the Party answered that if oneis a Party member he/she is more likely to find a good job.  Whenasked whether it is right to say that Party membership is animportant chip in the competition for good jobs after graduation,70.1 percent answered that this was reasonable.  When they wereasked what they would do when their personal interests clashed withthe interests of the Party, 53.7 percent answered that they woulddo their best to consider the interests of the Party, but theirpersonal interests would also have to be taken into consideration.Copyright 1996 The Princeton China InitiativeBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA FOCUS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996A Free Ridefrom CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996Jin Hua, an old lady, recently died of cancer in Ji'nan CentralHospital.  Fortunately, she was a veteran of the Anti-Japanese Warand all her medical bills could be paid by the state; the bill wasgiven to her daughter to be transferred to Jin Hua's work unit.Because her daughter is a very methodical person, she checked thebill over and found that there were many items on the bill that hermother had not received.  For instance, her mother was allergic toantibiotics, but she was charged for more than 200 penicillinshots; her mother's gallbladder had been removed many yearsearlier, but one of the drugs listed on the bill was to treatgallstones.  During Jin Hua's stay in the hospital, she had fourelectrocardiograms, but she was charged for eight; she had not hadany blood transfusions, but 640 RMB was charged for bloodtransfusions.  Charges for even more expensive medicine to treatobesity appeared on the bill.  Later it was found out that some ofthe doctors and nurses had included on the bill some medicine whichthey themselves needed.  They reasoned that since the bill was tobe paid by the state, then why not get a free ride?Copyright 1996 The Princeton China InitiativeBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA FOCUS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996A New Wave of Persecution Against Catholicsfrom CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996There are many Catholics in the Baoding region of Hebei province.Donglu village is one of the most densely congregated areas.  Inthe name of "helping to improve the economy," the authorities sentin a work team of over one hundred cadres at the beginning of thisyear and launched a new wave of persecution against the Catholics.The villagers were forbidden from leaving the village withoutpermission from the authorities.  Priests were arrested andworshipping was banned; Catholic students were suspended fromschool unless they denounced their religion, nuns were forced toparticipate in "pre-nuptial training courses" where "sexualeducation" was conducted in a lewd manner. The 38th Field Army ofover 2,000 soldiers surrounded the village to intimidate thevillagers.Such persecution has also occurred in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian,and Shaanxi provinces, as well as in other parts of Hebei province.Copyright 1996 The Princeton China InitiativeBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA FOCUS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996Bitter Fruit of the One-Child Policyfrom CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996Two incidents have become hot topics of conversation amongeducators and parents in China.The first incident concerns ten children from the city of Harbinchosen to participate in a summer camp in Russia.  These ten werechosen from over 100,000 Harbin children, and were supposed to be"outstanding students," but they also turned out to be very finickyand pampered.  Once when the children were playing volleyball, theball rolled into a swimming pool.  The Russian children immediatelyjumped into the pool to retrieve it, but the Chinese children stoodthere crying "What's to be done?"  When mountain climbing, theRussian children rushed up the mountain shouting joyously, whilethe Chinese children formed a line, climbed slowly and listlessly.When the time came for the children to depart, the gifts theRussian children gave to their Chinese friends were all hand-made,while the gifts from the Chinese children were all store-bought,conventional presents.Another incident concerns the freshmen enrolling at PekingUniversity.  On the day of enrollment, the number of parentsaccompanying their sons and daughters far exceeded the number ofstudents.  Some parents even planned to stay near the college fortwo weeks after enrollment to teach their children how to washtheir own clothes and how to take care of themselves.  Nearly allthe students were only children and had led very sheltered andpampered lives.Many educators and parents are worried: what has the one-childpolicy done to our next generation?Copyright 1996 The Princeton China InitiativeBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA FOCUS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996Spending 20,000 RMB to Win 4,800 RMBfrom CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996An advertisement appeared in Wuhan announcing a guessing gamesweepstakes: telephone the number 9680-0001 and answer a questionabout tourism; if the answer is correct, the caller will score apoint.

As early as December 1994, the Ministry of PublicHealth had announced that this powder could not cure cancer, thatit should be prohibited from being sold as cancer medication, andthat those who did so should be fined.  But, as the old Chinesesaying goes, "The heaven is high above and the emperor is faraway"; Hainan Island, which is the farthest province from Beijing,thought it did not have to obey orders from Beijing.  This"panacea" continued to be sold in the compound of the provincialpublic health department for 260 RMB per gram (the actual cost wasroughly 300 RMB per kilogram).  It was not until April 1996, whenvictims of this fake medicine began to sue, that this fraud finallycame to a halt.Copyright 1996 The Princeton China InitiativeBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA FOCUS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996Letter From China: Adventure in a Small Townshipfrom CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996Dear Brother:I always remember the letter you wrote to me about your first visitto 42nd Street in New York.  Now let me tell you something Iexperienced in a small border town several days ago.I went to Dongxing township at the border of Guangxi AutonomousRegion together with my boss and another colleague.  Having heardthat the public security there is not good, we decided that wewould stay in the same room just to be on the safe side.  But assoon as we settled down and turned on the TV for the 7:OO PM news,there was a knock on the door and in came a young girl asking touse our telephone.  We didn't give this much thought and agreed.She made a call and immediately another two girls arrived at ourroom, one of whom was wearing very little clothing.  They sat downon our beds and said: "You must be very tired, let us give youmassages."  We realized that these girls were prostitutes and ourboss said sternly: "Please leave!  We don't need any massages."But they refused to budge until we threatened to report them to thepolice.Having learned a lesson, we locked our door, but there were stillrepeated knocks.  One time our door was opened with a key and incame a seductive woman carrying a teapot.  She said: "Aren't youlonely in this small town without me?"  Despite her curses, wemanaged to drive her out.  At ten o'clock, my boss and my colleaguewent downstairs to arrange for our transportation for the next day.As soon as they left, another girl came in and said: "You must havebeen away from home for many days, don't you need female services?"When I pushed her away, she cursed at me saying: "Are you afraidthat I'll rape you, you old scoundrel!"  During that one evening,altogether there were five groups of prostitutes who knocked at ourdoor.The following morning we went to the front desk and demanded toknow how the prostitute had obtained a key to our room.  The clerksaid: "She said that you wanted some drinking water. How could Iknow she was a bad woman?  There are too many young girls here fromSichuan and Heilongjiang - when they can't find jobs, they have tosell themselves."Your Brother,Wu ZhixinCopyright 1996 The Princeton China InitiativeBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA FOCUS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996The Red and the Blackfrom CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996by Jin DabaiWhile the Chinese Communist regime is trying its best to block theway for democracy in China, the so-called "black gangs" (criminalsyndicates) have successfully penetrated into many mid-level andgrass-root institutions, sometimes even replacing the localregimes.As early as 1991, the Ministry of Public Security had exposed apowerful black gang in Gaoyang county, Hebei province.  Though thiscriminal syndicate had only some sixty members, the Ministry ofPublic Security had to mobilize forces from Hebei, Heilongjiang,Jilin, Shandong, Liaoning, Beijing, and Tianjin to crack it.  Why?Because it had infiltrated into many government and Partyinstitutions.  Even after the syndicate was cracked, its remnantsstill managed to seep into the judicial system, using differenthoaxes, to rescue three of its bosses, finally getting them out onbail.The black gangs are growing very rapidly, their power reachingalmost every stratum of the society.  In Nanjing, the capital cityof Jiangsu province, four criminal gangs have divided the city upinto four turfs.  They demand "protection fees" from the businessesand residents within their turfs and help settle disputes amongresidents as if they are government mediators.  Residents whousually are afraid to go to public security departments or courtsof law prefer to deal with people from the black gangs.Over the years, the black gangs have gradually wormed their wayinto various institutions of the regime; by bribing officials theyhave used legal means to obtain power.  With officials to back themup, the gangsters can do whatever they wish.  Some gangsters areeven officials themselves.  In some provinces in the south, it wasfound that quite a few of the local heads of the public securitydepartments are also black gang bosses.  This is why the Beijingregime recently decided to rotate local public security heads.Some officials who find it difficult to solve such problems asdebts, civil disputes, and problems of public order throughofficials channels often resort to the black gangs to settle thesedisputes and problems.  It is a common practice for managers tohire gangsters to force debtors to pay up; if the debtor refused,then he might have to pay with an ear, a hand, or even with hislife.  There is a fixed price-list in Shenzhen for carrying outsuch "jobs": chopping off a hand, 8,000 RMB; a foot, 10,000 RMB;for taking one's life, 30,000 RMB.  Recently the public securitydepartment in Shenzhen arrested two members of a butcher ring.They had been hired by Mr.Fan, the general manager of acorporation, to "teach a lesson" to Mr. Wang, the manager of a taxicompany. Fan was willing to pay 30,000 RMB, but, afraid that hemight be caught and face a death sentence, he told the executionersthat he would be satisfied with their merely incapacitating Wang.However, by mistake a taxi driver was beaten up and the case wasexposed.  When these two butchers confessed, they revealedinformation about the price-list; they confessed that they had beenhired several times and that as soon as they were paid they wouldgo out and "do their job."Both the officials and gangsters find such cooperation very useful:the gangsters with official power in their hands become morepowerful; and corrupt officials with support from the black gangsactually have an "army" at their beck and call.  In a township inHunan province, there is a tacit understanding between the localgovernment and the black gangs: the gangsters will collectprotection fees from the local markets and businesses; and wheneverthe public security department wants help in cracking a case, theblack gangs will give assistance.  The township officials seenothing wrong with this cooperation.  Such cooperation hasdeveloped to such an extent that in some localities the black gangsregard themselves as the regime itself.The current trend among the black gangs is to buy out grass-rootParty and government cadres so that they have more validprotection.  The black gangs in the countryside are making use ofthe clans to rope the cadres or to bribe officials in grass-rootelections so that the black gangs bosses are elected to publicoffice.Copyright 1996 The Princeton China InitiativeBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA FOCUS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996The Two Chinas - In the Media and in Realityfrom CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996by Chen YenIn August, I went back to China to visit my family and to tour thecountry.  In addition to brief stays in big cities like Beijing andXi'an, I also visited a number of inland counties and villages inSichuan and Hubei provinces.  I have to say that it was quite anexperience.  The most intense realization I had was that the Chinathat I saw with my own eyes is greatly different from the Chinaportrayed in various overseas media in Europe, America, Hong Kong,and Taiwan.I should say that there is another China that is real but that isbeing ignored in the media.The overseas media reports on China often cite numbers, but thesenumbers are primarily from China's official statistics.  Forexample, in July of this year China's official media made manyclaims: the Chinese economy had successfully achieved a "softlanding"; the growth rate of the economy for the first half of theyear remained at 13 percent, while inflation continued to declineto an average of 7.8 percent; and 49 percent of the state-ownedenterprises were operating at a deficit.  Except for the latterstatistic, the above officially announced figures are all positive.However, their accurateness is questionable.  Even the number ofstate-owned enterprises operating at a deficit is quite differentin reality.Among my observations in China, the first is that the condition ofagriculture is very bad.  This year flooding has been very seriousin the south and there was a bad harvest of the summer crops.Disallowing for the flooded fields, the crops had rotted in 30 to40 percent of the remaining fields.  In Sichuan, I ran into manypeasants who had fled from the floods in Hubei province.  Theyreported that all the rice paddies and cotton fields in their homeareas were flooded.  The cotton problem was the worst.  TheJianghan plain in Hubei province used to be a famous cotton-producing area.  But this year the cotton plants grew only stems,and there were no buds.  Therefore, there would be a diminishedoutput.The agricultural depression directly affected the market because ininland China, business in the middle-sized and small cities mainlydepends on the buying power of the peasants.  I witnessed adepressed economic scene in a number of counties and cities innorthern Sichuan: all the department storesin these cities had asurplus supply of goods.  But without even one exception, thesestores had almost no shoppers.  And few people were going torestaurants.When we visited a city in Hubei, we were told that 90 percent ofthe state-owned enterprises were idle.  Some operated occasionally,but they could not make a profit so that the workers had to go outto find other sources to make a living.The problems within the state-owned enterprises have already causedserious social consequences.  In one city in Hubei province, Iwitnessed 300 workers staging a sit-in in front of the municipalgovernment offices.  The city officials all had to use the sidedoors of the building to avoid the protesters.  The deputy mayorhad originally planned to accompany us on a tour of the city, butsince his car could not exit from the gate, he had to give up thetour.  The protesting workers came from a local power plant.  Thecity had initially collected funds from the workers so that theplant could generate electricity but the cost of producing theelectricity was higher than purchasing it elsewhere. So the citygovernment decided to close down this power plant.  However, theremaining funds collected from the workers were gobbled up by theofficials of the plant.  Although two of the officials werearrested for this wrongdoing, the whereabouts of the workers' fund,not to mention also their salaries, had yet to be resolved.  Themunicipal government did not know how to respond to the protest.Privately, city officials thought the workers' protest wasjustified; but even if the government temporarily were able toissue the workers small subsidies, because of its tight budget itwould not be able to ameliorate the workers' resentment.  Suchincidents are common-place in China today, so city officials acrossthe country are now quite accustomed to such protests.Although what I saw during this short trip to China naturally waslimited, it was enough to make me feel the seriousness of thecountry's current problems.  When I chatted with local officials, Iwas surprised that they so honestly told me that local governmentsat various levels all survive by submitting fake reports.Previously there was no income base for the finances of the localgovernments because they relied on the higher levels of government;now the local governments have to rely on extorting fees from themasses.  For example, schools now commonly ask grade school andhigh school students to pay high tuitions, which in turn aredeposited in the government's coffers. Local governments then boastthat their situation is excellent because their economic growth hastaken off at an amazing speed.A friend of mine has a position in a local government.  He told methat though the overall situation is very poor, temporarily thepeople will be able to tolerate it.  The reasons are: first, peoplehave an increased degree of freedom and if their own work unitcannot pay out wages, they can still find other outside income;second, most people have become cynical as they know that thissystem will not last for long.  As a result, he said, there are twodecisive consequences to the current circumstances and these willhave a far-reaching influence.First, since the reform started over a decade go, the people'sdemocratic consciousness has increased a great deal.  This meanscitizens everywhere, including people in remote areas, have allstarted resorting to their legal rights to express their opinions.Street protests are an often-used technique.Second, the relationship between the cadres and the masses at thebasic levels has changed substantially; it is now antagonistic andcompetitive.  The supportive base upon which the Chinese CommunistParty used to rely among the lower-level masses has already gonewith the wind.(Translated by Joy C. Lewis)Copyright 1996 The Princeton China InitiativeBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA FOCUS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996An Event Fueling the Power Strugglefrom CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996by Liu ZianRecently, an important event, which undoubtedly will intensify thepower struggle within the party central, has been unfolding.The beginning of this event was quite common place: earlier thisyear, the position of the vice secretary of the Liuzhou PrefecturalParty Committee in Guangxi Autonomous Region was vacated.  LiuHeping, deputy mayor of a city in that prefecture, went all out totry to secure the position.  He used to say that he had served inthe army for thirteen years and because of his achievements he hadbeen promoted from a common soldier to the post of the deputy headof a regiment.  But soon a competitor for the vacated positionexposed to the regional party committee that Liu had lied about hispersonal history; instead of being in the army he had actually beena criminal who had spent thirteen years in prison.  After aninvestigation, this allegation was confirmed.Just as Liu Heping was facing a hopeless impasse, suddenly twoofficers from the headquarters of the General Staff in Beijing cameto the Guangxi Autonomous Region Party Committee; they claimed thatthey were entrusted by the party General Secretary Jiang Zemin toinform the committee that Liu Heping had spent the thirteen yearsin prison "to carry out a special task."  As luck would have it, HuJintao, a standing committee member of the Politburo, was inGuangxi at that time.  When Hu heard about this, he was very muchin doubt; so he verified this piece of information with Jiang Zeminhimself.  Jiang flatly denied that he had sent out those officerson such an errand and asked that this fraud be thoroughlyinvestigated.It is obvious that whoever had sent those two officers faced greatpolitical risks.  Unless the exposure of Liu Heping would havebrought him tremendous disaster, he certainly would not haveventured to make such a dangerous move; and if he did not havestrong support, support from someone whose safety also dependedclosely on the safety of Liu Heping, this person too would not havetaken such a risk.Indeed, the case of Liu Heping exposed a huge criminal gang whichinvolved many high-level officers.  The person who had sent thosetwo officers to intercede on behalf of Liu Heping was in a highenough position: he was Major General Liu Shilun, head of theManagement Bureau of the General Staff Headquarters.  ThisManagement Bureau is in charge of providing logistic services toall the high officers, and Liu Shilun has broad and influentialconnections both in the top echelons of the military and in thelocalities.Based on many cases of corruption which have already been exposed,Liu Shilun had acted as the go-between for high military officersand local officials in illegal business dealings.  Liu Shilun wasalso guilty of another crime: using his authority he recruited manypretty girls from the ranks of the female soldiers and sent them toluxurious hotels established by the military and to military guesthouses in Beijing to provide sexual services to military and localofficials.Up to the present, one lieutenant general, three major generals,and tens of local officials have been arrested.  The highest-ranking officials in Tianjin municipality and in Sichuan provincewere also involved.Corruption in the army has always been more severe than in thelocalities, but such cases have always been carefully covered up.The anti-corruption campaigns have never really reached into themilitary and corruption cases in the military have never beenpublicly exposed.  In recent years, Jiang Zemin has been especiallycareful to avoid involving the military in the anti-corruptioncampaigns.  At this time, as Jiang is wooing the military forsupport in the intense struggle for power in the post-Deng era, anyexposure of military corruption cases will definitely put Jiang ina difficult position.  With so many factions in the military, itwill be very easy for one faction to find some pretext to strike atanother; Jiang certainly does not wish to be caught in the middle.It is said that the relationship between Liu Shilun and GeneralZhang Wannian, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission andchief of the General Staff, is very close.  Zhang Wannian hadseveral times recommended Liu Shilun for the position of the vicechief of the General Staff, but his proposal was vehementlyrejected by General Chi Haotian, another vice chairman of theCentral Military Commission and the minister of national defense.The exposure of Liu Shilun has evidently put Zhang Wannian at adisadvantage at a crucial moment when Zhang Wannian and Chi Haotianare both contending for membership on the standing committee of thePolitburo; at the same time, these two generals both carrysignificant weight in support of Jiang Zemin in the scramble tokeep his position as the General Secretary of the Chinese CommunistParty.  In view of the fact that Jiang Zemin has always favoredZhang Wannian over Chi Haotian, the struggle that is now unfoldingsurely will be intensely dramatic.(Translated by Chuan Hsien)Copyright 1996 The Princeton China InitiativeBack to Headline List WT03-B04-12IA086-000616-B002-58http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it129.html 205.156.212.5 19970122023500 text/html 43971HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:32:59 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:39 GMTContent-length: 43784Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it129.html Sample Issue Copyright CHINA NEWS via NewsNet September 23, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Local firms flood into Europe: 29 information technology companies hoping to get closer to their clients (447 words) Investment in Austria heading for early profit (376 words) Far Eastern Group looking to raise cash (297 words) MOEA approves US$328 in investments (253 words) 3 new funds to pump NT$8b into Taiex (236 words) China realtors to check out Taipei market (188 words) Women's group hands out awards to `sisters' (292 words) Ambassador issues open invitation (157 words) Gambling plan slammed: Legalized gambling will only lead to more crime, official (321 words) PRC claim on ROC `unjustified': academic (298 words) 6,000 protest Japan's claims: Taipei march to `protect the Tiaoyutai' (615 words) Deep Chinese rifts remain despite anti-Japan unity (652 words) MAC calls for strong post 1997 links (201 words) Overseas Chinese may improve ties (326 words) Beijing asked to take back illegals (312 words) Prosecutors to lose power to detain suspects (287 words) Peng feels no remorse over DPP: Ex-DPP presidential candidate critical of plans to negotiate with KMT (458 words) Taiwan is a `treasure island` (190 words) Lake swimmers go for world record (187 words) CopyrightCHINA NEWS                                    via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Local firms flood into Europe: 29 information technology companies hopingto get closer to their clientsfrom CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996 Acer, Mitac and First International are among 29 major Taiwan informationtechnology (IT) firms that are currently building assembly plants orexpanding operations in Europe, industry experts said on Saturday. Jean Yves Yao, a section chief of the Chinese National Federation ofIndustry (CNFI), said the ``companies want to be closer to their clientsso they can provide after-sales service.'' Acer, the biggest local computer maker, began constructing an assemblyplant in Finland in late 1995 and may start operation next year. Thecomputer giant plans to use the Scandinavian country as a base formarketing forays into Russia and other republics of the former SovietUnion. It chose Finland because of its proximity and traditionally closeeconomic ties to Russia. Mitac next year will mark its tenth year of operations in TelfordShropshire, the UK. It has invested about NT$68 million in a computerperipherals plant in the industrial district. Mitac, Tatung, Lite-on and six other IT and electronics firms which havemade the UK their regional hub are benefiting from the longest averageworking week in the European Union (EU) - 43.3 hours. They also enjoyquick transport links to continental Europe through the English channeltunnel, enabling them to deliver products to France and Germany in lessthan two days. First International has an assembly plant in the Netherlands, which,according to Yao, has the best transport system in Europe. ``Goods are brought to Rotterdam and then quickly shipped to users,''said Yao. The Netherlands also boasts the lowest incidence of labor disputes inEurope - it lost an average of only 13 working days per 1,000 employeesevery year from 1991 to 1993. Greece, which has the worst labor record inthe EU, lost an average of 1,780 working days per 1,000 employees everyyear in the same period. Joseph Chwo-ming Yu, a professor at the National Cheng Chi University,said many IT firms are planning to expand operations in Europe as a hedgeagainst declining sales in other markets. For instance, Acer's sales last month, NT$3.642 billion, dipped 25percent from the level in the same period last year. Mitac's saleslikewise dropped last month, by 18 percent to NT$912 million from thefigure in August 1995. According to Yu, about 34 percent of all local IT firms already serve theEuropean market. About the same number sell products to either NorthAmerica or China. Also, 24 of the 29 firms with big investment plans inEurope now make over 60 percent of total sales in foreign markets.Copyright 1996 China NewsBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA NEWS                                    via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Investment in Austria heading for early profitfrom CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996 VIENNA - Atomos Petrochemie, Taiwan's largest investment in Austria bythe Dahin Group, is going to celebrate its first anniversary on Sept. 30with a silver lining on the horizon. Kevin Liu, president of Atomos Petrochemie, said on Saturday that hebelieves the more than US$28-million investment project will proveprofitable in the first year. Dahin Group bought the petrochemical plant last year for US$28 millionfrom the state-run Chemie Linz. Atomos Petrochemie, located in theSchwechat petrochemical industrial park near Vienna International Airport,mainly produces PA (phthalic anhydride), an up-stream fossil material formaking plastics. Liu said since the plant began operation last September, its annualoutput of chemical materials has increased from 38,000 metric tons to42,000 metric tons and is expected to reach 45.000 metric tons within ashort period of time. Half of the plant's PA output is exported to Asian countries, while therest of it goes to Austria, Germany, France and Italy, Liu said. PA can be used to make a variety of products, ranging from nipples oninfants' milk bottles to medical gloves. Liu said that because of automated production lines, besides his wife andhimself, the plant hired only some 40 Austrian employees. While speakinghighly of the work force in Austria, Liu said the welfare system for theemployees sometimes was a headache in the factory management. Austria has proved to be conveniently located, allowing Atomos to acquireraw materials from resource-rich countries such as the former SovietUnion, the Netherlands, Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia, Liu said. On the future development of the petrochemical plant, Liu said that DahinGroup decided to further invest five or six million US dollars to installa co-generation facility in the plant.

GDRs are bonds that are convertible into warrants - certificates allowingthe transfer of the bonds into stocks - and are held on reserve in banks. Jean-Francois di Meglio, country manager of French bank Banque Paribas,said last week that his banks, BZW and ING Barings, lead the world in thesale of GDRs. They expect to sell US$60 million worth of GDRs for FarEastern Silo and Shipping before the end of the year. ``GDRs are currently at a premium. It's more difficult for foreigners tobuy GDRs. But they are largely responsible for the building up of theTaiwan stock exchange since March of this year,'' said di Meglio. C.S. Tsai, a senior official of the Intercontinental Commercial Bank ofChina (ICBC), said the ICBC is co-underwriting the sale of GDRs for FarEastern Textile. The textile firm is releasing over 30 million sharesworth over US$60 million. The sale began on September 12. The two Far Eastern companies reportedly will use funds generated fromthe GDR sale to clear bank debts and to finance expansion projects. A high-ranking Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official said theboom in the sale of GDRs and corporate bonds is likely to continue on thestrength of high annual profits from bond funds. Di Meglio, however, said GDR investors are demanding that the ROCgovernment give them a guarantee of convertibility from the date of bondissue. The government has restricted conversion in the past due to a fearof capital outflows.Copyright 1996 China NewsBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA NEWS                                    via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996MOEA approves US$328 in investmentsfrom CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996 The Ministry of Economic Affairs approved a series of new investmentprojects yesterday worth US$328 million that include foreigners'investments in Taiwan and Taiwan outbound investments, including severalgoing to China.

The association marked its third founding anniversary yesterday byselecting top 10 news making women who have drawn much public attentionover the past year. Chen made the list because she had changed jobs many times since herreturn from the US a year ago, the association said. Chen first worked for a prospective woman presidential candidate, thenheaded the DPP's publicity department. Following the March 23 presidentialelection, she worked for a music company for a short period of time, andthen returned to the DPP to serve as Hsu's special assistant. The association selected Annie Lee as the ``best actress'' of a ``reallife'' soap opera. Lu first made headlines after accusing a Normal Taiwan Universityprofessor of sexually harassing her. Lu blamed the professor for unfairlypreventing her from pursuing a doctoral degree at the school. She was later found to be having an affair with Wang Wen-yang, the son ofFormosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang Yung-ching. Wang was forced to resignfrom his father's company after his affair with Lu were exposed. KMT Legislator Shen Chih-hui was selected ``the woman most vulnerable toinjuries'' because she sustained serious injuries after being kicked byNew Party Legislator Fu Kun-cheng.

Gambling is rampant in Taiwan even though it is illegal. Some lawmakershave urged the government to allow the establishment of tourist casinoswhich they say can help increase government tax revenues and wipe outunderground gambling houses. Speaking on a TTV news program, Chang refuted the argument, saying localpeople generally do not like to gamble at public places. ``I'm afraid that legally licensed casinos cannot attract prospectivegamblers,'' he noted. Chang further said legalization of gambling may give local people themisleading impression that gambling is not a bad thing. This message wouldhelp fuel the gambling mania around the island. The Tourism Bureau has considered opening tourist casinos on selectedoffshore islands to lure foreign tourists, Chang said, adding that suchcasinos would only be open to foreign passport holders. However, Changsaid, the bureau has dropped the idea after a feasibility study showednegative results. For one thing, Chang said, establishing a casino alone cannot attractforeign tourists to Taiwan. It is also not expected to provide enoughincentive to lure local gamblers who are usually more interested ingambling at underground places where gamblers can hide their trueidentities and engage in all types of games. Several lawmakers earlier this year jointly drafted a bill governing theestablishment of tourist casinos. According to the draft bill, suchcasinos would be open to local people aged 18 or older. Strong oppositionfrom the government and academics persuaded the Legislative Yuan'sJudiciary Committee to not screen the controversial bill.Copyright 1996 China NewsBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA NEWS                                    via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996PRC claim on ROC `unjustified': academicfrom CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996 BRUSSELS - Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a part of its territory cannotbe justified under modern international law, according to a well knownBelgian academic. Jean-Marie Henckaerts, professor of international law at the Universityof Brussels, states in a new book that Taiwan is a de facto country interms of international law, even if it is not yet recognized by allcountries in the world. The book, The International Status of Taiwan in the New World Order,published in Boston and London in September, is a compilation of thepapers and reports read at a symposium sponsored by the University ofBrussels last June. Henckaerts states that a country is only a means of providing protectionto its people rather than a goal in itself, therefore, it is up to thepeople of Taiwan to determine what is best for them and who owns theisland. In his view, Taiwan has met every criteria necessary to become a memberof the United Nations. No rules under current international law forbidTaiwan from joining that world body. The author doubted Beijing's sovereignty claim to Taiwan, saying thePeople's Republic of China, established in 1949, has not ruled theterritory governed by the Republic of China since 1945. Henckaerts can not see how Beijing can threaten to take Taiwan by force.He believes it is the moral and legal duty of the international communityto safeguard Taiwan's freedom of choice, and make it clear to Beijing thatthe international community will not accept the use of force as a way tosolve the Taiwan issue. He urges European countries to form a common front to deal with Beijing.Copyright 1996 China NewsBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA NEWS                                    via NewsNetSeptember 23, 19966,000 protest Japan's claims: Taipei march to `protect the Tiaoyutai'from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996 More than 6,000 protesters took to the streets of Taipei yesterdaymorning in the largest demonstration yet against Japan's recent claims tothe disputed Tiaoyutai islands. Led by a huge ROC flag and chanting ``protect the Tiaoyutai'' and ``downwith Chinese militarism,'' the protesters wound their way from the ChiangKai-shek Memorial Hall, through downtown Taipei to the Sun Yat-senMemorial Hall. As they marched, the feelings of frustration and indignation were strong. ``The Tiaoyutai islands belong to the Chinese,'' protester Wei Tsu-chunsaid. ``We Chinese people cannot be bullied by any country. We cannottolerate any country invading our territory.'' ``Every Chinese person is furious when we hear Japan occupies ourTiaoyutai islands,'' protester Chang Shu-fan said. ``I wish they wouldleave immediately.'' A wooden model of Bruce Lee was raised above the crowd along with aJapanese sumo wrestler for Bruce Lee to kick. Above the models, a signread: ``The fierce dragon saves the nation.'' New Party Legislator Chu Hui-liang, speaking at a rally following themarch, focused on rejecting what she called the Japanese culturalinfiltration of Taiwan by programming on cable TV. ``We want to see our own programs, right?'' she shouted to the crowd.``Right,'' came the unanimous reply. Several other New Party lawmakers took turns to call on President LeeTeng-hui for stronger action to assert sovereignty over the islands. Theyalso called for a boycott of Japanese goods. The New Party, which organized the event along with the ROC Alliance forthe Protection of the Tiaoyutai, gathered signatures for a drive to send amillion petitions to the president. One man holding a picture of Lee Teng-hui shouted: ``Remove Lee Tenghuifrom office.'' ``Lee Teng-hui has Japanese relatives, that is why he is so weak,'' hesaid. Li Mi, a professor of International Ocean Law at National Taiwan OceanUniversity, said: ``Look at Korea. They stood up against Japan and Japanleft. The people in Taiwan are different, though.'' Shung King Fai, a Hong Kong Regional Council member, also took part inyesterday's protest, telling the rally that all Chinese people shouldunite in defense of the Tiaoyutai islands. Meanwhile, a small group of protesters set sail from Hong Kong yesterdayfor a three-day trip to the Tiaoyutai chain. The protesters plan to raise a Chinese flag on one of the islands. Japanese coastal authorities have said they will turn the boat back if ittries to enter its territorial waters. ``We emphasis that our protest will be peaceful but we are also preparedto sacrifice ourselves to protect our islands,'' said spokesman David Chan. The ship carried 18 protesters, all men and aged between 25 to 68,wearing green T-shirts and red headbands. The cargo ship was chartered by the Alliance of Worldwide Chinese for theProtection of the Tiaoyutai Islands. It also carried 42 accompanyingjournalists and 19 crew members. It was renamed the ``Bao-Tiao,'' or ``Tiaoyutai Islands Defender,'' forthe trip. ``We have taken no weapons,'' said Captain Ngai Lup-chee. ``If theJapanese shoot at us, we will get away.'' The group has asked for protection from the Chinese navy. Meanwhile, Japanese media reported yesterday that President Lee hasexpressed the desire to meet with Japanese Prime Minister RyutaroHashimoto to talk about regional security. Lee apparently made the request to Shinji Sato, president of LiberalDemocratic Party's Sino-Japanese parliamentarian group, earlier this month. The chance of such a meeting taking place, however, is considered slim.Copyright 1996 China NewsBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA NEWS                                    via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Deep Chinese rifts remain despite anti-Japan unityfrom CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996 At a glance, it would seem Asia's disparate Chinese communities at lasthave found a common voice as they angrily denounce Japan's claim ofsovereignty over a deserted East China Sea archipelago. But have they? In the weeks since Japanese ultranationalists built a shaky lighthouse toassert Japan's title to what it calls the Senkaku islands, a collectiveChinese howl of indignation has arisen in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau andChina. Daily protests, mostly small but a few attracting 10,000 or more people,have stirred a sense that after a century of profound political rifts andcivil war, Chinese fundamental interests have begun to coalesce, withJapan as catalyst. Fuelled by the islands dispute, this anti-Japanese Chinese nationalismpeaked on Sept. 18 - 65 years to the day after Japan invaded northeastChina to visit 14 years of atrocities on China's people and drag Asia intoWorld War II. Observers muse aloud whether the seemingly unanimous Chinese reaction toJapan's territorial claim - that the islands are called the Tiaoyutai, notthe Senkakus, and belong to China - signals a closing of Chinese ranks. Has a ``Chinese century'' begun to dawn? Political experts say no, pointing to deep-seated and complex forces theysay will check the emergence of any influential new ``greater China''nationalism or realignments in the fundamental China-Taiwan-Hong Kongbalance of power. Both Beijing and Taipei, experts say, are unwilling to allow a disputewith Japan over the unpopulated isles to affect their own five-decade-oldbattle of wits over the fate of Taiwan - a far higher priority - or tostir up domestic unrest. ``Cross-strait ties (between Taiwan and China) have a special dynamicwhich will not be influenced by the Tiaoyutai island row,'' said SoochowUniversity political scientist Luo Chih-chen. Luo said Beijing could not forcefully assert its sovereignty because thiswould highlight its failure to win back Taiwan. ``In essence, the Tiaoyutai problem is the same as the Taiwan problem,''Luo said. ``If China wanted to face the Tiaoyutai problem, it would beforced to face the Taiwan problem.'' Gallup pollster Tim Ting said it was impossible for China and Taiwan tomount a united stand or even take firm unilateral measures against Japan,since China fears offending Japanese investors and Taiwan wants to counton Japanese and US support in any confrontation with the mainland. ``Chances are Taiwan, Japan and China will all play down the sovereigntyissue and the only understanding reached eventually will be on somethingless controversial, like fishing rights in waters around the islands,''Ting said. Powerful local forces are also at work, analysts say. Most of Taiwan's anti-Japan protests have been organized by the tiny butvocal New Party, whose members hope to use the islands issue to underminePresident Lee Teng-hui, who they suspect longs for Taiwan's formalindependence rather than integration with China. ``It is only very few people in Taiwan who are trying to use thisopportunity to arouse nationalistic sentiment,'' said political scientistLu Ya-li of National Taiwan University. ``The majority of people, quite frankly, don't care.'' In Hong Kong, even the Democratic party, which fears a loss of freedom inthe British colony after it returns to Chinese rule in mid-1997, hasvoiced support for Beijing's claim to the Tiaoyutai islands and suspicionof Japan. But analysts say various groups have different motives for urging Beijingto use force to claim back the islands. ``For pro-China parties, this is simply a chance to win favor withBeijing,'' a Taipei diplomat said. ``But for the Democrats, pressuring Beijing for a military response is away of wielding a very popular issue to exert political influence thatChina does not want them to have.''Copyright 1996 China NewsBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA NEWS                                    via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996MAC calls for strong post 1997 linksfrom CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996 Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chang King-yuh has called for a solidand stable relationship between Taiwan and Hong Kong after the Britishcolony's handover to Chinese rule in 1997.

It is the largest of the five mainland migrantsdetention centers in Taiwan. According to the Kinmen Agreement signed by the ROC Red Cross Society andits mainland counterpart in September 1990, each side is obligated to takeback people who have illegally entered the other territory. Under the agreement, mainland authorities must send ships to Taiwan'soffshore islands of Kinmen or Matsu to take back their illegal immigrants,while Taiwan is responsible for sending the immigrants to Kinmen or Matsu. Over the past six years, China has not only been unable to effectivelyrein in its people's immigration drive but has also been slow in takingback illegals held in Taiwan, adding to Taiwan's social burden. Moreover, some detained illegal mainland immigrants have staged hungerstrikes to protest their long detention in Taiwan. MAC statistics show that Taiwan has detained 34,019 illegal mainlandimmigrants since 1987.

The revision was recently worked out by an ad hoc committee of theJudicial Yuan to comply with a ruling by the Council of Grand Justices.The ruling states that such powers are unconstitutional and must berevised by the end of next year. Prosecutors have been authorized to detain suspects because they used tobe considered part of the court system, but the Council of Grand Justicesbelieves that prosecutors and judges have different duties and thereforebelong to different systems. Under the revision, all decisions to order custody of suspects must beapproved by court judges instead of prosecutors, beginning in 1998. In addition to the part concerning the power of custody, some provisionsof the Code of Criminal Procedure will also revised according to therevision to be sent to the legislature for screening and approval. For instance, the maximum period of custody for investigation will beshortened from two to one month, but will be able to be extended for amonth if necessary. Custody for trials will be shortened to two months. Under no circumstances can a person suspected of committing a minor crimeand is subject to only a fine, be taken into custody. Police will not be allowed to question suspects in the evenings, unlesssuch questioning is approved by prosecutors or judges in advance becauseof the pressing need to get information related to the crimes they havecommitted, according to the revision.Copyright 1996 China NewsBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA NEWS                                    via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Peng feels no remorse over DPP: Ex-DPP presidential candidate critical ofplans to negotiate with KMTfrom CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996 Former DPP presidential candidate Peng Ming-min yesterday again blastedthe DPP for its plan to cooperate with the KMT, saying the party shouldtry to expand its popular base by persuading people to accept its policiesinstead of bargaining with the KMT for a few government posts. Peng made the remark while presiding over the inauguration of theKaohsiung branch of the NationBuilding Association, which he founded afterthe March presidential race. Some of the association's leaders have recently announced their plan tobreak away from the DPP to organize a new political party the TaiwanIndependence Party, after accusing the DPP of softening its stand onTaiwan independence. Peng told his supporters that he did not owe the DPP anything. He said hewon the DPP's presidential nomination because of his efforts in vying forvoter support during the primaries. Peng said he has delivered 300 public speeches pushing his politicalideals long before the DPP decided to nominate him to run for thepresidency. His role in the presidential election prevented the DPP from breaking upearlier, Peng said. ``It was wrong for the DPP to describe itself as the `mainstream' ofTaiwan's opposition movement,'' Peng said. ``The DPP is nothing but an`episode' of this movement that started after Japan occupied Taiwan nearlya century ago.'' Peng criticized DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang for meeting President Lee inprivate. ``The DPP should fight to become the ruling party by appealingfor public support with its policies and by supervising the KMT'sadministration, instead of trying to get a few government posts throughsecret deals with the KMT,'' Peng said. DPP Spokesman and Cultural Affairs Director Kuo Cheng-liang said hesympathizes with Peng's situation after losing the presidential race, butadded that he could not agree with Peng's criticism of the party. The DPP has never before negotiated with the KMT for a few posts as acondition for its cooperation with the KMT, nor has it done anything tobetray the opposition movement. The DPP might have adjusted its way of thinking, but this is because ithas to consider the Taiwan issue from a broader point of view for the sakeof Taiwan's future, instead of judging things from the standpoint ofpeople suffering from political persecution as it did in the past, Kuosaid. Kuo said he did not expect Peng to be punished for openly criticizing theDPP. ``Peng is still a senior adviser to the DPP, but he has not paid hisparty membership fees for a long time,'' Kuo said while explaining Peng'sstatus in the party.Copyright 1996 China NewsBack to Headline List CopyrightCHINA NEWS                                    via NewsNetSeptember 23, 1996Taiwan is a `treasure island`from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996 Taiwan is a good place for treasure hunting and archaeological studiesjudging from the huge number of sunken vessels in waters in this area,experts said yesterday.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996POVERTY REMAINS PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA     According to a new report by the UN's Economic Commissionfor Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), released in lateDecember, only a "handful" of countries in the region made anysustained progress in cutting poverty during the first half ofthe 1990s.  In fact, ECLAC reports that the fallout fromMexico's financial crisis last year severely eroded even thesmall gains in living standards that some countries hadpreviously achieved.     In early 1993, ECLAC published an extensive survey onpoverty levels in the region that showed that the ranks of thepoor and indigent swelled dramatically during the 1980s.According to that study, between 1980 and 1990 the number ofpeople living below the poverty line climbed by 60 million--from 136 million to 196 million--thus raising the percentageof the total population considered poor from 41% to 46%.  Atthe same time, the number of people living in extreme povertygrew from 62.4 million to 93.5 million, or from 19% to 22% ofthe total regional population (see Chronicle, 09/22/94).     ECLAC must yet carry out another comprehensive surveysuch as the one released in 1993.  Nevertheless, preliminaryestimates made by ECLAC in October suggest that, during thefirst half of the 1990s, the absolute number of people livingin poverty may have grown by another 34 million.  Ifpopulation growth during the period is taken into account,that would mean that about 48% of the total population may nowbe living below the poverty line (see NotiSur - Latin AmericanPolitical Affairs, 10/20/95).     In its latest report in December, ECLAC did not offer anynew statistics on poverty.  Rather, the commission announcedthat between 1990 and 1994 it was only able to identify sixcountries that registered slightly reduced rates of poverty:Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Panama, and Uruguay.  And, evenin those countries, there was only a relative improvement atbest in general living standards.     "Even in countries where economic liberalization programswere judged a success, such as Chile, the problem of endemicpoverty remained a stubborn reality," reads the report.     Moreover, ECLAC reports that in 1995 three countries--Mexico, Costa Rica, and Argentina--appear to have "lost theground in the fight against poverty that they had gained inthe preceding years."   The economies of those countries werethe most seriously affected by the currency crisis thatexploded in Mexico in December 1994, leading to a sharpdecline in growth in all three nations last year (seeChronicle, 11/16/95).     In fact, ECLAC said that Mexico and Costa Ricarepresented "worrisome cases" because poverty is now on therise again following years of decline in both countries.     In general, ECLAC says that, even in the most successfuleconomies, growth in recent years has not generated enoughjobs to keep pace with population growth.  Unemployment ratesin Latin America seldom dip below 20%, and more often average30% for the poorest sectors of the region's population,according to the report.  Real incomes for middle- and lower-income sectors have fallen in comparison with 1960 levels.     "A new group of poor people is now emerging that iscreating novel characteristics among the impoverished massesof Latin America," said ECLAC executive director RubenKaztman.  "The newly poor are by and large educated people whohad previously enjoyed higher patterns of consumption andaccess to basic services that they now lack.  Thetraditionally poor groups had already been living in severepoverty, but those who had previously belonged to the middleclasses are now also impoverished."     According to ECLAC, poverty continues to grow much morerapidly in Latin American cities than in the countryside,largely because of the acceleration in rural to urbanmigration in recent years.  In a separate study by ECLACreleased in November, the commission reported that about 351million people--more than 73% of the total population--nowlive in urban areas throughout Latin American and theCaribbean, making the region's cities some of the most denselypopulated in the world.     According to ECLAC, of the world's 15 most populatedcities, four are in Latin America: Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro,Mexico City, and Buenos Aires.  And, even though migration tothe largest cities has slowed somewhat in recent years, poorcampesinos continue to flood into medium- and small-sizedcities in search of better opportunities.  ECLAC predictsthat, if the present trend continues, within 30 years LatinAmerica's urban population will have swelled to 576 millionpeople, or 85% of the population, even after accounting forthe expected increase in the total number of inhabitants.     As a result of the demographic explosion in urban areas--which, for the first time, is making poverty in Latin Americaan overwhelmingly urban phenomenon--infrastructure is beingstretched to the breaking point.  For example, in anotherECLAC study also released in late December, the commissionestimated that there is a shortage of 20 million livingquarters in urban areas throughout the region.  In addition,of the estimated 93 million living quarters that do exist,only about 56 million, or 60%, meet minimally acceptablestandards.  About 20 million are "damaged" and the remaining17 million are in a "precarious" state.     Notwithstanding the severity of ECLAC's estimates, someregional experts offer even more dismal appraisals of povertylevels and even graver predictions for the future.  Accordingto Bernardo Kliksberg, executive director of the Inter-American Institute for Social Development--which was set up bythe Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)--as of 1990 at least50% of the total regional population already lived in poverty.And, Kliksberg estimates that by the year 2000, about 57% ofthe population will have slipped below the poverty line.     Kliksberg, who was the keynote speaker at a regionalconference on poverty held in Venezuela in mid-November, saysthat at present about 1.5 million people die each year as aresult of poverty in Latin America.     The rapid spread of poverty has begun to alarm even themultilateral lending institutions, which now promise tochannel much more aid into social development projects in theregion.  In unusually candid terms, IDB president EnriqueIglesias recently stated that the increase in poverty islargely a result of the structural adjustment programs pushedby the IDB, the World Bank, and the International MonetaryFund (IMF) since the early 1980s.     "During the last decade, the central concerns were how toovercome hyperinflation, survive economically, and maintainpayments on the foreign debt," said Iglesias in an interviewwith the Uruguayan magazine Posdata, published in earlyNovember.  "As a result, efforts to deal with the socialconditions of our citizens were postponed, and thoseconditions grew worse.  Now that the economies of the regionhave become more manageable, we must begin to focus on socialproblems, especially the appearance of large groups of newlypoor who have emerged as a byproduct of structural adjustmentpolicies."     Iglesias warned that governments must begin to deal withsocial problems immediately, before those problems spin out ofcontrol.     "Marginalized social groups, whose problems have largelybeen ignored, are making their presence known in stark formsthroughout Latin America, such as the uprising of Indiancommunities in the Mexican state of Chiapas and the recentpopular revolts in some provinces in Argentina," saidIglesias.  "Those episodes clearly demonstrate that there isa growing social activism that can no longer be ignored."[Sources: Inter Press Service, 10/05/95; La Jornada (Mexico),10/06/95; Notimex, 10/25/95; Reuter, 10/13/95, 12/05/95;Agence France-Presse, 09/26/95, 10/17/95, 10/29/95, 11/01/95,11/09/95, 11/17/95, 12/14/95; United Press International,12/28/95; Excelsior (Mexico), 01/02/96]Back to Headline List CopyrightCHRONICLE OF LATIN AM. ECONOMIC AFFAIRS via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996CUBA: OFFICIALS PREDICT CONTINUED GROWTH IN TOURISMAIDED BY EUROPEAN & LATIN AMERICAN INVESTMENT     The Cuban tourism sector finished 1995 with a strongshowing in the number of travelers visiting the island.  Grossreceipts from tourism may soon become the country's mostimportant source of hard currency.     Meanwhile, as the government concentrates on hotelexpansion and carefully planned cruise-ship projects withEuropean and Latin American investors, US travel executivesworry that the US economic embargo will shut them completelyout of the promising Cuban travel market.     Economy and Planning Minister Jose Luis Rodriguezannounced in November that the government expects earningsfrom tourism to surpass sugar export earnings.  Poor sugarharvests in the last three years have underlined the high costof dependence on sugar.  A sugar-for-oil barter deal withRussia, signed Oct. 15, 1995, may prove disappointing becauseof lower-than-expected results in the early stages of the1995-1996 harvest, despite a US$200 million investment intrucks, spare parts, and other harvesting inputs (seeChronicle, 10/12/95).  As a result, planners now see tourismas a more stable source of convertible currency.     The Center for Cuban Economic Studies (Centro de Estudiosde la Economia Cubana) estimates that the planned developmentof 67 tourist destinations on the island with a capacity toaccommodate 10 million tourists in 200,000 rooms willeventually gross as much as US$15 billion annually.  Whilethis is a far cry from the US$1 billion predicted for 1996,the Tourism Ministry (MINTUR) estimates that it will haveclose to 50,000 rooms in place and will gross US$3.5 billionannually in just four years.     To finance such massive expansion, MINTUR is counting onforeign investors covering much of the US$2.4 billion requiredto develop the 67 resorts.  At present MINTUR is involved innegotiations with over 200 prospective investors from 28countries, and total foreign investment already securedamounts to US$300 million.     MINTUR predicts that 900,000 tourists will visit theisland in 1996.  This compares with an estimated 745,000 in1995 and 630,000 in 1994.  Part of the increase in tourismlast year is explained by the gradual dissipation of thenegative public image that resulted from the August 1994exodus of 30,000 Cubans who sailed for US waters in rafts.     In addition, during the past two years, Cuba has improvedits tourism infrastructure with new hotel construction andcruise-ship terminals.  On Dec. 2, 1995, Havana's new terminalreceived its first ship, the 500-berth Costa Playa owned byItalian cruise operator Costa Crociere.  The terminal ishoused in an 80-year old customs building renovated by CostaCrociere as part of a US$12 million joint venture with theCuban government.  Costa Crociere has also renovated aterminal in Santiago de Cuba in southeastern Cuba and plans tobuild a third terminal in Mariel, west of Havana.     It took Costa Crociere chairman Alfonso Lavarello twoyeise lines havesent representatives to Cuba to negotiate cruise-shipcontracts, including the London-based P&O line and KlosterCruises Ltd., a subsidiary of the Norwegian Vard line.     Nevertheless, Cuban tourism planners are moving slowlyinto the cruise business.  Growth in the number of cruiselines calling on Cuban ports will be controlled as part of anintegrated tourism strategy.     Central to that strategy is hotel construction, while thecruise-ship sector will be kept at between 4% and 5% of thetourism industry's gross receipts.  Cuba now has 25,000 hotelrooms, double the number it had in 1989, and new constructionfinanced by foreign investment is in the works.  For example,the French hotel company Accord plans to build 1,330 hotelrooms on Cayo Coco off the northern coast of Cuba.  TheMexican Grupo Domos, which is heavily invested in Cubantelecommunications, and the Canadian mining firm Sherritt areboth planning to expand into hotel and resort ventures.     Thousands of additional rooms rented out by privatecitizens for a fraction of the price charged by resort hotelsaugment the industry's capacity.  In recent months thegovernment has taken steps to control dollar distribution andto tax private services that have sprung up since late 1993,when the economy was opened up to a degree of privateenterprise (see Chronicle, 10/26/95).  But rather thanclamping down on unauthorized room rental businesses, MINTURhas begun to regulate them and has set up an agency calledDulce Hogar to place tourists in private houses andapartments.     While European and Latin American investors move into thegrowing Cuban travel market, their US counterparts are showingincreasing impatience with the 33-year old economic embargoand restrictions on travel by US citizens to Cuba.     In early December, a group of executives from US credit-card companies, travel agencies, and other travel-relatedbusinesses went to Havana to talk with MINTUR officials and tovisit hotels and other tourist facilities in and around Havanaand Santiago de Cuba.     The visit was surrounded by some secrecy as the names andaffiliations of the visitors were not made available to themedia.  But Cuban officials said it was the largest group fromthe US travel industry to come to Cuba since the triumph ofthe revolution in 1959.  John Kavulich, president of theUS-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, which coordinated thevisit, said it was a "private, familiarization trip."     But at a White House Conference on Travel and Tourism inNovember, the subject of Cuba was not on the agenda.  However,Darryl Hartley-Leonard, chairman of the Hyatt Hotelscorporation said, "Everybody discusses Cuba.  All the time."     "I think we're losing it," Hartley-Leonard said.  "Havewe completely lost out?  No.  But we're losing an opportunity.All of us encourage continual review of our policies towardthat country.  It's the next great international opportunity,far more than the East bloc.  But Congress, in its wisdom,chooses to reinforce the embargo."

They mightbe anywhere, though we have a hard time believing thatthey live among us. Sure, a few homegrown ones surfacehere in the United States now and then, but how about theinternational variety, particularly the ones who wreakhavoc throughout the Middle East?Unless you followed the news very closely, you probablymissed the shocker of the year: the new head of IslamicJihad is a college professor from the University ofFlorida in Tampa. That's right. As hard as it is tobelieve that a high-ranking leader from one of the mostviolent terrorist organizations in the Middle East mightbe living here in the States, that is exactly whathappened.Islamic Jihad is an Iranian-backed organization with asworn hatred of Israel and an intractable opposition tothe Middle East peace process. Its suicide bombers havekilled several Israeli soldiers and an American collegestudent. Although overshadowed by Hamas, during the pastfew months Israeli intelligence has kept an especiallywatchful eye on Islamic Jihad, which last October saw itslast leader, Fathi Shiqaqi, assassinated in Malta,probably by Israeli agents.  While all this washappening, Ramadan Abdullah Shallah quietly minded hisown business as a professor of MiddleEastern studies at the University of South Florida.Fellow faculty members and students remembered Shallah asa scholar concerned about the image of Islam worldwide."He didn'tseem like a radical to me," one of Shallah's studentstold the New York Times. Another said there was "neveranyindication that he had any sympathy with acts of terrorfor anyone's cause."Last June, Dr. Shallah left the United States saying heneeded to tend to his gravely ill father in Gaza. Inreality he went back to take the reins of Islamic Jihad.With thedeath of Shiqaqi, the mild-mannered professor tore offhis mask and declared Israel to be the implacable enemyof Arabs in the Middle East and swore to destroy thepeace process. Shallah praised the assassination ofIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and promised a "hardwar" against Israel.There's another twist to the story. While Shallah mayhave fooled his academic colleagues, his cover roused thesuspicion of the most hardcore of Islamic fundamentalists-- the mullahs in Iran. Immediately after word went outthatShallah was the new head of Islamic Jihad, Tehran let itbe known that he has had "suspicious contacts" with USandBritish intelligence. Both groups deny any ties, but notethat Iran thinks Shallah is too moderate for the job.Why hole up in Tampa rather than Iran? According to theAnti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the scenario fitsprecisely with Islamic Jihad's new tactics. Beginning in1988 the group began moving its leaders who were notdirectly involved in terrorism to quiet spots overseas.Modern technology in the form of faxes and the Internethas allowed them to stay in touch and ready for action atamoment's notice. How many others might be under ournoses?Unfortunately, CTS has not been able to unmask any other"sleeping" terrorists, but we do have articles designedto keep security professionals on top of the latest incounterterrorism. Associate Editor Jack Plaxe profilesthe US State Department's "Rewards Program for TerrorismInformation," which promises $2 million for vitalinformation which prevents a terrorist act or leads tothe apprehension of wanted terrorists. In this issue wealsopropose new measures to enhance the security of civilaviation, and look at how organized crime is threateningthe economic security of South Africa. Contributingeditor Tom Marks looks at the ongoing terrorism in SriLanka, one ofthe world's last bastions of Marxist insurgency. On thepractical side, learn about new techniques in crisismanagement, plus what to do to prevent being kidnapped,or if you are, how to survive the ordeal.In short, there's something in this issue for everyone inthe security business.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996IACSP ANNOUNCES 4th ANNUAL TERRORIST TRENDS AND FORECASTSSYMPOSIUM Co-Sponsored by Leica Technologies, Inc.February 9, 1996, J.

Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part IYour early morning flight from Los Angeles InternationalAirport to Washington, DC, has leveled off at 37,000feet. As the plane crosses the Rocky Mountains, flightattendants scurry up and down the aisles servingbreakfast. You settle back into your seat to watch themovie.Suddenly, without warning, your senses are overwhelmed bya deafening bang and a billowing cloud of smoke. Youbarely have time to scream before you find yourselfhurtling through the air, surrounded by passengers anddebris from the disintegrating aircraft. Deprived ofoxygen and suffering from shock, you black out as yourbody accelerates toward the earth. You, along with 299other passengers and crew, have died because of aterrorist bomb hidden in luggage stowed in the jet'sbelly.Fortunately, most air travelers will never experience thehorror of being sucked out of an airplane following anin-flight explosion. Yet this scenario is more than anidle fantasy conjured by a fertile imagination. Since1985 more than 1,000 passengers and crew have diedbecause terrorists penetrated security and smuggled abomb on board a civilian airliner. Airplanes of carrierssuch as Pan Am, TWA, UTA, and Avianca have been bombed byterrorists, with devastating consequences.Aviation bombings are rare, but they represent a seriousthreat that the aviation community is not yet prepared tocounter effectively and consistently, especially withinthe continental United States. While security measuresare in place to reduce vulnerabilities to this threat, weare still years away from deploying explosive detectionsystems that are reliable, efficient, and cheap.Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ismoving proactively to beef up domestic security andeliminate the gap between international and domesticprocedures. This has sparked an outcry from airlineexecutives and airport operators--who have legitimateconcerns that they will be unable to bear the financialcost estimated at over $2 billion dollars--ofimplementing the newly mandated procedures.Where is the US aviation security system headed? What areactual threats facing civil aviation? What are theimplications of tougher domestic security measures forairline and airport executives as well as the travelingpublic? These questions have unleashed a highlycontentious process that will ultimately require both thefederal government and the airline industry to reassesshow aviation security should be organized, implemented,and funded.The Aviation Security SystemSecurity for airline passengers currently is handled intwo arenas- one international and one national.Internationally, security standards set by theInternational Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Annex17, offers a least common denominator approach tosecurity. While accepted internationally, these standardsfall short of providing a tough set of measures thatprotect air carriers targeted by terrorists. Forcountries like the United States, however, Annex 17 is astarting point for security rather than the finaldestination.The real action on security occurs at the national level.By law and by tradition, a nation has the right to setand enforce aviation security practices for their flagcarriers, regardless of where they operate, and forforeign carriers that depart from its airports. In actualoperation, however, these rights are not exercisedequally. The United States, in particular, has been veryaggressive in setting the standards and practices usedfor aviation security. Its influence is partly due to itsvast market--a huge number of passengers fly on UScarriers, and a large number of foreign carriers want tofly to the United States.Two US laws provide the legal foundation guiding how theUS carries out the aviation security mission,particularly overseas: the Foreign Airport Security Actof 1986 and the Aviation Security Improvement Act of1990. Both laws recognize the principle that acountry--in this case the United States--has thesovereign right to control who lands planes in itsterritory. The United States can set standards for anycarrier that wants to land in the United States,although foreign carriers are not required to use thesame security programs followed by US carriers. The legalframework also requires the US government to assesssecurity at any foreign airport where US carriersoperate. In addition, the FAA monitors the overseasperformance of security procedures, such as addingpersonnel to screen passengers prior to allowing them onboard a plane, or requiring passengers to be screenedwith metal detectors before boarding a plane.If the world consisted of only one nation, the task ofaviation security would be simple and straightforward. Inthe multinational world, however, aviation securityinvolves more confusion and conflict than clarity. A UScarrier operating in Germany, for instance, must carryout extraordinary procedures mandated by the FAA. Yet,the same US air carrier's operations at Frankfurt'sinternational airport are controlled primarily byGermany's federal government, and the Hessian StateGovernment in particular.  While the FAA can dictate theprocedures US carriers must follow and fine them forlapses in security, its ability to monitor thoseprocedures falls under the jurisdiction and laws ofGermany. In addition, foreign carriers flying to theUnited States claim that under Annex 17 the UnitedStates cannot compel them to impose tighter securityprocedures. The FAA can only require foreign carriers toimplement higher standards if they are departing from aUS airport.For many years the demands of operating in aninternational environment have generated friction betweenthe FAA and US air carriers. Prior to the bombing of PanAm 103, US air carriers complained regularly that theywere being held accountable by the US government forimplementing security procedures, but were on their ownin securing the permission of the host government.In the aftermath of Pan Am 103 the U.S. Governmentexpanded its role in helping US-based air carriersresolve disputes with foreign authorities overimplementing security procedures. For instance, US aircarriers operating in Great Britain and Germany in thespring of 1992 were co-located at check-in counters withIran Air. Because of Iran's dubious status as a statesponsor of terrorism, the carriers expressed fears thatthe Iranian airline officials, by virtue of theirproximity, would gain knowledge about US mandatedsecurity procedures. Agreeing that the carriershad a legitimate concern, the US State Department,working with the FAA, interceded with British and Germanofficials to provide a solution.The FAA is doing a good job of protecting US airlinepassengers, but its ability to do an even better job ishampered by its second-class status within the federalbureaucracy and internal conflicts resulting fromcarrying out its other regulatory missions--e.g., flightsafety and airport operations. At the White House and theNational Security Council, for example, transportationsecurity issues in general, and aviation in particular,are handled on an ad hoc basis. This has been the casefor both Democratic and Republican administrations.Accordingly, the FAA must use a rather convolutedbureaucratic chain of command to bring serious securityissues to the attention of the president. If the FAA'sAssistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Securitydecides punitive action is required against a country forinadequate security, such as suspending flights, he wouldfirst inform the FAA Administrator who in turn wouldpresent the issue to the Secretary of Transportation. Itis the responsibility of the Secretary of Transportationto present the issue to the White House.The FAA's regulatory missions also cloud its securitymission. Witness the recent effort, for example, to raisesecurity standards at airports around the country. Thishas touched off an intensive behind-the-scenes lobbyingcampaign by representatives of the air carriers andairport operators who believe the FAA is going too far.Many on the commercial side of the aviation industryargue that the new measures threaten the economicviability of the industry, and that in the absence of aspecific, credible threat, the additional procedures arenot being implemented in accordance with the criteriaspecified in established contingency plans. Along withindustry complaints, some members of Congress haveweighed in on the debate, questioning the basis for therecommendations of the FAA security experts.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996Aviation Security: New Measures Needed to Meet the NewCentury by Larry C. Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part IIAssessing the ThreatUnfortunately, the wrong question is being asked. Weshould be less concerned about whether or not securityofficials are accurately evaluating new threatinformation and focus instead on whether it is evenappropriate to base an aviation security system on ourability to get accurate, predictive intelligence.Traditionally, an increased threat has been the impetusfor installing new security procedures. This approach isdangerous. Contrary to conventional wisdom, intelligenceagencies rarely get information that permits a policymaker or security official to take preventative action orpredict what a terrorist will do. It is worth noting thatthe vast majority of terrorist attacks againstaviation--most notably the bombings of Pan Am 103 and UTA772--have occurred without advance warning. The recentcapture of Ramzi Yousef in the Philippines just before helaunched an attack against airliners flying across thePacific was a rare exception, and that happened mostly byluck. Usually, accurately predicting the weather inOklahoma next year is far easier than accuratelypredicting if there will be a terrorist attack inOklahoma City.The inadequacy of intelligence as a foundation fordetermining the appropriate security levels in the UnitedStates has become more difficult because the groups nowresponsible for most terrorist activity around the worldare not easily penetrated by traditional intelligencemethods. With the end of the Cold War the threat hasshifted away from national liberation movements to groupsaffiliated with extremist religious organizations. Weneed only recall the bombing of the World Trade Center,the nerve gas attacks in the Tokyo subway, the busbombings In Israel, and the airplane hijacking in Algeriato realize that the culprits are drawn from radicalreligious sects rather than the more familiar Cold Wargroups, such as the Red Army Faction and the Red Brigade.Moreover, going after these groups poses some dauntingcivil rights and legal issues. Is the United Statesprepared to authorize the FBI or the CIA carte blanche tospy on religious organizations? In the wake of Ruby Ridgeand Waco this appears to be an unlikely option. Yet as wenear the dawn of the 21st century, we are likely to seemore, not fewer, radical groups who believe that they areagents of some deity to bring to pass a divine judgmentor retribution on a wicked world.Instead of waiting for a spy to discover a terrorist plotand pass this information on to the appropriateauthorities, the aviation security system should bedesigned to prevent acts and deter threats. Failure toimplement such a system can have disastrous results. TheDecember 1994 hijacking of an Air France flight fromAlgeria is a case in point. Anyone who has monitored thefront page of a major newspaper during 1994 would recallthat Algeria has been wracked for several years by a waveof terrible terrorist violence. Much of this violence hasbeen carried out by radical Islamic groups bent onousting a secular government. Notwithstanding theviolence, the French adopted the traditional approach toaviation security by relying on Algerian authorities tomaintain the appropriate level of security. This approachleft 170 passengers and crew vulnerable to the eventsthat ensued on December 24.Four hijackers affiliated with the Armed Islamic Groupdisguised themselves as airport security officials andoverwhelmed the Air France crew. After killing threepassengers, including a French citizen, the hijackerswere allowed to take off and subsequently land inMarseilles, France, on December 26. As the situationcontinued to deteriorate, French commandos stormed theplane, rescued the passengers and crew, and killed thehijackers. The world was aghast when it learned thehijackers had placed explosives on board the plane,intending to blow it up in the air over Paris. Only inthe aftermath of this narrowly averted aerial kamikazeassault on Paris did French security officials tightensecurity on flights between Algeria and France and asserttheir right to monitor Algerian and the airlinecompliance.The world can no longer run the risk, as did France inAlgeria, of a security system hastily put together inreaction to specific incidents. During the late 1960s andearly 1970s a surge aircraft hijackings within the UnitedStates prompted the introduction of walk-through metaldetectors at US airports. Requiring pre-board securityscreening led subsequently to a dramatic reduction ofdomestic hijackings by individuals who had smuggled gunson board aircraft. We did not see a similar decline ininternational hijackings, at least initially, becauseneither the United States nor the airlines couldunilaterally force other countries to adopt thesesecurity measures.Then in the wake of the 1986 hijacking of Pan Am 73,which resulted in the deaths of 22 people and injuries tomore than 125, the FAA tightened security screeningprocedures for US air carriers operating internationally.Since 1986 no US air carriers have been hijacked becausea terrorist defeated the preboard passenger screeningprocess.Coping With Today's ThreatToday we have a sound security system for defeatinghijackings that is rooted in technology--walk throughmetal detectors and x-ray--and relies on human operators.Although a number of systems are coming on the marketthat try to automate this procedure or improve theability of the security personnel to locate a weapon incarry-on baggage, the decisions of human beings stillplay a large role in ensuring that weapons are notcarried on board an airplane. In the case of explosivesdetection, however, the security advantageevaporates--even in the presence of knowledgeablesecurity personnel. Unlike the systems to preventhijackings, there is no comparable technology presentlyavailable for detecting explosives that meets three keycriteria: reasonably priced, reliable, and efficient.Instead of solving the problem with technology, theairline industry is forced to rely on assumptions abouthuman behavior--such as hoping that most people do nothave a death wish and will not wittingly carry a bomb onboard a plane.When the FAA ordered airports and airlines in the UnitedStates to implement new security measures in August ofthis year they were acting preventively. This is anothersign of the improvements the FAA has made in securityoperations since Pan Am 103. Instead of reacting to aspecific threat the FAA is taking into account a varietyof events. Topping the list was the fear of retaliationfrom radical Islamic groups if a guilty verdict wasdelivered in the conspiracy case against Egyptian clericSheik Rahman. Another concern was the threat issued bythe radical Palestinian group Hamas, warning it wouldattack the United States if one of its leaders wasextradited from to Israel. In addition, the FAA believesthe World Trade Center in New York City and the federalbuilding in Oklahoma City have dispelled the notion thatthe United States is domestically immune to the threat ofterrorism. Accordingly, they have decided that there canno longer be one level of security for internationalflights and a lower level for domestic operations.The implications of this decision are enormous and willimpose substantial economic costs on air carriers andairports, which will be passed on to the travelingpublic. But, in our professional judgment, the FAA'saction is warranted and appropriate for the times. Themajor consequence of the FAA decision will be seen in thearea of positive passenger bag match (PPBM). Simply put,PPBM is coming to America.Positive passenger bag match ensures that no baggage willbe carried on a plane unless the passenger that checkedthe bag is also on board. This system has proveneffective in deterring and preventing aircraft bombingson international flights. It has not been useddomestically, however, because air carriers say that theycannot implement the procedure and maintain the samelevel of service. Part of the problem is the enormousvolume of domestic traffic and the short connecting timebetween flights in the hub and spoke system in use today.Keeping passengers and bags together is already adifficult task. Most in the airline industry argue thatPPBM on domestic flights will force a dramatic cutback inthe number of flights and operational efficiency. Yet,industry insiders also concede that if a bomb explodes onboard a domestic flight any opposition to PPBM will bemoot. Moving to PPBM will be costly. According to sourcesin both the FAA and the aviation industry, a recent studyputs the first year cost of implementing PPBM at betweentwo and three billion dollars. While this is a lot ofmoney, it works out to roughly two dollars per passengerper flight. Implementing PPBM would probably remove asmany as three banks of flights per day from the currentten bank system. This will create inconveniences forpassengers and could bankrupt several of the weakercarriers, according to industry officials.Not taking action, however, would be even more costly.Conservative estimates of the bombing of Pan Am 103 putexpenses at close to two billion dollars. The loss of PanAm 103 was a fatal blow to the carrier's viability as acommercial entity. This financial loss does not includethe emotional suffering of those who lost loved ones.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996Aviation Security: New Measures Needed to Meet the NewCentury by Larry C. Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part IIINext Steps to a Secure FutureWe are entering a new era of aviation security that willchange how airlines and airports do business and how youtravel. While the adjustments may not be easy,particularly in the beginning, the results will maketraveling by air more safe in the long run. The choicebefore the US government is whether or not it wants tostrengthen its ability to prevent terrorist acts againstcivil aviation. Because US aviation is a high profiletarget of terrorist threats, and since commercialaviation plays an important role in supporting nationaldefense, the federal government should treat aviationsecurity as part of a national defense strategy. Americancarriers are targeted by terrorists because they have theUS flag on their tails. They are surrogate targets. AndUS commercial air carriers play a key role in US militaryoperations, assisting in the transport of troops ormateriel during national crises. It is, therefore,reasonable for the federal government to view protectingcommercial aviation as a national security issue.Instituting this reform would require significant changesat the Federal level. One approach would be moving thesecurity function currently performed by the FAA to theDepartment of Defense. The responsibility for protectingcommercial airlines should be handled by an AssistantSecretary for Transportation Security. This job wouldhave both international and domestic responsibilities. Inaddition, the federal government should take on the jobof security at airports rather than leaving it up tolocal governments or the private sector. Many foreigngovernments successfully carry out aviation securityfunctions themselves rather than relying on privateindustry, and the United States should do the same.The second step towards better security is eliminatingthe dichotomy between international and domestic securityprocedures. The FAA deserves praise for moving in thisdirection. Unwilling to wait for terrorists to bomb adomestic airliner, the FAA is pursuing a course ofpreventative action by requiring airports and aircarriers operating within the United States to usesecurity procedures comparable to those in place forinternational flights. At the same time, the FAA is goingto need the muscle of the White House and the Secretaryof State to insist that other countries who fly to theUnited States use the same kind of security program thatUS carriers are required to use.This issue--known colloquially as the level playing fieldwithin the aviation industry--is very controversial. Thecontroversy pits US air carriers against the principle ofnational sovereignty. The carriers argue that becausethey must bear the cost of security requirements leviedby the federal government they are put at a competitivedisadvantage vis-a-vis foreign carriers, who do not haveto adopt the same practices. Yet the FAA alone does nothave the political clout to insist that all countriescoming to the United States must follow the sameprocedures. If it tried to enforce this requirement theFAA would find itself in the middle of a huge foreignpolicy wrangle. In fact, several countries have warnedthat they will prohibit the FAA from inspecting theirairports if such a law is passed. Without access to theseairports the FAA will be unable to certify whether or notadequate security procedures are in place to protect USpassengers.This brings us back to the relevance of treating aviationsecurity as a national security priority. Eliminating thegap in security practices and achieving greateruniformity in security standards requires strongerfederal leadership, starting with the president and theCongress.Finally, a critical element in achieving better aviationsecurity is technology. The mission for protectingairliners is very simple: do not let unauthorized peoplewith weapons get on board planes, and do not allow bombson board planes. While there is a technological solutionfor weapons--guns and knives--there is no similartechnological fix for detecting explosives.The two best systems on the market for detectingexplosives at airports are dogs and the COX 5000. MotherNature still has the edge in explosives detection,winning by a nose--a dog's nose. But while they are veryeffective, dogs are not feasible for handling dailyresponsibilities at a high volume airport such asChicago's O'Hare or Los Angeles International.The other option is the CTX 5000, a third generationx-ray computed tomographic (CT) scanner. Similar tomedical CAT scan technology, the CTX 5000 creates a crosssection image of luggage and analyzes it usingsophisticated software, which automatically identifiesexplosives based on their known CT signatures. This isthe only system currently certified by the FAA as anexplosive detection system. One shortcoming of the CTX5000 is its relatively slow processing speed for bags.Efficiency could be improved dramatically by using theseunits in combination with the airlines' computerrservation systems to identify passengers whose luggageneeds more scrutiny. The FAA is funding the developmentand testing of a computer reservations system that couldbe used in conjunction with other security technologies.Experts agree that presently there are no availabletechnologies that can be installed in airports that arereasonably priced, efficient, and reliable. Achieving atechnological solution to the threat of explosives isfeasible but will require a refocused effort. The currentresearch program under the auspices of the FAA'sTechnical Center is spending only $37 million annually tofind a single technology that can meet the operationalrequirements of airlines and the security standards ofthe FAA. Finding this silver bullet has been an elusiveprey and more difficult task than anyone imagined.A study commissioned earlier this year by CongressmenBenjamin Gilman and Lee Hamilton is being conducted bythe General Accounting Office and may provide answers orrecommendations on how to tackle this thorny issue. Oneresource that has been ignored in this technologicalquest is the national laboratory system. Labs such asSandia, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Pacific Northwest arestaffed by scientists and engineers well suited tolooking for answers to these types of questions.Unfortunately they have not yet been brought to bear onthis issue.We are moving into a new era of better aviation security.Because of hard lessons learned from previous terroristand criminal attacks the government and industry arebetter prepared and in the best position ever to confrontthe current threat. Yet the current system is flawed andadditional changes are needed. As the number ofcommercial flights continue to expand, the number ofpassengers increase, and the next generation of aircraftare deployed, the vulnerability of the system toexplosives will increase rather than diminish if newtechnology is not developed. During the waning years ofthe twentieth century, finding a solution to the threatof explosives will preoccupy government and airlinesecurity officials. It is an area requiring far greatereffort on the part of federal authorities.Larry Johnson is Vice President for Security Operationsat BGI, Inc., an international consulting firm inArlington, VA.

Mere mention of the word evokes dread. It seemsyou can't turn on the television or pick up a newspaperanymore without reading about a crisis somewhere. Theycan happen anywhere, from faraway countries to thebusiness around the corner. Yet, crises can be avoided.Those on the far side of the world may be beyond ourcontrol, but if something happens to your business, it'syour responsibility to solve it. The key is to developand implement a well-defined crisis management program.With one in place, business leaders can mitigate thepotentially disastrous effects of any incident.Management is never put more strongly to the test than ina crisis situation. The objectives are immediate and soare the results. What you and those around you do--ordon't do--will have lasting implications. Today,individuals responsible for the management of businessesand public agencies must deal effectively withincreasingly complex laws and issues or face theconsequences.What if...? You came to your office for the beginning ofyour work week and because of some unforseen event therewere no employees, no working telephones, no functioningcomputers, no utilities. You're the chief executive. Whatwould you do? Where would you start? Unquestionably thisis a crisis. Remember, you have access to almost none ofyour regular business tools.If this had been an actual incident, such as manybusinesses experienced during the Chicago flood in April1992, it would already have been too late to concernyourself with developing a crisis management program!You've got to have a program in place to ensurecontinuity of operations. But, what kind of CrisisManagement Program? To answer this question you mustfirst define the crisis.A crisis can be defined as any unplanned event,occurrence or sequence of events that has a specificundesirable consequence.Natural disasters, financial manipulation, societaldisruption, pollution, and stringent regulations are buta few examples of potential crisis situations. Thereasons for focusing on these issues may result from acommitment to protect the public, your employees, tocomply with government regulations or to protect the firmfrom possible liabilities and litigation. Theconsequences for not focusing on these issues can bedisastrous.Ask yourself why do we need a crisis management programwith an "all hazards" approach? Put simply, such aprogram allows you to provide for:* Effective coordination of activities among theorganizations having a management/response role* Early warning and clear instructions to all concernedif a crisis occurs * Continued assessment of actual andpotential consequences of the crisis* Continuity of business operations during andimmediately after the crisisA brief synopsis of the common weaknesses in crisismanagement planning may prove helpful. As you read thediscussion on the four basic elements, keep theseweaknesses in mind. You may also want to assess yourcurrent crisis management program against theseweaknesses. The most common weaknesses in crisismanagement planning are:* No systematic collection of planning information. Thisincludes such aspects as hazard analysis, organizationalinformation, regulatory guidance, company policyprocedures and location-specific data.* No systematic dissemination of planning information.You've assembled a wealth of information and have notshared it with the effected population--those whoseresponsibility it is to implement the plan.* Failure to identify and establish an incident commandstructure. This is a common pitfall as many planners tryto fit their organization into a standard incidentcommand system not designed around their particularneeds.* Minimal coordination with effected entities. Poorcommunications with the community, neighboringindustries, and identified support entities (fire,police, hospitals, etc.) can lead to confusion and chaosduring an emergency. A simple oversight, such as failureto designate a primary contact for offsite agenciesduring an emergency, can cause major disruption during anincident.* Lack of, or poorly defined, organizationalresponsibilities. Failure to provide clear, conciseprocedures defining a person's functions, duties, andtasks upon assuming their emergency organizationposition. This weakness can lead to fingerpointing--"It's not my responsibility!"--"I thought itwas yours!"* Once developed, the program is poorly maintained. Yourprogram was developed to meet a regulatory requirement.Why should you test it? You're not planning on having anyaccidents! Often, there is no provision for continuedevaluation and periodic update of the material.Frequently, changed material, such as telephone numbersare buried in various paragraphs throughout the plan.* The material you developed is not user-friendly. Yourplan contains information--lots of it. Unfortunately, theuser has to be a brain surgeon to figure out his/her rolein its implementation. You did not provide simple,easy-to-use supplemental materials that can be used as aquick reference guide during an emergency. Worse yet, youdidn't train anyone on the plan and their role in itsimplementation.* You did not disseminate the plan to the properauthorities. Failure to include appropriate parties onthe distribution list most often leads to failure ontheir part to respond in the manner you had hoped for.The PlanYou may think that it is too difficult and time consumingto develop a cohesive crisis management program. However,when broken down into its basic elements, a plan consistsof only four parts. These are:*Compliance*Preparedness*Training*Information ManagementAlthough no two crisis management programs are exactlyalike, these are the critical aspects of any plan. Wewill discuss each of these aspects briefly.COMPLIANCEHow do you reduce the vulnerability posed by potentialcrises? A system that will advise you of the initiativesto be addressed is needed. This will allow you to act ina responsible manner to fulfill the purpose and intent ofexisting legislation.It can also provide a framework for anticipating futurelegislation. An effective system for compliance can bedeveloped only if you know what laws and regulationspertain to your operation. In order to accomplish thistask, a survey of all operations should be undertaken.The survey should include:*General Administrative Information*Management Awareness and Control Programs*Identification of Hazards/Potential Crises*Business CharacterizationThe ultimate benefits to be gained from this type ofsurvey are in terms of identifying areas in need ofattention, establishing a list of potential crisissituations, determining what commitments you arecomfortable with, and documenting current efforts. Oncethe survey program has been developed and implemented, itmust be evaluated and kept up-to-date. This can beaccomplished by reviewing actual responses, and byconducting a detailed audit of each element of thebusiness.The survey program is the initial step, toward reducingvulnerability. Next, you must organize the operation. Themanagement chain is critical to this process. You mustensure that all levels of management become part of theprogram. This can be achieved in several ways:* Make a senior manager directly responsible to topmanagement and the board of directors. The formalassignment of a senior manager to the position of "CrisisManagement Programs, Director," or some other appropriatetitle, can accomplish the initial portion of this item.Additionally, you will want to establish within theindividual's job description some measurement standard toevaluate performance. This goes both ways. Uppermanagement has to take responsibility for developingmeasurable and attainable goals for the Program Directorto achieve.* Set aside specific time for reports on crisismanagement preparedness issues. This can be accomplishedby preparing an agenda for senior staff and board ofdirector meetings that includes a discussion of crisismanagement preparedness as a mandatory item. You have togive it more than lip service, though. Also, you mustmake the discussion substantive. Provide more than thedull and tiring statistics on reportable accidents, etc.Include all levels of personnel in the presentationprocess. This can be very effective and it gets themessage out to all personnel that your company is seriousabout crisis management preparedness.* Make crisis management planning issues part of thestrategic planning process. In one aspect, governmentregulations are defining strategic implications forcompanies. Additionally, for publicly held companies,Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), in the section ofthe annual report entitled, "Management Analysis andDiscussion," requires a discussion of potentialliabilities. Another perspective on this issue reallybegets changing the "corporate culture," i.e., makingcrisis management preparedness a part of the way you dobusiness.* Communicate compliance through all levels of theorganization using company policy and procedures. Thiscan be accomplished through formal adoption of policy atthe highest levels of the company. Generally, this willrequire the approval of the Board of Directors. It isessential, however, that companies become more aware oftheir responsibilities in these areas--and this is oneway to build the awareness.This discussion is limited by the space available to abrief highlight of some approaches that can beundertaken. Each company will find its situation andcircumstances to be unique to its corporate culture.Whatever the case, however, an in-depth analysis of yourcompany's operating environment should be undertakenbefore developing a program or attempting to address theabove items.PREPAREDNESSPreparedness used in the broadest context means any andall measures taken to prevent, prepare for, respond,mitigate, and recover from a crisis. It's with thisperspective that we begin to breakdown the aspect ofpreparedness. There are four critical aspects:*Preparation and Prevention*Detection and Classification*Response and Mitigation*Reentry and Recovery*Preparation and Prevention: Any set of activities thatprevent a crisis, reduce the chance of a crisishappening, or reduce the damaging effects of a crisis.Preparation and prevention activities include, but arenot limited to:* Development and implementation of the crisis managementprogram* Development and implementation of crisis managementplan implementing procedures* Development and implementation of crisismanagement/response training*Detection and Incident Classification: Actions taken toidentify, assess, and classify the severity of a crisis.Detection and classification activities include, but arenot limited to:* Activation of crisis management systems* Activation of crisis management plan implementingprocedures * Activation of the crisis management/responseorganization*Response and Mitigation: Actions taken to save lives,prevent further damage and reduce the effects of thecrisis. Response and mitigation activities include, butare not limited to:* Crisis management/response organization operations* Affiliated crisis management/response organizations'operations * Continuity of business operations*Reentry and Recovery: Actions taken to return to anormal or an even safer situation following the crisis.Reentry and recovery activities include, but are notlimited to:* Activation of the reentry and recovery organization* Coordination with affiliated recovery organizations* Activation of the reentry and recovery planTRAINING AND RETRAININGTraining of personnel is the third component of the "allhazards" approach. The training of the crisismanagement/response organization is one of the criticalsuccess factors that must be addressed if an adequateresponse is to be achieved. The development of thecompliance program, involvement of all levels ofmanagement, and establishing preparedness is only part ofthe overall process. To ensure an adequate response, atrained organization is required. A "systems" approach topreparing effective training programs should consist of:Task Analysis: When designing an integrated trainingprogram, first determine the skills, knowledge, andprocedures required for satisfactory performance of eachtask.Lesson Development: Learning objectives are defined fromthe skills, knowledge, and procedures developed duringtask analysis. Instructional plans are then prepared tosupport the learning objectives.Instruction: Lessons are systematically presented usingappropriate instructional methods. Instruction mayinclude lecture, self-paced or group-paced mediatedinstruction, simulation, and team training.Evaluation: Performance standards and evaluation criteriaare developed from the learning objectives. Eachtrainee's performance is evaluated during the course andduring field performance testing.In addition to the formal training program, a program ofproficiency demonstration is also needed. This can beaccomplished by establishing a program that supplementsthe training with drills and exercises. The drill programcan vary in degree of complexity.INFORMATION MANAGEMENTThe need to establish and maintain an ongoing dynamiccrisis management program is essential. The crisismanagement process doesn't end just because you finishedthe crisis management plan, are in compliance, haveinvolved management, and trained the staff.In order to facilitate planning requirements, a record ofall initiatives should be retained. These records serveto document the accomplishments, requirements,commitments, and reports relating to various programrequirements. The identification of commitments in theareas of compliance, emergency preparedness, and trainingis vital. The establishment of a defined informationmanagement system structure will ensure thatdocumentation will be available when needed.Senior management must be kept well-informed. Informationis a corporate asset. Information is expensive and itmust be shared and managed effectively. Informationmanagement is also critical during a crisis. The need foractive systems to provide information on materials,personnel, capabilities information on materials,personnel, capabilities, and processes is essential. Itis extremely important to have a system (and adequateback-up systems) in place that serves to identify,catalog, set priorities, and track issues and commitmentsrelating to crisis management and response activities.ConclusionIn almost every instance of successful response to acrisis, management and response activities consisting ofsound operating execution, coupled with superiorcommunication, predominate. Operational response isessential. It saves lives, property, and other assets.The ability to communicate is no less important. It savesthe business.The simple fact is: perception is reality. Publicperception of your company's reaction to a crisis is asimportant as your operating response. Lessons learned incrises ranging from Three Mile Island nuclear crisis tothe Exxon Valdez oil spill validate the need for adynamic crisis management program.Trust and confidence in the abilities of middle levelmanagement must be established. "How well have my peopleprepared?" This question can only be answeredsatisfactorily if you have established a level of trustand confidence, can communicate risk, and are willing toallow these managers to practice upward management--thatis to delegate up. They must have the ability torecognize needs and have a process in place that allowsthem to delegate up without fear of repercussions.Few crises will be as dramatic as Three Mile Island orthe Valdez ... unless it is your own. When your crisisoccurs, the hardest part of dealing with it can involveanswering the public call for information--a callpersonified by a television correspondent or newspaperreporter who shows up at your doorstep or on yourtelephone line to get the story. How well you responddepends on how well you are prepared.Geary W. Sikich is the author of Emergency ManagementPlanning Handbook, published by McGraw Hill.

Various political, military, and diplomaticoptions first come to mind, but there is one that is moresuccessful--the Counterterrorism Rewards Program of theDiplomatic Security Service of the US Department ofState. Over the years this program has resulted in theprevention of numerous terrorist attacks as well as theapprehension of some of the world's most infamousterrorists.The Counter-Terrorism Rewards Program was established in1984 by the Act to Combat International Terrorism, PublicLaw 98-533. In 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Securitywas legislatively mandated to administer the programunder Public Law 99-399, the Omnibus Diplomatic Securityand Anti-Terrorism Act. While the Bureau of DiplomaticSecurity is responsible for the day to day operations ofthe program, it does so with policy guidance from theOffice of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism.Under the Rewards Program, individuals approach the StateDepartment with information regarding planned terroristattacks or details about past incidents.  If adetermination is made that the information provided isuseful, the cooperating individual will be given amonetary reward. Rewards totaling millions of dollarshave been paid in more than twenty cases. Innocent liveshave been saved and terrorists have been apprehended,arrested, and put behind bars.These rewards are substantial. While the programinitially offered rewards up to $500,000, the maximum hassince been increased to $2 million. The only exception tothis is in the case of information provided that preventsan attack against US civil aviation. In this case,matching gifts raise the rewards to as high as $4million.In addition to providing monetary rewards, the StateDepartment can also help the cooperating individuals andtheir immediate family members relocate to a safecountry.  If the individuals choose to come to the UnitedStates, they can be afforded protection by the Bureau ofDiplomatic Security or placed into the US MarshalsService Federal Witness Security Program, depending onthe specific situation.Interagency Rewards CommitteeThe Director of the Diplomatic Security Service chairs aninteragency committee that identifies reward candidatesand recommends rewards to the Secretary of State. Thiscommittee, known as the Interagency Rewards Committee, iscomprised of representatives from the White HouseNational Security Council staff, the Central IntelligenceAgency, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, theUS Marshals Service Witness Security Program, theImmigration and Naturalization Service, the FederalAviation Administration, the Department of Energy, andthe Department of State.The Interagency Rewards Committee is tasked withdetermining which terrorist incidents merit inclusion inthe Program and the amounts that will be paid forspecific information. The Counterterrorist RewardsProgram is currently offering rewards for informationleading to the apprehension or capture of terrorists whoare responsible for some of the most deadly terroristattacks against both America and the internationalcommunity. These attacks include:*The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 - on December 21, 1988,terrorists destroyed Pan American flight 103 while it wasoverflying Lockerbie, Scotland. The aircraft carried 259citizens from 30 nations, including 189 Americans.Another 11 citizens of Lockerbie perished on the groundfrom the falling debris.*The bombing of the World Trade Center - on February 26,1993, a terrorist vehicle bomb detonated under the WorldTrade Center in New York City. This attack killed sixinnocent people, injured over 1,000 others, and trappedterrified school children in a smoke-filled elevator forhours.*The AK-47 assault at CIA Headquarters - on January 25,1993, Mir Aimal Kansi allegedly murdered two people andseriously injured three others by firing an AK-47 assaultrifle into cars waiting at a stoplight near a gate theCIA headquarters in Virginia.*The hijacking of TWA Flight 847 - on June 13, 1985terrorists from Hizballah hijacked TWA Flight 847. Duringa violent rampage against passengers and crew, they beatNavy Seabee Robert Stethem to death, then dumped his deadbody onto the tarmac.*The bombing of TWA Flight 840 - on April 2, 1986, a bombdetonated inside the passenger cabin of TWA Flight 840,killing nine-month-old Demetra Stylian Klug, giving herthe distinction of being one of the youngest victims ofinternational terrorism.*The kidnapping and murder of Americans in Lebanon -During the 1980s, kidnapped American citizens were heldhostage in various locations throughout Lebanon. For longand painful years, they were chained in the dark, beaten,and denied medical care. Three were murdered during theircaptivity.These incidents represent some of the worst terroristattacks directed against the United States and theinternational community. As such, it is only fitting thatthe Rewards Program be used to see that the partiesresponsible for the attacks are brought to justice.Rewards Program Successes: An Emphasis on PreventionDuring the first four years of the program, the StateDepartment offered specific rewards for informationleading to the arrest or conviction of those responsiblefor specific terrorist attacks. After the bombing of PanAm 103 in December 1988, however, new emphasis was placedon provisions of the law which allowed for payment ofrewards in cases where information led to the"prevention, frustration, or favorable resolution ofterrorist attacks against United States persons."Specific reward amounts for particular terroristincidents were no longer announced.  Instead, theSecretary of State was authorized to pay for informationregarding any past, present, or planned future act ofterrorism. This policy reaped benefits during OperationDesert Storm, during which the Rewards Program washeavily publicized.At the start of the Persian Gulf War, an informant in anEast Asian country came forward with alarming informationabout a series of terrorist attacks planned by the Iraqiintelligence service. The terrorists had already surveyedtheir intended targets and acquired automatic weapons,grenades, and high explosives for the attack. Theassaults  were beyond the planning stage and about to becarried out.One of the attacks, a planned terrorist bombing andmachine-gunning of airline ticket counters at a majorairport, was scheduled to be carried out within 48 hours.The cooperating individual provided information which wasessential in thwarting the attacks.  As a result of thetimely receipt of this intelligence information, theterrorists were stopped by the efforts of US and hostnation authorities. Had the planned attacks proceeded asplanned, many Americans and citizens of our coalitionpartners would certainly have been murdered.The informant and immediate family were relocated to asafe location within the United States and given a rewardof approximately $500,000 for coming forward andproviding information that saved lives.Pan Am Flight 103 InvestigationIn the course of the Pan Am 103 investigation, forensicevidence came to light that indicated that Libya wasbehind the attack. In November of 1991, indictments wereissued for two Libyans who allegedly routed the suitcasecontaining the bomb through the baggage system in Malta.The two suspects, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel BassetAl-Megrahi, were allegedly Libyan intelligence agents whoworked undercover for Libyan Arab Airlines at the airportin Malta.In 1990, a Libyan by the name of Abu Maged Jiachadefected to the United States.  Jiacha claimed to workwith the two Pan Am 103 bombing suspects at the airportin Malta. He claims to have had knowledge of their bombplans and is believed to have provided investigators withFhimah's diary which allegedly contains a handwrittennotation linking him to the attack.While Jiacha has been said to have provided informationon the Pan Am 103 case to the US government, it isunclear if this was done through the Rewards Program.However, he is currently a government witness in theFederal Witness Security Program. While the two Pan Am103 bombing suspects remain in Libya, there is littledoubt that Jiacha will play an important role in anyfuture criminal trial. When that trial may occur isanyone's guess.World Trade Center BombingOn February 26, 1993, international terrorists launched abombing attack in downtown Manhattan. A large improvisedexplosive device concealed in a cargo van was detonatedin the subterranean garage of the 110-story World TradeCenter complex. It was later learned from one of thecaptured terrorists that the intention of the bombing wasto collapse one or both of the twin towers with hopes ofkilling tens of thousands of innocent people.Fortunately, the terrorists did not succeed.  However,the bomb did destroy the underground parking facility andresulted in the death of six innocent people and injuriesto over 1,000 others.  Some of the victims in this attackwere young school children who had been visiting theTrade Center on a class field trip. As smoke from theexplosion billowed upwards, the terrified children weretrapped in one of the tower's elevator for hours.Some of the terrorists suspected of involvement of theWorld Trade Center bombing were quickly apprehended butothers managed to avoid capture. Suspected terroristsAbdul Rahman Yasin and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef fled the UnitedStates following the bombing. After indictments wereissued for the two, the United States launched a massiveinternational manhunt for the fugitives. Wanted postersoffering up to $2 million rewards for information leadingto their capture were distributed in a variety oflanguages. Multi-language leaflets containing the rewardoffers were also sent throughout the world. Evenmatchbooks containing photos of the fugitives weredistributed.In early February, a South African student living inPakistan approached security officials at the US embassyand told them that he knew where Ramzi Ahmed Yousef washiding. Yousef was immediately put under 24-hoursurveillance to ensure that he would not manage to escapea second time. On February 8, 1995 American and Pakistaniauthorities moved in on and arrested Yousef. He wasquickly extradited to the United States, where he iscurrently awaiting trial in a New York City detentionfacility.  It is believed that the student tipped offAmerican authorities after he had seen a Rewards Programmatchbook with Yousef's photo.Before his arrest in Pakistan, Yousef was busy planningand carrying out terrorist attacks in Asia. He isallegedly responsible for the bombing of PhilippineAirlines flight 434 which resulted in the death of26-year-old Japanese engineer Haruki Ikegama. This attackwas reportedly a trial run for a simultaneous bombingattack on eleven American air carriers operating in thePacific Rim. Fortunately, Yousef was forced to flee thePhilippines before the attack could be carried out.Four Million Reasons to prevent TerrorismWhile the Counterterrorism Rewards Program has certainlyenjoyed a number of successes over the years, not all ofthe details of these successes are publicly available.The reason for this is that in order for the program toremain successful, it must continue to attract people whohave a knowledge of the activities of the terroristunderworld. In order for these people to come forward,they must be assured of complete confidentiality toprevent any possible retaliation against them or theirfamilies.  The result of this necessary secrecy is thatthe work of the security specialists who work on theCounterterrorism Rewards Program often goes unnoticed.According to Diplomatic Security Special Agent BradSmith, who administers the program, the lack ofrecognition can sometimes be frustrating. However, he hasbeen  pleased with the public recognition that theprogram has received.  In fact, Smith was recentlyhonored by Tom Brokaw for the work that he has done overthe years to build and nurture the Rewards Program.In 1990, the State Department forged a uniquepublic-private partnership with the Air TransportAssociation of America and the Air Line PilotsAssociation, International. Each organization has agreedto pledge up to $1 million to supplement the existing $2million reward paid by the US government for informationthat prevents a terrorist act against US civil aviationor leads to the arrest and conviction of any person whohas committed such an act.  This has resulted in amaximum reward of up to $4 million in such cases.This supplemental program came about largely through thejoint efforts of Special Agent Brad Smith and former PanAmerican Airline pilot Bruce Smith (no relation). CaptainSmith, whose wife Ingrid was killed in the Pan Am flight103 bombing, decided to immediately accept Pan American'ssettlement offer of $100,000. He tried to convince otherfamily members who lost loved ones to do likewise so thatthey could pool their money to offer a substantial rewardfor the capture of the responsible parties. Unfortunatelyfor Captain Smith, few families followed suit.After this minor setback, Smith undertook efforts tolobby the Bush administration and airline tradeorganizations to strengthen the Rewards Program. Smithapproached the Air Line Pilot's Association and the AirTransport Association and convinced them to each pledgeup to $1 million to supplement the existing $2 milliongovernment reward. The reward of $4 million was to beused in the Pan Am 103 case and other cases involvingterrorist attacks against civil aviation. This $4 millionreward level remains in effect today.The US government's standing reward offer of up to $2million applies in all cases not addressed by this uniquepartnership agreement. However, Captain Smith and hisattorney Mark Zaid are currently undertaking efforts toexpand the government partnership with private sectorfunding sources through the newly created, not-for-profitFoundation to Combat International Terrorism. Thefoundation's main goal would be to provide grants tosupplement the rewards distributed by the RewardsProgram. This would allow the $4 million award level tobe offered outside the sphere of civil aviation andhopefully entice more people to come forward with usefulinformation.According to Zaid, the foundation was created in order toexpand upon the current Rewards Program activities in anumber of areas. For instance, Zaid explained that theFoundation could assist in publicizing the RewardsProgram in key countries and regions without some of thepolitical constraints that currently restrain US efforts.In addition, the foundation would also assist by allowingthe program to provide rewards to those states whichcooperate by providing timely intelligence information tothe United States that prevents terrorist activity. Atthe present, states are not eligible to receive rewardsfor information under the Rewards Program.However, the Foundation to Combat International Terrorismhas met with some resistance within certain offices ofthe State Department. Elements within the Bureau ofDiplomatic Security support the concept and goals of theFoundation and have actively supported the idea.Opposition to the foundation has come primarily from theOffice of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, headed byAmbassador Philip Wilcox.In a letter to Mark Zaid dated October 16, AmbassadorWilcox and Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic SecurityAnthony Quainton wrote that the State Department hasdecided not to work with the Foundation because of the"possible appearance of conflict of interest."However, this is merely an excuse given to de-emphasizethe real reason for State's decision not to becomeinvolved in the Foundation's work. According to theletter, Wilcox and Quainton explain that "even as aseparate legal entity the Foundation cannot effectivelybe distinguished from your own activities." This is areference to Zaid's work to revise the Foreign SovereignImmunity law which currently protects state sponsors ofterrorism from legal action by individual United Statescitizens. Zaid and others are trying to get changes tothe law which would allow for Americans who have been thevictim of state-sponsored terrorism to have recoursethrough the US legal system. The State Department is notin favor of such revisions to the Sovereign Immunity lawbecause it would effectively undermine State's ability tomanage foreign relations, a power which it jealouslyguards.Efforts to Publicize the Rewards ProgramThe State Department maintains an ongoing public affairscampaign to promote greater awareness of the RewardsProgram. This campaign includes efforts to both informthe American public about the Rewards Program as well asto disseminate information regarding available rewards tothose who might have information. Towards these ends,advertisements have been placed to promote the program ina variety of media. Print ads in English, Arabic,Spanish, French, German, and Russian have appeared inpublications as diverse as The New York Times, Al Hayat,Paris Match, Die Welt, and Pravda. Additionally, publicservice announcements featuring entertainmentpersonalities Charlton Heston, Charles Bronson, andCharlie Sheen have been widely distributed.Charlton Heston  "... Real life heroes are ordinarypeople who do extraordinary things for their fellowman--like warning of acts of political violence thatcould endanger innocent lives!"Charles Bronson "... Persons with information about anact of terrorism can be a hero by saving innocent lives.The US government, along with associations of pilots andairlines, is offering up to $4 million dollars for suchinformation."Charlie Sheen  "... Confidentiality and protection can beassured for these heroic people. Are you the next hero?"In 1994, the Counterterrorism Rewards Program also wenton the Internet. The global reach of the Internet isideal for distributing information about the RewardsProgram. According to Special Agent Smith, "severalthousand" messages from people from 68 countries havebeen sent to the HEROES electronic mailbox. The addressfor the Heroes electronic mailbox is: heroes@clark.net.At around the same time, the Rewards Program alsolaunched a site on the Internet's World Wide Web. Thisformat is useful for the HEROES page because it allowsthe State Department to include text about the program,sound clips of some of the radio and television spots,and photos of the wanted terrorists. According to SpecialAgent Smith, over 250,000 people have downloadedinformation from the Heroes World Wide Web site. The URLfor the Heroes Web site is:http://www.clark.net/pub/heroes/.Of course, the Counterterrorism Rewards Program can alsobe contacted through more traditional channels as well.Anyone who has information that could be of use by theDiplomatic Security Service can call a number which isstaffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by StateDepartment security personnel. That number is:1-800-HEROES-1  [1-800-437-6371].The Rewards Program can also be contacted by mail at :HEROES, P.O.

Although overshadowed by theblast at the Oklahoma City Federal Center, the WorldTrade Center bombing illustrates the seriousness of theproblem. Unfortunately, it is no longer feasible to relyon past experiences with terrorism as a guide toimplementing future policy. Recent world events have soaltered Middle Eastern terrorism that we now face apotentially more dangerous adversary that requires us torethink and formulate new tactics and strategies.Out with the OldThe breakup of the Soviet Union deprived the tightlyorganized, centrally directed, and usually secularnetworks of sophisticated Middle Eastern terrorists ofmoney, weapons, and safe-havens. Aid from Eastern Europedried up as well. Even Syria and Libya, also traditionalsources of money and weaponry, have been lying lowknowing that they can no longer get backing in anyconfrontation with the United States from a Soviet Blocthat no longer exists.Yasser Arafat himself contributed to the decline in theold terrorism by making the tactical mistake of sidingwith Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. After the Iraqidefeat, Arafat could no longer expect his PalestinianLiberation Organization (PLO) to be the recipient of aform of protection money from the rich and vulnerable oilstates. Just at the same time the oil money stoppedflowing, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency(UNRWA) cut much-needed financial aid to Palestinianrefugees in the occupied territories. With financialsupport on the decline, Arafat's competition, Hamas (theviolent wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement) steppedup its campaign to discredit his leadership. It is evenarguable that Arafat's troubles moved him to the peacetable with Israel before any fall from power.The Gulf War also crippled Iraq's worldwide network ofterrorist's activities. Add to this the demise of aterrorist network run from Tripoli and coordinated byso-called diplomats operating out of Libyan embassiesaround the world. Cuba, Syria, and Algeria also withdrewfrom openly encouraging and supporting terrorists. Inshort, these traditional actors and sponsors of terrorismare either so damaged that they have no alternative butto withdraw from their activities or are trying tocultivate a new, more diplomatic image.Credit is also due to the efforts of Americanintelligence agencies and other foreign groups in theirproactive counterterrorist activities. These agencieswere instrumental in curtailing the activities of manyterrorist groups like the Red Army faction in Germany andthe Red Brigades in Italy. These left-wing groups weresupportive of the PLO and other secular terrorist groups.In With the NewA new support center for terrorism in Iran emerged afterAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini toppled the Shah in 1979.Iran immediately set out to export and finance it'smilitant fundamentalist message throughout the Muslimworld. It supported militant Islamic fundamentalistmovements in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, and Sudan.The impoverished Sudan provided Iran with its firstsuccess. Nearly a decade after the Iranian revolution agroup of military officers and mullahs seized power inSudan installing the first Sunni Muslim republic. SheikHassan al-Turabi, the Sorbonne-educated spiritual leaderof Sudan's Sunni Muslims, offered an olive branch to theShiite Muslims of Iran. The charismatic Turabi iscommitted to ending the bitter historic enmity that hasseparated Sunni and Shiite since the seventh century. Hehas already been successful in bringing to Khartoum aseries of summit-type meetings with a variety of militantIslamic fundamentalist groups and terrorist leaders.Together these leaders have endorsed a terroristmanifesto containing Machiavellian prescripts foradvancing militant Islamic fundamentalism.The Shiite Muslim republic of Iran and it's Sunni Muslimallies in Sudan have pooled their resources. Togetherthey hope to "Islamize" the Muslim world while embarkingon a systematic campaign of sponsoring internationalterrorism. The linchpin of this partnership is oil-richIran which supplies the finances, arms, and trainers fromthe Revolutionary Guards and the secret army unit knownas Quds Force. Sudan's contributions to the partnershipinclude sanctuaries for terrorists and a series ofterrorist camps maintained by Sudan's Popular DefenseForces (a quasi-military body modeled after Iran'sRevolutionary Guards).The New TerroristTypically, young, uneducated, and unskilled, the newterrorists come to these Sudanese camps directly from alife of poverty and repression. They enter with a strongbelief in Islam as the way out of their dismal socialsituation. Their militant Islamic fundamentalism isreinforced by Islamic radicals versed in Koranic studiesand terrorist tactics they learned when fightingalongside the mujaheddin in Afghanistan. Unfortunately,the decade-long war against communism waged by themujaheddin in fighters turned Afghanistan into a bootcamp for terrorists. Many of the Islamic radicals whowent to do battle against the Soviets wound up experts inbomb-making and other terrorist tactics. Thesetroublemakers are now training other Islamic recruits interrorist camps throughout Sudan.Do not be misled into thinking that the absence ofsophisticated training places these students of terror ata disadvantage. Rather, their religious zeal makes themmore dangerous than the secular, often Marxist-inspired,Middle Eastern terrorists of the past. Harder to combatas well. Why? Because they are able to carry out theirterror with more readily available and less-sophisticateddevices. They need not wait for the delivery of high-techexplosives. They need only consult a number of anarchist"cookbooks" for the proper ingredients which are insupply in a wide variety of hardware stores. Look for amixture of nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil rather thanplastic explosives such as Semtex or C-4.Less sophisticated also means less organized than theirsecular predecessors, and consequently more difficult tospot, track, and intercept. In the past, universitieswere not only centers for recruiting terrorists butplaces that provided sanctuary for networks of terroriststo organize and spout their terrorist rhetoric. It ismuch harder for today's law enforcement agencies toinfiltrate groups that are not organized in anysystematic way.The new terrorists are easily inspired by religiousbeliefs and the suggestions of their spiritual leaders.The alleged involvement of the blind cleric, Sheik OmarAbdel Rahman, in the assassination of President AnwarSadat of Egypt and the World Trade Center explosionillustrates the power that a spiritual leader can have onthe actions of these new terrorists. Sheik Rahman'sblindness contributes to his credibility since blindreciters of the Koran are respected in Islamic societiesfor their heightened sensitivity for memorization. It isoften the case that the loss of one sense is compensatedby an increase in another.Inspiration can also lead to freelance terrorism thatoccurs with regularity throughout the Middle East,especially in Israel. We often read of how a Palestinianwith no history of terrorist activity or groupaffiliation randomly stabs or axes an Israeli on thestreets of Tel Aviv. These freelance terrorists aredevoutly religious, highly impressionable, and given tosuggestion. Their acts are almost impossible topredict--except that they are bound to occur given thecall to fanaticism that echoes through the impoverishedsocieties of the Middle East.These new terrorists travel freely throughout the entireMuslim world. They walk the streets of Pakistan andcongregate in the suburbs of Cairo. The World TradeCenter bombing and the aborted plot to bomb a number ofother landmarks in New York should tell us that they arehere with their well-documented penchant for takingmatters into their own hands. We can count on them totake action--and we should understand that they will.What to do?The new world order has already impacted on our locallaw-enforcement agency's ability to protect and serve.Future occurrences in international politics will do thesame. Today's local law enforcement agencies mustconstantly monitor a changing world for potentialterrorism and its likely impact on domestic security.Today's militant Islamic fundamentalists cannot beignored; in fact, it would be wise for all of us tobecome familiar with the aspirations of the more than onebillion Muslims worldwide. We have already witnessed averitable explosion in the number of individualssubscribing to the Islamic faith right here in America.The overwhelming majority of Muslims abhor terrorism.Nevertheless, we must not be afraid to ask questions ofthose who do not. But to make certain that the rightquestions are asked, it makes sense to give our lawenforcement personnel cultural diversity training. Thatway, there will be fewer problems stemming from any lackof understanding. After all, there is no way to getaround the fact that millions of Muslims live in theUnited States or have regular contacts here eitherthrough family or business. Mutual understanding is thefirst step toward countering terrorism.Dr. Harvey W. Kushner is a terrorism expert affiliatedwith the Long Island University Department of CriminalJustice.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996Hidden Crisis: International Crime Imperils SouthAfrica's Security by Edward V. Badolato Part IWhen Nelson Mandela became president of South Africa muchof the world breathed a sigh of relief. Here was a manwho promised a new future to a country long plagued byracial strife and increasing instability. But there isalso a dark side to the bright future, for beneath SouthAfrica's youthful democratic face lurks a potentiallydeadly disease: the specter of organized crime.Of course, this is a scourge that afflicts much of theworld today. International crime organizations operaterelatively freely around the globe, reaping huge profitsfrom the proceeds of their illegal activities and takingadvantage of new technology to insert themselves covertlyinto the machinery of national economies. The World Bankreports that some of these "crime empires" are now worthfar more than the gross domestic products of all theMiddle Eastern and North African countries combined. Theopportunities being presented to international crimeorganizations for worldwide illegal operations aregreater today than they have been since the end of WorldWar II. Over the past five years, international gangshave greatly benefitted from the changes brought about bythe breakup of the Soviet Union, the introduction ofcomputerized international banking and finance, and thegeneral trend toward free trade.In South Africa this trend is particularly apparent.Hiding behind burgeoning local crime, South Africansyndicates are growing larger all the time, a newmanifestation of the problems which have affected theUnited States and the rest of the world in the post-ColdWar period.Like South Africa, the United States has traditionallyfelt that its oceans, great distances, and nationalborders provide separation and safety from internationalcrime. However, the globalization of communications,transportation, trade, and finance has globalized crime.The same conditions and mechanisms that support theexpansion of free markets are just as well suited tobolster the so-called "Four Horsemen of InternationalCrime"--four key criminal activities that have thecapability to wreak havoc with democratic countries.These four corrosive factors are: organized crime, drugs,illicit financial activity, and transportation crime.In South Africa, the recent movement to politicalpluralism, the development of a market economy, and theend of Soviet and Cuban military intervention inneighboring countries have provided a new source of hopefor the Southern African region, but it has also enticedthe world's criminal organizations to take advantage ofthe opportunities that the new situations provide. From aUS perspective, South Africa's dramatic change andprogress over the past several years must not be given upto the international gangs that are currently flocking tosouthern Africa.According to South African Police Services (SAPS)sources, approximately 500 well-armed and financedorganized crime syndicates are now operating in SouthAfrica. These powerful gangs--some domestic, some fromneighboring African countries, and some from the wellknown and powerful international criminalorganizations--are capable of buying and burrowing theirway into public institutions and terrorizing the publicand the South African business community.The majority of South African gangs are involved in drugtrafficking (136), followed by vehicle theft (112), andcommercial crime (85). Police say that the activities ofthe various gangs are closely linked. For example motorvehicle theft, truck hijacking and robbery are linked tothe illegal arms trade in Mozambique, while drugtrafficking is connected with motor vehicle theft inZambia as well as to money laundering and check kitingschemes.The US government has important interests in South Africathat will be adversely affected by the unchecked growthof these international crime syndicates. Americaninterests are essentially based on promoting ademocratic, secure, and prosperous South Africa. SouthAfrica's success in dealing with the various syndicateswill depend partly on reinforcement by the United Statesin countering the insidious actions of internationalcrime organizations--drug smuggling, money laundering,and their illegal theft and trade activities.International Criminal OrganizationsThe world's traditional criminal gangs and mafias aregroups whose primary objective is to gain money and powerby carrying out illegal activities. Organized crimegroups that used to operate only nationally in their owndomestic arena are now forging new global ties and movingbeyond traditional drugs, arms smuggling, andprostitution into new areas such as trade in nucleartechnology, transport of illegal aliens, and moneylaundering.International gangs are estimated to turn over some $750billion a year from drug smuggling and other illegalactivities. Organized crime and the financial frauds theyperpetrate are currently considered to be the mostpervasive and sophisticated threats that businesses mustface. A recent survey of top British executives showedthat 55 percent of respondents said they believe the riskof syndicate fraud will increase in 1995, compared withonly 29 percent who predicted political instability willincrease.What caused this? Largely the decline of border controlsin Europe and the removal of the severe travelrestrictions that once divided Europe between east andwest. Easy access has created opportunities for theworld's major organized crime syndicates in Italy,Russia, and Asia to work with their colleagues in SouthAmerica and the United States to expand into new marketsand to evolve into truly international crimecorporations.Russia. The breakdown of the old Soviet police system andthe lack of centralized control in the new Russia hasallowed over 5,000 criminal syndicates to flourish, oftencombining their efforts with those of the internationalmafia. Russian gangs are complex organizations withinternational criminal connections around the world. Thedanger posed by Russian gangsters has already reached theUnited States. Russians are now frequently apprehendedand put on trial alongside their criminalassociates--members of the US and Italian mafia who,among other crimes, import large amounts of heroin intothe United States.FBI Director Louis Freeh agrees that Russian criminalgangs are "becoming a formidable threat." The FBI hasidentified some 220 Russian gangs now operating in 17 UScities in 14 states. Russian gangs are also establishedin 29 foreign countries and maintain contacts with anestimated 100,000 criminal enterprises around the world.These range from sophisticated technology smuggling toillegal immigrant smuggling rings to child prostitutionrings in China and Southeast Asia. Banks with branches inCyprus are reported to be handling about $1 billion amonth in laundered Russian funds, according to theRussian Central Bank.Actually, the FBI considers that the arrival of Russiangangs is directly related to much of the drug-relatedviolence in urban America. Most Russian gangs initiateoperations in the United States by entering the countryon normal business visas and then stay on illegally whentheir visas expire. The number of Russians entering theUnited States has risen dramatically. In 1988 only 8,000Soviet citizens entered, but in 1994 the number rose to140,000.The FBI is concerned about these large numbers ofRussians entering the country because ongoing criminalcases show that there is a lot of involvement inorganized crime, especially in working with the ItalianMafia to import narcotics. Last year, FBI Director Freehand Russia's top law enforcement officials agreed on acooperative program to combat organized crime, swappinginformation, training and law enforcement personnel--inFreeh's words "a police-to-police bridge."Art collectors, police, and insurers are alsoincreasingly blaming organized crime--especially theRussians and Eastern European gangs--for the rapid growthin fine art theft in Europe. Worldwide, some $3 billionworth of art and valuable objects are currently missing,and much of the cause can be placed on organized crime.Frequently, US sting operations against organized crimegangs recover stolen art among shipments of drugs,contraband, and stolen art.Chinese Triads. China's triads have developed a thrivingexport business that includes trade in people. Chinesegangs may make up to $3.5 billion annually from exportingtheir compatriots searching for a better life at $35,000per head. Chinese Triads have developed a complexinternational network to smuggle their refugees into theUnited States and Europe with major transit points inRussia and Latin America. The Triads have set upoperations in South Africa, and its only a matter of timeuntil they expand their other activities there, includingan interest in South Africa's emerging casino industry.The New Jersey state Casino Control Commission iscurrently investigating the activities of members ofAsian organized crime syndicates and reports that thereis a distinct possibility that the Asian mobsters haveinfiltrated the industry. In typical understatement,police officials have said that Chinese Triad interestsin South Africa have "become more apparent."Taiwan. Not all illegal activity takes place in mainlandChina and Hong Kong. Some opposition leaders in Taiwansay that while their organized crime problems are hardlynew, crime families have gained influence with theblossoming of Taiwan's democracy. The Ministry of Justicereported in late 1994 that one-third of Taiwan's 858elected city and county councilors have criminal records.Japanese Yakuza. The Yakuza, Japan's principal organizedcrime syndicate, has shown a remarkable ability torespond to changing circumstances. After World War II itdid what criminals do best--straight violence. In thelate 1950s, the Yakuza turned to debt collection, and inits next phase, the Yakuza zeroed in on the publicofficials who regulated them. The high-growth 1980slaunched the gangs on a fourth phase of corporateoperations, this time focused on manipulating the stockmarket, bank fraud, and real estate swindles. Thiscurrent Yakuza campaign against the business world ison-going today, and the gangs are growing more and moreclever.Although the Yakuza prefer to operate in a low-keymanner, it is capable of violence, as shown by the 1994murder of Kazufumi Hatanaka, head of the Nagoya branch ofSumitomo Bank. The Sumitomo Bank had been accused ofcutting ethical corners, and there have been a number ofcomplex and questionable financing transactions betweenSumitomo and underworld organizations. The Japanesegovernment has been clamping down on the Yakuza throughthe enforcement of the Organized Crime Law of 1992, butthe gangs have shown that they are extremely difficult toput out of business.Fraud and Money LaunderingEmployee-related fraud in South Africa is on a par withthe worst countries in the world, according to riskinsurers with Lloyd's of London, and it is seen byinternational observers as being as bad as in SouthAmerican countries, such as Colombia. The frequency andsize of fraud claims in South Africa has more thandoubled in the past three years. Some players in thelocal financial markets will no longer provide fidelityguarantee cover--insurance against employee fraud--forfinancial institutions. The increase in fraud claims areblamed on higher stock values, the growing sophisticationof criminal gangs, increased computerization, andpolitical uncertainty. In August 1995 there was a totalof $6 billion in fraud cases under investigation by SAPS,and some risk managers say that this is just the tip ofthe iceberg.It is the sheer volume of money that ties together thevarious forms of international crime and links them allwith legal business. The US Treasury Department estimatesthere is an enormous, several trillion-dollar pool ofmoney that dashes around in what is effectivelyinternational cyberspace, moving by computer in and outof offshore banks and chasing profits in 24-hour markets,all largely beyond the reach of government control. Ofthis total amount, it is estimated that there is between$100 billion and $300 billion of dirty money circling theglobe at any one time, looking for a home, looking tomerge into the legal economy, looking for deals that maybe legal, and some that are not legal.South Africa's banking and financial system has areputation as one of the world's solid professionaloperations--the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is theworld's tenth largest. Yet the emergence of the new SouthAfrica and the transition from the previous government'ssystem of controls and operations has presented someproblems. As South African banks rejoined theinternational business community, they arrived at a timewhen illegal money laundering was at an all time high,and crime syndicate money managers were on the lookoutfor any easy opportunity to launder their cash.Because there was no obligation for South Africanfinancial institutions to report any suspicion of moneylaundering, the banking community learned that it was aprime target for the international crime organization'sfinancial networks. Banks quickly realized that this wasnot a time for business as usual, and they had to reactswiftly to ensure the integrity and ethics of theiroperations.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996Hidden Crisis: International Crime Imperils SouthAfrica's Security by Edward V. Badolato Part IIGlobalized money laundering is a profound challenge tonational sovereignty. Offshore banks and other means oflaundering allow businesses to evade taxes and nationalregulations and provide the money to lubricate thebribery and corruption that makes their activitiespossible. This is a security threat that neither of thetraditional security responses--the legal system andpolice operations--can really meet. Getting the moneylaundering problem under control will require crossborder cooperation and an unprecedented degree ofcooperation between the government and the privatesector.The US dollar is presently the currency of choice for anincreasingly powerful collection of drug lords and theirrogue financial advisors bent on manipulating the globalfinancial order. The financial managers for the top drugcartels, especially the highly skilled money launderersfor the Colombian, Brazilian, and Mexican cartels, aretransferring huge quantities of funds each day around theinternational banking system.In the wake of tough US banking regulations, most drugmoney laundering operations now generally involves one offour methods: first by smuggling profits directly out ofthe country by stashing them in industrial shipments orappliances bound for Latin America where the Cali cartelor their agent can get easy access to the cash. Second,breaking down large amounts of cash into smallerincrements that need not be reported to federalregulators. Third, many laundering operations set upelaborate commercial fronts, washing the money throughcomplex layers of seemingly innocent transactions.Finally, some laundering operations are unbelievablyunsophisticated as they take hundreds of thousands ofdollars to a friendly employee at the bank, fill outdeposit slips and deposit the cash. Recently a Citibankassistant manager in New York was caught cooperating witha worldwide group that has laundered hundreds of millionsin drug money back to Colombia.The US government has been focusing on new technologiesand software programs that can track the flow of money inand out of a country. For example, in the United States,companies and banks must report cash transactions of$10,000 or more. This information is used by the TreasuryDepartment's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network(FINCEN), a financial tracking organization that plays animportant role in combating money laundering crimes, as adatabase to track transactions. Such anti-moneylaundering operations are reported to have driven thecost of laundering US drug proceeds from six percent inthe late 1980s to 26 percent of today's gross profits.This has been borne out by some recent interviews withcaptured drug kingpins who said that it was costing them$260,000 to move each $1 million out of the UnitedStates.However, because the Treasury Department concluded thatsome of the record-keeping and reporting rules in placeto stop money laundering were bureaucratic andineffective, and sharp cuts have been made in theinformation that banks must keep on large ($10,000 andabove) cash transactions. This is not giving thelaunderers a free ride, because at the same time theyremoved much of the bureaucratic red tape, the TreasuryDepartment tightened the rules on the real problemareas--those governing electronic money transfers amongcurrency exchanges, casinos, brokerage firms, and banksto require the keeping of records about the sources andrecipients of the transfers.Banks in other areas of the world are also improvingtheir oversight operations. For example, controls andstaff training has recently been introduced by the HongKong Association of Banks to help its members combatmoney laundering. Hong Kong is a prime target for hidingsources of illicit funds because of its location, tradingpolicies and sophisticated markets.Credit card fraud is also a serious organized crimerelated problem in the United States--and it may alsobecome so in South Africa as that country takes on moreof the technological trappings of the Western world.Credit card fraud losses for major card players in theUnited States has increased to about $1 billion a year,much of which is attributed to Nigerian gangs. As aresult, the credit card industry has taken drasticmeasures to curb fraud and to wage war against organizedcrime, which uses card fraud to finance illegalactivities. Countermeasures include use offraud-detection software to enable issuers to determineif someone is making unauthorized transactions,incorporating a unique secret code in the card's magneticstripe to detect altered data at the time ofauthorization, new chip cards, and education on propercard acceptance procedures.The Drug TradeThe global drug trade's illegal income makes up the majorportion of the $750 billion taken in by the majorinternational crime organizations each year. Indicationsare that South Africa, and in particular Johannesburg, israpidly becoming the southern anchor of an African drugtriangle involving Nigeria in the northwest and Sudan inthe northeast. South African customs officials areconcerned that Johannesburg International Airport (JAI)is becoming a major distribution point for cocaine movingto the European market.The chief of the narcotics bureau at JAI, ColonelStefanus Smit, says that "the quantity of cocaine comingthrough has increased at an incredible rate." Smit hasonly a 13-man staff to monitor the 3,000 internationaltravelers per day at the airport. Police sources claimthat South American cartels are now using South Africandrug couriers out of Johannesburg because they draw lesssuspicion as they travel to Europe and the United States.The South African couriers are flown to a Latin Americancity, such as Rio de Janeiro, supplied with drugs, andthen flown to Nigeria or another West African country.After a few days they travel into South Africa, takingadvantage of soft security at border crossing points.The drug cartels operating in South Africa, like theirAmerican counterparts, must be able to launder thesefunds skillfully to pay their underlings, to run theirmassive and intricate transportation systems, and todistribute the extensive numbers of bribes required tokeep their system going.Transportation CrimeAround the world, trade is growing twice as fast--andforeign direct investment four times as fast--as nationaleconomies. South Africa's transportation system ispresently in this high growth situation with increasedroad traffic, increased rail shipments, and increasedmaritime shipments. For example, the port of Capetownforecasts an increase of over 50 percent in internationalcontainer shipments next year. International trade andexports are a major factor in South Africa's economicfuture. This intense competition for the growing volumeof money, goods, and services moving across borders andthrough ports can place South African officials undertremendous pressure to make sure they move the goods andcommerce swiftly, hence encouraging the relaxation ofbottlenecking regulations and controls internally and atborders.International crime syndicates love to work a busytransportation system, where they can operate "in theseams" with little chance of apprehension. We havelearned a lot about this in the United States whereinternational thieves have found cargo theft soprofitable and the likelihood of arrest so slight thatsome gangs have switched from drug smuggling to cargocrime. The United States has worked hard to combat cargotheft, yet the total dollar loss from all modes oftransportation approaches $10 billion annually. If thisis the case in the United States, South Africa must takecare that its cargo operations do not become a sittingduck for international cargo crime syndicates.However, it appears that international crime syndicateshave already begun to focus on South Africa. Lawenforcement officials credit the increase in organizedcrime in South Africa to the stricter laws and controlmeasures now in place at points of entry in Europe andAmerica, renewed international trade interest, SouthAfrica's strategic location astride the major FarEast-Middle East and Atlantic shipping routes, its firstworld infrastructure, and its re-entry into theinternational arena.In the United States, some of the conditions that allowinternational transportation crime to flourish have beencreated by conscious choice. For example, at one of thebusiest Mexican border crossings, customs officials aretold to spend no more than one minute examining eachnorthbound tractor-trailer in order to prevent huge12-hour traffic jams. This and other programs to speedthe cross border traffic, has been a bonanza for drugsmugglers.  Another problem is within the ranks oftransportation workers themselves. In the United States,many instances of cargo theft involve insider cooperationor information. In one major airport that had high theftrates, it was discovered that at least 70 percent of thestaff that worked on the tarmac had previous arrestrecords. In other areas strong unions in port areas withhigh theft rates refuse to allow increased exit searchesand controls.And while the volume of air freight is exploding, newrules make the government liable for damage caused toperishable goods--flowers, food, animals--by inspectiondelays. So what could be more natural than to use thesesame shipments, especially those moving through thebusiest airports, to smuggle drugs and other contraband?The largest volume of air cargo in the United Statespasses through busy Miami Airport. It is the gateway toLatin America, and perishable air freight cargoes such asflowers (82 percent of the flowers imported into theUnited States originate in Colombia) pass through Miamiairport. Airport officials have had to deal with thechallenge of smuggling drug shipments in the flowers andother cargos. Additionally, Miami is the largest port ofentry for the French perfume industry. Last year, theftof expensive shipments of fragrances by organized crimegot so bad that an FBI Task Force had to be formed.The US Department of Justice reported that Colombiannationals, together with Peruvians, Ecuadoreans, andChileans, have formed large-scale cargo theft gangs.Particularly with the Ecuadoreans, multi-million dollartractor trailer thefts of cargo were occurring atnumerous terminals all along the East Coast. Whenapprehended and questioned, the thieves were found to bemembers of drug cartels which switched from the illegaldrug business because they found stealing cargo safer andeasier than smuggling drugs.Vehicle Hijacking and TheftBecause of the vacuum caused by police reorganization,international organized crime has quickly moved intoSouth Africa's extensive vehicle theft operations.According to Police Commissioner George Fivas, in 1994over 80,000 vehicle were stolen, including a huge numberof commercial trucks and cargos. There have been 36hijacking-related murders of drivers in the first half of1995. The crime syndicates are currently managing to stayone step ahead of the outgunned and undermanned police,and are increasingly using the cross-border theft ofvehicles and cargo to finance drug shipments in a networkof criminal activity involving Lesotho, Tanzania,Zimbabwe, and Zambia. Police have recently recoveredstolen South African vehicles as far away as Australia,Portugal, Greece, and Cyprus.There is some hope for the grim picture of rampanttransportation crime thanks to the determined efforts ofThe Transportation Crime Sub-committee of South Africa'sNational Crime Combatting Council, which was founded in1994 to establish a partnership between the South Africanpolice and all elements of the transportation businesssectors for the fight against transportation crime. TheAmerican experience has shown that public and privategroups like this must have dedicated government supportif they are to be successful.SolutionsAround the world, organized crime is rapidly expanding totake advantage of post-Cold War opportunities.International crime syndicates are adding to theirtraditional illicit activities by using their vastfinancial resources and sophisticated command oftechnology to move huge amounts of ill-gotten, buteffectively laundered money around the world in seconds,to steal sensitive proprietary information for unlawfulpurposes, and to infiltrate legitimate businesses. Itappears that this trend will increase unless strongcooperative international measures are taken.South African police forces are currently out-gunned andout-manned. A key factor why organized crime isflourishing in South Africa may be because police forcesare too poorly paid and equipped to fight theinternational criminal gangs taking up residence there orto resist the corruption of overpowering financialtemptations and bribes. SAPS sources admit that they lackthe structure, resources, finances, and technicalresources to cope with large-scale organized crime. Someorganized crime groups already have state-of-the-artequipment and communications systems, most of which putsSouth African law enforcement technologies to shame.The international criminal organizations are evolvinginto a new breed of cyberspace crook.     Trends in SouthAfrica indicate that the top participants in futurecriminal organizations will be educated, highlysophisticated, computer-literate individuals who canwield state-of-the-art information technology to the bestadvantage, for themselves and their criminalorganizations. To be effective, law enforcementorganizations must recruit and train the same caliber ofindividuals.International economic and law enforcement organizationsare only now beginning to deal with the problem. Withinthe last year a spate of international conferences on thedrug trade, bribery and official corruption have begun toat least talk about the issues. The European Union issetting up a Europe-wide police intelligence agency, andthe FBI has made international cooperation one of itshighest priorities. The next meeting of the Group ofSeven top industrial nations is scheduled to produce theoutline of a new economic architecture that cancollectively deal with terrorism, organized crime anddrug trafficking.Affected countries like South Africa have begun top levelpublic-private efforts to combat international crime. InSouth Africa, the Council of South African Bankers andBusiness South Africa hosted "A Business InitiativeAgainst Corruption and Crime" in August 1995 that wasattended by President Nelson Mandela and most of thetop-ranking government, security, and businessexecutives. The conference has an ambitious action planwhich will provide a South African road map for guidingthe struggle against criminal elements.The continuing fight against international crimeorganizations will involve increased internationalcooperation and new regulations to improve lawenforcement operations. Finally, countries must worktogether to tighten their laws to prevent criminalorganizations from benefiting from internationalloopholes. New laws should be introduced where necessaryto strengthen the hand of local law enforcers and easeinternational coordination of operations againstinternational syndicates. States also should exchangeinformation and experience to increase the level ofinternational cooperation.

William Bodine wascharged for arranging meetings with executive branchofficials to help foster the normalization of relationswith the United States.Libya refuses to release Abdel Basser Ali Al-Megrahi andLamen Khalifa Fhalmah, both suspected of planting theexplosives aboard Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988.Economic and diplomatic sanctions against Libya,initially imposed in 1986, were broadened after thebombing, including a provision prohibiting normalizationof relations until the suspects are extradited to GreatBritain or the United States for prosecution. Accordingto a supporting affidavit by a US Customs Service agent,Bodine met on June 16, 1992, with an unnamed employee ofthe Bush administration's National Security Council todiscuss the sanctions. The affidavit specifies thatothers were contacted, including National SecurityAdviser Brent Scowcroft and former adviser RobertMcFarlane.Bodine also allegedly arranged a meeting between LibyanTreasury Minister Mohammed El Bukhari and a "Texasbusinessman" who sources identify as real estateexecutive Trammel Crow. Bukhari had hoped that, inaddition to a Dallas land deal, the Crow family influencemight lead the way to Washington.Authorities allege that Bodine set up a branch of the NewYork-based Investment Advisory Group in the BritishVirgin Islands and opened a Swiss bank account to receive$8 million per year in separate $460,000 payments to"consult" on behalf of Libya. A search of the Dallasoffice of Bodine's son-in-law, Henry Billingsley,allegedly uncovered a roll of undeveloped film of Bodineat a site in Libya bombed by the United States in 1986.In a related development, on October 17, Libya abandonedits candidacy for the "North Africa" seat on the UnitedNations Security Council, claiming that the UN had becomea tool of the United States. Arguing that it would havebeen unconscionable for a state presently under UNsanction to fill a vacancy, the United States, Britain,and France campaigned against Libya and gathered enoughvotes to prevent Libya from obtaining the two-thirdsmajority of the General Assembly required to winelection.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996Senate Provides More Relief for Victims of Terrorism byDouglas KashOn June 6, the Senate passed legislation aimed atincreasing federal powers to prevent and combatterrorism. In a 91-8 vote Senate bill S. 735--known asthe "Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995."Title X of the bill, "Victims of terrorism Act of 1995,"provides that the director of the FBI is entitled to makegrants to states in order to provide compensation andassistance to residents of those states who, whileoutside the territorial boundaries of the United States,are victims of terrorism or mass violence, but are nototherwise eligible for compensation under the OmnibusDiplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. (See,"Where to turn? Compensating the Victims of Terrorism,"Counterterrorism & Security, Spring 1995). They alsoprovided the same compensation and assistance package forvictims of domestic terrorism. The FBI director may alsoprovide funds to the US Attorney's office for use incoordination with state victims compensation andassistance efforts in providing emergency relief.Even more recently the Senate Judiciary Committee and itscounterpart in the House offered their respective changesto the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) of 1976 toenable victims of terrorism to sue the governmentsresponsible. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Actgenerally prohibits lawsuits against a foreign country byUS citizens unless the injury is directly related to theforeign government's business in the United States.Distinct from the Victims of Terrorism Act of 1995, theSenate amendment to the FSIA limits the Act to countrieslisted by the State Department as sponsors of terrorismsuch as Libya, Iraq, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria.The House version would permit a suit against any countrywhose legal system does not offer foreigners an adequatelegal remedy, such as Saudi Arabia. Under this remedy,victims of terrorism could win damages in US courts ifthey are unable to gain compensation in the courts of thecountry involved.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996Sri Lanka: Terrorism in Perspective by Tom MarksA fine line separates terrorism from forms of violencebased upon mass mobilization. The problem for securityforces is that, early on, armed challenges to governmentcontrol appear more or less the same. Hence systemicresponse to "terror," normally based upon force, moreoften than not is inappropriate. Most commonly, abuse ofthe populace creates a new dynamic which allows anoperationally astute terrorist organization to mobilizeadditional support.It is this process which makes the ongoing struggle inSri Lanka of more than passing interest. Prior to theJuly 1983 explosion of communal violence which serves asthe starting point for the conflict's intense phase, bestevidence indicates that the number of Tamils actuallyengaged in violence amounted to no more than 50-60hardcore individuals who traveled freely between Indiaand Sri Lanka. These activists were assisted by a networkof informers throughout the north. Violence was limitedto the Jaffna area, the main base of Tamil resistancesituated on the island's northern tip.July 1983's wholesale assault upon the Tamil populace byenraged Sinhalese mobs, combined with the inability orunwillingness of the security forces to protect them,proved the turning point. What might have remained aterrorist threat exploded into insurgency. In the monthsthat followed, the resistance movement underwent adramatic expansion in strength and areas of operation. Bymid-1984 total numbers of separatists were estimated at2,500-5,000 personnel, with probably at least half armedand equipped. Today, insurgent strength may go as high as15,000, with a divided, amateurish resistance having beenreplaced by the well-trained, disciplined, and armedLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), or "Tigers."How much different would the situation have been had aforce and an approach been at hand to deal correctly withthe situation! Background to the ConflictIronically, as a democracy, Sri Lanka would have seemedtheoretically positioned to address popular grievancesadequately. But following independence from Britain in1948, the new nation's highly centralized, unitary stateensured domination of the polity by the nearlyfour-fifths majority of Buddhist, Sinhala-speakingSinhalese (roughly a fifth of the population wereTamil-speaking Hindus).Several groups sprang up to press for redress of Tamilgrievances. In the center was the Tamil United Front(TUF), formed in 1972 and calling autonomy. On the leftside of the political spectrum the Tamil StudentsFederation (TSF) advocated more radical solutions, suchas independence. The most radical group came to be knownas the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), an armedseparatist group committed to insurgency.In 1978 fighting erupted between the LTTE and the army,causing the government to declare the group illegal on 19May 1978. The government was also empowered to proscribeany organization which advocated the use of violence andwhich was directly or indirectly connected with anyunlawful activity.But the military lacked a counterterror capability.Indeed, its total ground strength was effectivelycontained in five infantry battalions. The capability forintelligence-gathering and surgical application of force,in other words, was all but lacking at this time in SriLanka. The advantage lay with the terrorists.Violence escalated, and by the early 1980s terrorincidents by the Tamils unleashed spasms of communalconflict -- one ambush in Jaffna, in which 13 soldiersdied, prompted widespread rioting and looting directedagainst Tamils. At least 400 persons were killed and100,000 left homeless; another 60,000 fled to India.Police stood by, and in many cases members of the armedforces participated in the reprisals.The violence served to traumatize the Tamil community andprovided the Tigers with an influx of new manpower. Thusthe ascendancy of radical leadership in the struggle forTamil Eelam was complete. Both the militants and theauthorities recognized that, for the moment, the conflictwould take the form of a military test of strength. Thegovernment reacted by improving coordination andstrategic direction through the formation in March 1984of a Ministry of National Security, headed by LalithAthulathmudalai, in effect a command center for theconduct of a counterinsurgency campaign. Expansion ofnumbers and equipment for all of the security forces wasundertaken, as were steps to tighten discipline and tohalt abuses of the population.The small size of the Sri Lankan security forces madesuch steps imperative. Though Athulathmudalai clearlyintended to conduct a counterinsurgency in the Britishmode, with military measures deriving direction from theoverall thrust of a political solution, the very size ofthe emerging separatist armed threat made forcefulmilitary measures inevitable. But without substantivemovement towards the framing of particulars in apolitical option, there was a danger that militarysuppression would become an end unto itself.This is precisely what occurred. Even a police SpecialTask Force (STF), formed in 1984 specifically for acareful, nuanced approach to "counterinsurgency," quicklybecame but another aggressive unit in a generaldeployment to combat. Escalation of hostilities led toconflict nationwide, eventual Indian intervention in July1987, and the complete domination of the "liberationstruggle" by the LTTE, which proclaimed itselfMrxist-Leninist.Only with the election of a coalition headed by the SriLanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in August 1994, followed bythe November presidential victory of SLFP leaderChandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga -- these polls ending17 years of United National Party (UNP) power -- waspolitics allowed to drive the military response to theproblem. A three-month cease-fire, during which Colombosought to frame a solution acceptable to all parties,ended when the LTTE launched attacks on governmentforces. These included use of underwater assets todestroy navy ships, as well as introduction of SA-7surface-to-air missiles into the conflict. The latterwere used to down several air force transports, later atleast one helicopter. Armor was already in use by bothsides. What had begun as a campaign by terrorists hadgrown to conventional civil war.Security Force OptionsIn mid-1995, therefore, the government held a series ofmeetings designed to settle upon a national strategy forending the conflict. Incredibly, no such step hadhitherto been taken. These meetings, of which there wereat least three primary sessions, did not go well. Thegovernment itself, as the meetings progressed,articulated a plan for devolution which came close, inall but name, to abandoning the unitary state in favor ofa federal system. Yet while all official bodies basicallyagreed that the Tigers would have to be defeatedmilitarily in order for the political solution to beimplemented, there was disagreement on the plan ofoperations.On one side were those who saw no option but to end theLTTE hold on Jaffna by direct assault. The principaladvocate of this approach was Anuruddha Ratwatte, apresidential relative and, effectively, Minister ofDefense (he was actually the Deputy Minister, but thePresident herself was the Minister, so Ratwatte ran thesecurity forces). He was joined by a body of militaryofficers who felt the effort had to be made. Opposed wasan equally distinguished and senior body of officers,both active and retired, who demurred. They cited theconsiderable success which had been achieved by thesystematic domination of areas using force to shieldrestoration of government control. This approach, theyargued, while much slower, would be ever less costly inlives and financial resources.The former category was obvious, since any assault onJaffna would involve the taking of hardened,well-defended positions. The latter point was equallyimportant, though, because by 1995 interest payments toservice government debt were of themselves 29.9 percentof current expenditures, with a figure of close to 48percent reached if amortization and interest paymentswere included under debt service. High intensityoperations, regardless of purely military considerations,were bound to worsen this financial situation.So bitter became the debate that at least one keycommander, Brigadier Janaka Perera of the Reserve StrikeForce (RSF), was summarily relieved in consequence of thetone and substance of his objections. He opted to accepta brigade command in the extreme northeast rather thanretire. In all of this, the army commander, LieutenantGeneral Gerry de Silva -- like Perera, a Sandhurstgraduate -- found himself very much in the middle. Hisimportant contribution after assuming command on 1January 1994 had been to rationalize the command andcontrol structure of a force grown to 76 infantrybattalions alone (drawn from three sources -- active,reserves, and national guard). With his own staff dividedon the merits of a Jaffna assault, he was torn betweendemands from above that he lead the charge and from belowthat he back another course of action.Perera's arguments were illustrative of the proposedalternatives. He advocated continuing systematicdomination of areas while taking the battle directly tothe insurgents using special operations. These were thetactics he had used successfully in the south during theresurgence of a Sinhalese communist group, JanathaVimukthi Peramuna (JVP, "People's Liberation Front"). Aprevious effort by the JVP to seize power in 1971 hadbeen bloodily suppressed, but the group had gained newlife in the wake of India's July 1987 militaryintervention in Sri Lanka as a "peacekeeping force."Portraying itself as the representative of Sri Lankannationalism, the JVP convulsed the Sinhalese areas of thecountry before being destroyed. Perera played a crucialrole in breaking the JVP by capturing a number of its keypersonalities, to include its head, Rohana Wijeweera.As his weapon, Perera made use of a special forcesbrigade which grouped together units of the commandos andspecial forces. These, like most of Sri Lanka's militaryforces, had developed in step with the Tamil insurgency.While the threat was still terrorism -- with attacksincluding strikes against Colombo's commercial air links-- a small commando force had been formed. It had but twosquadrons, one devoted to rapid response missions,principally anti-hijacking, the other to VIP security. Asactual hostilities progressed, the commandos foundthemselves active in counterguerrilla operations as well.The shortage of such personnel led to the formation of aseparate Special Forces Regiment, primarily for jungleoperations. Leaving permutations aside, the end resultwas that both the commandos and the special forceseventually evolved into forces of two battalions each(these with approximately 450 men rather than thestandard infantry 600 strength), brought together in aspecial forces brigade.During his four-year tenure as special forces brigadecommander, Perera expanded its operations into a varietyof unconventional areas, including airmobile assault andundercover work. There was even one squadron which usedmotorcycles during its operations.When Gerry de Silva formed a reserve strike force in July1994 as an integral part of his refining of the commandstructure, Perera was picked to lead it. Under him werenot only the four battalions which had been in thespecial forces brigade but also six infantry battalions,mechanized and airmobile, and three armor battalions. Assuch it was an elite strike force which could respond invirtually any fashion to a threat anywhere in the theaterof operations. It was also the force Perera lost when hisblunt assessment of the planned Jaffna operation cost himhis job.Exile, in any event, proved brief. When the actualassault on Jaffna was launched in October of this year,Perera was recalled to command the cutting edge of theattack. Certainly his concerns, as well as those ofothers who shared his opinion, had not changed, but allwere unwilling to sit on the sidelines as the securityforces locked horns in fierce battle with the LTTE.The FutureJaffna fell to government forces in early December,bringing the conventional phase of combat to a close. Butthe war is certainly not over. Problems remain --problems that should have been addressed in the earlieststages. From a lesson-learned perspective, the fightingclearly illustrates how a terrorist threat of minorproportions progressed to a multi-divisional assault upona heavily fortified built-up area, using all the arsenalof conventional combat -- air power, artillery, andarmor, among others. The Tigers even have reportedlyemployed homemade chemical weapons.The ferocity that the struggle has gained over the yearscannot be understated. Many of the principalpersonalities involved, to include both the presidents ofSri Lanka and India, have fallen in the process.Neither should the complexity of the task as it hasdeveloped be underestimated. A Third World state has in adozen years been forced to create, support, and deploy aforce with nearly twice the infantry battalions availableto the likes to the United Kingdom. It has done so atheavy human and financial cost. The rearming for thepresent Jaffna offensive alone is estimated to have runup a bill of some $500 million.What is sobering, though, is that the security dynamichas scarcely changed since battle was joined. The debatewithin the Sri Lankan command concerning the attack onJaffna, for instance, was not on the necessity of takingout that insurgent center but rather on the means and thetiming. Assessing its own political situation, as well asthat of its opponents, Colombo decided that it could notadopt the long haul approach. It was well understood thatthe attack would be costly and that insurgent elementswould certainly seek to relocate elsewhere in the countryto continue the fight.Preparations were thus made to safeguard the gains madein the east and "near north" (that area south of Jaffna),those Tamil-populated areas which remain in contention,as well as to secure the Sinhalese rear area itself.These have been mostly successful, at least on thesurface, though Tiger attacks succeeded in destroying oilstores in Colombo and in massacring a number of Sinhalesevillages.Whether the cost of the Jaffna assault -- thousands ofcasualties had already resulted at the time of thiswriting -- proves commensurate with the results willdepend upon the government's follow-up. Among the manyironies of the war is the fact that at no time has amajority of Tamils lived in the so-called "Tamilhomelands." This has become even more the case as theyears have gone by.The ceasefire and its subsequent violation by the Tigershas served the useful purpose of exposing once again,both domestically and internationally, the fact thatrevolution as opposed to reform is the LTTE aim.Consequently, not only has there been a decided shift ininternational circles away from the sympathetic tilt ofmany towards the Tigers, there has also been an upsurgein numbers of Tamil civilians fleeing LTTE areas forgovernment lines.In the key Vavuniya district, for instance, wherethree-quarters of the area remains under LTTE control,that precise proportion of the population lives on thegovernment side of the lines -- wherein there had been noincidents during the year before the Jaffna attack. Thetest will be whether the costly seizure of Jaffna servesto facilitate further this domi- nation of the populace.Certainly the struggle will continue. What is hoped inColombo is that the destruction of the insurgent headwill push the conflict back to the level at which itshould have remained had government response been moreappropriate and foreign intervention less disruptive(India, now firmly on Colombo's side, was for much of theconflict an ally of the insurgents; Tamil Nadu insouthern India continues to be used as a base and stagingarea despite New Delhi's efforts).Thus it can be dealt with using the techniques and forcesdeveloped for special operations. Had these beenavailable from the start, combined with the greaterpolitical and social sensitivity now evident in Colombo'sstrategic approach, it is unlikely the story of the Tamilinsurgency would have grown to such gigantic proportions.Tom Marks is an expert in revolutionary warfare andcounterinsurgency, and a contributing editor to CTS.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996Terror in Oklahoma City Reviewed by Jack Plaxe.Oklahoma Rescue, by Jon Hansen (New York: BallantineBooks, 1995), 222 pp., $5.99.Requiem for the Heartland: The Oklahoma City Bombing (SanFrancisco: Collins Publishers, 1995), 119 pp., $19.95.In Their Name: Oklahoma City, The Official CommemorativeVolume (New York: Random House, 1995), 176 pp., $25.00.And the Angels Wept: From the Pulpits of Oklahoma City,edited by Marsha Brock Bishop and David P.

For this and other reasons, April 19, 1995will forever be remembered as a day of infamy.A number of books have come out since the bombing to bothexplain what happened and to pay tribute to those wholost their lives on that day. Oklahoma Rescue, the firstbook published on the bombing, was written by OklahomaCity Assistant Fire Chief Jon Hansen. Hansen imparts amoving personal account of the rescue effort, from themoment that he heard the bomb blast to the recovery ofthe final three bodes of the victims on May 29.Two of the new books were compiled to remember those wholost their lives and to commemorate the valiant effortsof the rescue workers and volunteers. Requiem for theHeartland is a photographic compilation that vividlyshows the devastation of the bombing and Oklahoma City'sefforts to carry on in the face of adversity. In theirName, another pictorial work, is a collection offirst-hand accounts from the survivors of the bombing andfrom the next of kin, the rescue workers and the citizensof Oklahoma City who were trying to cope in theaftermath. Both books contain powerful photos, many ofwhich will be familiar to those who followed the bombingclosely. Proceeds from these books will be donated tocharities involved in assisting the Oklahoma City bombingvictims. Both books are fitting tributes to those whodied and to those who selflessly gave of themselves tohelp.The final book on the bombing is very different from theothers. And the Angels Wept is a compilation of sermonsdelivered at various religious institutions in OklahomaCity in the aftermath of the bombing. It is a touchingtribute to those religious leaders who attempted to makesome sense out of this terrible tragedy. All of theproceeds of this work will go to the Interfaith DisasterRecovery of Greater Oklahoma City.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996Protection Specialist Survey and Checkbook, by JohnDermaut (International Network of Protection Specialists,Global Security Complex, 1995), 200 pp., $19.95,805-845-7011. Reviewed by Mayer Nudell.Sometimes, someone finds a new way to presenttime-honored material in a different and more useful way.That is the case with the new pocket-sized ProtectionSpecialist Survey and Checkbook, produced by theInternational Network of Protection Specialists (INPS).The INPS is a relatively new organization focusing on theprofessional needs of those in the security fraternitywho are largely responsible for the personal protectionof others. John Dermaut, director of the INPS, has made asignificant contribution to the literature by packaging aconsiderable amount of information into a compact format,and by adding his own international perspective andknowledge to the mix. The result is an extremely usefulguide and series of checklists that can be usedrepeatedly when doing advance work and in providingpersonal protection in any context.The book is divided into two parts. The first deals withbuildings and transportation. It provides checklists andreminders for dealing with residences, offices, hotels,restaurants, hospitals, cars, planes, trains--and manyother aspects of personal protection in a wide range ofenvironments. The second part contains specificinformation and checklists for doing advance work, routesurveys, and many other tasks. It also contains severaluseful references for dealing with improvised explosivedevices and letter bombs, along with a conversion chartfor metric-English measurements, a listing of country andarea telephone codes, and some key dates for theprotection specialist to keep in mind (especiallyimportant since many attacks are linked anniversaries ofevents).The Protection Specialist Survey and Checkbook is anextremely useful publication, and its compact, pocketsize makes it a reference that can easily be taken alongon any site survey or advance trip. Its many checklistsshould ease the task of providing personal protection,and its comprehensive coverage should ensure that nothingis overlooked. This inexpensive book belongs in thelibrary of all protection specialists, although it won'tstay there gathering dust. Its sturdy cover mayeventually become dog-eared through use, but protectionspecialists will certainly welcome its help.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996The Seven Steps to Personal Safety, by Richard B. Isaacsand Tim Powers  (New York: Varro Press, 1993), 170 pp.,913-432-6399. Reviewed by Mayer Nudell.The past few years have seen a number of advisory booksintended to help people learn to protect themselves fromcrime and other assorted evils of modern life. Most ofthem concentrate either on avoiding dangerous situationsor on self-defense techniques to use when attacked. TheSeven Steps to Personal Safety is one of the few tocombine both aspects into a common-sense approach topersonal safety. The authors each have many years ofexperience in law enforcement, criminal justice, andself-defense training. Against this background they havefocused their presentation on awareness and avoidance,while providing a continuum from awareness throughreaction and response to the aftermath of a violentincident. In the jargon of the security manager, theauthors take a systems approach to personal defense andsafety, and the seven steps they propose flow from one tothe next.The authors' seven steps to personal safety are: 1) beingaware of vulnerability, 2) mental commitment to doingeverything possible to remain safe, 3) being aware of theenvironment and taking reasonable precautions, 4)creating and maintaining distance to escape threateningsituations, 5) stopping an assault and escaping, 6)immediate notification of the police, and 7) dealing withpost-incident stress. Each chapter focuses on one ofthese steps, providing a wealth of useful informationthat anyone can use.Isaacs and Powers present a number of options thatindividuals can choose from should they find themselvesexposed to danger. Recognizing that a major part of bothavoidance and response is mental, they repeatedly discussthat aspect of personal safety--ranging from planning tothe decision about how to respond from an attack, and inrecovering from an attack's effects. They stress thatbehavioral changes in attitudes toward life need notresult in paranoia, but in a feeling of being in controland of feeling secure. The net result should be moreself-assurance and an increased ability to enjoy life.The Seven Steps to Personal Safety also contains bothverbal and physical techniques that can be used invarious situations to either de-escalate tension or torespond to an attack. These techniques are presented aspart of an overall programmatic approach to personalsafety. While not a replacement for a well-conceivedtraining program, this book provides an intelligent andeffective method of enhancing personal safety.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996Book Review: Extremism in America, edited by Lyman TowerSargent (New York: New York University Press, 1995), 380pp., $17.95, order line 800-996-6987.Reviewed by JackPlaxe.An excellent collection of primary source documents froma wide range of groups and individuals, Extremism inAmerica is an investigation into all facets of politicalextremism.

Reviewed by Jack Plaxe.Comrade Criminal is described as "the first comprehensiveinvestigation into the organized crime and corruptionthat plague Russia today." The author, former Moscowbureau chief of the Toronto Star, makes extensive use ofinterviews to show how organized crime is hinderingRussia's transition to democracy. The breakup of theSoviet Union has resulted in a virtual free-for-all forbureaucrats and criminals. Smuggling and the black marketactivity have become an integral part of the Russianeconomy over the past 20 years. Along with this comescriminal activity that manifests itself in gang-styleexecutions, kidnappings, and drugs and weaponstrafficking. Widespread corruption, bureaucratic red tapeand a high level of taxation make it difficult forbusiness to be conducted honestly.

The G26 is designed in 9mm, and theG27 in .40 caliber. Those concerned about defendingthemselves can walk down a dark street with confidenceknowing they have the power of a service caliber Glockpistol on their side.The concealability of these compact pistols are the mainselling point as a self-defense weapon, or as a backupweapon. With a 6-inch slide and a height of only 4inches, these pistols easily slip into an ankle holsteror handbag.Another distinctive advantage is that the G26 acceptsmagazines from the 9mm Glock models 17 and 19; the .40caliber G27 accepts magazines from the models 22 and 23.Both models have plenty of firepower, since the G26 holds10 rounds and the G27 holds nine rounds. Law enforcementofficers who carry Glock pistols of the same caliber likethe concept that their duty magazines are compatible withtheir backup or off-duty pistol.Simple upkeep and training make these mini-pistols theperfect choice for anyone desiring a compact for personalsafety. The same technology that made Glock known foraccuracy and ease of shooting still applies to thesecompact packages. The recoil is lessened by the lowpositioning of the slide and the unique double-recoilspring, allowing each pistol to perform exactly like itslarger counterparts.Anyone who can shoot a Glock can pick up the compactversion and expect the same function, accuracy, andperformance. Since the inner mechanisms are identical infunction and design with the other Glock pistols, fieldstripping, cleaning, and servicing are as simple on theG26 and G27 as on any other Glock.For more information contact: Glock, Inc., PO Box 369,Smyrna, GA 30081. phone: 770-432-1202.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY MAGAZINE via NewsNetWinter 1996Compact Night VisionITT Night Vision introduces two new products for lawenforcement: the ITT Gen 3 Night Enforcer 160 monocularand the Gen 3 Night Enforcer 260 binocular-style viewers.Both feature Generation 3 technology--the highest gradenight vision technology available.ITT Night Vision knows the importance of arming our lawenforcement community with top-of-the-line equipment, butalso realizes most departments are on tight budgets, sothey have developed various innovative programs toovercome some of the monetary concerns.

The "enemies" that have beenattacked include the United States, Israel, neighboringAfrican states and outspoken Libyan dissidents who oppose theQaddafi regime.Over the years, Qaddafi has provided support to such diversegroups as the Palestine Liberation Front, the ProvisionalIrish Republican Army and the Black Power movement in theUnited States.  In the 1980's, Qaddafi's sponsorship and useof terrorism greatly expanded.  Libya began to provideoperational support in the form of travel documents, weapons,training, and safe haven to the Abu Nidal organization.Libyan government agents also began to carry out terroristoperations directly.  Some of the more notorious terroristincidents that Libya has been involved in include:     The April 1986 bombing of the La Belle disco (3 killed,  dozens injured)     The December 1987 bombing of the USO lounge in Barcelona (1  killed, 9 injured)     The July 1988 machine gun and hand grenade assault on the  Greek cruise ship 'The City of Poros' (9 killed, over 100  injured)     The December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 (270 killed)     The September 1989 bombing of UTA flight 772 (171 killed)  Despite these terrorist activities, many countries continue todo business with and maintain diplomatic relations with Libya.These links provide the Qaddafi government in Libya withlegitimacy which allows it to participate in internationalorganizations such as the United Nations, the InternationalCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and INTERPOL.The United States strategy vis a vis Libya has been to attemptto isolate Libya through the imposition of unilateral economicsanctions.  This strategy was revised in 1992 when the U.S.led efforts at the United Nations to impose limited aviationand diplomatic sanctions on Libya for its role in the Pan Am103 bombing.  These sanctions have since been expanded toinclude a variety of limited economic sanctions.  However, thesanctions do not include an embargo on Libyan oil, the primarysource of Libyan hard currency revenues.The result of these limited sanctions is that Libya has beensomewhat isolated yet they still participate in internationalfora such as the UN, ICAO, and INTERPOL.  If Libya is to betruly isolated, all nations who condemn terrorism must work torestrict Libyan participation in the these organizations.There are some indications that this is underway.  The UnitedStates, Great Britain and France recently led a successfuleffort to deny Libya a seat on the UN Security Council.  Inaddition, the Libyan delegation to the INTERPOL annualterrorism conference was rebuked when the US delegationpresented information to the effect that they were seeking twoLibyan government agents for their role in the Pan Am 103bombing.  The Libyan delegation was so humiliated by the USpresentation that they left the conference and did not return.Despite these steps, additional efforts must be undertaken toisolate Libya economically.  It is highly doubtful thatEuropean and other countries will voluntarily stop doingbusiness with Qaddafi.  For this reason, the limited aviation,diplomatic, and economic sanctions currently imposed on Libyathrough the UN Security Council must be expanded to eitherinclude a complete ban on Libyan oil sales (as was doneagainst Iraq after the Gulf War) or a total naval blockade ofLibya.  Either action will deny Libya the petrodollars thatprop up the Qaddafi government.Efforts should also be taken to isolate Libya diplomaticallyby denying them the right to participate in international forasuch as the UN, ICAO, and INTERPOL.  A nation that has beenshown to both use and sponsor terrorism should not be a memberof an international police organization whose focus isinternational cooperation to prevent criminal activity.  Norshould Libya be allowed to participate in ICAO, particularlyin light of its involvement in the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772bombings which resulted in over 400 deaths.Terrorism has long been an important instrument of Libyanforeign policy.  The international community must takestronger steps to isolate Qaddafi both diplomatically andeconomically.  If countries continue to provide the Libyangovernment legitimacy through trade opportunities andparticipation in international fora, the Qaddafi regime willremain in power and continue to support terrorist activitiesaround the world.Jack Plaxe is a Washington-based terrorism researcher andwriter and associate editor of Counterterrorism and Securitymagazine.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTERTERRORISM & SECURITY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary/February 1996This section of Counterterrorism and Security Report isThis section of Counterterrorism and Security Report isprovided to keep members informed about legaldevelopments which may affect their professional orpersonal lives.

Reese, CPP, CISSPTwo major incidents, the World Trade Center and the OklahomaCity Federal Building, have shown that terrorist acts havecome to our shores.  They can originate from outside ourboundaries or be truly home grown.  These incidents should nothave been any surprise, especially the homegrown one inOklahoma City.On June 14,1995, the Washington, D.C. Chapter of  the AmericanSociety for Industrial Security (ASIS) held its annualCountering Terrorism Seminar.  Frank McGuire, a Bethesda, MDsecurity consultant, described an event in 1988 that shouldhave been a pointer to the damage even one man can do.  Adisgruntled tax payer rigged a homemade mortar in his pickuptruck that was designed to attack the building in West LA thathoused the IRS.  Fortunately, the chemicals involved had anunintended reaction and the fire department was called for atruck on fire. After extinguishing the fire, the fire fightersnoted a suspicious glow and called the bomb squad.  Severalcity blocks were evacuated while the situation was resolved.Had it gone off as planned, the IRS Building would havesuffered major damage with significant human losses.McGuire was asked how to assess the potential risk created byright-wing extremists.  He responded that, based on the WestLA scenario, and what we know about Oklahoma City, it isconceivable for one deranged person to build a truck bomb.  Itwould simply take longer than if he had help.  Using thiscriteria, McGuire commented that if there are 1,000 peoplenation-wide with these intentions and capabilities, that meansthere could be 1,000 truck bombs.Much media attention has been focused on militias and relatedmovements since the Oklahoma City bombing. At the ASIS AnnualSeminar in New Orleans, September 11-14, 1995, Daniel Donohue,a security consultant based in Hallandale, Florida, discussed"Domestic Terrorism and Right-Wing Extremist".  He began hispresentation by discussing the history of political violencein America.  Most of us have forgotten our high school orcollege U.S. history which covered labor organizing violencein the late 19th  and early 20th centuries.  Violence by theKKK against blacks, primarily in the South, resulted in manylynchings in the 20s and 30s.  There was more racially relatedviolence in the 1960s and 70s during the civil rightsmovement. The Vietnam War protesters sometimes became violent,as at the Democratic Convention in Chicago.  This country hasnot been immune from political violence, but most of us haveshort memories.Donohue believes that since the Oklahoma City bombing somemilitia groups have disbanded and others have goneunderground.  He bases this observation on informationreceived from the Southern Poverty Law Center's Klanwatchgroup, where he has done pro-bono work.The Symposium, "Terrorism: Past, Present, and Future" wassponsored by the University of Illinois at Chicago, Office ofInternational Criminal Justice, July 31-August 3, 1995.  PeterProbst, a Defense Department international crime specialiststated, "Ten years ago, most terrorist groups were politicallymotivated...now you have a whole range of new groups."  Hesuggested that cults, ethnic, and religious groups will nothesitate to cause large numbers of civilian casualties whilepolitical terrorists have avoided this to keep from losingpolitical support.Steven Sloan's paper,  "Terrorism: How Vulnerable is theUnited States?", was published by the Strategic StudiesInstitute of the Army War College in May 1995.  Sloan pointsout that threats from fundamentalists of all religious groupscannot be ignored. He suggests that such groups might receivesupport or be joined by domestic religious extremists.  Thesegroups might also obtain support from cultists, survivalists,or neo-fascists who have their own reasons for rejecting theexisting social, economic, and political order, waitinginstead for their own Armageddons.A unique aspect of Sloan's paper is his suggestion that therole that could be played by  apolitical terrorists, who areinto violence and intimidation as an aspect of their criminalactivities.  Drug gangs and other criminal enterprises ininner-city America could become the basis for such operations.They could corrupt local government with their vast funds.These groups could use their terrorist tactics to "shake downthe neighborhood" or blackmail the entire city.  Theirfinancial resources would enable them to acquire a significantarsenal of weapons to challenge local law enforcement andimplement acts of violence on a level on previously seen inthe U.S.Most of us think about terrorist attacks on buildings, planes,and people.  However, Frederick Cohen in his recent book,Protection and Security on Information Superhighway, discussesthe concept of  "infrastructure warriors" who would attackelectrical power grids or eliminate telecommunicationscapabilities.  He cites an article in the July/August 1993issue of Wired magazine which named the top 10 U.S.infrastructure targets.  These include the Culpeper, VAtelephone switch that handles federal fund transfers and theWorldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS).Another example he gives is a paper presented to the NavalPostgraduate School in August of 1993 which claims that 20people and $1,000,000 can bring the U.S. to its knees.We did not learn much from the West L.A. situation describedby Frank McGuire.  Those in the contingency planning fieldknow that the effect of the World Trade Center bombing lastedonly a few months. However, research published in InformationWeek showed that nearly 40 percent of the businesses in theWorld Trade Center when the bomb exploded are no longer inbusiness.As we can see from the examples cited above, there are manypossibilities for how terrorism can be viewed in the nearfuture within the U. S.  We can review past incidents bothhere an overseas to understand tactics used against specifictypes of targets.  We can improve our intelligence gatheringto obtain a better understanding of potential threats.  We canpractice "target hardening" to encourage the adversary moveaway from us to a weaker target.  Finally, we must be have ourcrisis management, contingency, and business resumption plansdeveloped and tested - just in case.  Regardless of what thefuture holds, these steps are reasonable and prudent.Lloyd F.

As a result of that, Bouchard said that he will belikely to call another referendum, but that it would not take placebefore April 1997.  He went on to predict that the next referendumwould result in success for Quebec's seperatist movement.  While theaccuracy of that prediction remains to be seen, it is true to saythat Bouchard's dynamic entry into the debate over separatism in therun-up to the last referendum was largely responsible for the nearvictory achieved by the PQ then.  With Bouchard at the helmthroughout, the possibility of a sovereign Quebec before the turn ofthe millennium cannot be ruled out.Meanwhile, Bouchard's major opponent during the Quebec affair,Federal Prime Minister Jean Chritien, has come in for severecriticism from within the country's ruling Liberal Party for hishandling of the issue.  Prior to the referendum, Chritien had assuredanglophone Canadians that there was nothing to worry about in Quibicand that the province would not be leaving the federation as a resultof the referendum because the separatists had no chance of winningit.  As it turns out, the separatists came within a whisker.  Thelast week of campaigning saw Chritiin back-pedaling furiously tooffer several concessions to the seperatists in order to prevent agovernment defeat.Now that the federalists' panic has receded, the whispering campaignhas begun.  Reports suggest that some within Chritien's party feelthat he is no longer the best man to ensure that Quibec remainswithin the federation.  With Bouchard in place as the province'spremier as of the beginning of 1996, this feeling may well increaseto proportions at which Chritien's 31 year-old career in politicscould be threatened.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CANADAECONOMYThe latest OECD report on Canada suggests that, while the economy islikely to see some degree of recovery during 1996, high levels ofprovincial and federal debt will continue to present considerableproblems to the country's ability to weather any further economicdownturn, and may result in greater volatility of the Canadiandollar.Real GDP growth is estimated to rise by 3.1% in 1996, with the bulkof growth coming from a 4.5% expansion in the second half of theyear.  The organization sees this growth coming as a result of abroadening of the base of economic activity from the largelyexport-led recovery that has been seen to date.  Despite an expectedincrease in the levels of private consumption and housing as a resultof wage increases  in the export sector, widespread wage increasesare not expected, keeping down the magnitude of such privateconsumption rises.  Public sector consumption spending is expected,and hoped, to remain weak as commitment to fiscal austeritycontinues.  Inflation is forecast to be around the middle of the Bankof Canada's target range of 1-3%.Canada's ratio of public sector debt to GDP now stands at some 65%,with interest payments exceeding government deficits.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CHILEBASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . . .President Eduardo Frei (since March 1994)Head of Government . . . . . . . . .President Frei (since March 1994)Area . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 756,626 sq. kmPopulation  (1995) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14.26 million*GDP (1995) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .US$59.85 billion*GDP per head (1995). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .US$4,195*GDP Growth (1995). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.2%Inflation Rate (current) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .8.0%*Foreign Debt Service (% of total exports, current) . . . . . . 17.0%*Current Account Ratio (% of total exports, current). . . . . . .0.0%*International Liquidity (months of import cover, current). . . .10.5*Currency and Exchange Rate (12/15/95). .Chilean peso (Cp) 405.55/US$*ICRG RISK CATEGORY . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .LOW* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CHILEPOLITICSFormer dictator, Augusto Pinochet celebrated his 80th birthday at theend of November and signaled his determination to remain at thecenter of Chilean politics until his constitutional term as commanderof the army expires in 1998.  Pinochet's remarks will not have beenlost on President Eduardo Frei, who has attempted to challenge the"constitutional safeguards" put in place by Pinochet when he handedover government to civilian rule after the 1989 election of PatricioAylwin Azocar.Under the arrangements that Pinochet made, both he, and nine militaryappointed Senators remain in place until 1998.  Frei wantsdesperately to get rid of them because his ruling coalition is threeseats short of a majority in the upper House.  Doubtless Frei wouldalso like to see an end to the need to spend some 39% of the publicsector wage bill, equivalent to 2.8% of GDP on the armed forces.Another of Pinochet's parting gifts was to ensure that legislationwas passed that meant that no one could interfere with the military'sbudget.In addition to his comments about staying on to what may well be abitter end in terms of his relationship with Frei, Pinochet has beenexplaining that his 17 years in power were a "soft" dictatorship.  Hewent on to defend officers of his regime who are now in prison forhuman rights' abuses and suggested that they had been imprisoneddespite any proof of wrong-doing.  One cannot help but wonder howsuch comments were received by the families of those hundreds ofpeople who disappeared under the former dictator's regime and willnever see an eightieth birthday.They will at least have been cheered to hear that former torturechief, Manuel Contreras, who was convicted of murder in June, hasrecovered from the hernia that had made him so poorly that he had tobe detained in a Naval hospital.  In a move that Frei himself willdoubtless applaud, Contreras' recovery has resulted in him finallybeing able to be transferred to prison to serve his sentence.  In alast ditch attempt at avoiding such a fate and a final display of hisboundless bravery, Contreras, who is believed to have beenresponsible for the torture and murder of many of those whodisappeared, staged a hunger strike in October.

Figueres and the PLN ran on a platform of blaming thePUSC for implementing free market economic reforms that resulted inhigher unemployment and a host of other social problems.Despite Figueres' stated opposition to free market policies andIMF-sponsored structural adjustment programs, the recent decline inwhat has been one of the region's richest economies has led him toaccept the need for reform.  This has been further underlined by thecountry's high level of debt.  At an estimated US$4 billion, foreigndebt is equivalent to nearly 60% GDP and generates  a debt serviceratio of some 17%.  Internally, the PLN inherited a fiscal deficit of8% from its predecessors.  Attempts to blame the outgoing Calderonadministration for the poor state of the country's finances, whilereasonably correct, have done little to calm the ire of the CostaRican people as the austerity measures put in place by the PLN havebitten hard.The hardships being faced by the population resulted in a wave ofstrikes throughout 1995.  Public sector unions exercise considerablestrength within the political system of Costa Rica and such publicshows of dissent have, in the past, often resulted in changes ingovernment policy irrespective of which party has been in power.It would seem that this is no longer the case, however.  Some 50,000Costa Rican teachers held a month long strike toward the end of 1995,denouncing both the government and the opposition for the handling ofeconomic policy and in particular the public sector layoffs that haveoccurred and the increases in basic utility charges that have beenintroduced.Traditionally supporters of the NLP, the teachers have accused thegovernment of failing to meet its campaign pledges and has said thatthe PLN now lacks credibility.  Unfortunately for the teachers, thechances of a government turnaround appear slim.  The economic reformsbeing put in place by the PLN are an integral part of the IMF standbyagreement sought by the government as part of the process of puttingthe country's economic house in order.  The situation is likely toget worse before it gets better.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CUBABASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . . . .President Fidel Castro Rus (since 1976)Head of Government . . . . . . . . . . .President Castro (since 1976)Area . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 114,661 sq. kmPopulation  (1995) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11.17 million*GDP (1995) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .US$19.83 billion*GDP per head (1995). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .US$1,775*GDP Growth (1995). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2.5%*Inflation Rate (current) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15.0%*Foreign Debt Service (% of total exports, current) . . . . . . . .N/ACurrent Account Ratio (% of total exports, current). . . . . . . .N/AInternational Liquidity (months of import cover, current). . . . .N/ACurrency and Exchange Rate (12/15/95). . . . . .Cuban peso (Cp)1/US$*ICRG RISK CATEGORY . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . HIGH* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CUBAPOLITICSDetermined to circumvent the efforts of some sections of the USlegislature to destroy the economy of his comparatively tiny country,President Castro has been busy courting a wide variety of partnersfor trade and cooperation during the last couple of months of 1995.Increasingly it seems to be the USA rather than Cuba that is beingviewed as intransigent and unreasonable.Perhaps in final recognition that a large section of theinternational community looks none too kindly on the US stance onCuba, the American Senate passed a considerably watered-down versionof the Helms bill aimed at tightening the US embargo at the end ofOctober.  It was not watery enough, however, to prevent the passageof a UN General Assembly resolution at the beginning of Novembercalling for an end to the US economic embargo.Despite the resolution, some members of the US lower House are stillhoping to reintroduce some of the stiffer measures ditched by theSenate when the two bills come up for reconciliation.  But withCastro enjoying cordial relations in so many other places at present,the effects of any such moves might well have been neutralized beforethey can take place.Meetings between Castro and the representatives of several othercountries including South Africa, Uruguay, Vietnam and Mongolia havetaken place recently.  All reported to have gone well and resultedeither in the signing of cooperation and/or trade agreements or havegone some way toward such agreements.In addition, Cuba and Russia have concluded a series of protocolswhich the two countries describe as amounting to a new stage in tradeand financial relations between them.  Russia has agreed to a sugarfor oil deal which will ensure that what Castro has described as the"Achilles' heel" of the Cuban economy will be protected to the tuneof 4.5 million tonnes of oil in return for 1.5 tonnes of sugar.  Withworld sugar production expected to top the 120 million tonne mark forthe first time in 1995/96, Castro will be particularly satisfied tohave arranged a deal that takes Cuban sugar out of a potentiallyfalling market.It should, however, be noted that neither country has yet completeddelivery of 1995's barter deal, which involved one million tons ofsugar for three million tons of oil.  Should things not work out,however, a further source of oil is likely to be Angola, with whomCuba signed a cooperation accord at the end of OctoberIn addition to the sugar deal, Russia has promised to give Cubaenough money and technology to finish building a Soviet-era nuclearreactor in the country.  Reportedly, Russia is to provide US$349million and Cuba US$208 million towards the project.  A furtherUS$200 million is to be raised from an international consortiumincluding Latin American and Western countries.  Of the LatinAmerican contingent, Brazil will almost certainly be a part.  Recentdiscussions between the two countries are believed to be likely toresult in the signing of a nuclear cooperation pact in the nearfuture.Other recent negotiations have resulted in an investment agreementbeing signed with Vietnam, the establishment of diplomatic relationswith Kenya and a deal in which Colombia has agreed to purchasevaccines from Cuba.Still more negotiations took place in November between Cuba and theEuropean Union (EU).  According to the EU these have a good chance ofleading to the signing of an economic and trade agreement, providedthat Castro is willing to accept some form of transition todemocracy.  So far, however, the Havana regime appearsunenthusiastic.  Alongside increased confidence of an economicrecovery in 1996, Castro's preparedness to spurn the double-handedapproach of the EU is perhaps as a result of a warming of relationsbetween Havana and Beijing.The Cuban President made a reportedly highly successful trip toChina, again in November.  The visit coincided, strangely enough,with a six day visit by general secretary of the Communist Party ofVietnam.  Neither Cuba nor Vietnam have had particularly cordialrelations with China in the past, but the shrinking world ofcommunism seems to be uniting former adversaries in a struggle forsurvival.In his state of the nation speech in July last year, Castro said thatwhile he was prepared to go some way toward capitalism in order toreform his country, he had no intention of giving up his ideology.His visit to China has been seen as an exercise in learning how thetwo may be combined.  While the discussions that took place inBeijing remain largely unknown, the Chinese foreign ministry did saythat at wide range of bilateral issues were be dealt with and thatparticular emphasis will be given to economic development.  Thepossibility of a trilateral agreement between Cuba , China andVietnam was, however, ruled out.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CUBAFINANCEMuch of Castro's confidence in dealing with the internationalcommunity stems from the fact that, despite all the odds beingstacked against it, the Cuban economy continues to grow.  Latestfigures released by the Planning Ministry suggest that GDP growth in1995 will reach 2.5%, a significant advance on the 0.7% growthrecorded in 1994.In a move aimed at re-starting talks with western creditors, thegovernment has released an astoundingly detailed report on thecountry and its debt.  The report puts total debt at US$9.1 billionat the end of 1994 and for the first time publishes balance ofpayments' figures using IMF-recommended methods.  The data, which hadbeen specifically requested by creditors, shows an improvement in thecurrent account deficit from US$371.6 million in 1993 to US$81.3million in 1994.  The decline in deficit is attributed to an increasein exports and a rise in net current transfers, mostly from donationsand remittances from Cubans living abroad.Cuba's parlous financial state means that it badly needs to gainaccess to the medium and long term debt arrangements that have beendenied it since debt talks with the Paris Club of internationalcreditors stalled in 1986.  The release of this latest economicreport is the first step along that road, but there is still someconsiderable distance to go.  The journey will be made that much moredifficult by the fact that Cuba is not a member of the IMF and thechances of the USA allowing it to rejoin are slim.In the meantime, not to be outdone, Castro has told the people ofCuba that the "capitalist evil" of income tax will be falling uponthem again as of January 1996.  For the time being the tax will bepayable on hard currency earnings only, but the writing is on thewall for taxation of the relatively low national state salaries.In a further move aimed at easing the country's financial problems,two more foreign banks, France's Societe Generale and Banco Sabadellof Spain, have been authorized to open branches in Cuba.  These twobring to 11 the number of foreign banks that have been grantedlicenses to operate in Cuba over the last few months.Credit and loan agreements have been signed with several of theforeign banks now represented in the country and, although figureshave not been released, it is believed that the deals involvefinancing for Cuba's sugar, nickel and rice production and for foodimports.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996EL SALVADORBASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . . . . .President Armando Calderon Sol (1994)Head of Government . . . . . . . . . . . . .President Calderon (1994)Area . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .21,393 sq. kmPopulation  (1995) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .5.73 million*GDP (1995) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The protesting soldiers held the inhabitants hostage forthree hours, demanding that the government fulfill the promises itmade under the Chapultepec peace agreement concerning job trainingand the granting of loans.  This was the latest in a series ofdemonstrations carried out by demobilized fighters demanding helpwith their reintegration into society.The incident, in which one of the former soldiers was killed, gaverise to persistent rumors of an imminent coup attempt as armoredvehicles, troops and helicopters reportedly took up positions aroundthe city.  However, the threat of a coup was dismissed by Calderon,who said that the rumors were of a plot to destabilize the country,hatched by the FMLN and the working classes.  According to thegovernment, evidence of the plot had been uncovered and the heads ofmetropolitan riot police and mobile units were given details in aspecial memorandum.The memorandum, which apparently details several planned activitiesby labor organizations aimed at "paralyzing the country and provokinginsurrection", was condemned by FMLN leader, Leonel Gonzalez, asuntrue.  According to Gonzalez, the army and PNC intelligenceservices are deliberately creating an atmosphere of mistrust in thecountry in order that the government can justifiably carry out asecurity clampdown to stifle opposition to its widely dislikedeconomic program.However, FMLN deputy, Miguel Saenz Varela has suggested that themilitary maneuvers were indeed indicative of a coup attempt in themaking.  According to Saenz, it is not the government seeking toclamp down on its opposition that has resulted in the increasedtensions within the country, but unidentified forces who are intenton discrediting the transition to democracy.For its part, the army refutes suggestions it would be party to anycoup attempt.  Defense Minister General Humberto Corado said that themilitary regretted the death that had accompanied the PNC actionagainst the former soldiers, but pointed out that the overridingpriority for authorities was the restoration of order.  Without that,said Corado, "regretful consequences for the country" might ensue.The deafeningly loud unspoken message seemed to be that suchregretful consequences would of course be avoided were the army toestablish military rule.Despite Corado's insistence that that is not the army's aim, hisexplanation of the military presence in the capital, which includedthe "buzzing" of the Presidential Palace, seems a little thin.  Heclaims the soldiers were there as part of a military sporting event.He offered no explanation as to why those who, presumably, shouldeither have been spectators or competitors, were driving armoredtrucks through the streets of San Salvador.  Given that no coup hasyet taken place, however,  it is perhaps reasonable to assume thatany, purely coincidental, messages that were given by the military'sactions have been taken on board by Calderon.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996GUATEMALABASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . .

The remainder of the vote was dividedamongst the confusing array of candidates that had never really stoodmuch chance.  These included a former defense minister who had beenfound guilty of human rights abuses by a US court and an formerattorney-general who was remanded in custody under the lastgovernment for swindling his aunt.Despite winning the poll, Azru failed to gain the 50% of the votenecessary to avoid a rerun.  This has been scheduled for January 7.The likelihood is that Azru will be successful on that occasion.While Portillo is a fellow conservative, he suffers from a degree ofguilt by association in that Montt is barred from standing in his ownright because of his 17 month long de facto rule in 1982-83.  Thatperiod has been described by some as one of the most brutal periodsof Guatemalan history.The relatively low turnout, at just 40% of the 3.7 million eligibleto vote was blamed in part on the large number of candidates causingconfusion amongst the electorate.  Hopefully, with the field a littleclearer for the January poll, there will be an increased interest inwhat is only the country's third presidential election since itgained independence in 1986.At the time of this report, no agreement has been reached with theURNG concerning an additional cease-fire to cover the run-offelection.  Despite pleas to extend the cease-fire past the November13 cutoff, the URNG refused.  The guerrilla organization did,however, say that it was ready to negotiate a permanent bilateraltruce with the government and that its commitment to achieving thatend was proven by the peaceful election period.  The organization hassaid that it supports neither candidate in the run-off, but there islittle likelihood of disruption to voting.The transitional government of current President Ramiro de LeonCarpio will leave office on January 14 when the winner of the run-offwill take over for a four year term.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996GUATEMALAECONOMYIn one of its last economic moves in office, the government broughtGuatemala into line with El Salvador and Nicaragua by joining inCentral America's tariff normalization policy.

MODERATE* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MEXICOPOLITICSThe problems being experienced by the ruling InstitutionalRevolutionary Party (PRI) in the wake of the late 1994 devaluationcrisis were underlined once again in October when Manuel Camacho,former Mayor of Mexico City and once-upon-a-time likely candidate tosucceed President Zedillo, resigned from the party.In explaining his resignation, Camacho said that he was not in favorof cosmetic electoral reform intended to artificially prolong thePRI's time in office.  Rather, said Camacho, he is interested in realpolitical change and the advancement of democracy.  He intends toform a new coalition to achieve this out of what he sees as thedisaffected groups within both the PRI and the left-wing Party of theDemocratic Revolution (PRD).How successful he will be remains to be seen.  Despite sufferingsevere criticism and several high profile gubernatorial electiondefeats since the devaluation crisis, the PRI is still a fairlycohesive unit.  The party responded to its poor electoral showings bymaking several personnel changes in August 1995 in an attempt torevitalize grassroots support.  Recent elections at the municipallevel suggest that while a resurgence in PRI support has not yetarrived, the rot has perhaps been stopped.  While it is true to saythat the PRI is struggling to become more of a political party andless of a tool of the President, it is not currently likely to breakdown to the extent that would be necessary for Camacho to create arealistic alternative.The PRI does suffer from the fact that it has, in the past, been heldtogether more by power and patronage than by a common ideology.  Thishas been underlined by the, almost meteoric, rise in popularity ofthe National Action Party (PAN).  In common with many left-wingparties over the last couple of years, the PRD has suffered somethingof an identity crisis which has translated itself into poor electoralresults and caused a deal of internal division for the party.  Thelack of ideological direction on the part of the PRI has led afundamentally conservative electorate to move to the right, and intothe waiting arms of the PAN.  The PAN's capitalization on the rightwing mood of the population has further consolidated its ideologicalposition.  The PRD has seen its support dwindle, but it appears thatthe party has rallied round its leaders in spite of the tensions thatthis has brought.Given that both the PRI and the PRD seem to be wrestling with theirproblems but staying pretty much together, and that the popularground is being seized by the PAN, it is difficult to see just whereCamacho might find room to form a power base.  It is the PAN that hasstolen the governorships from the PRI and the likelihood is that,come the congressional elections in 1997, it will be the PAN thatpresents to biggest problem for the PRI.  How well the PRI stands upto the challenge will depend, in large part, on how successful it isin remodeling itself into a modern political party in the meantime.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MEXICOECONOMYThe government launched its Alliance for Economic Recovery at thebeginning of November in a bid to aid recovery and provide leeway forincreased social and investment spending while remaining within itstarget of a balanced budget for 1996.Under the plan, which was reached in conjunction with trade union andbusiness leaders, the minimum wage will be increased by 21% in twoinstallments.  The first took place in December 1995 and the secondis due in April this year.  In addition to the wage increase, highergrants are to be given to the unemployed and further help will beprovided for the temporary jobs program.  Businesses will receive taxincentives including a commitment to suspend asset taxes for smalland medium-sized business during 1996.  Tax on investment that isover and above 1995 levels will be waived and tax credits will begiven to companies that take on new workers.The government has also undertaken to help in the drive toward fiscalstability by staggering price increases for gas and electricity, bothof which are still currently sold by parastatals.  The governmentintends to make a 4.75% cut in real spending during 1996 and isbanking on the increased economic activity that will come as a resultof the Alliance providing the rise in tax revenues necessary to makeadditional social spending measures feasible.The plan has had a mixed reception with some economists worried aboutthe reliance on growth to ensure increased tax receipts.  Accordingto Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, the measures will mean a fiscalrelaxation of about 0.5% GDP which will not be enough to push thegovernment off its balanced budget target.  The plan is aimed at aninflation rate on the year of 20% and growth of 3% of GDP.  Ortiz isof the opinion that recovery will be export led and that this sectorwill provide growth of 1.4 percentage points.  Given that thegovernment expects an export volume growth of 12% and a value growthof 18% in US dollar terms, the peso is expected to strengthen.  Nofigures for such a strengthening have been released, however.  Thegovernment has simply said that the floating rate will continue.Confidence in the currency's ability to achieve additional value andsurvive a floating exchange rate system got off to a poor start.  Thepeso plunged to its lowest ever level against the US dollar justseven days after the government announced the Alliance.  A ten pointinterest rate rise did nothing to strengthen the currency as it cameunder increased pressure from speculators and the Central Bank wasforce to intervene several times to defend it.  Even then, suchdefense was unable to stop the currency losing close to one fifth ofits value against the US dollar in the space of two weeks.Further distressing news for the government came toward the end ofNovember with figures being released that suggest that the Mexicaneconomy is continuing to contract at a worrying rate.  According tothe figures, GDP fell by 9.6% in the third quarter of 1995 comparedto 1994.  This followed a second quarter decline of 10.5%.  Thefigures suggest that the government's estimate of a 5.5% contractionfor 1995 may prove to be optimistic.  Should that be the case, thetarget figure for next year's recovery may slip beyond reach.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996NICARAGUABASIC DATAHead of State. . .

Upto October this year, however, these reserves were in deficit to thetune of US$115.2 million.  According to Pereira, the situation isbetter than it was last year, but he recognizes that the continuingdeficit in international reserves threatens the country'smacroeconomic stability.  The reason for the lack of progress in thisarea is, according to Pereira, due to unspecified problems with theNicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute (Telcor).Another indicator that the government will not be able to meet thestopgap loan agreements is the fact that the net internal credit tothe non-financial public sector was not to exceed Nc308.4 million byDecember 31.  However, reports issued by the Economic StudiesManagement of the Central Bank registered credits to this sector ofNc748.3 million up to November 9.  This put the government Nc439.9million off target with more than a month to go to the deadline.Finally, the National Development Bank was supposed to deposit US$30million a month into the Central Bank from October.  The US$60million that should, therefore, have arrived by the end of Novemberfailed to do so.The fact that these three goals have not been met makes it likely,according to Pereira, that the IMF will withdraw its help at thebeginning of 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996PANAMABASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . . . . . .

MODERATE* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996PANAMAPOLITICSThe prospect of a continued US military presence in Panama after 1999looks less certain after the postponement of talks between the twocountries aimed at coming to an agreement over the terms of anextension.Under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed during former US presidentJimmy Carter's term of office, the US presence that the Hay-BuneauVarilla Treaty granted in perpetuity in 1903 must come to an end inthe year 2000.  Talks aimed at an extension of this period began inSeptember 1995.  There was immediate confusion as to which side hadinitiated the talks.  Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladaresinsisted that it was the USA that broached the subject, but this iswidely believed to have been a face-saving exercise on his part aspressure began to build over the imminent loss of one of the majorplanks in the Panamanian economy.Balladares has explained the postponement in terms of it being a badtime for the USA to deal with the issue given the problems it ishaving over the budget.  This again, however, is likely to be lessthan the whole story.  In reality, it is more likely that Balladareshas asked for far too much of what he terms "clear economic benefits"for Panama that are the prerequisite for him considering a continuedforeign military presence in his country.Opinion polls suggest that 75% of Panamanians want the US troops tostay.  The US military presence pumps around US$400 million into thecountry's tiny economy each year and supports some 18,000 jobs.Official unemployment is at 14% but the true figure is probablydouble that.  In addition, the country's traditional sources ofincome have come under threat over recent years.  Once a thrivingoffshore banking center, international insistence that rules betightened to stem the flow of dirty money being laundered in thecountry have put paid to much of that sector.  Meanwhile,deregulation in the USA has damaged Panama's erstwhile equallysuccessful shipping and insurance sectors, while the entry of Sweden,Finland and Austria into the European Union's controlled bananamarket has reduced exports of what was the country's biggest foreignexchange earner by 20% this year.  Balladares is not really in aposition to demand rent from the USA in return for allowing it tocontinue to prop up the economy, but it would appear that demand ithe has.In fairness, it is understandable that Balladares should want abetter deal for Panama.  It was, after all the USA which, firstthrough sanctions and then through its invasion to remove formerdictator Manuel Noriega, devastated the economy in the first place.Estimates put the real cost to Panama at US$4-6 billion.  US economicaid since the 1989 invasion totals a mere US$700 million incomparison, and the situation has not been helped by Panamanian bankslosing a further US$2 billion during the Mexican devaluation crisisof 1994.However, there is a good chance that talks will resume and that somecompromise will be made because Panama has the Canal and that is ofconsiderable strategic importance to the USA.  About 13,000 ships usethe Canal each year and this figure is growing at an annual 2%.  WithPresident Clinton pushing for even greater levels of free tradewithin the Americas, that figure is set to rise over the next decade.Given that, the USA will almost certainly be back to talk toBalladares, but for the meantime, it would appear that he hasoverstepped the mark and the US administration has decided to givehim a little time to reflect on his country's situation.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996UNITED STATES OF AMERICABASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . . .President William J.

VERY LOW* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996UNITED STATES OF AMERICAPOLITICSIt would not be entirely undeserved for President Bill Clinton toallow himself a smile of satisfaction in the privacy of the Ovaloffice over the events of the last two months.  He has received aconsiderable boost to his opinion poll ratings ahead of next year'spresidential election; he is not, again according to latest opinionpoll results, being held responsible for the increasinglydangerous-looking budget battle; He has brokered possibly the mostimportant peace deal in Europe since the end of the Second World War;and secured an advance in the peace talks in Northern Ireland.  And,last but not least, the only man who has so far looked remotelylikely to present a challenge to his continuation in office next yearhas decided not to run for the Republican presidential nomination.That is not, however, to say that problems do not remain.  Mostpressing of these is the battle between Clinton and the Republicanparty over the 1996 budget and extension of the current federal debtceiling of US$4,900 billion.A late November compromise between the protaganists has ensured thatgovernment funding continued until mid-December, but it isessentially superficial and agreement on the real issues that liebehind opposing spending suggestions remains some way off.  Tensionover the budget stand-off increased substantially in mid-Novemberwhen some 800,000 federal employees were sent home.  This came as aresult of the failure of the two sides to reach agreement on acompromise over the passage of appropriations bills, which containRepublican spending cuts, to areas that Clinton is determined toprotect.  Visitors choosing to see the sights had picked a bad day,as both the Grand Canyon and the Statue of Liberty were closed to thepublic.  Rather more importantly, staff responsible for ensuring thepayment of pensions and some other state benefits were laid off,leaving many Americans in difficult financial circumstances.In order to ease the situation, Clinton did sign some appropriationsbills for individual departments.  This resulted in some governmentworkers returning to their posts, but did nothing to end the impasseover the "reconciliation" bill passed by the House ofRepresentatives.  That bill includes some US$245 billion in tax cutsand reforms of the social security net, both of which Clintoncontinues to refuse to sign.The compromise that gave rise to a continuation of government fundingfor all departments until December 15 was reached when Clinton agreedto the signing of a non-binding Congressional resolution that thefederal budget be balanced by 2002.  This seven year period for theremoval of the budget deficit has been the central feature ofRepublican budget proposals.  Clinton's apparent climb-down from hisearlier suggestion of a 10 year period for balancing the budget was,in fact, something of a non-move in that the depth of cuts requiredto achieve the seven year target depend quite heavily on whicheconomic growth figures for the period are used.  Congress insists onusing projections made by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) andtheir spending cuts rely on these figures.  The Clintonadministration, however, has its own set of figures that are lesspessimistic than those of the CBO, and would, as a result, requireless damaging cuts than those proposed by the Republicans.The agreement made by Clinton does not, however, give the last wordon these projections to the CBO.  Rather, Clinton has said that he isprepared to balance the budget over seven years, but only inconjunction with figures resulting from an administration and privatesector review of the CBO projections.  Given the 4.2% growth in GNPin the last quarter of 1995, the projections resulting from such ajoint enterprise are likely to be a deal more optimistic than thosecurrently available from the CBO.  The difference is of greatimportance in that some estimates suggest that it could result in areduction in planned Republican spending cuts of hundreds of billionsof dollars over the forecast period.Further to that, the text of the agreement quite clearly includesprovision for the "protection of future generations" by means ofensuring the solvency of Medicare, the adequate funding of Medicaidand the promotion of "tax policies for the working poor".  Thislatter is a reference to the Earned Income Tax Credit system whichRepublicans want to get rid of.  Newt Gingrich, Republican Speaker inthe Lower House and architect of the Republican spending cuts hasaccepted that the agreement puts the centerpiece US$245 billion taxcut policy very much back on the negotiating table.Meanwhile, attempts to overcome the impasse over the raising of thefederal debt ceiling before the USA defaults on its internationalobligations have met with less success.  This is the other area inwhich Republicans have attempted to link, to Clinton, unpalatablelegislation to the debt extension bill in order to force throughtheir wishes.  Crisis was averted in November when TreasurySecretary, Robert Rubin, converted US$61.3 billion worth ofnon-marketable treasury bonds into cash and auctioned a further US$48billion worth of Treasury bills in order to cover the US$102 billionworth of debt that came due.  This situation cannot go on forever,however.  Rubin remains confident that the Treasury can get throughDecember by such methods, but crunch time will arrive in mid-January.The political fallout from these issues looks to be landing squarelyon the Republicans at present.  Opinion polls suggest that twice asmany Americans support Clinton's refusal to bow to Republicanpressure than disagree with it.This is just one more indicator of the problems being faced by aRepublican party that seems increasingly to be wide of the mark ofpublic opinion.  Following the decision of General Colin Powell notto stand for the Republican presidential nomination, the party lookedtoward Gingrich as a possible candidate to consolidate the image of afloundering opposition.  He too, however, has declined suchinvitations.  Given his plummeting popularity ratings over the lastfew weeks, the Republican party might now breathe a sigh of reliefthat he has chosen not to spearhead their presidential bid.  Pressurewould appear to be getting to Gingrich.  His recent outbursts includeblaming the welfare state for a particularly horrific triple murderand admitting to allowing perceived snubs on board the presidentialplane on route to the funeral of assassinated Israeli leader, YitzhakRabin, to play a part in his decision to bring government to astandstill.  Such respectively ludicrous and petulant behavior hasdone little to endear him to a public which has already signaled itsdistaste over his attacks on the most vulnerable within Americansociety.In addition, Gingrich faces investigation over charges of violatingcampaign finance laws filed against him by the Federal ElectionCommission.  According to the FEC, an organization called the GrandOld Party Action Committee (Gopac), chaired by Gingrich since 1986and used by him as a vehicle for regenerating the party's grass rootssupport, channeled some US$250,000 into Gingrich's campaign forreelection as a congressman in Georgia in 1990.  This, says the FEC,was illegal because Gopac did not formally register as a federalpolitical action committee.  If found guilty, Gingrich stands to befined a considerable amount, not to mention the damage to whateverpolitical standing he has remaining at that time.So, with Gingrich out of the frame, the Republican party's onlyobvious hope for the presidency now lies with Senator Robert Dole.Dole himself, has suffered something of a setback recently though.In a straw poll in Florida amongst 3,300 registered Republicans thatis widely regarded as the start of the nominations process, Dole tookan unconvincing 33% of the vote.  Senator Phil Gramm of Texas came insecond with 26% and former Tennessee governor, Lamar Alexander,polled 22.5%.  The fact that Dole was unable to secure a greaterpercentage lead over his supposedly little-hoper opponents can onlypresent further worries for the Republican party as a whole.These worries must have been heightened yet further by the party'spoor showing in off-year elections throughout the country.  Despitebeing convinced that for the first time since the civil war,Republicans would control both chambers in the Virginia legislature,the Democrats retained their 52-47 majority in the lower house anddrew 20-20 with the Republicans in the state senate.  The castingvote in the senate goes, however, to a Democrat.  Similar resultswere posted in several other polls, but the Republicans did hold onto the governorship of Kirk Fordice in Mississippi.All this is, of course, cheering news to Clinton.  Provided thepresident is able to secure the welfare system protection he wantswhile still reducing the period in which the deficit will be clearedto seven years, both approved by the electorate, he will haveachieved an important compromise that could well ensure his return tooffice.Clinton is not unassailable, however. Implementation of the so-calledDayton peace agreement signed between the Presidents of Bosnia,Serbia and Croatia in Paris in mid December will require the presenceof some 20,000 US troops to be deployed in Bosnia.  This isparticularly contentious domestically.  A majority of Republicans,and probably a majority of the American people, fear a re-ignition ofthe war in Bosnia that will result in the deaths of many USservicemen.Clinton has achieved wide recognition for his part in the brokerageof the deal, but his decision to send troops could well backfireshould considerable US casualties ensue.  While it is traditional forthe electorate to rally round a President in conflict situations, thelast thing Clinton will want to see in an election year is largenumbers of body-bags returning home.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: THE AMERICAS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996UNITED STATES OF AMERICAECONOMYDiscussion over the possibility of an interest rate cut surfacedagain in November following the release of economic indicator figuresthat suggest that the pace of growth in the economy is slowing.Industrial production fell in October, with output down by 0.3% toregister its first decline in six months.  Some 0.2% of this decreasecan be attributed to the strike at aircraft maker, Boeing, butaccording to analysts, even with this taken into consideration, mostsectors were flat or slightly down.  Output of consumer goods,business equipment and construction supplies were down by 0.5, 0.8,and 0.6% respectively.  These figures were reflected in thePurchasing Managers' Index of manufacturing activity which fell by0.3% in November to 46.5%.  A figure of below 50% indicates acontraction in manufacturing and the November figure is the sixth inseven months to indicate a decline, taking the index closer to the44.5% figure at which the economy as a whole is said to be incontraction.Consumer confidence figures as measured by the New York businessanalysis group, The Conference Board, remain strong.  The Board'sfigure for November rose to 101.4 as against 96.3 in October.Readings of above 100 have traditionally been associated with periodsof rapid economic growth.  The apparent strength of confidence amongconsumers is not, however, expected to translate itself into highretail sales figures for Christmas.  The Commerce Departmentregistered a 0.2% decline in sales in October .  According to thedepartment, high levels of indebtedness will prevent consumerconfidence boosting this position for the time being.As for inflation, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3% inOctober as a result of sharp increases in the cost of housing, energyand clothing.  The core CPI, which discounts food and energy prices,also showed a 0.3% rise.  Despite most economists now believing thatthe economy is slowing and will probably only post a quite moderate2.4% GDP growth figure for 1996, the possibility of upward pressureon inflation still makes imminent cuts in interest rates unlikely.The Fed is not known for impulsive moves and, in our opinion,decisions on whether or not to give the economy a moderate boost willnot take place until early next year.Foreign TradeSluggish domestic demand has been held responsible for a secondconsecutive fall in the US monthly trade deficit figures.  Thecommerce department said that the deficit fell to US$8.3 billion inSeptember as against expectations that it would be as high as US$9.5billion.  This comes on top of the fall in August to US$8.4 billion.Within the figures lurks a decline in the bilateral deficit withJapan, subject of much disagreement between the two countries oflate, from US$5.1 billion to US$4.3 billion, its lowest level in twoyears.Exports rose 1.6% between August and September to US$67.2 billion.This more than offset the percentage rise, at 1.4%, of imports whichincreased in value to US$75.6 billion.  Exports were 10.3% higherthan in the September 1994 and imports were up by 8.4% over the sameperiod.  The deficit was US$90 billion for the first nine months of1995, up from US$78.7 billion over the same period in 1994.  Adeficit of US$136.8 billion in goods was partially offset by aUS$46.8 surplus on trade in services.Back to Headline List WT03-B04-17IA086-000616-B002-240http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it12.html 205.156.212.5 19970122023925 text/html 92214HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:37:23 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:25 GMTContent-length: 92027Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it12.html Sample Issue Copyright COUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNet JANUARY 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES REGIONAL SURVEY COMPOSITE RISK RATINGS* (237 words) CZECH REPUBLIC BASIC DATA (275 words) CZECH REPUBLIC POLITICS (1125 words) CZECH REPUBLIC ECONOMY (1096 words) CZECH REPUBLIC FINANCE (1083 words) HUNGARY BASIC DATA (283 words) HUNGARY POLITICS (1221 words) HUNGARY ECONOMY (776 words) HUNGARY FINANCE (539 words) POLAND BASIC DATA (274 words) POLAND POLITICS (1862 words) POLAND ECONOMY (1004 words) POLAND FINANCE (209 words) SLOVAK REPUBLIC BASIC DATA (277 words) SLOVAK REPUBLIC POLITICS (2245 words) SLOVAK REPUBLIC ECONOMY (1014 words) SLOVAK REPUBLIC FINANCE (1082 words) CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996COMPOSITE RISK RATINGS*CURRENT ASSESSMENTS AND ONE-YEAR FORECASTS                CURRENT RATINGS                 COMPOSITE RATINGS                Political  Financial  Economic  Year   Current  Year                Risk       Risk       Risk      Ago    Month    AheadCOUNTRY         01/96      01/96      01/95     01/95  01/96    01/97Albania         67.0       34.0       26.0      59.5   63.5     61.5Austria         79.0       47.0       39.5      86.0   83.0     82.0Belgium         82.0       47.0       41.5      83.0   85.5     82.0Bulgaria        75.0       35.0       35.0      67.0   72.5     70.5Cyprus          74.0       45.0       39.5      80.5   79.5     80.0Czech Republic  82.0       42.0       41.5      81.0   83.0     80.5Denmark         85.0       48.0       42.0      86.0   87.5     85.0Finland         87.0       43.0       39.0      84.0   84.5     84.0France          74.0       44.0       38.5      82.5   78.5     85.0Germany         83.0       47.0       39.0      84.5   84.5     85.0Greece          74.0       38.0       37.0      72.5   74.5     77.5Hungary         79.0       39.0       31.5      73.0   75.0     75.5Iceland         83.0       41.0       39.0      79.0   81.5     81.5Ireland         85.0       44.0       39.0      81.0   84.0     84.0Italy           73.0       41.0       39.0      76.0   76.5     77.5Luxembourg      88.0       49.0       41.5      89.5   89.5     88.0Malta           82.0       44.0       42.5      83.5   84.5     81.5Netherlands     84.0       47.0       41.0      85.5   86.0     86.0Norway          84.0       46.0       45.0      86.0   87.5     88.0Poland          79.0       41.0       39.0      76.5   79.5     77.0Portugal        80.0       43.0       41.0      80.0   82.0     80.5Romania         71.0       35.0       29.5      65.0   68.0     69.5Russian Fed.    58.0       29.0       43.0      59.0   65.0     60.5Slovak Republic 75.0       38.0       43.0      73.0   78.0     75.0Spain           72.0       41.0       38.5      75.0   76.0     78.0Sweden          79.0       40.0       40.0      82.5   79.5     82.0Switzerland     84.0       50.0       43.0      88.5   88.5     88.0United Kingdom  79.0       46.0       35.0      80.0   80.0     83.0Yugoslavia      59.0       19.0       23.5      46.0   51.0     58.0Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CZECH REPUBLICBASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . .President Vaclav Havel (since January 1993)Head of Government . . . . . . . . . . . .Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus                                                 (since January 1993)Area . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .80,311 sq. kmPopulation  (1994) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10.35 million*GDP (1994) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .US$41.40 billion*GDP per head (1994). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .US$4,000*GDP Growth (1994). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4.9%*Inflation Rate (current) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .7.0%*Foreign Debt Service (% of total exports, current) . . . . . . .7.0%*Current Account Ratio (% of total exports, current). . . . . . -6.5%*International Liquidity (months of import cover, current). . . . .N/ACurrency and Exchange Rate (12/15/95). .

VERY LOW* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CZECH REPUBLICPOLITICSWith the next general election now scheduled for May 31 and June 1this year, Prime Minister Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) hasmoved to strengthen its position by merging with the ChristianDemocratic Party (KDS).  The ODS was already the largest party inparliament, but it remains to be seen how effective the merger willbe.The problem is with the Club of Committed Non-Party Members (KAN),which was closely allied to the KDS.  Although the leadership of theKAN supported the merger with the ODS, the bulk of the membership didnot.  As a result, although the KDS members voted overwhelmingly forthe merger, 69 KAN members did not.  When the vote was carried theKAN membership voted to abrogate the partnership agreement with theKDS.  KAN chairman, Emil Dejmek, who supported the ODS-KDS merger,was forced to resign, along with other members of the KAN leadership,and was replaced by Pavel Holba.On the left of the political spectrum, the Left Bloc (LB) hasannounced that it intends to contest the election independently.This means that three parties will now be competing to capture theleft vote in the elections - the LB, the Communist Party of Bohemiaand Moravia and the Czech Social Democratic Party.According to LB chairman, Jaroslav Ortman, the party intends to spendCcr19 million (about US$731,000) in its election campaign.Another complication for the political establishment is the decisionto transform the current unicameral legislature into a bicameralsystem with an upper and lower chamber.  Under this amendment to theconstitution agreed by parliament last year, the existing singlechamber - the 200-member National Council - will become the lowerchamber and a new upper chamber, the Senate, will be created bydirect election.However, the parties in the coalition government are unable to agreeon whether the Senate elections should be held simultaneously with orseparately from the lower chamber elections.   Josef Lux, the leaderof the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party(KDU-CSL) and Jan Kalvoda, the leader of the Civic DemocraticAlliance (ODA) have argued that the two elections should be heldseparately, while Prime Minister Klaus and his ODS favor holding thetwo elections simultaneously.Relations between the ODS and the ODA have been poor through most ofthe current governments' term, and it would appear that Klaus isdepending on the merger with the KDS to counteract any gains made bythe ODA in the upcoming election.The current representation of the parties in parliament (with thecoalition parties indicated by an asterisk) is as follows: CivicDemocratic Party-Christian Democratic Party (ODS-KDS*), 84; CzechPeople's Party-Christian Democratic Union (CSL-KDU)*, CivicDemocratic Alliance (ODA)*, Left Bloc (LB), 35; Czech SocialDemocratic Party (CSSD), 16; Liberal Social Union (LSU), 13; 15; 14;Movement for Self-Governing Democracy  in  Moravia and Silesia(HSDMS), 9; Republican Party (SOR-RSC), 8; Liberal National SocialParty, 6.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Klaus has suggested that the government beslimmed down after this year's election through the abolition of anumber of ministries, including the culture and economic ministries.He argued that a culture ministry was not needed as the tasks itcarries out can easily be taken over by other ministries.  On theeconomic side, he argues that a Privatization Ministry, EconomyMinistry, Industry and Trade Ministry and Ministry for EconomicCompetition is excessive.  In his view at least two of these couldgo.Racial/Ethic TensionsLast year, the Interior Ministry reported that racial persecution isbeing directed to an ever greater extent against Romanies, orGypsies.According to the ministry, attacks on Arabs or blacks are sporadic,and there is no evidence of increasing racially motivated criminalactivity against Vietnamese or Jews.  However, attacks againstRomanies appears to be on the rise.The ministry puts the responsibility for most of the raciallymotivated attacks on members of the skinhead movement, which unitesaround 1,500 young people.  However, the ministry is unable toidentify which of the numerous skinhead factions actually organizesthe attacks.According to the ministry, the numerically strongest and mostimportant skinhead factions - the Patriot League, Bohemia HammerSkins, the National Socialist Movement and the National FascistCommunity - tend to restrain their activities to organizing meetingsand concerts or to publishing printed material that indirectlyprompts attacks on Romanies.The most frequent occurrence of racially motivated activity has beennoted in Prague and northern Bohemia, while it has been falling insouthern Moravia and eastern Bohemia.  In 1994, police investigatedup to 160 racially motivated conflicts, of which 130 were criminaloffenses.As a result of the sharp increase in racially motivated crimes, thepenal code was amended on September 1 last year to increase thepenalties available for racially motivated crimes.Social ConditionsThe government has increased the subsistence level by an average of8% as from 1st January 1996.  Given that inflation is different invarious areas, the government reckons the amount "per individual"will be increased by 7%, while the amount including expenditure onjoint household needs will be increased by 13%.When fully implemented, the increase will cost Ccr3.2 billion (US$123million) this year.  The last increase in the subsistence level wasat the beginning of 1995.Meanwhile, the republic continues to enjoy one of the lowestunemployment rates in the world.  There were 146,000 peopleregistered as unemployed at the end of October, equivalent to anunemployment rate of just 2.8%.  Overall, there were 9,200 fewerunemployed than in September and 31,000 fewer than in January 1995.Of the total of 146,000 unemployed, 68,200 (46.7%) receivedunemployment benefits worth Ccr1.35billion (US$52 million), 88,000were women, 22,000 had limited work capabilities and 22,000 werecollege graduates.  At the same time, there were over 94,000 jobvacancies.The highest unemployment rate - 7% - was in the northern Bohemiandistrict of Most.  The districts of Karvina in northern Moravia andother northern Bohemian districts of Teplice, Louny and Chomutovrecorded an unemployment rate of over 6%.PopulationThe Czech Republic's birth rate was lower than its mortality rate in1994 for the first time in the republic's history.  According to theCzech Statistical Office, the social and economic changes wrought bythe transformation process have substantially changed thereproductive behavior of the people and brought demographic changesin the Czech Republic into line with those in West Europeancountries.One positive feature of this development has been the reduced numberof abortions.  In comparison with 1992, the number of abortions hasdropped by 38.3% last year.  The average marrying age for the Czechsis also higher, while the divorce rate remains virtually unchanged.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CZECH REPUBLICECONOMYThe Czech Republic became a member of the OECD on November 28 lastyear - the first of the post-communist countries to do so.  Althoughmembership will not bring any direct increase in   economicassistance it does set a massive seal of approval on the government'smanagement of the economy since the establishment of the state inJanuary 19xx and confirms Republic's lead among the former Europeanmembers of Comecon.In line with the OECD stamp of approval, the credit rating agencyStandard & Poor's upgraded its foreign currency debt ratings for theCzech National Bank and the City of Prague by two points from BBB+ toA, raising the outlook for both institutions from "positive" to"stable".The latest estimates put last year's GDP growth at 4.1%, comparedwith 2.6% in 1994 and a forecast 5% plus this year.Industrial output growth accelerated to 7.8% in the fist nine monthsof last year, compared with an annual growth of 2.1% in 1994. Theoverall growth rate for 1995 is estimated at 7-7.5%, but a slightslowdown to 5.5-7% is expected this year.While the 8% growth rate in construction forecast for 1995 will behalf a percentage point higher than in 1994, a slight fall to 7-8% isexpected this year.  Labor productivity growth has been greatest inindustry and the construction, rising by 8-9% last year.Domestic demand in real terms grew by 5.1% in the first half of 1995while external demand grew by 4.4%.  The rate of investment in thefirst half of last year was 23.6% in current prices.  The estimatefor the whole year is around 30%.  The rate of engineeringinvestments was twice that of the rate of investment in construction.Household savings have been stable at 10-11% of disposable incomes.No major change is expected in this sector this year.InflationInflation remains a pressing concern.  As Prime Minister Klauspointed out last year, the transformation "cushion" set up in 1991and which allowed real wages to grow by more than the GDP is nolonger sustainable.  The cushion was created by the liberalization ofprices and trade and the devaluation of the currency, but the roomfor maneuver they provided has now been exhausted.That means, said Klaus, that henceforth real wages must not beallowed to grow at a greater rate than the GDP if domestic pricerises are to be kept in line with foreign prices.  He pointed outthat up to now the government had consciously set the level ofdevaluation, but that too little control had been exercised overprices.  As a result they had soared.  The rise in prices which beganin the second quarter of 1990 and accelerated after priceliberalization in January 1991 pushed real wages down in the secondquarter of 1991 to 69% of their levels at the beginning of 1990.This year, said Klaus, real wages should approach the levels of early1990, while inflation should be around 7.5%.According to the Czech Statistics Office, inflation in retail pricesis slowing, but only modestly when compared to the acceleration ofeconomic growth.After a 10% rise in retail prices in 1994, the rise was a littleslower at 9.7% in the first six months of last year. Prices of foodand public catering rose more than 14% in the first half of lastyear, while prices of services rose by 8.3% and prices of other goodsby 6.9%.  The increase in food prices was primarily influenced by therising prices of potatoes, meat products and coffee.  The prices ofservices were affected by adjustments to government regulated pricesduring the first half of the year, including prices for heat,postage, telephone service, railway fares, energy and gas.Nevertheless, the moderation in the annual inflation rate continuedthrough the year with a rate of 9.5% recorded in the first ninemonths.  The overall projection for 1995 is an inflation rate ofaround 9.5%.AgricultureA slight growth in gross agricultural production is expected lastyear, following several years of decline.  According to the hectareyields and crops assessment from the end of October last, basic graincrops should reach 6.7 million tonnes, a drop of 0.9 % on 1994.  Thewheat yields will be 4.1% higher, but the yields of rye, barley andoats will be lower than in 1994.The production of potatoes is expected to be 1.4 million tonnes, anincrease of 14.3% compared with 1994.  The rape crop is expected toreach 664,000 tonnes, some 46% higher, while sugar beet productionfor industrial purposes is estimated to reach 3.5 million, anincrease of 9% on 1994.Livestock production was slightly lower last year.  It is estimatedthat the numbers of cattle fell by 2% and the number of pigs by 0.5%.The milk yield increased by 4.3% to 11.3 liters per day in the firsthalf of 1995 compared to the same period of 1994.  According to theannual estimate, the sale of milk will decline by 3.5% and the saleof eggs by 0.4%.Inward InvestmentA package of agreements was signed in November enabling foreign oilcompanies a stake in Czech refineries.  The International OilConsortium (IOC), comprising Agip of Italy, Royal Dutch/Shell of theNetherlands and Conoco of the USA, signed up to the deal with theCzech state-owned Unipetrol joint-stock company to acquire a 49%stake in the Czech Refinery Company (CRS).The CRS was formed out of a merger of the refining operations ofCzech refinery giants Kaucuk Kralupy and Chemopetrol Litvinov.  Theremaining 51% share in the CRS stays in the hands of Unipetrol, whichin turn is wholly owned by the National Property Fund.Banking SectorThe Republic's three largest banks reported high profit growth in thefirst nine months of 1995.  Komercni Banka, which declared grossearnings of Ccr6.8 billion, compared with Ccr2.6 billion for all oflast year, recorded the highest profit growth, followed by CeskaSporitelna (Czech Savings Bank) with a net profit of Ccr1,194million, a growth of almost 22% 1994.The net profit of the third bank, Investicni a Postovni Banka (IPB),was Ccr712 million, 70% of the projected Ccr1 billion in earnings forthis year.  During the same period last year, IPB achieved a netprofit of Ccr584 million while the total for the whole year amountedto Ccr752 million.All three banks recorded an equal growth in granted loans andconsequently in reserves.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CZECH REPUBLICFINANCEThe state budget ended the first ten months of 1995 with a surplus ofCcr12.3 billion.  Revenues totaled more than Ccr355 billion andoverall expenditure reached Ccr343.4 billion.  Finance Minister IvanKocarnik said the figures showed the government's overall projectionsfor the 1995 budget were realistic.  It meant that the prognosis forthe end of the year situation, based on the October figures, was thatrevenues to the budget should be met with a possible variation ofplus or minus Ccr1-2 billion.In November last, the parliamentary budget committee recommendedapproval of the proposed state debt of Ccr155.7 billion for 1996.Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel said the debt's nominal valuewill remain the same as in 1995 but its share of the GDP woulddecrease from the 13% to 11.2%.  The major tendencies inadministering the state debt are to convert the passive trade balancewith foreign countries into a domestic passive balance and to convertdirect loans to securities, Havel said.He said the state will buy its receivables in foreign countries andfinance it by issuing bonds and treasury bills at a total value ofCcr40 billion, which will reduce the amount of foreign debt in theoverall debt from 44% in 1993 to 23% in 1996.  For the first timesince 1993 the state debt will not be financed by the government'sNational Property Fund.The state debt totaled Ccr162.8 billion at the beginning of 1993(17.3% of GDP).  By the end of 1994, the debt had totaled Ccr157.3billion.  In 1995, Ccr1.6 billion was paid off from the surplus inthe 1994 state budget, bringing it down to Ccr155.7 billion (13% ofGDP).  If the debts of municipalities, funds and other independentstate institutions are added to the debt, the total share of the GDPwould reach 18%.Havel claimed that the proposal to issue state securities worth Ccr40billion this year will not influence the behavior of investors on theCzech capital market.  At the time of this report, parliament had yetto discuss the budget committee's recommendation.Foreign TradeThe foreign trade deficit for January-October 1995 stood at Ccr77.4billion, according to Statistical Office figures.  This is anincrease of Ccr9.2 billion on the January-September period.   Exportstotaled Ccr446.5 billion and imports Ccr369 billion.  In the sameperiod of 1994, the foreign trade deficit amounted to Ccr8.9 billion.In October 1995 alone, the deficit stood at Ccr11.9 billion comparedto the deficit of Ccr1.5 billion in October 1994.Imports grew by 30.2% between January and October 1995 compared tothe same period last year, while exports rose by 10.5%.  Imports ofmachines and transport equipment grew by 33.3%, accounting for 35.1%of total imports.  Passenger cars accounted for 7.5% of total exportsof machines and transport equipment.  Semi-finished products made asignificant contribution to the increase in imports, accounting for18% of the total.  The volume of imports in this area jumped by 43%compared with the same period of last year.  Chemical importsrecorded an increase of 33.6%, a share of 13.6% of total imports.Exports of semi-finished products increased by 19.5% in theJanuary-October period and accounted for 33% of total exports.Exports of chemicals rose by 15.9% and accounted for 10.5% of thetotal.  Exports of machines and transport vehicles grew 9.9% and madeup 25.6% of all exports.Overall exports were hit by a drop in exports of industrial products,mainly consumer goods, which accounted for 12.7% of total exports.They dropped by 2.7% between January and October 1995 compared to thesame period of 1994.The volume of foreign trade in agricultural produce increased by 16%in the January-October period.  However, the Czech Republic's deficitin this trade amounted to Ccr12 billion, a year-on-year increase of33%.Trade with European Union (EU) countries showed a deficit ofCcr11billion and that there was a Ccr6 billion deficit in trade withdeveloping countries.  In trade with Slovakia Czech imports rose by21.1% in the 10-month period to Ccr59.4 billion against exports ofCcr59.7 billion, to produce a surplus of Ccr300 million, an increaseof 8.6%.  The republic also recorded a surplus with Central EuropeanFree Trade Agreement countries as a whole.Trade with Russia in the first nine months of 1995 was more than 21%up on the same period of 1994 and totaled Ccr47billion, according topreliminary data from the State Statistical Office. Imports fromRussia were worth Ccr36.3billion, a rise of 30%, while exports fellby 3.4% to Ccr10.6 billion.  Fossil fuels and lubricants accountedfor 77% of the imports.Exchange ControlsDespite the burgeoning trade deficit, the Czech Republic became thefirst of the former European Comecon members to partly liberalize itscapital account transactions on October 1 last year when itintroduced a new foreign exchange act.  The act, which alsointroduced full convertibility of the currency for current accounttransactions, does not affect the central bank's managed exchangerate policy.  The value of the crown will continue to be tied to acurrency basket made up of a 65% weighting to the German mark and a35% weighting to the US dollar. Under this system, the crown isallowed to fluctuate by 0.5% either side of the set parity.Under the act, the Ccr100,000 ceiling on the amount of foreigncurrency citizens can buy is removed.  In addition, the purchase offoreign real estate is permitted, companies are allowed to acceptcredit from non-resident banks, and some restrictions on directinvestment are eased.  However, other restrictions, such as the banon investing in foreign stock markets, remain.  The National Bank'sgoal is to achieve full capital account convertibility by the year2000.National BankThe Czech National Bank's (CNB) balance sheet stood atCcr530,824,300,000 at the end of October last. The greatestcontribution to the increase in the bank's assets are the greateroutstanding claims on foreign countries, which have increased toCcr70,146,800,000.  In addition, receivables from local banks grewhave risen to Ccr72,343,800,000.Czech National Bank deposits in foreign banks, including securities,amounted to Ccr258,861,300,000, while other assets amounted to Ccr5,742,300,000.  Obligations to local banks increased to Ccr124,613,700,000.

On the one hand, two ministershave resigned over their opposition to elements of the tough economicstabilization plan, while on the other, Finance Minister Lajos Bokroshas threatened to resign over a ruling by the Constitutional Courtthat other elements of the recovery plan are unconstitutional.The first minister to resign, on October 6, was the Labor Minister,Magda Kovacs Kosa, one of Prime Minster Horn's most experiencedministers.  Clearly loath to see her go, Horn initially refused toaccept her resignation and pleaded with her to stay on.  However,Kosa, a former trade union leader in the communist era, was adamant.In particular she opposed the cuts in sick pay provision put forwardin the restructuring program.Prime Minister Horn finally accepted the unavoidable on November 28and replaced Kosa with Peter Kiss, a 36-year old mechanical engineer,and Socialist Party deputy.  Kiss held senior posts in the CommunistYouth Union (CYU)  and was a founding member of the Progressive YouthAssociation (PYU), which was set up when the CYU was wound up in1989.  He was chairman of the PYU from 1992 to 1995.  He has been aSocialist member of parliament since 1992.In the meantime, Education Minister Gabor Fodor resigned on November24, although he agreed to stay on until the 1996 budget is settled.On making the announcement, Fodor said he was leaving because he didnot agree with a number of decisions made by the government andbecause he did not receive enough support from the prime minister.He was particularly unhappy that the 1996 budget allocation forpublic education is to be cut by Hf7 billion and that furtherredundancies are planned in higher education. Fodor is a member ofthe Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDZS), the junior member of thecoalition.  He is likely to be replaced by another SZDZS member.However, what could be the hardest blow for Prime Minister Horn'shopes of pressing ahead with his recovery program came on November 22when Finance Minister Lajos Bokros offered his resignation.  Bokros'smove, clearly one of exasperation, came after the ConstitutionalCourt ruled that his move to increase housing loan rates from 15% to25% was unlawful.  This was the fourth time the Constitutional Courthad ruled that certain measures in the economic stabilization packageare unconstitutional.Prime Minister Horn refused to accept Bokros' resignation.  Bokrosresponded by putting a set of conditions for his continuation asfinance minister and said that whether or not he stays on depends onthe extent to which these demands are met.  In particular he wantsthe parliamentary groups of the two government parties the means bywhich he can manage the economy without continually running foul ofthe constitution.  That means, he said, that the role of every basicinstitution has to be reassessed, including interest coordination.He also wants a compulsory declaration of assets, as he believesfinancial savings should be encouraged, while the accumulation ofreal estate as a form of investment should notIn essence, Bokros' demands can only be met through fundamentalamendments to the constitution.  That a new constitution is neededhas been long recognized, but little has been done to address theproblem so far.  However, Bokros' latest intervention has reawakenedthe debate, with Prime Minister Horn saying it is vital thatpreparatory work for a new constitution should start at the beginningof this year at the latest.Not surprisingly, the harsh effects of the recovery package has splitthe Socialist Party, with its more left-wing members arguing for asoftening of the measures.  So far, however, Horn has remainedadamant that the policy must be kept on track.  This division betweenthe two wings of the party led to the resignation of SandorCzintalan, the executive deputy chairman of the party on November 24,with effect from this year.Social ConditionsIn November last year, the Central Statistical Office (KSH) publishedits first detailed statistical analysis on the economic transitionprocess.  The study shows that the GDP shrank by one quarter between1990 and 1994.Between 1990 and 1995, Hungary received the largest share (US$9.2billion) of the working capital invested in the transition economiesin Eastern Europe and obtained the largest proportion of jointventures.  In the summer of 1995, more than 800,000 privateentrepreneurs were registered in the country, 15% of the activepopulation.  However, the KSH estimates that 30-40% of privatebusinesses were set up purely for "tax alleviation".The age structure of the population is out of balance.  Some 24.8% ofthe population is 55 or older, and 34% is below the age of 24.However, while the middle age group, which makes up only 28.3% of thepopulation, has to carry the bulk of the taxation and expenditureburden, it also suffers the highest unemployment and death rates.Average life expectancy at birth is also falling.  In the case of menthis was 65.9 years in 1960, but only 64.5 years in 1994.  The lifeexpectancy of women is better at 73.8 years.Over the 1990-1994 period, the number of people in registeredemployment fell by 1.4 million, about 25%. The unemployment rate lastyear was 10-11%.  Unemployment is highest among young people at thebeginning of their careers: 23% among women and 31% among men.Economic activity is overall is 57% (62.6% in the case of men and51.8% among women).  The employment proportions are distorted by thefact that, between 1990 and 1995, the number of pensioners workingpart or full time decreased by 60% while the number of people inearly retirement or retirement due to disability increased by 15%.The real income of the population decreased gradually from 1990 to1993, at which time it stood at 93.3% of the 1985 level.  Realincomes rose by 3.7% in 1994, but are estimated to have fallen by 11%in real terms last year.Inflation, the decrease of real incomes, the increased number ofdependents and falling consumption show a large degree ofdifferentiation in incomes.  The difference between the smallest andhighest average incomes is more than seven-fold.  In 1994, 45.9% of ahousehold's income came from the main place of employment.  Thisindicates that in an "average family", welfare and illegal incomeshave become dominant.  According to the household panel surveys, some25% of the population lived below subsistence level in 1994.  Peopleon low income spent 35.6% of their total spending on food and around20% on housing.  The proportions are believed to have continued todeteriorate last year.However, the data also indicate that from a "quality of life"viewpoint, the housing situation, telephone supply, the generalpossibility to use infrastructural services, the number of cars perfamily, and the construction of holiday homes have significantlyimproved in the past five years.The population's health has deteriorated; the proportion of smokersand alcoholics has soared; and the proportion of people having torely on various welfare provisions has increased.   Public safety hasalso deteriorated continually since 1990, and the proportion ofviolent acts and economic crimes has been increasing among criminalacts.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996HUNGARYECONOMYDespite the considerable pain being inflicted, the austerity package,introduced in March last year, is bearing fruit.  The GDP isestimated to have grown by around 2.5% last year, with improvementsin the budget, trade, and current account deficits.  However, thereare indications that the sharp improvements seen in the first half ofthe year, started to slow in the second half.After 8.3% growth in the first half of 1995, industrial productionincreased by 7.4 % in July, 2.7% in August and 2.4% in September,compared with the same periods in 1994.  Both small and large-scaleenterprises increased their output.  As a result, the volume ofindustrial production in the first nine months of 1995 exceeded thatof the same period of 1994 by 6.8%.Industrial production in September was the equivalent of 78.8% ofindustrial production achieved in 1994.  At the same time, the volumeof production in September, based on the index containing all theenterprises and the seasonal adjustments, was 2.6% lower than thatcalculated in August.  With the exception of the chemical industry,the major processing industry sectors registered a fall inproduction.  The biggest drop was registered in metallurgy and metalprocessing, where production dropped by 14.3%, but the engineeringindustry also registered a considerable drop of 8.3%.Food, beverages, and tobacco production dropped by 4.6%, comparedwith August, while chemical industry production increased by 12%.Production of the mining industry in September 1995 dropped by 8.5%compared with September 1994, while electric energy, gas, thermal andwater production registered an increase of 10.1%.InflationIn November, the government produced an inflation forecast of "only"19% this year provided the trade unions accepted pay rises averaging17-18%.  The government also proposed that the social insurancecontribution to be paid by employees this year should be 12% comparedwith 10% last year.  Companies, however, should only have to pay a40- 41% social insurance contribution, as opposed to the current rateof 44%.Also in November, the government and unions reached agreement on anew tax regime.  Employers, however, are unhappy with the dealbecause they consider the top tax rate of 48% on the top band of overHf900,000 as excessive.  The tax rate on the bottom band, up toHf185,000, is 2%.Foreign TradeHelped by a 9% devaluation of the forint and an 8% import surcharge,introduced as part of the recovery package, exports grew by 40% inthe first nine months of last year against a 29% rise in imports.Nevertheless, with imports totaling to Hf1,367.4 billion and exportsHf1,076.8 billion at current prices, the trade deficit for the periodwas still Hf1.8 billion more than in 1994 at Hf290.6 billion.According to the National Bank of Hungary (MNB), imports fell by 3%and exports rose by 4% in comparative prices against thecorresponding period of 1994.  On its figures, in US dollar terms,exports in the nine-month period were worth US$9.01 billion, up fromUS$5.23 billion in the same period of 1994, while imports increasedto US$11.06 billion, compared with US$7.76 billion.  As a result, thetrade deficit fell from US$2.5 billion in the first nine months of1994 to US$2.05 billion in the first nine months of 1995.Yugoslav EmbargoFollowing the decision of the United Nations' embargo committee tolift its sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, theHungarian government lifted its compliant restrictions on November23.  With effect from that date, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV)announced that was now prepared to transport goods to and fromYugoslavia and to allow transit shipments to and from Yugoslavia onits lines.At the same time, the Hungarian Oil and Gas Rt (MOL) increased theamount of Russian natural gas transported to Serbia via the transitstation at Kiskundorozsma in southern Hungary to its pre-embargolevel of 186.5 million cubic meters a month.The Ministry of Industry and Trade estimates that the embargo imposedon the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) on June3, 1992, has cost Hungary over US$2.2 billion in lost trade.  Thegreatest loss, some US$1 billion, was suffered in 1993.  In 1994Hungary's embargo-related losses amounted to only US$571 million,while in the first nine months of 1995 they reached some US$300million.The losses have been caused partly by a fall in export markets, extracosts stemming from re-diversion of exports, hindrances to suppliesand cancellation of transit shipments.  A one-off state subsidy ofUS$2 million in 1994, issued in a bid to partially compensate firmsfor damages caused by the embargo, increased government lossesfurther.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996HUNGARYFINANCEIn October, the central bank, the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) saidthat both Hungary's external payments position and its reserves hadimproved significantly, with reserves standing at around US$9.1-9.2billion.  On that basis the NBH said it had decided to repay US$620million of its debt to the IMF in November.  Repayment was not dueuntil the end of 1998.NBH President Gyoergy Suranyi said the step would improve thecountry's debt service ratio and cut interest payments in the comingyears.  As a result of earlier repayment, Hungary's current debt ofslightly more than US$1 billion will fall to US$400 million, whichwill be due in and after 1999.  The NBH took up these loans in 1990and 1991.The budget deficit picture looks rather less rosy, however.  Underthe austerity package, the budget deficit was supposed to fall toHf150 billion last year, equivalent to 6.5% of GDP against 9.5% ofGDP in 1994.  Budget revenue reached a total of Hf1,149.3 billion atthe end of October, and expenditure Hf1,344.9 billion, to produce adeficit of Hf 195.6 billion.  With the deficit in November andDecember expected to be around Hf100-110 billion, the total deficitfor the year could rise to around Hf300-310 billion.1996 BudgetFinance Minister Bokros presented the draft 1996 budget to parliamenton November 7, with another harsh message for the people.  It wasessential, he said, that there be no rise in the standard of livingthis year and that there was a further decrease in incomes in realterms.  This further belt-tightening was needed, he said, to achievethe three main aims of the budget - improving the balance ofpayments, cutting the budget deficit and public expenditure, andbringing down inflation.He said the first economic policy goal is to halt the increase in theexternal net debt.  This will require a significant decrease in thedeficit of the balance of payments on the current account, from aboutUS$2.8 billion in 1995 to less than US$2 billion.  Second, the growthof internal debts must be slowed significantly.  The budget deficittarget for this year is 4% of GDP.Exchange ControlsThe new foreign exchange regime came into force in January 1, makingthe forint a convertible currency as defined by the IMF.  As theforint was already convertible as far as companies' financialtransfers are concerned, the main effect of the new law will beenabling private individuals to use the forint for the purchase ofservices and commodities abroad.From January 1, Hungarian citizens holding forint cards or registeredsavings deposits will have free access to foreign currency abroad.However, the tourist allowance of US$800 a year remains unchanged.Hungarian companies and businesses are now able to found companies oracquire stakes in existing ones without any limitation.  The stake ofthe Hungarian investor, however, should always exceed 10% of theassets of the foreign venture.  Also, the company to be founded oracquired should be based in an OECD member state, with which Hungaryhas concluded a mutual investment protection agreement.Hungarian private individuals and businesses wishing to invest insecurities issued abroad will still require a foreign exchangelicense.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996POLANDBASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . . . . . . .

When one thinks of quitehow bad he has been as a president - in his five years he engineeredthe downfall of seven prime ministers and almost as many governmentswhile showing an alarming tendency towards authoritarianism -  andthe low esteem in which he has been held by the majority of Polesover the latter part of his term, that was no mean achievement.However, that narrow failure was achieved by the same means thatWalesa employed during his presidency - spite, bullying, characterassassination and, last but not least, the unswerving support of theCatholic church.  It has to be admitted, however, that the eventualvictor, Aleksander Kwasniewski, more than played into Walesa's handsby being less than candid about his educational background - a sillypretense in a competition against a man qualified only as a shipyardelectrician, and perhaps an indicator of a suppressed vanity.Knowing that Kwasniewski was his main challenger, Walesa based hiscampaign on one single theme - the threat of a return to communism.The "reds under the beds" tune was eagerly taken up by the Church,with priests in every parish lecturing the faithful on the dangersthat stood before them if they were foolish enough to vote the wrongway.In the first round of voting on September 27  Kwasniewski gained35.11% of the vote and Lech Walesa 33.11%.  The other candidates wereJacek Kuron with 9.22%, Jan Olszewski with 6.86%, Waldemar Pawlakwith 4.31%, Tadeusz Zielinski with 3.53%, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltzwith 2.76%, and Janusz Korwin-Mikke with 2.40%.From then on the heat was turned up under Kwasniewski, who suddenlyfound himself being required to account for his personal finances andthe posts he filled in the communist era. Aged 41 and married withone daughter, Kwasniewski was an activist in the communist SocialistUnion of Polish Students (SZSP) and joined the communist party, thePolish United Workers' Party (PZPR) in 1977.  In 1980-81 he was madea member of the executive committee of the SZSP main council.From November 1981 to November 1985 he was editor-in-chief of the ITDweekly and later the Sztandar Mlodych daily.  He then moved intogovernment in October 1985 as minister and head of the committee foryouth and physical culture under Prime Minister Zbigiew Messner, andstayed there through to June 1990 under prime ministers MiczyslawRakowski and Tadeusz Mazowiecki.  From October 1988 to September 1989he chaired the cabinet's socio-political committee.After the dissolution of the PZPR he became a member of itssuccessor, the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD).  He became a member ofparliament and head of the SLD caucus in October 1991 and has beenhead of the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly sinceNovember 1993.However, despite all this high profile activity, the Walesa camp wasquite unable to come up with any dirt.  Moreover, the "the Reds arecoming" message was undermined both by Kwasniewski's consistentcampaign message that he was committed to maintaining the thrust ofthe free-market reforms and the fact that the SLD/PSL (Polish PeasantParty) government, also former communists, have not been making a badjob of running the country.This reduced the Walesa campaign, finally, to complaining aboutKwasniewski's educational qualifications, or lack of them.Rather stupidly, Kwasniewski had put it about that he had a master'sdegree from Gdansk university.  Diligent digging by the Walesacampaign team proved that he had in fact failed to complete hiscourse with a masters' thesis and that no degree had been awarded.But it was too little, too late.  In the run off election on November19 and with a turnout of 68.23%, Kwasniewski won 9,704,439 votes, or51.72% of the votes cast.  Lech Walesa came second with 9,058,176, or48.28%.Lech Walesa's reaction to his defeat was consistent with the mannerin which he had conducted his presidency - mean-minded andvindictive.  This man was a hero.  It was Walesa who called thestrike in a Gdansk shipyard 15 years ago which spread nationwide,created the Solidarity movement, and started the beginning of the endof the communist dictatorship in Poland.  It was Walesa who provedthe greater man when martial law was invoked in 1981 to crushSolidarity.  For his courage and foresight in helping to avoidbloodshed he was rightly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1983, anaward he refused to accept in person while his colleagues remained inprison.Despite the failures of his term as president, that background meantthat Walesa could have departed with dignity and able to regain the"father of the nation" status that was previously his.  Instead, hemounted an immediate campaign to have the election result set asideon the grounds that Kwasniewski had lied about his educationqualifications.  Realizing that this appeared a bit weak, they threwin the spurious allegation of electoral fraud and claimed thatKwasniewski had suppressed information about his family's shares inthe Poisa insurance company.At the time of writing, the Supreme Court had received some 600,000petitions that the presidential elections be annulled on the basis ofone or all of these grounds.  Given that the Walesa camp has yet toproduce any actual evidence of fraud. the pettiness of theeducational qualifications question, for which Kwasniewski hadalready apologized, and the fact that Kwasniewski did produce a fullbreakdown of his finances, it seems unlikely to us that the SupremeCourt will rule the election illegal.  In that case AleksanderKwasniewski should be Poland's next president.That will give Poland a left-wing president as well as a left-winggovernment.  Some Western commentators look upon such a developmentwith alarm.  We don't share it.  Quite simply, countries like Polandnow have no alternative but to follow the reformist path.  Even themost backward-looking former communist knows that any retreat wouldlead to the political, social and economic chaos that is Russia.Moreover, all their economic plans, and therefore hope of progress,are inextricably tied to Western political and financial institutionssuch as the IMF, World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment, the European Union and North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.  Quite simply, there is no way back.Rather, we see Kwasniewski's success as positive.  With a like-mindedpresident, prime minister and government Poland has much betterprospects of achieving harmony in political decision-making than wasever possible Lech Walesa's presidency.  The key early test ofKwasniewski's ability to work with Prime Minister Oleksy will be theway he handles the so-called presidential ministers.The incumbents of these posts - Andrzej Milczanowski of internalaffairs, Wladyslaw Bartoszewski of foreign affairs, and ZbigniewOkonski of national defense all tendered their resignations witheffect from December 20.Religion in PoliticsLech Walesa's defeat in the presidential election was also a defeatfor the Catholic Church, which conducted an all-embracing campaign inhis favor.  Like Walesa, the Church has also been less thanmagnanimous in defeat, with the Primate of Poland, Cardinal JozefGlemp, calling Kwasniewski a liar in all but name.  Referring to thefuss over Kwasniewski's educational achievements, the Cardinaldeclared that the one thing known about him was that he "publiclybore false witness".This was par for the course.  When he cast his own vote in the secondround, Cardinal Glemp said the election was a "choice between asystem of Christian values and a system of neo-pagan values".  Afterthe election he commented that a society which chose a presidentialcandidate who did not represent Christian values was morally sick.Other priests reportedly said that anyone who voted for Kwasniewskiwas committing a sin.When the electorate decided that "morally sick" or not, it wasplumping for a "system of neo-pagan values", the Church swung intoaction behind the campaign to get the elections annulled.  Priestsberated their congregations and dished out protest forms for theSupreme Court, printed by Lech Walesa's provincial headquarters inPoznan.In order to get the message across to those who did not manage tomake it to mass, the Church's own radio station, Radio Marya,broadcast appeals to the faithful to send in demands to the SupremeCourt that the election be annulled on the basis of Kwasniewski's"falsification" of personal details.  This was so blatant, that theNational Radio and Television Boradcasting Council was forced tointervene on the grounds that the radio station was contravening theterms of its franchise by involving itself in political protest.Meanwhile, a new political party was registered on November 21.Called the "Movement for Poland's Reconstruction" it comprises theformer election committee of Jan Olszewski, who gained 6.8% of thevote in the first round of the presidential election.Social ConditionsThe Central Statistical Office (GUS) estimates that more than onemillion Poles work unregistered in the gray, semi-illegal, economy.GUS concludes from this that the true level of unemployment issignificantly lower than the official figures suggest.  Just under 7%of the total number of people registered as employed also register asecond job.  However, GUS believes that the true percentage is muchgreater than this and that more than two million people were employedin the gray economy last year.Men worked unregistered more often than women; urban dwellers did itmore often than the rural population.  It also emerged that one youngperson in eleven was employed in the gray economy which employed notonly people with poor qualifications but specialists as well,although the latter's work in the gray economy was not their mainjob.Rather surprisingly, the GUS study found that horticulture andagriculture were the largest employers in the gray economy.  Work inthe service sector came second.  Households were the main employersof gray economy workers, followed by private firms.The situation on the labor market did improve last year, with thenumber of people in work rising by 1.7% up in October 1995 comparedwith October 1994, bringing the number of employed to 15,720,000.However, this is 2,500,000 than in 1990.The unemployment rate stood at 14.7%, down from 16.2% at the sametime in 1994.  This translates into some 2,600,000 people officiallyregistered as having no job.  However, if all the unemployed arecounted, including pensioners, the figure rises to 11,600,000, anincrease of 5,00,000 since 1990.  According to demographic forecasts,the number of people able to work will increase by 680,000 by the endof this century.Salaries in the industrial sector grew and after three quarters of1995, the wages in the economy were 1.6% higher than inJanuary-September 1994.  However, public sector wages fell 1.5%.  TheCentral Statistical Office (CUP) estimates that after the fourthquarter indexation of pensions, the purchasing power of the benefitswill have risen by 2.8% in the whole of 1995.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996POLANDECONOMYThe GDP grew by around 6.5% last year, with industrial productionrising by 10%, construction and assembly by 11%, and agriculturalproduction by 7-9%.  On the downside, inflation was higher thanpredicted, while high unemployment, especially among young people, acontinuing crisis in housing, and growing economic disproportion'sbetween households continued to hold down expectations.Industrial output rose by 11% in the first 10 months of last year,compared with corresponding period of 1994.  In the constructionsector, production was 15.5% higher.  However, the number ofcompleted flats was 20.7% lower than in January-October 1994.The inflation rate for the month of October was 1.8%.  With hopes ofthe monthly rate moderating to an average of 1.5% in the last twomonths of the year, the projected annual rate for 1995 was 28% - wellabove the 22.7% rate forecast in the 1995 state budget law.Exports grew by 28.9% in September, compared with a growth of 37.6%in the first eight months of the year.  Imports also rose rapidly,however, and at the end of September the deficit in the balance ofpayment of commodities amounted to US$930 million.The state budget deficit stood at ZL6.02 billion in October,equivalent 68.1% of the figure forecast for the whole year.  Revenuesof over ZL66 billion were collected in the first 10 months of theyear, while the expenditures over this period stood at ZL72.08billion.PrivatizationThe sale to the population of special share certificates in 15National Investment Funds (NFI), controlling more than 500 state-runcompanies, was ceremonially launched on November 22. Polish citizenswere eligible to buy the share certificates at a fee of ZL20 (someUS$8.09) and later exchange units made up of these certificates forshares in each of the 15 NFI.On November 27, it was reported that more than 250,000 people hadbought NFI share certificates in the first three days of theirdistribution.Also in November, the Polish Privatization Ministry said that a totalof 914 state enterprises were transformed into State Treasury-ownedjoint-stock companies in the period between July 1990 and October1995.  This accounts for 26.8% of the 3,412 enterprises subject tothis process.  However, only around 150 of the State Treasury-ownedjoint-stock companies have been privatized so far.  A total of 1,160enterprises were wound down under the privatization process and theliquidation of 1,338 enterprises, which were in poor financialcondition, has begun.A new version of the privatization bill was due to be submitted toparliament in the middle of January 1996.  According to privatizationminister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, parliament would be able to speed up thelegislative process by suing the deputies' bill already submitted tothe parliamentary speaker.  However, the Constitutional Tribunal hasalready ruled that some of the provisions of the deputies' billcontravene the constitution.  These include the provision making theprivatization of strategic industries dependent on the consent ofparliament.Another commitment made by the government before the presidentialelection was that the privatization of the State Airline LOT would beready by the end of this year.  Under the privatization scheme beingprepared by a ministerial committee, the state treasury will retain a51% stake in LOT and another 20% would be sold on "easy terms" to LOTemployees.LOT's fleet currently comprises four Boeing 767, 10 Boeing 737 andseven ATR-72 aircraft.  In 1994, the company carried 1,583,000passengers, 14% more than in 1993.UnemploymentIn an effort to tackle the unemployment time bomb (see SocialConditions above), the government approved a draft program for jobcreation last November, which unlike the current program, focuses oneliminating the sources of unemployment, rather than alleviating itseffects.  Its overall aim is to achieve an unemployment rate of 8% bythe year 2000.Funding for the new program is put at ZL9,000 billion this year,ZL3,000 billion more than last year.  The additional funds will comefrom cutting expenditure on unemployment benefits, which at used upabout 88% of the Labor Fund in 1995.  It is expected unemploymentbenefit this year will be linked to minimum pay, rather than toaverage pay as has been the case up to now.  The actual level will bearound 88% of minimum pay.The new program also proposes, for the first time, that unemploymentbenefit will be withheld or reduced when an unemployed person refusesthe offer of a job for which he or she is qualified.  Under theexisting system, an unemployed person can refuse up to two job offerswithout giving any reason.  From this year school leavers willreceive scholarships for active job seeking and training rather thanautomatic benefits.In order to help in job creation, state support will be given to setup special economic zones with concessions for investors andentrepreneurs.  Favorable terms will apply for people starting up newbusinesses.  The budget will also help finance regional restructuringprograms and investment projects in areas with high structuralunemployment.Mining RestructuringIn November last, the government promised there would no mass layoffsas a result of its plan to restructure the coal mining industry.  Theplan provides for reducing employment by 90,000 miners in the years1996 through to 2000.  However, miners were assured that 56,000 ofthese jobs would disappear through the normal process of retirement,while the remaining redundancies would be cushioned.The five-year restructuring plan is designed to put the industry on asound economic footing by cutting costs and improving productivity.Meanwhile, the government has stressed that lignite and hard coalwill remain Poland's main energy sources until the year 2010 despitethe planned increase in the share of gas in energy production.  Atpresent 43% of energy is produced from lignite, the cheapest sourceof energy with prices of up to ZL25 (about US$10) per tonne.  Ligniteresources are estimated at 228 billion tonnes with an annualextraction rate of 100 million tonnes.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996POLANDFINANCEDeputy prime minister and finance minister, Grzegorz Kolodko,prsented the budget bill to parliament on November 22.  This is thethird draft budget to take account of the government's "Strategy forPoland" program.  The declared aim of the budget is to maintain ahigh rate of economic growth, curb inflation, improve livingconditions, increase individual incomes and improve the efficiency ofpublic services.Budget funds are increased in real terms, but are not sufficient tocover all the needs.  Thus, certain areas are prioritized. - publicsecurity, education , restructuring of the countryside, the reform ofthe health service, housing construction and culture.According to the draft budget, the deficit is not to exceed 2.8% ofGDP, while inflation is targeted to fall to 17%.Japanese GuaranteesIn November, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade andIndustry announced that Japan has resumed granting guarantees forexports and investments to Poland.  The decision was made becausePoland has started to fulfill the three conditions for restoring theguarantees: regular repayment of interests on debts, maintaining goodrelations with creditor countries and the International MonetaryFund; and stabilizing its economic situation.Japan suspended commercial guarantees for Poland in April 1991because of the country's growing foreign debt.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SLOVAK REPUBLICBASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . .

So far, however, and to the increasing irritation of thepremier, the president remains in place.  The problem for Meciar isthat he is running out of ammunition.  He has managed to get ano-confidence vote in the president passed in parliament by virtue ofthe simple majority held by his coalition.  However, this still fallsshort of the majority required, as all the opposition parties supportKovac's continuation in office. President Kovac can only be dismissedby three-fifths of the votes in parliament, i.e. 90 out of the 150seats.  The government coalition does not have that number.Confounded in that direction, Meciar has also tried to bring Kovacdown by establishing a parliamentary commission to investigate hisrole in bringing down his government in March 1994.  With thecommission packed with his own supporters, it could be counted on tobring in a damaging enough critique of the president for hisimpeachment to be sought.Unfortunately, the Supreme Court ruled in November that suchcommissions are unconstitutional on the grounds that the 1989 lawunder which commissions are empowered prevents them from starting acriminal prosecution or obliging people to give evidence at publichearings.This is a major blow to the Meciar government, which has set up threeparliamentary commissions, the first, established on  November 3,1994, the day after Meciar was returned to power, was to look intoPresident Kovac's role on the earlier dismissal of the Meciargovernment; the second was to look into the election lists of theopposition Democratic Union (DU), whose creation precipitated thefall of that government, with the aim of excluding it fromparliament; the third, also designed to embarrass the opposition, wasto look at the sale of army pontoons to India; and the fourth, aninvestigation into in the car crash in which Alexander Dubcek waskilled in 1992.All will now have to be wound up.There has also been the curious case of the kidnapping of thepresident's son, Michal Kovac junior.  Although little is currentlyknown of the detail of this case, it is not beyond the realms ofpossibility that this too was part of a plot to discredit Kovacsenior.The bare bones are as follows: In 1994, Peter Krylov, a Slovak whohad become a German national and who headed a Slovak company calledTechnopol was found guilty of fraudulently removing US$2.3 millionfrom it.  On August 31 last year, Michal Kovac junior was abductedand taken to Vienna, Austria.  After his arrival, Krylov claimed thatKovac junior was a partner to the fraud.  Although he made no mentionof Kovac during his trial in 1994, Krylov said that the fraud arosewhen Kovac, representing his own company, called Sycko, presentedTechnopol with a fraudulent trade deal.Kovac junior, now released by his captors, but remaining safely inVienna, has refuted all the allegations and has claimed that he hadnever met Krylov and never discussed any deal with him.  It thentranspired that one of the men involved in his kidnapping was anagent of the Slovak Intelligence Service (SIS), known publicly onlyby the name, Oskar F.  The man ultimately in charge of the SIS is, ofcourse, Prime Minister Meciar.  Despite the weight of evidenceagainst Oskar F., President Kovac pardoned him from all criminalcharges on November 29.  Was this in return for Oskar F. Disclosingthe full background to the kidnapping?  If so, some very interestinginformation may be about to unfold.With all these various avenues of bringing down the presidentapparently blocked or stalled, Prime Minister Meciar is being forcedto consider the final arrow in his quiver - his long-standing threatto call a referendum on Michal Kovac's fitness to be president.  Butthis remains fraught with risk for the premier.  Despite all he hasdone to denigrate the president, weaken his powers and diminish hisoffice - government formulated cut-backs in budget allocations to thepresident's office have already forced the sacking of over 40presidential staff - the people of Slovakia stubbornly continue togive a higher approval rating to their president than to theirpremier.  If Meciar were to call a referendum and lose, his positionwould become near untenable.Racial/Ethnic TensionMeanwhile, the government has managed to create yet anotherconfrontation with the European Union and the USA, as well as withHungary and part of its own opposition, over its attitude toSlovakia's Hungarian minority.  The specific point of issue was thepassing by parliament on November 15 of the long debated LanguageLaw.  A total of 108 of the 142 parliamentary deputies voted in favorof the law.  All 17 of the deputies belonging to the HungarianCoalition voted against, while 17 deputies - all deputies of theChristian Democratic Movement (KDH), plus Lubomir Ftacnik of theParty of the Democratic Left (SDL) and Viliam Vaskovic of theDemocratic Union - abstained.At the same time, parliament notably failed to approve theSlovak-Hungarian basic treaty, which is supposed to form the basisfor good relations and cooperation between the two states.The Language Law stipulates that Slovak is the only state language inthe republic and orders all state employees to speak Slovak and thatall newspapers and periodicals must be published in the statelanguage.  Also, all public ceremonies, except weddings, must beconducted exclusively in the Slovak language. That part of the lawstipulating these obligations came into force on January 1, 1996,while the section of the law regarding fines and other sanctions forfailure to meet the obligations will become effective on January 1,1997.Slovakia's Hungarian minority, which has been campaigning against thelaw throughout 1995, sees it as a direct attack on its status andculture.  However, during the months of national debate on the issue,the government did promise that the Language Law would be accompaniedby additional legislation guaranteeing support for minority languagesand determining their use in official contacts.  Significantly, thisaccompanying legislation was not presented to parliament with thebasic Language Law.Hungary withdrew its ambassador in protest and raised the matter atthe 47th plenary assembly of the permanent Council of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  OnNovember 16 the EU parliament passed a resolution condemning thelegislation and warned Slovakia that it must show greater respect forhuman rights and democracy or EU aid may have to be suspended.  TheUSA issued a note to similar effect.One would have thought that having provoked earnest criticism bothinside and outside the country, the government would have taken aconciliatory and assuring tone.  Not a bit of it.  Referring to theEU resolution as a "demarche" of the kind used by Nazi Germany andthe Soviet Union against its neighbors, Prime Minister Meciar saidthat Slovakia would never succumb to such threats and that businesseswould be compensated for any losses should the EU's PHARE program toSlovakia be canceled.To add even more heat to the fire, SNS deputy Vitazoslav Moric saidthat political parties specifically representing Hungarian interestsshould be banned and that the Language Law should be used tocounteract the "disproportionate" number of Hungarian schools in thesouth of the country.  When asked what would happen to the Hungarianpress from January 1 this year - when all publications are supposedto be in Slovak - Moric said "there will be no Hungarian press".Corruption in GovernmentMeanwhile, the opposition has gone onto the attack, accusing membersof the government of corrupt practices in the implementation of itsprivatization program.  One of the first acts of the Meciargovernment was to throw out the privatization program produced by itspredecessor and replace it with one of its own.  It then allegedlypacked the Privatization Ministry, the National Property Fund and theSupreme Supervisory Bureau - the bodies responsible for the program -with people belonging to or supporting the three coalition parties,Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the Associationof Slovak Workers (ZRS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS).At the end of November, Mikulas Dzurinda, the deputy chairman ofopposition the Christian-Democratic Movement (KDH), accused ZRSleader, Jan Luptak, of exercising undue influence on theprivatization process in order to enrich himself and his family, andother government ministers and their families.  He also accused thegovernment of selling off state assets to family and friends at afraction of their real value.Dzurinda claimed, for example, that the new private sector owners ofSlovnaft paid down only 1.56% of the company's shares nominal value,2.35% for Duslo Sala (a chemical plant), 2.75% for the Vysne Ruzbachyspa, and 0.06% in the privatization of the Zvolen Meat ProcessingPlant.  The new owners, said Dzurinda, are now able to sell thecompanies abroad and divide the profits on a 50:50 basis - one halfto partial sponsors and one half to their own pockets.The same cry has been taken up by Peter Weiss, chairman of theopposition Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), who accused thegovernment of creating a "privatization sleaze".  He said it was ascandal that only nine men at the Natinal Property Fund (FNM) areresponsible for privatization decisions and that there is clearevidence that state assets are being sold off at below market value.Moreover, he added, privatization is benefiting literally only a fewhundred people.  As a result, a "clientist" political system is beingcreated in which economic and political power are being weldedtogether.At the same time, the opposition parties have demanded aninvestigation into whether the former SNS deputy chairman and presentdirector of Slovenska Poistovna (the Slovak Insurance Company), PeterSokol, also has a 25% share in the company which seeking to acquireit under the privatization program. If so, he would make a clearprofit of Scr5 million (US$170,000) in dividends from the deal.  Theyhave also asked for an investigation into the high monthly income ofthe SNS chairman, Jan Slota.Questions have also been raised about ministers leaving government tostep straight in to top jobs in state companies on the privatizationlist.  In November Marian Mojzis, the State Secretary in the EconomyMinistry, became director-general of the Petrimex joint-stockcompany.  He was replaced as Secretary by his adviser, Pavol Hrmo.Social ConditionsPrime Minister Meciar's peculiar method of governance is clearlyhaving an impact on the people's perceptions of democracy in actionas opposed to their counterparts in the Czech Republic, according toa survey conducted in the middle of last year by the SociologicalInstitute of the Czech Academy of Science and the Center of EmpiricalResearches (STEM).In answer to the question, "Were people like you better off before1989?", (i.e. under communism) only 47% of Czechs answered yes,compared with 73% of Slovaks.  In addition, of the respondents, 75%of  Czechs believe that the freedom of the individual has increasedsince 1989, while the figure for Slovaks was only 54%.  The Czechsalso tend to hold the view that at present they are given betteropportunities to upgrade their standard of living, while Slovaks tendto believe that these opportunities were better before 1989.The overall atmosphere in society was valued negatively by 60% ofCzechs and 70% of Slovaks.  More than 90% of those polled in bothcountries have noticed deepening social inequalities.An average Czech has an almost casual approach to unemployment,believing that sooner or later he or she will be able to get a jobnear home.  By contrast, unemployed Slovaks are willing to move tofind a job.  While the unemployment rate slipped under 3% in theCzech Republic in September, the figure for Slovakia stood at around13%.Political Party DevelopmentsAt the end of November, Peter Weiss, the chairman of the Party of theDemocratic Left (SLD), which he formed out of the old CommunistParty, announced that he would not seek re-election as chairman, butwould continue to aid the party in a private capacity.The party only just managed to get into parliament at the lastelection and Weiss's leadership has come under a good deal ofinternal criticism.Meanwhile, Jan Langos was elected chairman of the Democratic Party(DS) at the party's Congress on November 18 with 167 of the 221votes.  His opponent, the former chairman, Peter Osusky, received 46votes.New BordersThe negotiation of new border agreements with the country'sneighbors, necessitated by the separation from the Czech Republic onJanuary 1, 1993, are nearing completion.  The only borders to undergoactual changes are with the Czech Republic and Hungary, and involve452 and 209 hectares respectively.  The changes in the course of theSlovak-Hungarian border are due to the beds of the Ipel, Slana andRoznava rivers gradually changing their course since 1965.  TheSlovak-Hungarian agreement is apparently ready for approval.Under the new agreements, Slovakia's borders measure 1,714.61kilometers.  The longest section is the Hungarian border (678kilometers), followed by Poland (547.1 kilometers), Austria (109 km),and Ukraine (98.5 km)  The Slovak-Czech border is 285 km long, butwill be 33.21 kilometers less  after the new agreement is passed.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SLOVAK REPUBLICECONOMYIndustrial output in September 1995 was 13.2% higher than inSeptember 1994, according to data from the Slovak Statistical Office.In the first nine months of the year, the total output of Slovakia'smanufacturing industry, calculated at inflation-adjusted prices, was8.4% higher than in the same period of 1994 and amounted to Scr362.2billion.The construction industry's output in September 1995 was up by 1.7%on September 1994.  In the first nine months of 1995 the constructionindustry's output rose by about 3.9% on the same period of 1994 andthe industry's projects were worth about Scr36.3 billion.Farming enterprises' turnover in September 1995, calculated atcurrent prices without corn for seed and seedlings, was 7.9% down onthe same period of 1994.  In the nine-month period, farmers earnedScr21.6 billion, excluding corn for seed and seedlings, and theirsales were 3% up on the same period of 1994.  Although there was a1.4% decline in crop production, this was offset by a 5.2% growth inthe sale of animal products.Retail trade, calculated at inflation-adjusted prices, was 16.6%higher in September 1995 than in September 1994.  In the first ninemonths, retail sales amounted to Scr199.4 billion, a rise of 19.9% onthe same period of 1994.  The retail trade annual rise, calculated atinflation-adjusted prices, amounted to 8.1%.Private businesses accounted for 63.7% of the manufacturing industryoutput and for 80.6% of theconstruction industry output.The draft budget for 1996 (see FINANCE section below) projects a GDPgrowth this year of at least 5%, with inflation falling to 6-8%.UnemploymentUnemployment remains a pressing concern.  The unemployment rate didfall to 12.8% in October last, the first time it had been below 13%since the end of 1994.  In the month there were 82,472 unemployedpeople receiving state support in the month, 1,942 less than inSeptember.  Of the unemployed people 53.1% were women, 7.7% peoplewith limited ability to work and 18.3% school leavers.  There were325,490 registered job seekers in the month.Although the current unemployment rate compares favorably with themajority of the other former Comecon countries in Eastern Europe, itis embarrassingly high compared with the Czech Republic, the onlycomparison that counts for most Slovaks.  In an attempt to ensurethat the rate continues to move downward through 1996, the governmentis to introduce a new system of unemployment benefits this year.The old system of a single benefit scheme for all registeredunemployed people has been replaced by a two-tier system todistinguish between those who are not to blame for losing their jobsand who want to work and those who do not want to work.  This will becoupled with a change in social policy through the introduction of a"poverty" level in addition to the existing "subsistence" level.  Thepoverty level will be considerably lower than the subsistence leveland will be applied to those who refuse to accept a job.Inward InvestmentThe total volume of foreign investments in Slovak companies hadreached Scr19.8 billion (US$660.8 million) by the end of September1995, a 12.8% increase since the end of July.  Foreign capital wasinvested in 8,469 companies, with the largest volumes going toindustry, trade, financing and insurance companies.The most important investors, investing over Scr1 billion, were fromthe following countries (ranked according to volume of investment):Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, the USA, France and GreatBritain.  The situation in foreign investments during the thirdquarter of 1995 was influenced by the establishment of three branchesof foreign banks in Bratislava, the Austrian Bank Austria (name asreceived), the Czech Komercni Banka and the US Citibank, withcontributions of British capital.Gas PipelineIt was agreed in November that the new pipeline to carry gas from theYamal deposit in northern Russia via Belarus and Poland to Germanywill incorporate a branch line to Slovakia.  The line, which will runfor 233 kilometers from Poland will probably be built by aSlovak-Russian joint venture.The Russian gas company involved, GAO Gazprom, also showed interestin extending the current transit gas pipeline from Slovakia viaHungary and Slovenia to Italy.  Slovakia will buy 5.1 million tonnesof Russian crude oil next year.  In addition, Russia has reportedlyagreed to supply Slovakia with natural gas from Turkmenistan throughits gas system.Coal Industry PrivatizationPrime Minister Meciar said in November that the coal mining and thecoal engineering industry inSlovakia's most important coal region, Horne Ponitrie (the UpperNitra region), will be privatized.  He said that in line withelection promises, mine employees and Prievidza citizens would beable to purchase the region's collieries for a nominal one Slovakcrown.The mine employees and the citizens of Prievidza will receive stateprivatization bonds which they will be able to exchange shares.  Theprivatization of the region's engineering industry, due to beimplemented concurrently with the privatization of coal mining, willbe treated separately and with a different legal method.The Horne Ponitrie region is suffering from an overall decline inproduction due to the slow transformation and decline in the coalmining industry.  As a result unemployment in the region has soaredand now stands at around 9,240.State RailwayThe state-owned Slovak Railways is expected to have incurred a lossof around Scr3 billion last year from its passenger services.  Thegovernment will only cover up to Scr1.73 billion of this loss due tolimited resources in the state budget.  Slovak Railways expect that asimilar situation will also arise this year when the costs ofoperating passenger transport will be Scr5.051 billion, while saleswill only reach Scr1.63 billion.   However, the state is committed tocovering only Scr2.03 billion of the expected Scr3.42 billion loss,according to the proposed budget for 1996.Railway passengers in Slovakia now only pay 43% of the real cost oftransport.  The real cost per person per kilometer is Scr1.16, butpassengers pay only Scr0.50.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: EUROPE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SLOVAK REPUBLICFINANCEFinance minister Sergej Kozlik has predicted that the budget deficitfor 1995 will be much lower than forecast.  In late November thedeficit stood at Scr7 billion, compared with a target figure of Scr27billion for the year as a whole.  Kozlik said that the reason for thelower budget deficit was the fact that only 86% of the plannedbudgetary expenditure had been used and that 93% of the plannedrevenues had been collected.1996 BudgetThe draft budget for 1996 approved by the government in Novemberprojects a deficit of Scr27 billion, with revenues put at Scr162.4billion and expenditures at Scr189.4 billion. that debt repaymentspending will be Scr19 billion this year, the fiscal position of thestate budget means a deficit of 1.5% of GDP.The budget makes no provision for rent, fuel or energy price risesthis year as part of the government's policy of bearing down oninflation.  The inflation rate has followed a downward trend of late,falling from 9.8% year-on-year in August to 7.9% year-on-year inOctober.As part of the inflation strategy, parliament approved a new pricelaw in November, which gives the Finance Ministry and localauthorities at district and regional levels the right to regulate theprices of goods and commodities.  The new law enables state officialsto regulate prices in cases of "economically justified" costs or"adequate profits".Critics claim that the law could lead to a situation where the statewould be in charge of price setting.  The opposition argued that thelaw was only just within the bounds of the market economy systembecause it empowered state officials to decide on the "adequacy" ofprices, costs and profits.However, spending on the intelligence service (SIS) is to rise by 50%to Scr760 million (US$29 million).  The money allotted to thegovernment will more than double, from Scr150 million in 1995 (US$5.8million) to Scr414 million (Scr15.9 million).On the other hand, the President's Office will again receive less,Scr97 million (US$3.7 million) as against Scr121 million (US$4.65million) in 1995.  All part of Prime Minister Meciar's strategy tocurtail and diminish the presidency by whatever means available.Foreign TradeA surplus of Scr3.5 billion was recorded on the balance of foreigntrade in the first 10 months of last year.  Exports were worthScr210.7 billion, an increase of Scr37.6 billion or 21.7% on the sameperiod of 1994.  Imports were worth Scr207.2 billion, an increase ofScr35.8 billion or 20.9% on the same period of 1994.The largest share of exports went to the Czech Republic (35.4%),Germany (18.9%), Austria (5%), Italy (4.7%), Hungary (4.6%), Poland(4.4%), the Russian Federation (3.6%), Ukraine (2.1%), France (2%)and the Netherlands (1.7%).Exports to the EU countries went up by Scr18.5 billion (30.5%) andmade up 37.6% of total exports.  Exports to the OECD countries wereup Scr18.5 billion (27.4%) compared with the same period last yearand constituted 40.9% of total exports.Imports mainly came from the Czech Republic (28.1%), the RussianFederation (16.8%), Germany (14.3%), Austria (5.2%), Italy (4.5%),Poland (2.9%), the USA and France (each 2.3%), Hungary (2.2%), theNetherlands (1.7%) and Ukraine (1.5%).A total of 34.5% of Slovak imports came from EU countries, which isScr15.2 billion (27%) more than in the first 10 months of 1994.  Theshare of imports from OECD countries stood at 40.9%, an increase ofScr18 billion (26.9%) compared with the same period of 1994.ReservesThe Slovak National Bank's currency reserves stood at nearly US$3billion at the end of October, US$900 million of which had beenaccumulated during the first half of 1995.The hard currency reserves of the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS)amounted to US$3,045 million on November 20, an increase of US$1.3billion compared to the reserves held on January 1, 1995.The sum total of hard currency reserves held by all banks in Slovakiaamounted to US$4.55 billion on November 20, of which all commercialbanks in Slovakia held US$1.55 billion.  According to the 1994 AnnualReport of the NBS, at the end of December 1994 the NBS's hardcurrency reserves stood at US$1,745 million.  The sum total of thehard currency reserves held by all banks in Slovakia amounted toUS$3,093 million, of which all commercial banks held US$1,348million.Banking sectorThe National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) announced last year that almosthalf of all loans extended by Slovak banks will not be repaid intheir full nominal value.  The total volume of the loans extended bySlovak banks by the end of August last year amounted to Scr276.2billion.  About Scr130 billion of this sum or 47% are presumed to bedoubtful loans, which are unlikely to be repaid in full, while someScr86 billion of these loans are considered as bad or"irrecoverable".If these estimates are correct, the total volume of doubtful loans isalmost as big as the state budget revenues or nearly 30% ofSlovakia's annual GDP.  The three biggest Slovak banks, which jointlyhold about 70% of all loans, also hold 90% of doubtful and bad loans.These are:  Vseobecna Uverova Banka (the General Credit Bank),Slovenska Sporitelna (the Slovak Savings Bank), and Investicna aRozvojova Banka (the Investment and Development Bank).According to an NBS analysis, the assets of the biggest Slovak banksare Scr19 billion below the level required to cover their risks.  TheFinance Ministry believes that the current high interest margins andthe new income tax law, due to give a boost to the process of riskassets creation, should help the banks accumulate more risk assets.Although banking sector representatives accept this argument, theysay that other legislative steps will have to follow that wouldaddress the companies' problems as well as the bad loans problem.EBRD CreditIn November, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development(EBRD) and the Slovak commercial bank Istrobanka have signed anagreement on the opening of a DM30 million credit line forIstrobanka, making it Slovak commercial bank, after Tatra Banka andPolnobanka, to be selected by EBRD as its partner for providinginvestment loans.The money drawn from this credit line will be used for private sectorprojects.  Istrobanka's clients will have a chance of receiving acredit ranging from DM0.5- 8 million per project on the estimatedrepayment period between seven and eight years.Back to Headline List WT03-B04-18IA086-000616-B002-285http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it13.html 205.156.212.5 19970122024009 text/html 109073HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:37:50 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:25 GMTContent-length: 108885Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it13.html Sample Issue Copyright COUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N.

MODERATE* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N. AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996IRANPOLITICSAttention is now concentrated on the parliamentary (Majlis) electionsset for March 8, 1996.  This has already led to some concertedcriticism of the power of the clergy in politics and, in earlyOctober, to student demonstrations in Tehran university.  Details ofthe incident, or incidents, are patchy, but it appears that studentssympathetic to the Hezbollahi staged some sort of demonstration in alecture hall, which then got out of hand.In any event, this election will be a critical one for PresidentRafsanjani and his reformist government.  Parliamentary elections inIran are complicated by the fact that the country has had nonationally organized political parties since 1987.  This gives riseto a large number of candidates standing as independents - typicallysome 1,500 candidates compete for the 270 parliamentary seats.  WithIslam being the most pervasive national organization, this systemtends to favor religious candidates with strong local support.Without the discipline of party ideology or membership, suchcandidates are likely to be far more responsive to clerical orpopular opinion than they are to the government.  As a result, thegovernment's parliamentary support can become extremely fragile.And that is the problem now.  With the massive contraction ineconomic growth and high inflation, Rafsanjani's popularity is on along downward track.  This was shown in the last presidentialelection in 1993, when support for Rafsanjani fell sharply.  However,Rafsanjani's government was still fairly safe as its supportersformed the largest bloc in the Majlis after the April 1992parliamentary election with around 110 seats.  With the remainingseats split between the antipathetic religious and, for want of abetter description, left-of-center candidates, the government hasbeen able to get support for its legislation  by playing one groupoff against the other.This time around there appears to be a real risk that religiouscandidates will make significant advances at the expense of thosecandidates supporting the government.  This, perhaps, is the realreason behind the recent attacks on "politicized" clerics andPresident Rafsanjani's call in a radio and television interview inNovember for the formation of political parties rather than thecurrent "interest" groups that contest elections.Rafsanjani argued that "serious" nationally based political partiesare essential in a political system that employs an electoral systemand that if any single party obtained a majority in parliament itshould form the government.  The statement was generally welcomed,though many have also pointed out that this is not the first time acall for the formation of political parties has been made since theIslamic Republic Party stopped functioning in 1987.To the surprise of many, the death sentence imposed on Fazel Khodadadfor his part in the Ir1,230 billion embezzlement at Bank Saderat wascarried out on November 22.  In all 20 people were arrested on theembezzlement charges in the summer, but it was thought that Khodadadwas too highly placed to suffer the punishment meted out by thecourt.  Two others were sentenced to life imprisonment and six tolong-term jail terms and cash fines.Tehran Oil ConferenceThe successful holding of the international oil and gas conference inNovember was hailed by the government as the decisive indicator ofthe failure of the US oil trade embargo. The aim of the conferencewas to brief foreign companies interested in taking part in the 11projects being opened to foreign investment in the current five yearplan period.Representatives from 123 international oil companies and 20 Iraniancompanies attended the conference.  The size of the foreignattendance has been taken by the government as the strongest possibleindicator that non-US oil companies will tender for the projects on abuy-back basis and that its planned development of its oil and gassector will not be pushed off track by the US embargo.Of the 11 projects, five are offshore.  They comprise the developmentof the South Pars gas field, a the injection of gas into the Dorudoil field, the development of the Khaf gas reservoir in the Salmanfield, the development of the new Belal oil field, and thereconstruction of installations and enhancement of the Sorush oilfield.The on shore projects comprise a gas condensate refinery in BandarAbbas, a project for the Shiraz refinery, the construction of a gascondensate recovery system at Lavan island, the construction of gasand liquefied natural gas plants in southern Iran, and a project forthe collection of oil field gases in the south.Foreign RelationsPakistanAlthough an official visit to Tehran by Prime Minister Bhutto hasserved to put a stamp on the increasingly close relations betweenPakistan and Iran, a potential source of discord is beginning toappear.  It seems that the two countries are supporting opposingsides in the conflict in Afghanistan.  Relations between Pakistan andthe government of Afghanistan are already under pressure followingAfghani government allegations that Prime Minister Bhutto'sgovernment is supporting the Taleban forces ranged against it.  Thishas been denied by Pakistan and was denied again by Prime MinisterBhutto during her visit to Iran.However, Iran has consistently supported the government of PresidentBurhanuddin Rabbani.  Moreover, shortly before Prime MinisterBhutto's visit, the Taleban forces officially complained that Iranwas training Afghan government troops in Iran.  Iran has also beenaccused of allowing Afghan government forces to operate from Iranianterritory to launch operations aimed at liberating the town of Herat.This has been denied by Iran, but the fact that the sympathies of thetwo new partners clearly lie with opposing factions could prove to bea problem in the future.IraqIranian involvement in Iraqi Kurdistan is growing, to anger of theIraqi government and exasperation of the USA.  After the failure ofthe peace conference between the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions -the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Kurdistan Democratic Party(KDP) -  in Dublin, Iran hosted another meeting between the two inTehran in October, and achieved at least a partial agreement.To make matters worse, reports surfaced in November that Iran hadarmed and dispatched units of Iraqi Shi'is to the Kurdish-inhabitedareas of Iraq in order to launch attacks against the Baghdadgovernment with the backing of the Iraqi National Congress. The unitsare reportedly from the Imam Ali Regiment, Badr Brigade, and havebeen deployed around Sulaymaniyah. (For further details see the Iraqreport in this issue.)United Arab EmiratesFour day long talks between expert teams from Iran and the UAE inDoha, UAE, over competing territorial claims ended in failure inNovember.  The dispute between the two countries centers around theGulf islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunb islands(Tunb al-Kubra and Tunb al-Sughra).The islands are claimed by Iran, particularly Abu Musa, which wasoccupied by Britain when it was the colonial power in the region.However, when Britain left the island in 1971 it did not hand it overto Iran but to the UAE.  The meeting apparently broke down when thetwo sides failed even to agree on its agenda - Iran wanted to discussthe administration of Abu Musa, while the UAE wanted to press itssovereignty claim.Iran has invited the UAE to hold to next round of talks in Tehran.Currently, the UAE is resisting this and no announcement has beenmade as to when the next round of talks will be held.TurkmenistanIran and Tukmenistan have agreed on a series of military cooperationmeasures, including joint exercises, following the first visit toTurkmenistan by an Iranian military delegation in November.Agreement has also been reached on Iranian and Turkmen border guardsworking together to prevent violations of the common borderJapanIran is concerned over US pressure on Japan not to make payment ofthe second installment of a loan agreed in April 1991.  Under theterms of the deal, Japan undertook to contribute N150 trillion inloans for construction f the Karun-4 dam in Iran's southern provinceof Khuzestan.  In May 1993, Japan made a first installment of N38.6billion (US$400 million) on the project.  However, it has not yetpaid the remainder.Pressure is now on Iran as it needs the remainder of the loan to bepaid now if it is to complete the project by the target date of 2000.Iran believes that the USA is putting strong pressure on Japan not topay the second installment and to cut back its trade with Iran.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N. AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996IRANFINANCEPresident Rafsanjani presented the budget for the year March 21,1996-March 20, 1997 on November 26.  This second annual budget in thesecond five-year development plan (1995-1999) totals Ir138,133.4billion, an increase of 43.8% on the 1995/96 budget.  However, withinflation running at over 50%, the budget represents a cut back inspending in real terms.The government's general budget was put at Ir60,742.3 billion, a30.9% increase on 1995/96.The budget for state-owned companies, profit-making institutesaffiliated to the government and banks is forecast at Ir90,248.4billion, up 41% on 1995/96.  Of this figure, Ir79,928.4 billionbelonged to state-owned companies, Ir1,935.7 billion to profit-makinginstitutions affiliated to the government, and Ir8,384.3 billion tobanks.Total revenues are put at Ir54,369.3 billion, an increase of 28.5%.Some 51.5% of the total comes from oil income, 19.6% from tax income,and 28.9% from other revenue sources.Of the total revenue for the government, 25.5% will come from taxeson oil and gas, electricity, posts and telecommunications services,29.2% from hard currency sales, 34% from income-expenditure items and11.3% from other items.The increase in tax incomes is mainly due to a rise in taxes leviedon non-governmental companies, on jobs and on imports, which willaccrue through the improvement in the country's economy and theexpansion of trade and manufacturing in the domestic economy.Crude oil production capacity is targeted to reach 4,250,000 b/d, andgas production by 110 million cu.m/day.  The capacity of Bandar Abbasrefinery is to be raised to 232,000 b/d.  The oil price has been setat US$15.5/bbl in the budget to produce a total government revenue ofsome US$15.5 billion.  However, as the current oil price is aroundUS$16/bbl, there is a likelihood that actual revenue will be abovethe budget figure.Current expenditure is put at Ir31,934.7 billion, up by 15%. Rises inthe salaries of civil servants, transfer payments and grants amountto Ir10.950 billion and account for 20% of the government's totalgeneral budget.Current expenditures on defense, education and training, health care,and social security have risen sharply.  Defense expenditure isslated to increase by 30.7%, from this year, to Ir5,900 billion,while spending on education and training is to rise by 41.7% toIr5,256 billion and spending on health care by 11.2% to Ir18,965billion.  On the other hand, current expenditures for importing oilproducts have been cut by 27.8% due to the success of consumptionreduction policies.Development credits are to rise by 53% to Ir22,684 billion in thenext financial year.  This will bring the ratio of developmentexpenditures to the government's total general budget to 42% from34.8% in the current budget.A number of industrial projects are due to go on stream next year,including eight food and pharmaceutical plants with 50,000 toncapacity, chemical plants with a total capacity of 342,000 tons,metallurgical plants with 20,000 tons capacity, a lamp manufacturingplant, two automobile spare parts plants, and six non-metals plantswith an annual capacity of 4.7 million tons.On infrastructure, 2,300 kilometers of roads and 800 kilometers ofrailway will be brought into service, including the 165 kilometerMashhad-Sarakhs line designed to link the Iranian railway to theCentral Asian network.  Cargo transportation volume is expected toreach 25.5 million tons compared with 23 million tons this year.A total of 450,000 new telephone lines are to be installed to bringthe number of villages connected to the national telephone network to2,220.  Mobile telephone usage is also expected to increase.In the cooperatives sector, the government is to help set up 3,600cooperatives with a membership of 319,600 to bring 850 projects intooperation, creating 45,460 new jobs with an investment of Ir3,356billion, which in turn will enable the building of 70,000 residentialhouses.In the farming sector red meat production is forecast to rise to685,000 tons, poultry to 660,000 tons, fish to 450,000 tons, milk to4.7 million tons and total protein from livestock and fisheries to7.17 million tons.The budget for state companies, banks and profit-making institutionsaffiliated to the government is put at Ir90,284 billion, accountingfor 65.3% of the total budget.To cater for the needs of the poor, the budgets of organizationsresponsible for supporting this group have been increased fromIr1,243 billion to Ir1,656 billion.  With the rise in the budget setaside to support the poor, some 1.3 million families consisting of4.5 million people will come under the government's support.  Of thefunds allocated to elimination of deprivation, Ir76 billion will bespent on implementing self-employment projects.Credits allocated to provinces for the year will be Ir2,492.2billion, 16.2% up.  This money will be spent on education, healthcare and infrastructure needs in such as road building, supply ofelectricity and drinking water, and production facilities for ruralareas.Credits earmarked to the deprived regions are increased by 22% toIr600 billion. A total of 77% of the figure comes from the provincialcredits and the remaining 23% from the national budget.Some Ir700 billion has been allocated to reconstruction projects andcompensation payments. Once this money is disbursed 85% of allreconstruction projects will be completed.On housing, the government is to provide 31 million sq.m of land forbuilding 93,000 residential units and will pay a part of the bankingcharges on loans granted for buying houses as well as offeringbanking subsidies to teachers.  The government will also boostinvestment in housing through the formation of credit cooperativesand housing investment companies.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N.

AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996IRAQPOLITICSThe most intriguing feature of the national referendum on SaddamHussein' presidency on October 15 was not the 99.96% who voted infavor, but the 0.04% who did not.  The regime says that 8,357,560voted, of which 8,348,700 plumped for seven more years of SaddamHussein's leadership.  That means that 8,860 people either spoiledtheir ballot papers or, heaven forfend, voted against.When asked by a reporter who these dissenters might be an electionofficial ventured the opinion that they might be either mentally illor of criminal intent.  Well, mad or bad, they are certainly brave.It is popularly said it only takes one brave man to make adifference: Iraq seems to have at least over 8,000 of them.Clearly buoyed up by the success of the referendum exercise,President Hussein has announced that elections to the NationalAssembly will be held early next year, possibly in February or March,and carried out a limited reshuffle of his government on November 6.Education Minister Hikmat Abdullah al-Bazzaz was made adviser at thepresidency and replaced as education minister by Abd al-Jabbar TawfiqMuhammad. Irrigation Minister Nizar Mum'ah was replaced by Housingand Reconstruction Minister, Mahmud Dhiyab al-Ahmad, and Abd al-IlahHamid Muhammad Salih was appointed minister of agriculture.Finally, just to confirm that the people's love of President Husseinis diminished only in so far as they also idolize his son, UdaySaddam Hussein was unanimously reconfirmed as president of theexecutive council of the National Union of Iraqi Students on November29 and given the powers of the Union's general assembly.In an "Alice in Wonderland" message to senior state officials onNovember 5, President Hussein said that all people were equal beforethe law, whether or not they were members of the Ba'th party and thatthose who abused their positions to gain favors for their own ortheir families' benefit were unfit to hold positions ofresponsibility.It would appear that the message was prompted by the fact that underthe UN sanctions corruption is getting out of control - out of thecontrol of the Hussein family that is.  In fact, corruption,particularly in diverting humanitarian aid, had become so blatantthat the government was forced to cut down on the number of fingersin the till.The problem was that an investigation a few months ago not onlyunearthed evidence of the activities of one particular group ofofficials, but also, inadvertently, implicated two high-rankingofficials Major-General Najm al-din al-Naqshabandi, the former seniorundersecretary at the Ministry of Interior, and Major-General HatimAli Khalaf, another former senior Interior Ministry official, as wellas a number of lesser mortals.The problem for the regime in this is that the two generals are bothclosely associated with it, particularly with President Saddam's son,Uday.  Given that the group had set up a network of foreign agents tohelp them launder the moneys gained from diverting funds, intendedfor humanitarian purposes, from various international agencies, itwas presumably feared that if they were made to suffer in any way,the foreign agents working for the two men might release informationthat would not only implicate close members of the ruling family, butalso impede their continued personal access to such funds.Against this background it came as no real surprise that the caseagainst the two generals never came to court.  In late November theNational Assembly, in a special vote, acquitted both of all charges.Their less well-placed confederates, however, have all been sent totrial on charges of illegal acquisition of land, cars and funds.They are Major-General Hashim Muhammad Faraj, Major-General Wa'dMahmud Sulayman and Dr Majid Khurshid.But the referendum, the promise of parliamentary elections andfulminations against corruption change nothing.  The UN sanctionsremain in place and the regime is only able to hang on to powerthrough the its ruthless imposition of a police state and theconstant weeding out of anyone though to present even the slightestrisk.  This combination of privation due to sanctions and fear offalling suspect produces a continuing stream of defections from thearmy to the Kurdish zone in the north.A group of high-ranking officers reportedly defected to northern Iraqshortly before the presidential referendum.  It included onebrigadier-general, two colonels and a major.  One of the defectors isColonel Yusuf Khalaf Khaffaji, the commander of the Second Battalionof Brigade 116.Iraqi KurdistanThe three northern provinces of Sulaymaniya, Arbil and Dohuk, whichform Iraqi Kurdistan and have been under UN protection in the form ofa no-fly zone since the 1991 Gulf war, continues to be riven byfeuding between the Kurds themselves.  However, just as the two mainIraqi Kurdish groups - the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) andKurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) - are inching towards settling theirdifferences, heavy fighting has broken out between the KDP and themilitant Turkish Kurdish group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).KDP versus PUKThe KDP, which is led Mas'ud Barzani, occupies the western part ofKurdistan and leans towards Turkey, while the PUK, which is led byJalal Talabani and occupies the southern part of the territory comesunder the influence of Iran.  The KDP is headquartered in thehill-top town of Salahuddin, while the PUK has occupied the "capital"of Kurdistan, Arbil.The two groups have been fighting each other since 1994 when theirinnate rivalry became uncontainable.  Its effect has been to destroythe dream that the internationally observed elections in the regionin 1992 would lead to the establishment of a parliamentary democracyin the region.  Instead it has only served to exacerbate the tribal,linguistic and regional differences that Saddam Hussein exploited tosuch effect in his efforts to break the back of Kurdish resistance.Indeed, the KDP's West Kurdistan and the PUK's South Kurdistan havevirtually the same boundaries now as the old Kurdish principalities.The fighting reached a peak in July, just before the two sidesattended US-sponsored peace talks in Dublin, when each launchedmassive tit-for-tat attacks on the other's headquarters.  Hundredsdied for absolutely no gain.However, the talks in Dublin, Ireland in August and September brokedown.  This failure opened the door for Iranian mediation, which ledto the holding of peace talks in Tehran between October 5-9.To the USA's exasperation, these talks did actually produce a partialagreement.  Most notably the PUK and KDP agreed to a cease-fire and,in principle, set May 4, 1996 as the date for new elections.  Bothsides also agreed to accept the results of the electionunconditionally.However, Iranian involvement went much further than this.   First,the cease-fire is to be monitored by the Iranian controlled SupremeAssembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI).  Second, it wasalso agreed Iraqi Shi'is located in Iran should participate inKurdish operations against Saddam Hussein's forces.  To this end,Iran dispatched armed units of Iraqi Shi'is to Iraqi Kurdistan inNovember.  According to an announcement from the Iraqi NationalCongress, the units fare from the Imam Ali Regiment, Badr Brigade,and have been deployed around Sulaymaniyah.The hand of Iran is also seen in the car bombing of the offices ofthe main Iranian opposition group, the Mojahedin-e Khalq, in centralBaghdad on November 27.  The explosion damaged buildings and shops inthe area but caused no casualties.  The organization blamed theIranian embassy in Baghdad of being responsible for the explosion,the 36th to target the center since 1993.All this is anathema to the USA, which desperately wants to keep Iranout of an increasingly fractious situation.  In an attempt to regainthe initiative it dispatched a delegation to Iraqi Kurdistan inNovember under the leadership of Robert Deutsch, head of the northernPersian Gulf desk at the US State Department.  Deutsch held separatetalks with both Barzani and Talabani, but it is not clear that anyconcrete progress, over and above that already made in Tehran, wasachieved.However, there are intimations that Deutsch found a more sympatheticreception from Talabani than from Barzani.  If true, this couldcomplicate matters further as Talabani's PUK depends heavily on Iran,while the KDP, at least for the moment, is more closely allied to theWest, in the form of Turkey, due to its ongoing battles with theKurdish Workers' Party (PKK).  The difficulty for US mediationefforts is that it is committed to maintaining the territorialintegrity of Iraq, while most Kurds, in both the KDP and PUK, want toestablish Iraqi Kurdistan as an independent sovereign state.KDP versus PKKTo add to these troubles a virtual war has now sprung up between thePKK and the KDP on the Iraqi Kurdistan side of the Iraqi-Turkishborder.  Conflict between the two organizations flared up afterTurkey's second cross-border assault on PKK positions in July.  ThePKK believes that the Turkish army received at least tacit supportfrom the KDP, which relies on Turkish government goodwill to formaintaining its cross-border supplies.When the Turkish troops withdrew, the PKK launched a series ofattacks on KDP positions.  The KDP counter-attacked in force inSeptember.  In the initial assaults it claimed to have killed orinjured more than 1,000 PKK members out of a force of 2,500 in onearea.The KDP kept up its attacks on the PKK through October and November.It its reports are to be believed the PKK has suffered heavy damage,both in men and materiel.  Turkey has officially offered itsassistance to the KDP in its fight with the PKK.  The KDP maintainsthat it has not accepted such support.  Whether or not this is true,relations between the KDP and the Turkish government are, to say theleast, cordial.  The same cannot be said of the PUK which hassteadfastly refused to become what it calls a Turkish gendarmerie tofight the PKK.The leader of the PKK, Anbdullah Ocalan, who is based in Syria andJordan called for a cease-fire in early November, but when the KDPcalled on his to surrender the fighting continued.JordanAlthough political relations may have been strained by the defectionof Hussein Kamel Hassan and his brother in August, it appears KingHussein is not prepared to take risk with his economy by downgradingtrade links with Iraq, particularly with regard to oil.  On September11, representatives of the two countries signed a memorandum ofunderstanding on oil issues in Baghdad, which will ensure that traderelations between Jordan and Iraq will remain as tight as ever.The memorandum not only contains an agreement to establish anIraqi-Jordanian company for oil studies and development, butadditional agreements to build a Jordanian-Iraqi refinery in Aqabaand to construct an Iraqi pipeline to the Zarqa refinery in Jordan.The Aqaba refinery is to have an initial capacity of 140,000 barrelsper day (b/d) with the option to increase this to 250,000 refinedb/d.  The projected capacity of the 600-km pipeline is put at aninitial 100,000 b/d, with the option to increase to 350,000 b/d inthe second stage.  The objective of the pipeline is to replace thecurrent system of road tanker transportation.  Currently the shipmentof Iraqi oil from Baghdad to the port of Aqaba employs 1,500 tankertrucks.In addition to these oil sector projects, discussions are alsounderway on boosting cooperation in electricity generation anddistribution and in industrial cooperation in such sectors aspharmaceuticals, canning and packaging, and engineering in general.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N. AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996IRAQECONOMYThe UN decision to maintain sanctions against Iraq despite the wealthof new information on its various programs for "weapons of massdestruction" handed over after the defection of the Kamel brothersand the referendum of Saddam Hussein's presidency in October, isextremely bad news for the people of Iran.The impoverishment of the country already underway as a result of theeight-year war with Iran, has accelerated under the UN sanctions.While the GDP per head has plummeted, inflation has soared.  A kebabwhich cost Id2 in 1990 now costs Id800.According to the UN's World Food program in Baghdad, four millionpeople in the country are now short of food, while the rate of childmalnutrition in central and southern Iraq is now higher than inSudan.  Infant mortality has reportedly increased by more than 25% ayear.However, with no progress in sight on Iraq being able to meet theconditions for lifting the sanctions the UN aid agencies are findingit increasingly difficult to get the donor countries to keep coughingup the funds to maintain the population in its present parlous state.In October the UN launched an appeal for US$183.3 million t fundhumanitarian programs in the country.  Although the sum asked for islower than previous requests the total has still not been met andonly 30% of the UN's funding requests have been raised since 1991.The USA gives no aid to Iraq as a whole, but channels all that itdoes give exclusively to the Kurdish controlled north.So far Saddam Hussein has resisted taking the opt-out of UNresolution 986 of April of this year, which allows Iraq to sell US$2billion worth of oil over six months exclusively for humanitarianpurposes.  The regime has refused to take up the option on thegrounds that the close monitoring involved is an affront to itssovereignty.  There must, however, be a question as to how muchlonger the resistance can be maintained.ON the other hand, if Iraq does decide to take advantage ofResolution 986 it could cause sever problems for other oil producers,particularly neighboring Gulf countries which are counting on therecent firming of international oil prices to get their economiesback in shape.  At their recent meeting OPEC members decided tomaintain the current output limits in order to maintain prices attheir current level.However, the input of Iraqi oil in the market could upset thedelicate price stability that has been achieved and drive pricesdown.  As the Resolution is concerned with revenue rather thanquantity, any fall in prices would force Iraq to increase sales inorder to reach the target figure of US$1 billion every three months.The increased output would have a further knock-on effect on pricesand could produce a downward price spiral.  While that would be goodnews for the consumer countries - those most concerned withmaintaining the sanctions - it could have a disastrous effect on theother oil producing countries in the region.Meanwhile, the government is trying to make up for a shortage ofhousehold gas in the coming winter.  In the first and second quartersof 1995 production of domestic gas was around 3,400 tonnes a day.The aim is to raise this to 4,600 tons a day in the final quarter ofthe year.But production is only part of the problem.  The gas has to betransported to the gas bottle filling stations in the towns.  As aresult of the sanctions - with spare parts like tires and batteriesin short supply, transportation costs have soared.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N.

AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996ISRAELPOLITICSPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's Labor Party prime ministeronly since 1992, was shot on the evening of November 4 whileattending a peace rally in Tel Aviv.  He died a short while later inhospital.  His murderer was an Israeli Jew, Yigal Amir, a 27-year oldlaw student at Bar Ilan University and a member of Eyal, a militantnationalist/religious group opposed to the peace process.The murder of their prime minister by another Jew was not only aphysical blow against the governance of the state, but also a massivepsychological blow against the people at large.  In this single act,Yigal Amir forced the Israeli people to admit that they too have beenas subverted by the struggle to retain the occupied territories ashave the Palestinian people in their effort to retrieve them.This subversion probably began with the disastrous invasion ofLebanon in June 1982, was compounded by the massive increase inIsraeli settlements in the West Bank under the same Likud government,and reached its final expression in the massacre of Palestinians atprayer in the mosque of the Cave of the Patriarchs by an Americanimmigrant settler, Baruch Goldstein, in February 1994.What was palpably obvious, but never before admitted, was that themilitant Israeli groups that sprung up among the West Bank settlersand their supporters in Israel proper was that they had the backing,direct and indirect, of the Israeli government.  In confrontationsbetween the settlers and their Palestinian neighbors, the Israelisecurity forces and government could always be counted on to bepartisan.After the Cave of the Patriarchs atrocity, the organization to whichGoldstein belonged, Kakh, was declared illegal.  However, its memberswere then absorbed by two other groups Eyal, led by Avishay Raviv,and Kahana Hay, led by Binyamin Kahana.  The connection between thesegroups and Kakh is underlined by the fact that the man responsiblefor securing funds for Kakh, Herbert Sunshein, is also responsiblefor securing funds for the other two groups.  And yet, theauthorities made no moves against either Eyal or Kahana Hay.  On thecontrary, it appears to have been deeply involved in both.It now appears that members of the Israeli internal intelligenceservice Shabak (formerly Shin Bet) were deeply involved in Eyal andwere aware on a day-to-day basis of its activities, including allegedfatal attacks on Palestinian civilians.  This could be seen as properinfiltration of a militant group by the authorities.  But if it wasmerely infiltration in order to secure intelligence, why did it failto secure any information that could be used against theorganization's claimed attacks on Palestinians, let alone the murderof Rabin?  One conclusion must be that the security forces weresupporting and encouraging Eyal's anti-Palestinian activities.It never seems to have occurred to the Israeli people at large, andparticularly to the main political parties and the security services,that they were breeding vipers in their breast, vipers that would oneday turn and bite their mentors. Hence the shock when a member of oneof those groups did exactly that by assassinating Rabin.Thus it was that while security around Rabin was extra-high duringthe peace rally, his bodyguards were looking only for Arab assassins,particularly after the murder by the Israeli secret services of theIslamic Jihad leader Fathi Shkaki outside his hotel in Malta, only afew days previously.It also appears that the mass militarization of the people workedagainst society in that Amir put into practice the skills gainedduring his compulsory military service.  It has been reported thatAmir was employed by Shabak in 1992 and that he used the techniqueshe learnt then to carry out the assassination.The response of Eyal's fund-raiser, Sunshein, to Rabin's murder wasto say his death "proves that God is in the world...On November 4when Rabin was shot, at the same time, on the Western calendar, MeirKahana was assassinated."The New GovernmentThe murder of Rabin threw the right-wing Likud into disarray.  On thedeath of the prime minister the deputy prime minister, foreignminister Shimon Peres automatically became caretaker.  If there isone man the Likud leadership views with even greater distaste than itviewed Yitzhak Rabin, that man is Shimon Peres, regarded by many onthe right in Israeli politics as the real architect of the peace planand therefore the arch traitor to the nation.But with Rabin slaughtered, as Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu putit, by another Jew, the party could not in conscience oppose Peres'forming a new government as Israel's next prime minister.  Again inthe words of Netanyahu, "political murder must not disrupt thecontinuity of government in a democratic republic".   As a result,Likud abstained in the parliamentary vote on the new governmentdespite having "no confidence in the path of the new government, justas we had no confidence in its predecessor's path".Although some parties like the Moledet insisted that they would stillvote against him, Likud's abstention from the upcoming parliamentaryvote removed the only real obstacle to Peres forming a new governmentunder his leadership.The assassination brought a closing of ranks in the Labor Party, withtwo defectors - Shmuel Avital and Amir Peretz of the New LifeMovement - returning to the fold.  However, Peres wanted more thanthat.Immediately on assuming the role of caretaker, Peres attempted tobroaden the coalition he had inherited from Rabin through theinclusion of one or more of the religious parties such as theNational Religious Party (NRP), United Torah Jewry, Tzomet and theTorah Observing Sephardim (Shas).  To this end he intimated he wouldaccept some of their demands on religious issues.This upset his existing coalition partner, the secular Meretz party,which threatened to leave the government if the NRP was brought in.This forced Peres to change tack and seek instead to secure thesupport of the religious parties in parliament, without includingthem in the coalition, by agreeing a "document of understanding" withthem.  However, he insisted that while Meretz would still be in thecoalition it would have no right of veto over negotiations with otherparties.Some of these parties would appear to make unlikely bedfellows.  Onlya few days after Rabin's murder, the Tzomet chairman and member ofparliament (MP), Refael Eytan, quoted to high school students Article29 of the Penal Code, which he claimed stipulated that anyone whohands over lands belonging to the state risks the death penalty.The clear inference was that Rabin had committed such a crime.The same article is used by the militant groups to justify theiractions.  In fact, the article refers only to acts of treason, suchas espionage, as determined by a court of law.  Moreover, it cannotbe applied to occupied territories as they are just that, occupiedterritories and not legally part of the sovereign state of Israel.In any event, Peres still had to retreat further to secure thecontinued support of Meretz.  On November 21, Labor agreed withMeretz that all new religious laws would require an a prioriagreement by all members of the coalition.  In other words, Meretzhas got its veto.With that matter settled the new government was formed on November 22as follows:Shimon Peres - prime minister and defense minister (Labor)Shulamit Aloni - minister of communications, science and the arts(Meretz)Yosi Beilin - minister in the prime minister's office (Labor)Binyamin Ben-Eliezer - construction and housing minister (Labor)Uzi Baram - minister of tourism (Labor)Ehud Baraq - foreign minister (Labor)Mikha Harish - industry and trade minister (Labor)David Libai - justice minister (Labor)Ora Namir - labor and welfare minister (Labor)Efrayim Sne - health minister (Labor)Rabbi Yehuda Amital - minister without portfolio (Independent/Meimad)Yair Tzaban - immigrant absorption minister (Meretz)Ya'aqov Tzur - agriculture and rural development minister (Labor)Yisrael Qeysar - transport minister (Labor)Anon Rubinstein - education, culture and sports minister (Meretz)Haim Ramon - interior minister (Labor)Gonen Segev - energy and infrastructure minister (Yiud)Avraham Shohat - finance minister (Labor)Moshe Shahal - minister of internal security (Labor)Shimon Shetrit - minister of religious affairs (Labor)Yosi Sarid - environment minister (Meretz)The first major surprise in the line-up was Peres' decision to takeon the defense portfolio, appointing Ori Or as his deputy.  Thesecond was his shake-up of the foreign ministry.  As Peres'selevation to the premiership had left the foreign portfolio vacant,it was natural enough for it to be filled, as it was by Ehud Baraq,the former chief of staff.  However, Peres went much further byappointing the former deputy foreign minister, Yosi Beilin, to hisown office and transferring responsibility for negotiations withSyria from Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to Washington, tothe director-general of the Foreign Ministry Uri Savir, who isalready responsible for negotiations with the Palestinians.The third surprise was the creation of a new Ministry of InternalSecurity, under the former Police Affairs minister, Moshe Shahal,made up of three commands - the police, the prisons service and theHome Front Command.  The creation of this ministry now leaves theIsraeli Defense Force (IDF) (i.e. the military services) onconcentrating its efforts on external threats to state security.The effect of these three measures is to massively increase thepowers of the prime minister's office in three critical areas -defense, the peace negotiations and internal security.There is little doubt that Rabin's assassination has been a setbackfor the right, particularly for the main party opposing the peaceplan - Likud.  Nevertheless, the forces ranged against any furthermoves remain large and, if the various splits are ignored, there isstill a possible majority against the peace process.Thankfully, however, the right continues to fissure.  Yet another newhard-line right-wing party was officially registered on November 14.Named the Yamin Yisrael (Israel's Right) it plans to contest the nextgeneral election.  Appeals were lodged against its registration onthe basis that it is a racist party representing illegal positions,but these were rejected by the party registrar.Yamin Yisrael was established by MP Shaul Gutman, who split fromMoledet, and Miryam Lapid from Qiryat Arba, the settlement thatproduced Baruch Goldstein.  It advocates the expulsion of Arabs andinsists that any partition of Eretz Yisrael (i.e. Israel plus theWest Bank, or Judea and Samaria) be prohibited by law.  It also callsfor the building of a Jewish temple on the Temple Mount.  The numbertwo in the party is Rahamin Kohen, a former Kakh movement executive.Peace ProcessThe Oslo B agreement, singed by prime Minister Rabin and PLO leaderYasser Arafat in Taba on September 28, was approved by the Israeliparliament on October 6 by 61 votes to 59, with all 120 members ofparliament attending.  The Labor members Qahalani and Zismann votedagainst.  It was the third agreement concluded between Israel and thePalestinians in the occupied territories, the first being theDeclaration of Principles singed on September 13, 1993 in Washington,and the second, the so-called Cairo Agreement signed on May 4, 1994.Overall, the agreement covers the withdrawal of Israeli control fromfurther areas of the occupied West Bank and its replacement byPalestinian control, and the holding of elections in the Palestinianareas in January 1996.  Once that is achieved further talks will beheld to secure another agreement on the vacation by Israel of furtherareas.However, such further withdrawal is to be severely limited.  Inpresenting the Taba agreement to parliament Rabin insisted Israelwill not return to the 1967 borders.  Instead, the security borderfor the state of Israel will be situated in Jordan Rift Valley "alongthe broadest possible interpretation of that term".  As a result, theEtyzyon Bloc, Efrat, Betar and other settlements, mostly situatedeast of the pre-Six-Day-War Green line will become an integral partof the state of Israel.  In addition, Israel intends to keep thewhole of Jerusalem, including Ma'ale Adumim and Givat Ze'ev, as theundivided capital of the state of Israel.The aim of all this, said Rabin, is to create an internationallyrecognized sovereign state of Israel and a Palestinian "entity",which will "manage the lives of the Palestinians under itsjurisdiction", will be "less than a state".To say that this is contentious hardly addresses the issues raised.The Palestinians have conceded much, i.e. their country, with the aimof achieving their own state with Jerusalem as its capital. However,here is the Israeli government stating categorically that neither ofthose aims will never be achieved.  Prime Minister Peres has repeatedall of Prime Minister's Rabin's statement.If that is Israel's stance, what will there be to discuss on thefourth round?  There certainly will be no point in the Palestiniansattempting to negotiate on the issues.  In his first publicappearance as foreign minister on November 23, Ehud Baraq told Laborparty members that Israel would secure all of these demands "becausewe are stronger".This seems to us to be a recipe for disaster ahead and a guaranteethat terrorism will continue.Meanwhile, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the additional areasoutlined in the Taba agreement have proceeded to plan.  Under this,Israel was due to vacate the Jenin area during the period October 25through November 19, the Tulkarm region by December 10, Nablus andQalqilyah by December 17, Bethlehem by December 20 and Ramallah onDecember 31.  Withdrawal from Hebron is to be completed in March.The Palestine National Authority (PNA) took control of Jenin onNovember 13, taking authority over transport, communications andmeteorological responsibilities.  The process of vacating Nablus andTulkarm began at around the same time and the vacation of Bethlehemand Hebron on November 15.  On November 28, 15 Palestinian officersarrived in the city of Qalqilyah to coordinate the takeover of thecity by the PNA on December 18-26.It has not been an entirely peaceful affair, however.  There wereviolent clashes in Nablus between youths and the Israeli occupationforces at the end of November. Youths blocked the streets withbarricades and burning tires and pelted Israeli patrols with stones.Soldiers responded by firing shots and rubber bullets and throwingpercussion grenades.  A total of 23 people were injured.  After calmwas restored two Israeli Border Police were abducted in Jenin.  Inaddition, the Israeli security forces killed a wanted Hamas (IslamicResistance Movement) member south of Hebron on November 28.  He wasMuhammad Nasir Musalimah.  The house in which he was hiding was firstsurrounded and then shelled with antitank rockets.  The house, withthe body of Musalimah still inside, was then bulldozed to the ground.In reiterating Prime Minister Rabin's minimum territorial demands,Prime Minister Peres said that the negotiations about the permanentarrangement, due to last three years, will start in May 1996, andsaid that he did not believe that anything significant pertaining tothe permanent arrangement would be decided before the parliamentaryelections in October next year.Elections in the Palestinian areas are due to be held on January 20.The election date was set by the Palestinian National Authority onNovember 4 - the day Rabin was murdered.  Registration of votersstarted on November 12.  There will be 66 European observers..PALESTINIAN AFFAIRSIn September, the PNA reached an agreement with the World Bankwhereby international aid would henceforth be transferred directly tothe PNA, and not to the Palestinian Economic Committee on Developmentand Reconstruction (PECDAR).  The PLO set up PECDAR, headed by AbuAla (Ahmad Quray), as the official address for international aid tothe PNA soon after signing the Oslo accord.The PNA's various offices competed to take over responsibility forthe aid funds, including Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Planning andInternational Cooperation Ministry, and to Abu Ala, who is also thehead of the Ministry of Economy.  However, it was agreed that thebulk of the funds will go to the Finance Ministry headed by Muhammadal-Nashashibi.This is not only a blow to Sha'th and Abu Ala, but, as Nashashibi isvery close to Yasser Arafat, but also ensures that Arafat will beable to control the distribution of the funds.  This will provideenormous political benefits and will enhance his powers of patronageeven further.UnemploymentIsrael has imposed further restrictions on Palestinian workers inIsrael despite reopening the border on October 17.  On the eve of theclosure, some 35,000 Palestinians were employed in Israel.  However,on lifting the closure Israel allowed entry to only 26,600, makinganother 8,400 unemployed.As of the opening only men of 35 years and older are allowed intoIsrael from Gaza.  Before the closure, the minimum age was 30.  Theminimum age for Palestinian workers from the West Bank was raisedfrom 28 to 30.  In both cases, only married men are allowed to workin Israel.The civilian work force in the West Bank stands at 250,000 of whom190,000 are employed in the region.  According to CivilAdministration data, the unemployment rate stands at 10%, some 25,000people.  Some 60,000 Palestinians are employed in the self-rule area,while some 14,000 work in Israel and the Eretz area.  The PNA claimsthat the unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip is almost 50% of thework force.Dr. Fu'ad Bsisu, governor of the PNA fiscal authority, has warnedthat unemployment might reach 32% in the West Bank and Gaza by thebeginning of this year.  He said that after 28 years of occupationthe restructuring of the Palestinian economy requires a strongbanking sector.Finance & AidIn this respect, a banking study prepared by the Palestinian fiscalauthority has reported that total deposits in the banks operating inPalestine reached US$975 million at the end of May 1995, reflecting aUS$387 million, 65%, increase on the end of December 1994.  Totalclient deposits in the PNA areas reached US$538 million at the end ofMay, reflecting a US$286 million increase, or 48%.  In the West Bank,total deposits up to the end of May reached US$437 million, anincrease of 30% on the end of December 1994.According to the study, Gaza and Jericho are the major contributorsto bank deposits in Palestine, contributing 55%.  Judging by thedemographic structure, Gaza inhabitants represent 38% of thepopulation and account for 25% of the GNP. The study notes thatGaza's share of commercial bank deposits is 55% of the total depositsin Palestine.  This indicates relative political and economicstability in the PNA areas.Foreign AidA European Union delegation, headed by Spanish Foreign MinisterJavier Solana, now the new head of NATO, signed an agreement for theprovision of US$300 million in soft loans to the PNA on October 27.The sum is part of the 1993 grant of US$600 million offered by the EUin 1993.  The money will be used to set up large-scale water,electricity and commercial projects.In November, the PNA's donor group recommended offering US$75 millionto cover the deficit in the Palestinian budget and US$600 million tofinance investment and social projects.  The sums were due to beapproved during the donor countries' ministerial meeting in Paris onDecember 9.Israeli Settlement ExpansionAlso in October the Peace Now settlement monitoring team claimed thatthe construction of 1,400 new housing units had started in the Jewishsettlements of the West Bank since the start of this year.  Peace Nowalso claimed that some 6,000 apartments are currently in variousstages of construction in the territories.  When they are inhabited,the apartments will provide a significant boost to the population ofthe Israeli settlements.  In the organization's view this willseriously harm the political process.It further claims that overall some 3,800 housing units have beencompleted this year in the area dubbed Greater Jerusalem after thework was approved by the special ministerial committee.  Another3,900 apartments will be built over the next year or so in the areabetween Ma'ale Adumim, the Etyzon Bloc and Giv'at Ze'ev.Peace Now surveyed each Israeli settlement individually.  It claimsthat the total number of apartments under construction last year isthe largest number since the Likud government.  If all the apartmentscurrently being built are inhabited, some 25,000 additional settlerswill be moving in.However, the government rejected the organization's claims.According to the then housing and construction minister, BinyaminBen-Eliezer, the ministerial committee charged with approvingconstruction projects in the occupied territories had approved theconstruction of only 500 housing units in Ma'ale Adumim, thecontinued construction of some 500 housing units in Betar, and workon privately-owned land in Giv'at Ze'ev, which had not yet started.As for Tel Aviv, the minister did admit that some 95,000 housingunits are being built, with a further 1,100 housing units in PsigatZe'ev in Greater Jerusalem.LEBANONThe continuing state of tension in the Israeli security zone insouthern Lebanon rose by several more degrees in October when sixIsraeli soldiers were killed by a booby-trap bomb in the easternsector.  The deaths provoked a massive Israeli reaction of targetedair attacks over the next several weeks.  Each of which was met withretaliatory action from the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine - General Command (PFLP-GC) and Hezbollah.In mid-November Israel intensified its bombardment of southern areasand carried out a massive air attack against PFLP-GC positions in theNa'mah hills, inflicting a large number of fatalities.  Following theattack, the PFLP-GC reportedly began dismantling its bases in Na'mahas a precautionary measure against further strikes.As for the bombardment, attacks on alleged Hezbollah villages onNovember 27 reportedly killed a number of ranking members of theorganization.  Hezbollah claimed that Israel used nail andfragmentation bombs in the attack and said it had it had no honorablealternative but to respond with the weapons it has to hand, namelythe Katyusha rockets.The next day Hezbollah fired a "relatively large number" of Katyusharockets into northern Israel in two salvos.  The missiles struck thearea around Qiryat Shimona in the Galilee but there were no reportedfatalities.The attack produced fury in Israel, with Prime Minister stating thatthe attack was a blatant breach of the understanding reached afterthe Israeli operation in Lebanon n 1993.  He went on to assign fullresponsibility to the Lebanese and Syrian governments.  Inparticular, he noted that Syria had to be held responsible for theactions of Hezbollah because it has a military deployment in thecountry.Backing up the prime minister, deputy defense minister Ori Or saidIsrael will make Hezbollah, Lebanon and Syria "pay the price" for theattacks.  However, the military had already issued a statement thatSyria had nothing to do with the attacks.  Israel is also limited inits response by its need to keep the peace process on track.  Afterall this is the fifth time Israel has vowed to retaliate afterKatyushas have been fired into northern Israel, and it has not doneso yet.So, the result has been more of the same. On November 28 a member ofHezbollah's security committee in Jibshit was killed when his car wasblown up, either form a bomb or a rocket fired by an Israeli plane.On November 30 Israeli warplanes carried out three air raids on theridges located between Mashgharah and Ayn al-Tinah firing 500 and1,000-pound air-to-ground missiles.Israel is also still enforcing its restriction on maritime trafficinside Lebanese territorial waters. In Late October it was reportedthat Israel had stepped up its patrols all along the coast betweenNaqurah and Sarafand, imposing a tight blockade on the ports fromwhich Lebanese fishermen operate.  Fishing boats also claim to havebeen subjected to machine-gun fire along the coast south of Tyre.On November 19, Israeli gunboats detained two Lebanese fishermen.They were released the next day with a map stipulating that fishingis only allowed in a one-kilometer area off Tyre's northern beaches.On November 30, Israeli gunboats seized two ships with a cargo ofcars heading for Tyre.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N. AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996ISRAELECONOMYIn addition to saying that he would hold the Rabin line on the peaceprocess, Prime Minister Peres also committed himself to pursuing thesame general thrust in economic policy.  That, however, is a line hemay find difficult to hold.Certainly, the past few years have been the best ever in Israel'ssocioeconomic history with GDP growth averaging nearly 5.6% over from1991 through 1994.  However inflation has been stubbornly resistantto the government's tight monetary policy.  Although the rate fell toaround 9% last year from 12.3% in 1994, growth started to pick uprapidly in the second half of the year, stoking up inflationarypressures.   Growth last year could well have been as high as 6.8%.This year Finance Minister Avraham Shohat has forecast a GDP growthof 6.8% and there is a strong possibility that inflation will riseagain.This is alarming.  Interest rates are already very high.  In Octoberlast the central bank raised its key lending rate charged tocommercial banks 13.7% to 14.2%.  This brought a sharp halt to agradual fall in  the rate from a high of 17% in November 1994.Moreover, the budget deficit situation is also worsening.  Accordingto the latest forecasts, the fiscal deficit is expected to turn outat 3.6% of GDP in 1995, compared with 0.9% in 1994 and well in excessof the government target of 2.75%.European UnionIsrael and the EU signed an economic agreement at the EU's Council ofMinisters in Brussels on November 20.  This is the largest and mostimportant international economic agreement signed by Israel.  Itreplaces the agreement signed about 20 years ago and includeselements that will improve and enhance the ties between Israel andthe EU countries.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N.

AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996JORDANPOLITICSConcern is rising both in the government and abroad over theheightened level of opposition to the peace agreement with Israel.The problem was brought into focus by a recent debate on the peaceprocess in parliament in which a number of deputies opposed thegovernment line.  The opposition was led by the Islamic Action Front,but supported by more than 13 nationalist, leftist and even centristdeputies.This was followed by the rejection of the government's normalizationof relations with Israel by the trade unions.  The government wasalso discomfited when in a democratic election the Islamists andleftists who oppose the it scored a landslide victory in the branchelections of the Jordan Engineers' Association.This has led some observers to claim the country is teetering on thebrink of a bloody confrontation between proponents and opponents ofthe peace.  Their argument is that this fundamental politicaldivision in the country is exacerbated by Jordan's purely domesticproblems such as the high level of unemployment which is officiallyput at 18% of the workforce, growing poverty and hardship, and thewidespread corruption in the government and bureaucracy.This mix is made worse, they contend, by Jordan's open door policy onimmigration.  Thus, Islamic militants have moved into Jordan fromother countries in the region with the express intent of fomentingtrouble.  Finally, there is the continuous external pressuregenerated by the continued UN sanctions against Iraq and thesuffering of its people to the east and the stand-off between Syriaand Israel to the north.This does at least appear to have the USA worried.  According to theJordanian newspaper Akhbar al-Usbu, the USA has been involved insecret discussion with exiled Jordanian opposition groups and someopposition groups inside the country.Also, the government's move in October and November to cut the numberof foreign workers in the country cannot be entirely unconnected withthese concerns.  According to Labor Minister Nader Abu el-Shaer, theforeign workforce of around 250,000 was cut by 70,000 in Octoberalone.  The hope is that this action will both cut down on the numberof potential foreign agitators and help to ease the unemploymentsituation for low-paid workers.Saudi ArabiaTo King Hussein's enormous relief, normal relations have beenrestored with Saudi Arabia and ambassadors exchanged.  The Saudiambassador arrived in Amman on November 11.  King Hussein is expectedto make a visit to Saudi Arabia soon.It was also announced that the defunct pipeline, which used to carry40,000 barrels of Saudi oil to Jordan daily, is to be repaired andput back into operation.IraqDespite the improvement in relations with Saudi Arabia, King Husseinis still treading a political tightrope in his relations with Iraq.So far his condemnation of the regime has been in non-specific termsand he has taken care not to criticize Saddam Hussein personally.This has been essential in that Jordan is still economicallydependent on Iraq (for details of the recent trade agreement see theIraq report in this issue) and that the majority of the Jordanianpeople are sympathetic to the political message emanating fromBaghdad.At the same time, however, he cannot afford to alienate either SaudiArabia or Kuwait.  To this end, King Hussein reportedly made contactswith some Iraqi opposition groups during his private visit to Londonrecently.  This, however, brought criticism from a rather unusualquarter, the pretender to the Iraqi throne, Sharif Ali Binal-Hussein.  In late November Sharif Ali, who is a member of theHashemite family to which King Hussein belongs, said such contactsconstituted a threat to the integrity of Iraq.Apparently, Sharif Ali, who heads an organization called the IraqiConstitutional Monarchy Movement and hopes to have himself installedas a constitutional monarch in Iraq after Saddam Hussein is broughtdown, fears that Iraq in its present divided state is ripe forbreak-up and sees the threat of a confederation between Jordan andthe rump of Iraq should the Kurds succeed in breaking away.IsraelDespite the domestic protests, however, relations with Israelcontinue to forge ahead.  On October 25 the two countries singed atrade deal which is expected to led to a rapid increase in tradebetween them.  Under it Israel has granted Jordan 20-50% exemptionsfrom customs on most Jordanian industrial products, including cement,furniture, foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals and toys.  For its part Jordanhas agreed to reduce its tariffs by 10% on a wide range of Israeliproducts, including plywood, tires, foodstuffs, electroniccomponents, medical and communications equipment and pharmaceuticals.The agreement takes account of the difference between the Israeli andJordanian economies: per capita income in Jordan is less than aquarter of the level in Israel.  The agreement will be in effect forthree years, after which the terms will be renegotiated.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N. AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996JORDANFINANCEJordan finally got its second debt write-off deal with the USA onSeptember 25.  Under the first deal US$220 million was canceled,while the second deal removed a further US$400 or so to bring thetotal amount of debt canceled to around US$640 million, around 10% ofthe country's total foreign debt.Also in September Japan announced its intention to extendgrants-in-aid totaling N1.12 billion to Jordan.  The aid consists ofN547 million to finance a project aimed at combating oil spill in thenorth of the Gulf of Aqaba, N550 million to help the country purchaseagricultural machinery to boost food production, and N24 millioncultural grant-in-aid to help Jordan's radio and TV corporationpurchase educational TV programs.In late October Japan also announced that it is to provide US$215million aid package, including a US$135 million loan from theExport-Import Bank of Japan, to help alleviate Jordan's foreignexchange shortage.Last but not least, the European Union is to provide a grant of 20million European Currency Units (Ecu) to help the kingdom implementits economic reform program.  The money will be used to financeprojects in the fields of health, education, social development andwater.In October Moody's Investors Service assigned a Ba3 long term ratingto Jordan's foreign currency debt, while and Standard & Poor'sassigned a B+ rating for the country's foreign currency debt and aBBB rating for local currency debt.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N.

AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996KUWAITECONOMYPrivatizationThe Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) said in November that it nowexpects the privatization program to be completed before the targetdate of end 1998 as a result of the increasing demand from investorsfor shares in the parastatals due to be hived off.Up to the end of October, the KIA - the body charged by thegovernment with executing the privatization program - had sold sharesworth Kd310 million (approximately US$1 billion).  Up to that date,some 15,000 people had subscribed to the shares sold and the monthlyshare trading figure had increased from an average of Kd45.3 millionin the first half of 1994 to Kd248.7 million in the first half of1995.Private deposits increased from Kd5.5 billion in June 1994 to Kd6.1billion in August 1995.  In addition the central bank had registereda decrease in the amount of transfers abroad.The increase in average share prices in the stock market has led tosimilar increases in the value of the portfolio of local shares heldby the state through the KIA.  The value of this portfolio hasincreased by more than Kd300 million since July 1994.The KIA holds more than 10% of the equity of 28 companies.  Thisstake is worth around Kd9.24 billion.  Approximately 34.5% of thistotal is in the banking sector, some 20.6% in the manufacturingsector and around 20.5% in the service sector.Oil SectorMeanwhile, Oil Minister, Dr. Abd al-Muhsin al-Mid'ij, said inSeptember that the level of investment the private sector couldcontribute to the oil industry after 1997 could be as much as US$10million.He said that the Kuwaiti Petroleum Corporation (KPC) is planning toincrease its oil production to three million barrels per day (b/d) bythe beginning of the next century and to around 3.5 million b/d bythe year 2005.  As for the refining sector, the plans are to increasethe volume of oil refined by Kuwait refineries from 800,000 b/d toaround one million b/d by the year 2000.Prior to the November meeting of OPEC oil and energy ministers inNovember, Mid'ij appeared to be urging his partners to raise Kuwait'sproduction ceiling from 2.0 million b/d to 2.2 million b/d.  However,Mid'ij also talked of wanting to raise the oil price to US$21/bbl.Given the excess capacity in the market and an oil price at the timeof around US$16/bbl, the two aims were clearly incompatible.In the event the OPEC meeting decided to keep the organization'soverall production ceiling at 24.52 million b/d up to the end of Junethis year.  As a result, the production ceilings of all membercountries, including Kuwait, will remain the same.  By maintainingtotal output against a forecast rise n global demand of 1.4 millionb/d this year, OPEC is hoping that the oil price will risesignificantly towards the US$21/bbl figure this year.It was announced in October that a new oil deposit has beendiscovered in the Kira al-Maru, in western Kuwait.  Outflow from thenew discovery started on October 19.  The outflow is of light oil ,the first time such oil has been discovered in the area.The Kuwait Oil Company's exploration at Kira al-Maru began in June1990, but was halted by the Iraqi invasion.  Work resumed in February1994.  Preliminary estimates indicate that deposits in the new fieldamount to 300-400 million barrels.Foreign Economic RelationsThe Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC) signed a memorandum ofunderstanding with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in September on thesetting up of a joint oil refinery with an estimated annual capacityof about six million tonnes - which could be increased to 10 milliontonnes - at a cost of more than US$1 billion.The project is to be set up and operated in the state of Orissa innortheast India by a new joint company.  The KPC and IOC will eachhold 26% of the shares of the joint company, while the remainingshares, 48%, will be offered to individuals and institutions inIndia.The financing of the project depends on the use of the paid capitaland foreign loans.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N.

AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MOROCCOPOLITICSDespite the current economic difficulties, the kingdom retains itsmoderate political risk.  However, in that King Hassan, by virtue ofhis near absolute powers, is the key to political stability therewere some anxious moments in late October when his was taken ill inNew York in the USA.The king apparently caught influenza which then deteriorated into anacute respiratory infection.  Although he has apparently recoveredfully and has returned home, he has been advised to take severalweeks recuperation.CorruptionMeanwhile, the government's latest attempt to cut back on the blatantcorruption in the country resulted in the arrest of more than 2,000people in mid November.  The arrests resulted from the latestanti-corruption measures and most of the detentions - 826 - were madein and around the port city of Casablanca, while the center-northcame second with 423.  Most of those arrested were charged withattempting to bribe policemen.The number of arrests sounds impressive but in reality can barely bedescribed as even the tip of the iceberg.  The whole of thebureaucracy in Morocco is riven with bribery and "baksheesh", inwhich paying policemen to turn a blind eye to parking offenses andtraffic violations is but a minor part.  It is virtually impossiblefor a citizen to obtain a building permit, birth certificate, deathcertificate or any other official document without money changinghands under the counter.Political TerrorismAlthough Morocco has no domestic problem with political terrorism,proof positive has emerged that some of its citizens are takingadvantage of the terrorist activity in neighboring Algeria with thearrest of a group of arms' smugglers on the Moroccan side of theborder.Although the arrests were made in mid-September, they were notannounced until mid-October.  There were 17 members in the group, 12Moroccans and five Algerians.  According to the government, theMoroccans were either small traders or unemployed, aged between 25and 40.  The Algerians are believed to be members of the Algerianterrorist group Groupe Armi Islamique (GIA).  They face prisonsentences of 5-20 years.Western SaharaThe registration process of voters in the referendum on the futurestatus of the territory, scheduled for January 1996, continues at asnail's pace.  In July, the Moroccan government suddenly presented afurther 100,000 application forms for Moroccans its claims originatedfrom Western Sahara.  This has snarled up the registration process tosuch an extent that in November the President of the self-styledSaharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), Mohamed Abdelaziz, wrote tothe UN secretary-general warning that the whole process was on thepoint of impasse.Meanwhile, the first elected Saharan National Assembly was installedat the refugee camps in Tindouf on October 12, to coincide with the20th anniversary of the proclamation of the SADR. The Assemblyconsists of 101 members.In November, the SADR's armed wing, the Polisario Front released 186Moroccan prisoners of war.  These men had been released in 1989, butthe Moroccan government refused to receive them on the grounds thatthere were no Moroccan POWs.Relations between the SADR and the Moroccan government also cameunder further strain in August, when Morocco opened talks with Russiaon renewing the three-year fishing accord that permits Russian shipsto fish off the Western Saharan coast.The SADR has always regarded the accord, which was signed in August1992 as, a deliberate provocation that runs counter to theUN-brokered peace plan signed by both sides in August 1988.  It alsoregards the accord as being part of Morocco's policy of establishinginternational legitimacy to its claim of sovereignty over the regionin advance of the referendum.  The accord was the first signed byMorocco which was limited exclusively to the Western Sahara.European UnionThe long-running dispute with the European Union (EU) over fishingrights was finally brought to a conclusion on November 15 last aspart of a new partnership agreement.  The EU had hoped to get thefishing treaty out of the way before the trade accord was dealt with.However, Morocco, realizing the leverage the fishing deal gave it innegotiations on the accord hung on until the EU was forced toconsider both together.  The overall result is that Morocco hassecured both agreements under arguably better terms than it wouldhave done.It has been a tough negotiation.  When Morocco refused to renew theexisting fisheries agreement when it expired on April 30 last year,relations between Morocco and the EU, particularly Spain, plunged.With its fishing vessels barred from Moroccan waters, Spain faced theloss of around 40,000 jobs in its fishing industry.Pressure was also on the EU in general as it wanted the partnershipagreement drawn up before the Euro-Mediterranean conference which washeld in Barcelona on November 27/28.  It was also important in thatthe EU sees partnership agreements with the countries of the Maghrebas an essential contributor to stability on its southern flank.The new fisheries agreement, which comes into effect on September 1,1996, is for a non-renewable four years.  During this period Moroccowill modernize its fishing fleet, expand its structure and ports,train seamen and prepare a scientific research program to manage itsfish resources.  For its part, the EU will provide financial aid tofund these tasks and has undertaken to restructure its fleet andgradually reduce its use of Moroccan territorial waters.  To thisend, the EU's financial contribution of Ecu102 million is to beraised by 20-30%.Over the period of the agreement, has agreed to cut its catch ofmolluscs by 40% and of crustaceans by 34%.  The catch of otherspecies is also to be reduced.  At the same time, EU vessels areobliged to land 30% of their catches in Moroccan ports.   Moroccanwaters on condition that there is a gradual reduction of the volumeof fishing over the coming four years at a rate of 40% for molluscsand 34% for crustaceans and a percentage of the EU ships' cargoes areunloaded at Moroccan ports.  EU fishermen have also committedthemselves to respecting the biological rest period to allow stocksto recover and to employing one or more Moroccan sailors per vessel.The partnership agreement provides improved access to the EU marketsfor Morocco's agricultural produce and is a key element in the EU'sstrategy to create a Euro-Med free trade zone by 2010.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N. AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MOROCCOECONOMYFollowing a government report in September that economic growth willslow, and that unemployment, the budget deficit and inflation willclimb if current policies are not changed, King Hassan announced inOctober that Morocco is to introduce a series of five-year plans, thefirst covering the period from 1995 until 2000.Addressing the House of Representatives on the opening of the newparliamentary term on October 13, the king said he had asked theWorld Bank in June to carry out analyses of three areas of concern tohim:  education, administrative reforms and Morocco's future policyon economic, financial and trade issues.  He said the World Bank'sreports on the first two subjects, which he had recently received,had made "painful" reading.On that basis, said the king, he had reached the conclusion that theproblems and the challenges are so great that they must be tackledthrough a "full and comprehensive" national debate.  In particular,the king pointed out that the year of drought had put enormouspressure on the country and that it faced some difficult debtrepayment hurdles in 1997 and 1998.The September report forecast that the drought will cut agriculturaloutput by around 56% this year, with a concomitant fall in the GDP of4-5%.   As the 1995 budget had forecast a growth of 2.5%, it appearsthat the country will suffer a negative growth in real terms.Foreign TradeThe foreign trade turnover increased by 3.4% in the first six monthsof 1995. Exports totaled Md53,886 million in the period, comparedMd52,113 million in the same period of 1994.The export of food products increased by 14.1% to Md5,367 million,from Md4,703 million in the same period of 1994.  Exports of energyproducts rose from Md13,000 million in 1994 to Md14,326 million,while phosphate exports increased by 14%, or Md94 million, to Md769million from Md675 million in 1994.Overall, imports declined.  However, there was a sharp 8.1% increasein the import of food products, mainly cereals, as a result of thedrought.  The trade deficit in the period was reduced by 6.9% toMd15,889 million.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N.

AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SAUDI ARABIAPOLITICSConcerns about the health of 74-year old King Fahd rose again when hewas admitted to the King Faysal specialist hospital in Riyadh onNovember 29.  Official statements said that he entered hospital for aroutine medical check up and that he is fit and well.  However, KingFahd is beleived to be terminally ill with advanced kidney failure.As a result, he frequently loses consciousness and has to receiveblood transfusions to compensate for the occasional heavy bleedingresulting from his condition.Under those circumtances, it is not surprising that the rumor flewaround the Middle East that the king had actually suffered a minorstroke.  The idea that the visit was indeed more than routine wasgiven further credence by the flurry of goodwill and get wellmessages from other Arab leaders.  After all, if he hadn't been ill,what was the point?TerrorismBut while concerns over the health of the king have been around forsome time now, concerns over terrorist activity in the kingdom havenot.  That nonchalance was rapidly expelled in October and Novemberwhen first a mosque and then the a US military installation werebombed.No organization has claimed responsibility for the first attack, on amosque in Quba in the Bishah region in late October.  From the scantdetails available, it appears a Saudi threw a bomb into the mosquewhile people were at prayer. Six people were killed and 101 injuredin the explosion.  The bomber escaped the scene but was hunted downand cornered in a mountainous area in the province of Namas.  Therewas apparently an exchange of gunfire in which one policeman waskilled.  The man then blew himself up.There is, as yet, no evidence to connect this to the second incidenton November 13 when a car bomb was detonated outside a US militarycommunications center in the capital Riyadh.  Six people were killedand over 60 injured.   Part of the three-story building collapsed andbuildings were damaged up to half a kilometer away.  The bombersescaped without detection.A few days later, the government denied that there had also beenunsuccessful attempts to blow up the offices of the Defense Ministryand the Petromin (General Petroleum and Minerals Organization).The bombing in Riyadh, in particular, is a serious warning that evena state as rigidly controlled as Saudi Arabia is not immune to theforces of militant Islam that are wreaking such havoc elsewhere inthe Middle East and appears to be in line with a growing radicalismin the kingdom.  First came the establishment and subsequent crushingof the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights (CDLR) in May1993 and the roundup of hundreds of clerics and dissident academicsin the north-western province of Qasim last year.  This year,leaflets have been circulated in Riyadh warning foreigners to desistfrom involving themselves in Saudi affairs.It appears that general dissatisfactions, domestically because of thetwo-year recession, and abroad because of what is seen by the publicas the poor deal meted out to the Palestinians in the peace agreementwith Israel, have coalesced into an opposition to the presence in thekingdom of not only foreign, but non-Arab and non-Muslim forces.There is another problem.  At least 5,000 Saudi youths receivedcombat training in Afghanistan.  Some estimate the number could be ashigh as 10,000.  The presence of such a large number of experiencedfundamentalist fighters outside of the government's control.  Thethree groups that have claimed responsibility for the Riyadh bombinghave almost certainly been drawn from their ranks.According to Dr Muhammad al-Mas'ari, the official spokesman of theexiled CDLR, now based in London, England, these groups have carriedout no actions up to now because they could not obtain a fatwa tocarry out an armed attack on foreign forces in the kingdom.  Thebasis they used to request such a fatwa is a religious ruling whichstipulates that no non-Islamic force, armed or not, should be presentin the Arabian Peninsula.  This ruling applies to the whole Islamicworld and precludes Muslims everywhere from seeking help fromnon-Muslims in the Arabian peninsula.However, requests for a fatwa have been consistently rejected by suchdistinguished clerics and leaders such as Safar al-Hawali, Salmanal-Awdah and others.  The presumption by many is that a fatwa has nowbeen secured from a leading cleric outside of the kingdom.The organizations that have claimed responsibility for the bombingare the Tigers of the Gulf, the Partisans of God, , and the JihadWing of the Islamic Movement for Change.  Only the last of thesegroups is known.   However all previous statements from the JihadWing, demanding that all foreign forces leave the Arabian peninsula,have been made in writing.  All of the claims of responsibility forthe Riyadh bombing have been made by telephone.Although the attack automatically increases the political terrorismthreat component in our assessment of Saudi Arabia's political risk,we do not see the threat as great on current evidence.Finally, and to the intense embarrassment of all concerned, it becameknown in November that the US security forces had arrested one of itsservicemen, a Lt-Col Michael Schwart, in September on suspicion ofspying for Saudi Arabia.  Schwart was serving in the US navalintelligence base in Riyadh when he was arrested.However, Schwart has not been charged with espionage and betrayinghis country.  This treatment stands in sharp contrast to that ofanother US citizen, Jonathan Pollard, who has spent 10 years in jailfor spying for Israel.  In recognition of his work, the Israeligovernment granted Pollard Israeli citizenship in late November.Government ChangesAfter only three months in the job, Dr. Sulaymani Bin Abd al-Azizal-Salim resigned as finance and national economy minister on October9.  The official reason given for his sudden departure is the stateof his health.  Given that he has a history of heart trouble and hasbeen treated for the same in London, there is no obvious reason topresume ulterior reasons.He was replaced on the same day by Dr Abd al-Aziz bin Abdullahal-Khuwaytir.  Al-Khuwaytir had been education minister since 1975,but was appointed minister without portfolio in the August reshufflethat put Al-Salim into finance.There are considerable differences between the two men.  Al-Salimcould be regarded as a technocrat, despite his long experience ingovernment (he had been commerce minister for 20 years before hisappointment to finance).  Despite this long service, Al-Salim isstill only 54 years old and is held in high regard in the USA as wellas Saudi Arabia.Al-Khuwaytir, on the other hand is considerably older at 68 and muchmore of an insider, being much more of a trusted retainer to the kingthan just a minister.  Thus while Al-Salim's appointment could beseen as a signal that King Fahd had finally decided to allow decisivenew action to be taken in the management of the economy, hisreplacement gives the impression of a "steady-as-she-goes" approach,with little prospect of fundamental change.This difference between the two men is so stark that mostcommentators believe that Al-Khuwaytir's appointment is onlytemporary and that he will soon be replaced by another, youngerfinancial or economic technician.  The top names currently touted areHamad Al-Sayari, the 54-year old governor of the Saudi central bankand Ahmad Abdul Latif, the 60-year old president of the Arab BankingCorporation.However, there is always the possibility that Al-Salim's resignationhad more to do with the way he was running his portfolio than hishealth, and that King Fahd did not like the proposed changes ofdirection.  If that is the case, then the appointment ofAl-Khuwaytir, who can be relied on to have much the same mind set asthe king, could be a great deal more permanent than is presumed.  Itwould also indicate that reforms, if any, will be conducted at a muchslower pace.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N. AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SAUDI ARABIAECONOMYAn indicator that King Fahd may be backtracking on his commitment toreform is the government's claim in November that it has now managedto overcome its financial difficulties and that these were anywayexaggerated by the foreign media.In particular, the government statement claimed that the financialdeficit in the first half of 1995 had been reduced to 2% of GDP,compared with a deficit of about 9% in 1994.  The deficit in theforeign current account in the period was also reduced to 2% of GDP,from 8% in 1994.The problem is that this improvement is almost entirely due to thestrengthening of international oil prices last year.  The reformprocess began last year with an austerity budget designed to cutspending by 6% to US$40 billion in order to pull the budget deficitdown to US$4 billion.  This compares with deficits of US$37.62billion in 1991, US$-11.13 billion in 1992, US$9.53 billion in 1993,and US$10.68 billion in 1994.However, the oil revenue projections in the budget were based on anoil price of only US$14/bbl.  However, oil prices averagedUS$15.50/bbl through most of last year.  This extra income, probablysomewhere in excess of US$3 billion, has been the major contributorto the country's improved financial situation.However, the real imbalances in the economy, such as the growingunemployment among the educated young, the sharp rise in inflation(up to 6% from 1-2%), and government payment arrears of US$405billion, are still there.  Complacency now could be disastrous.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N.

There is also a good deal of fraud beingperpetrated over land contracts.There has also been some attempted terrorism of late.  A group ofwhat the government called "sabotage elements" were arrested at theend of September in Aden and another group in mid-November.  They arenot believed to be related to the militant Islamic groups in Egypt,but to the defeated Yemeni Socialist Party, whose leadership wasforced to flee the country after its defeat in the civil war in 1994.The government admits that yet other groups could still be at largeand the possibility of at least isolated acts of terrorism cannot bediscounted.  In an effort to reduce the risk, the government hasdeported some 4,000 Algerian, Libyan, Egyptian and Sudanese nationalsin October and November.  According to Prime Minister al-Ghani, theaim of the deportation program was to prevent Aden being used as abase for terrorist activities against its neighbors.  Particulareffort has been made to locate and detain any Egyptian nationalsbelieved to be conspiring against the Egyptian state.A new minister for expatriate affairs, Fadl Muhammad bin Aydarutal-Afifi, was appointed on November 11.Foreign RelationsThe rapprochement with Saudi Arabia appears to be continuingaccording to plan.  The third Saudi-Yemeni joint committee for borderdemarcation held its third session in San'a during November 5-9 in areportedly friendly and cooperative atmosphere.  Agreement wasreached to start implementing the time table of the technical fieldwork of border demarcation.  The fourth session is due to begin onDecember 25.Although relations with Saudi Arabia are clearly on an improvingtrack, relations with Kuwait remain sticky.  Deputy prime ministerand foreign minister Abnd al-Karim al-Iryani went some way towardsallaying Kuwaiti concerns in late October when he said that Yemen hadnever adopted a policy supporting or entrenching the occupation ofKuwait and that claims to the contrary were a falsification ofYemen's position.However, the effect of this was rather spoilt when Yemen latersupported the call by the United Arab Emirates for the UN sanctionsagainst Iraq to be lifted.EritreaYemen has also managed to blunder into a territorial dispute withEritrea over three Red Sea islands - Hunaysh al-Kubra, Zukar andHunaysh al-Sughrah.  The islands have been occupied by Yemen, whichis hoping to develop them as tourist centers.In mid-November Eritrean naval patrols attempted to land on one ofthe islands when it appeared that tourists facilities were underconstruction there.  Yemeni military units on the island preventedthe Eritreans from landing.  In response Eritrea warned Yemenimilitary units and fishermen to evacuate the island on the basis thatit is disputed territory.In an effort to cool the situation the two sides have agreed to aseries of talks on the status of the islands.  The first of thesemeetings took place in San'a on November 22.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: MID-EAST & N. AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996YEMENECONOMYThis year is to be the first in a new five-year plan extending to theyear 2000 aimed at establishing the primary development projects inorder to provide a base for the future development of the economy.The government says the plan will be carried out in line with thecommitments it has already made to maintain its economic reformprograms, combat financial and administrative corruption, improveproduction, and encourage investment, exports, trade exchange andcompetition.  Apart from oil and gas developments, particularattention is to be paid to agriculture, tourism and fisheryresources.The key to Yemen's future economic development is oil and gas.  Inthis respect, a major step forward was achieved in September with thesigning of the final agreement on a project to liquefy and exportnatural gas with the French company Total.  Negotiations are underway with the US companies Hunt and Exxon with the aim of having themparticipate in the project as well.  South Korea has already putitself forward as a potential buyer of Yemeni gas.Overall, the US$3 billion project is forecast to produce five milliontonnes of natural gas a year for 25 years.  This will produce anannual revenues of about US$600, the bulk of which will be earmarkedto boost agricultural and industrial development, and improveservices.Another major project is the development and modernization of theAden refinery.  Bids for the work have been tendered by foreigncompanies and are currently being studied.  The project should getunderway this year.Currently, oil production is concentrated in two areas - Sector No.18 in Ma'rib and Jawf and Sector No. 14 in the Masilah area inHadhramawt Governorate - which jointly produce about 350,000 barrelsper day (b/d).  Crude oil production from these fields is expected toincrease this year due to the continued drilling of development wellsand to the coming on stream of new fields in the Jannah area, knownas Sector No. 5.  This should add around 25,000 b/d to next year'soutput total.  Also due to come into operation soon are the Farid andAtud fields in the eastern part of Shabwah, known as Sector No. 10.Initial production from these fields is expected to be 12,000 b/d.Overall, some 26 international companies are carrying out surveys orexploratory drilling operations in the country and the potential forfurther major discoveries appears high.  Total has already beendiscovered oil in commercial quantities at Qaribah and Hisnal-Karadis in eastern Shabwah.  On that basis the government isexpecting to increase its overall oil production by up to 60,000 b/dthis year.  Following the completion of oil pipeline projects, outputshould rise to 500,000 b/d.  Natural gas output is expected to reachsix million tonnes a year and should be able to be increased to sevenmillion tonnes.Back to Headline List WT03-B04-19IA087-000634-B037-52http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it14.html 205.156.212.5 19970122024031 text/html 75134HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:38:31 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:24 GMTContent-length: 74947Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it14.html Sample Issue Copyright COUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNet JANUARY 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES REGIONAL SURVEY COMPOSITE RISK RATINGS* (252 words) BOTSWANA BASIC DATA (240 words) BOTSWANA POLITICS (602 words) BOTSWANA ECONOMY (495 words) COTE D'IVOIRE BASIC DATA (279 words) COTE D'IVOIRE POLITICS (774 words) GABON BASIC DATA (281 words) GABON POLITICS (1169 words) GABON ECONOMY (430 words) MADAGASCAR BASIC DATA (276 words) MADAGASCAR POLITICS (508 words) MALI BASIC DATA (280 words) MALI POLITICS (556 words) MALI ECONOMY (296 words) MOZAMBIQUE BASIC DATA (268 words) MOZAMBIQUE POLITICS (1451 words) MOZAMBIQUE ECONOMY (281 words) TANZANIA BASIC DATA (277 words) TANZANIA POLITICS (934 words) TOGO BASIC DATA (274 words) TOGO POLITICS (280 words) TOGO FINANCE (42 words) UGANDA BASIC DATA (255 words) UGANDA POLITICS (523 words) ZAIRE BASIC DATA (265 words) ZAIRE POLITICS (554 words) CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996COMPOSITE RISK RATINGS*CURRENT ASSESSMENTS AND ONE-YEAR FORECASTS                CURRENT RATINGS                 COMPOSITE RATINGS                Political  Financial  Economic  Year   Current  Year                Risk       Risk       Risk      Ago    Month    AheadCOUNTRY         01/96      01/96      01/95     01/95  01/96    01/97Angola          51.0       21.0       38.5      48.5   55.5     57.0Botswana        72.0       40.0       42.0      78.0   77.0     78.0Burkina Faso    54.0       28.0       32.0      58.5   57.0     58.5Cameroon        51.0       29.0       30.0      49.0   55.0     55.5Congo           53.0       27.0       28.5      55.0   54.5     56.5Cote d'Ivoire   59.0       28.0       32.0      60.0   59.5     62.5Ethiopia        60.0       25.0       33.5      51.5   59.5     58.0Gabon           59.0       34.0       35.0      63.0   64.0     62.0Gambia          56.0       24.0       33.5      58.0   57.0     58.0Ghana           65.0       33.0       30.5      63.5   64.5     67.0Guinea          51.0       25.0       30.0      51.5   53.0     53.5Guinea Bissau   44.0       20.0       23.0      38.0   43.5     47.0Kenya           67.0       34.0       31.5      63.0   66.5     65.5Liberia         32.0        8.0       14.5      23.5   27.5     30.0Madagascar      59.0       20.0       25.5      50.5   52.5     54.5Malawi          64.0       28.0       27.0      54.0   59.5     60.0Mali            57.0       19.0       30.0      54.0   53.0     56.5Mozambique      57.0       25.0       13.5      48.5   48.0     50.5Namibia         77.0       31.0       40.5      72.5   74.5     78.0Niger           47.0       29.0       23.5      48.0   50.0     50.5Nigeria         53.0       23.0       23.5      51.5   50.0     60.0Senegal         59.0       29.0       34.5      56.0   61.5     62.0Sierra Leone    30.0       16.0       24.5      35.0   35.5     40.0Somalia         28.0       10.0        8.5      19.5   23.5     28.0South Africa    75.0       41.0       35.5      75.0   76.0     77.5Tanzania        65.0       32.0       24.5      61.0   61.0     63.0Togo            51.0       28.0       30.0      51.5   54.5     55.0Uganda          52.0       25.0       32.5      56.5   55.0     60.0Zaire           34.0       14.0       25.5      34.0   37.0     48.0Zambia          65.0       27.0       29.5      55.0   61.0     62.0Zimbabwe        66.0       28.0       32.5      63.5   63.5     67.0Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996BOTSWANABASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . . . .

During the last presidential andlegislative elections - held in October 1994 - the Merahfe gainedcontrol of a larger number of seats in the 40-seat National Assemblythan the Kwelagobe faction.  This led to calls from the Merahfe forchanges to the constitution that would ensure all tribes would begiven equal status.  However, these calls were rejected by theKwelagobe, which enjoys the support of President Masire, and has,since the country's independence from the UK in 1966, been thefaction from which the ruling elite has predominantly been drawn.Masire's continued support of the Kwelagobe position caused a gooddeal of anger amongst the Merahfe.  The ensuing row resulted in theMerahfe collaborating with the opposition Botswana National Front(BNF) to install Moutlakgola Nwako, a long-time opponent of Masire,as speaker of the House.  The subsequent limiting of presidentialterms is a result of both the renewed vigor of the Merahfe inpursuing their aim and a recognition on the part of Masire that,despite the next elections being some four years off, without somedegree of internal reconciliation, the BDP faces the possibility of asplit so damaging that it would end its 29 year-old hold on power.Just how far the recent change will go in lessening the Merahfe'sbelief that it is treated as a second class faction within the BDP isunclear.  Any hopes that they may have had that Masire, who has heldoffice since 1980, far in excess of two terms, would resign in orderthat a new, Merahfe, president could take over, were quickly dampenedwhen Masire said that changes to the constitution were not meant foran individual and that he retained the right to resign when hepleased.Masire's position was underlined by BDP chairman, PonatshegoKedikilwe, when he responded to a press report in The BotswanaGazette that suggested that Masire would leave office at the end ofthis term as a result of the constitutional change.  According toKedikilwe, the two term restriction will only apply from the 1999elections and will not be retrospective.  Neither does the resolutionprevent someone who has been president before continuing for the twoterm period.  This leaves the Merahfe facing the prospect of Masireremaining in office until 2009 should the BDP continue to maintainelectoral success.Given that prospect, and the growing resentment in theMerahfe-controlled north of the country that the bulk of theBotswana's impressive GDP growth over the last ten years hasbenefited a tiny proportion of the population that happen to live inand around the southern capital, Gabarone, the possibility of aformal split along regional and ethnic lines remains very much alive.The danger to the BDP as it now is, is compounded by the growth inpopularity of the opposition BNF.  The BNF quadrupled its support inthe 1994 elections to come out holding 13 of the 40 available seatsin the National Assembly.  Of the remaining 27 seats, the majorityare held by the Merahfe.  Should that faction decide to leave whatlooks increasingly more like an uneasy coalition than a unifiedparty, the 1999 elections could prove to be wide open.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996BOTSWANAECONOMYMany of the political problems faced by Masire's government are theresult of problems with the economy.  Despite GDP growth of around 6%a year for the last five years and, at US$2,600, a relatively highannual GDP per head, the figures mask vast inequalities in thedistribution of both wealth and jobs.  Some 75% of the populationlive in impoverished rural areas and are dependent on the subsistenceagriculture and cattle farming that tends to be omitted from economicperformance figures.  Botswana's geography is particularlyunforgiving to farmers in that much of the countryside is made up ofthe sandy lands of the Kalahari desert.The modern sector of Botswana's economy suffers from the fact that itis highly dependent on its minerals sector.  The country is theworld's leading producer of top quality diamonds and also exportscopper-nickel ore, coal and soda ash.  This dependence on miningleaves the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for itscommodities.  Such fluctuations were responsible for the downturn ingrowth experienced during 1992/93.While development of the mining sector has been responsible for thecountry's impressive GDP figures, distribution of that growth inwealth has been restricted by the fact that the mining sector onlyemploys some 4% of the labor force.  In addition, the country's threelargest mines are in private, South African, ownership.In the modern sector of the economy as a whole, unemployment runs ataround 25%.  In an attempt to keep the lid on the situation, thegovernment has become the country's largest employer, taking up some30% of the modern sector workforce.  This has resulted in aninefficient collection of parastatals which, according to a recentreport from the auditor general's office, are losing millions of pulaa year.  The report says that the Botswana Agricultural MarketingBoard has lost some Bp4 million this year alone and is unlikely tocontinue trading without continued government support.Attempts by the government to draw foreign investors into sectorsother than mining in order to diversify the economy and reduce itsvulnerability to commodity price changes have met with littlesuccess.  Manufacturing still accounts for less than 10% of exports.In addition to creating employment in the public sector and trying todraw in foreign investment, the government actively encouragesworkers to find jobs abroad.  Estimates suggest that some 40,000Botswanans follow this path every year.  The vast majority find workin neighboring South Africa, source of some 85% of Botswana'simports.While a modest rise in the price of diamonds on the world marketsthis year has helped Botswana to some extent, the government fearsthat if diversification does not come quickly, a possible saturationof the market by Russian diamond sales may do considerable harm toboth the economic and political stability of the country.  Shouldthat turn out to be the case, the likelihood of foreign investorsmoving in to the country will diminish.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996COTE D'IVOIREBASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . . .

With counting completed for 151 of the 172contested, the PDCI-RDA had secured 133 with both the IFP and RDRclaiming nine each.  The figure of 172 seats is three short of thefull National Assembly complement of 175 seats.  The three remainingseats were not contested during the election because of the highlevels of violence that have taken place in them since the Octoberpresidential poll.  Elections in these constituencies are to be heldat a later date.All three of the postponed constituencies lie in the Gagnoa region,stronghold of the IFP, and as a result of the postponements, IFPleader Laurent Gbagbo was effectively prevented from taking part inthe elections.  According to government sources, the violence inGagnoa has resulted in dozens of deaths and thousands of displacedpersons.  Of the four constituencies within Gagnoa, the only onedeemed by the government to be stable enough for elections to takeplace was, by coincidence, the only one in which the PDCI-RDA wasvictorious in the 1990 parliamentary elections.However, the government's success was not repeated there this timeround and the seat was won by the IFP.  Gbagbo, whose IFP joined theRDR in a boycott of the presidential elections, describedpostponements in the other constituencies as a cynical move toprevent him from being present in the National Assembly when theSpeaker was elected.  In rejecting these claims, Interior MinisterEmile Bombet said that some 18.6% of Gagnoa voters had fled theregion as a result of the violence and, as such, were unable to voteuntil peace returned there.  Be that as it may, weight was added tothe allegations of a government conspiracy against leading oppositionmembers by the earlier decision, by the Constitutional Council, notto allow RDR secretary, Djeny Kobina, to stand as a candidate in theelections.Just days before the elections were due to take place, Kobina wasdenied candidacy by the Interior Ministry on the grounds that hisparents were Ghanaian and that he could not produce a certificate ofIvorian citizenship.  Despite his claims that the government haddeliberately lost his citizenship paperwork in an attempt to throwthe opposition into disarray, the Court upheld the governmentdecision and Kobina was barred from standing.  This was a similarmove to that which was used to prevent Alassane Ouattara fromstanding as RDR presidential candidate against Bedie.  It was thatdecision that led to the violence in Gagnoa and other regions.Possible manipulations aside, the opposition parties were furtherhindered by their inability to decide on joint candidates for theparliamentary poll.  This left many seats with both an IFP and an RDRcandidate in the contest.  To what degree this split the oppositionvote is not clear, but it may well have had a bearing on the finalresults.Within those results, initial analysis would tend to suggest thatboth the opposition parties' support remains localized.  The RDRappears to be essentially entrenched in the north while the IFP isbest established in the center-west region of the Adzope enclave,which includes Gagnoa.  The PDCI-RDA took all seats in the westernand south-western regions and were predominant in the central region.Of the five PDCI ministers that stood for election only one, AlphonseDjedje Mady, was defeated.  Francis Wodie, leader of the IvorianWorkers Party and sole opponent of Bedie in the presidential poll,was defeated by the PDCI candidate in the Cocody electoral districtof Abidjan.Voting was said, by government sources, to have taken place with fewincidents, although independent reports on levels of fraud and/orviolence have, at the time of writing,  yet to be released.  Itcannot be ruled out, however, that in the light of the results,  theopposition stance toward the government will harden and with thatwill come increased , if generally localized, levels of violence.Should that prove to be the case, a security clampdown may wellresult.Meanwhile, the December 17 municipal elections look set to bepostponed as a result of insufficient time in which to processcandidacies.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996GABONBASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .President Omar Bongo (1967)Head of Government . . . . . . . .

MODERATE* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996GABONPOLITICSAfter 28 years as the ruling party, President Omar Bongo's GaboneseDemocratic Party (PDG) look to be increasingly at risk of losingcontrol of government in the forthcoming March legislative elections.Much will now depend on whether Bongo and his party make good ontheir stated commitment to ensure free and fair elections or followthe same path as in 1990 when, in the country's first multi-partyelections, the opposition were denied victory by vote rigging andfraud.  The ensuing hostilities between government and oppositionresulted in several changes to the country's political structure.The Movement of National Recovery (MORENA), led by Mba Abessole and,in 1990, the major threat to Bongo and the PDG, split into severalfactions following differences of opinion over how to deal withBongo's devious behavior.  Abessole carried the bulk of MORENA'ssupport with him to his new National Assemblage of Woodcutters (RNB)party.  The remainder followed two other factions known as MORENA andMORENA-Originel.Aside from the opposition split, the 1990 result also gave rise to aseries of measures aimed at reducing the Bongo's power.  Mostimportant of these was the move toward a new constitution that wouldenshrine the necessary checks and balances to avoid a rerun of the1990 electoral fraud.  Despite apparent agreement between thegovernment and opposition over the so-called Paris Accord, Bongocontinued to dispute opposition claims that the National Assembly wasthe country's de facto government until the new Senate, provided forunder the French-brokered agreement, came into being.Bongo lost his case before the Constitutional Court in mid-1995.  TheCourt's decision, however, prevented the National Assembly fromratifying the Paris Accord without a referendum.  This was duly heldand resulted in a 95% vote for ratification.  A further result of theCourt's ruling was the extension of the current period of office ofthe National Assembly by six months, putting the date of electionsback until March 1996.Going in to these elections, the PDG has 66 seats in the 120 seatNational Assembly.  The opposition Gabonese Progress Party (PGP),headed by Pierre-Louis Agondjo-Okawe, has 19 seats and the RNB, 17.The remainder are taken up by minority opposition parties.Despite the RNB's apparent position of third, it must be rememberedthat the results of the 1990 elections that determined this patternare widely believed to bear little resemblance to the voting thatactually took place.  The fact that the socialist and secular PGPholds the main opposition position is more to do with the PDGtampering less with its voting figures than a genuine lead over theRNB.The PGP draws most of its support from the Myere ethnic group andurban workers.  Since the 1990 elections, the Myere have become lessimportant electorally as high levels of urbanization have left themas minority groupings.  In addition, many of the urban workers uponwhom the PGP has depended for support are from the Nbazi ethnicgroup.  There is some evidence from the 1993 presidential electionsthat this group have undergone a shift in support toward Bongo.Although the figures for the presidential election, in which Abessoledid not take part and Bongo was returned to office, are probably asunreliable as those of the 1990 elections, the fact that Agondjoreceived little support as a presidential candidate tend to supportthe theory that the PGP can no longer rely as heavily on the urbanworker vote.Far more worrying for the PDG than the loss of support for the PGP isthe fact that much of the shift toward urban areas has beenundertaken by the Fang ethnic group which broadly supports Abessoleand the RNB.  The broad conclusion to be drawn from these factorswould tend toward being that, provided the March elections are freefrom the shenanigans of 1990, the RNB should see a considerable risein its support, possibly even enough to force the PDG in to aposition of minority within the National Assembly.  In addition tothe Fang, the RNB also draws support from the Bapunu ethnic group andthe urban middle classes.  Unlike the PGP, whose support is largelyregional and based around Port Gentil, the RNB is nationallyorganized.The PDG's problems are compounded by the possibility of an alliancebetween the RNB and Bongo's son, Ali.  Although he has not openlycriticized his father, Ali Bongo, is known to be in favor of seeingfair elections this time round and would like to see a shedding ofthe old style PDG loyalists in favor of younger technocrats.  Aliheld discussions with Abessole in the aftermath of the 1993presidential elections and it is believed that he is not averse toseeing his father replaced if such an event would further his ownambitions.Further important dimensions to Gabonese politics come in the form ofthe military and the (former colonial) French government.  Both theseactors have given strong support to Bongo in the past.  While theFrench government has been critical of the lack of democracy in thecountry, it was not above sending military support to the Presidentto help in the putting down of widespread demonstrations against theregime in 1990.  France also trains and equips the Presidential Guard(PG) which has been responsible for violent repression of theopposition culminating in the destruction of Abessole' home and theMORENA radio station Liberte in late 1994.Despite former French President Mitterrand announcing a policy oftying development aid to democratization in 1990, no Frenchgovernment has yet implemented such a policy.  Relations betweenGabon and its former colonial power have improved considerably sincethe May 1995 election of French President Jacques Chirac.  So far, itis unclear to what degree the current French government is committedto the Paris Accord brokered by its predecessor.Coincidentally, Elf-Aquitaine, the oil company owned largely by theFrench government continues to enjoy preferential treatment at thehands of the Gabonese government.  In yet another coincidence, Frenchcriticism of Bongo's administration has tended to become more mutedwhen rumors of the loss of Elf-Aquitaine's leases have surfaced.Should the March elections suffer from the same irregularities astheir predecessors, it remains to be seen whether the Frenchgovernment will turn a blind eye, or even exercise its moralresponsibility in aiding the Gabonese security forces in restoringstability on the streets once more.  What is equally unclear,however, is the degree to which the military would be prepared tosubdue the opposition as a matter of course.On balance, the outlook for the PDG and Bongo is not good.  Attemptsby the regime to construct a more broadly-based government whichincludes Fang members have done little to soften opposition desiresto rid the country of PDG rule.  If the results are again tamperedwith, it is next to impossible, even with French help, to see how aperiod of considerable political unrest could be avoided.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996GABONECONOMYUnfortunately for Bongo and the PDG, Gabon's economic position leaveslittle room for maneuver.  The country suffers from an overly heavydependence on the oil sector and high levels of imported labor,expertise and investment.  The falling price of oil since the mid1980's coupled with excessive government spending has left thecountry in a position in which it is heavily reliant on internationallenders such as the IMF.  Adjustment programs sponsored by the IMFhave met with little success in the past as attempts to implementausterity measures have resulted in widespread popular protests.The latest in a series of structural adjustment programs wasnegotiated with the donor organization in 1994 following adevaluation of the CFA franc.  The effect of the devaluation has beento push prices up by some 40% since the beginning of 1994, but thegovernment's hands are tied in trying to offset this by wageincreases because of the terms of the agreements made with the IMF.The problem of inflation as a result of devaluation is brought intosharp focus by the fact that Gabon is dependent on imports for some85% of its food needs.In addition to the devaluation problem, siphoning funds off tofeather the nests of the ruling classes during the boom times of theearly 1980's has resulted in a crumbling infrastructure and growingdifficulties in supplying basic health, education and housingservices to the population.  These problems, in particular thedeteriorating road links needed to maintain the supply and export offood and agricultural produce, have resulted in a large populationshift toward urban areas.  This has, in turn compounded the problemsalready faced in urban centers and has given rise to unemploymentrates of some 12%.  This latter is of acute importance socially in acountry where the average wage earner supports ten people.The one relatively bright spot for the economy is that the timberindustry is gaining ground as a result of Asian countries restrictingexcessive logging and dangerous deforestation.  Wood and woodproducts are second only to crude petroleum in terms of exportearnings.1996 BudgetThe cabinet recently adopted a budget of CFAfr817 billion for 1996.This figure represents a 5% increase on the 1995 budget of CFAfr780billion and conforms to the three year program signed with the IMF.Given that inflation is currently running at an annualized 15% andGDP growth is unlikely to exceed around 1.5%, it is difficult to seehow such a budget target can be met without considerable spendingcuts taking place.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MADAGASCARBASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . .President Albert Zafy (since February 1993)Head of Government . . . . . . .

HIGH* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MADAGASCARPOLITICSSuspicion surrounded two major fires that took place at the Queen'sPalace and Finance Ministry in Antananarivo in mid-November.  Thefire at the Palace left the building razed to the ground, and theloss of what was an historical landmark has been described as anational tragedy.Perhaps more immediately significant, however, are the rumors thatthe Palace fire was set deliberately to divert attention from anotherfire which started in offices within the Finance Ministry.  Thesewere not just any old offices, but the rooms which contained files ontax and customs investigations, as well as highly sensitive cases ofembezzlement involving several well known figures.Four of these are alleged to have been close associates of theoutgoing prime minister, Francisque Ravony, including the financeminister in the first Ravony cabinet.  This was the time at whichRavony was still very much involved in the business of "parallelfinancing".  The subsequent row between Ravony and President AlbertZafy  over an end to the practice led to the former's eventualresignation.  Another alleged subject of the files was the formerPresident, Didier Ratsiraka.The Finance Ministry issued a statement following the fire to theeffect that tax and customs files had not been damaged.  Rumors arerife, however, that the most important of these documents havedisappeared.  Several senior luminaries in Antananarivo are said tobe breathing a collective sigh of relief.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Emmanuel Rakotovahiny, who replaced Ravonyfollowing the latter's defeat in a nationwide referendum onpresidential powers in October, announced his new cabinet on November10.Rakotovahiny kept many of the central figures of Ravony's Cabinet inplace in what he described as a Cabinet aimed at continuity andreconciliation.

Estimates suggest that during the intervening period,some 50,000 Mali citizens have fled the country and sought safety inneighboring Algeria and Mauritania.  Most recent reports suggest thatthese refugees are now returning to Mali in large numbers, some20,000 alone in the first two weeks of November.In response to the improving security situation in the country,President Konare, has signaled that conditions for the implementationof the agreements made as part of the National Pact signed betweenthe government and Tuareg groups in 1992 are now in place.  Thereturn of Mali's refugees was central to the national pact and nowthat this process would appear to be taking place, Konare has beencommenting on the means by which the remainder of the pact might beinstituted.In addition to the return of the refugees, the 1992 agreementsenvisaged a large degree of decentralization of powers and theforming of autonomous Tuareg regions in the north of the country.According to Konare, however, the government has decided that, inorder to facilitate the formation of these regions and achieve thegoal of widespread devolution, provincial boundary changes will needto be made.Konare has also been at pains to point out that such decentralizationwill not be a quick process and has urged that dialogue on the issuebe continued for some time to come.  In addition, Konare sees theoverriding priority at the present time to be the rebuilding of theinfrastructure in the north of the country and the resumption ofbasic services that have been impossible to provide during theconflict.The potential problem within Konare's suggestion of redefinedboundaries is that the original National Pact made no mention ofthem.  Konare's response to this has been to say that freshboundaries are central to the task of decentralization and that thenew regions will be delineated in such a way as to allow the peopleto unite along ethnic, cultural and historical bases.  What Konarealso concedes, however, is that the line-drawing operation will notbe without a mind toward the economic consequences for the country asa whole.So far, the FIAA have made no comment on Konare's proposals, butshould the redefined boundaries be such that the new regions aredenied access to means of economic production that the Tuareg feelare rightly theirs to operate, there is a definite potential for areturn to conflict.  Whether this potential becomes realized or notwill depend, to a large extent, on the attitude to the changes of theLibyan regime of Mu'ammar al-Qhadafi.  It was Qhadafi, reportedly,who was behind the FIAA's decision to cease hostilities and recentvisits to Konare by the Libyan security minister suggest that thereis a high level of cooperation between the Mali government and theideological mentors of the Tuareg rebels.  Provided that thiscooperation continues, there must be a reasonable chance that thepeace in Mali will hold.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MALIECONOMYDespite being offset to some extent by the end of hostilities, thereturn of so many refugees to Mali will undoubtedly put pressure onthe government's coffers.  This will be of particular importance asMali is halfway through an IMF/World Bank sponsored structuraladjustment program (SAP).The SAP has already caused considerable anxiety in the country, whichresulted in anti-government demonstrations throughout 1995.  Thedepth of feeling about the austerity measures that have been put inplace have percolated through to the National Assembly.  This wasunderlined during the adoption of the 1996 budget at the beginning ofDecember.  At the beginning of the year, the budget for 1995 waspassed unopposed but with one abstention.  Eleven months on, the 1996budget still passed, but was subject to seven No votes and elevenabstentions.Overall spending for the financial year to end 1997 was placed at CFAFr380.327 billion.  Revenues are projected at CFA Fr333.853 billion,leaving a budget deficit of CFA Fr46.486 billion.  The deficit, downfrom CFA Fr54.127 billion in 1995, is to be financed from externalassistance and the mobilization of domestic savings.  The governmentpoints out that earnings projections now show a CFA Fr524 millionsurplus in relation to the 1993-1997 financial program.While encouraging, this relatively small figure will almost certainlybe swallowed up by the government's stated intentions of rebuildingthe north of the country.  Spending to offset the effects of the SAPin areas such as health and education has already fallen from CFAFr13 billion in 1994/95 through CFA Fr10 billion in 1995/96 to CFAFr8 billion in 1996/97.  Given the added expenditure required toensure a successful transition to peace, the government's chances ofstaying within its target deficit must be seen as slim.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MOZAMBIQUEBASIC DATAHead of State. . . . .President Joaquim Alberto Chissano (since 1986)Head of Government . . . .Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi (since 1994)Area . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 786,762 sq. kmPopulation  (1995) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16.37 million*GDP (1995) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The gap between Mozambique's two main politicalprotagonists has widened to chasm proportions that make the outlookfor an already fragile peace continuing through 1996 less likely thanat any time since the end of the country's 16 year long civil war.The chances of a return to an all out civil war remain slim becauseof Renamo's lack of external funding or over-border base camps, butthere is a distinct possibility that Dhlakama is moving toward makinggood on his February 1995 threat to split the country by establishingRenamo control in the five central provinces in which the party wonelectoral victory.Mid-October saw Nobre Meque, district Administrator of Maringue inSofala province, abandon his office and the district capital afterreportedly being mistreated by Renamo members.  Meque was originallynominated by Renamo and appointed by the government, but hassubsequently been accused by the former rebel group of collusion withthe ruling Frelimo party.  In addition to Meque, it has been reportedthat several other Maringue district officials have also been forcedto flee.Other reports, some of which have been supported by independentverification, have surfaced of Frelimo officials being beaten andarrested by Renamo members in Gorongosa district (also in Sofalaprovince) and Dombe.  The violence committed against these officialssuggests that at least some Renamo members have chosen to foregocontinued political argument over the government's decision to placeFrelimo officials into previously Renamo-controlled areas in favor ofdirect action to remove them.If so, a deal of significance can be given to Dhlakama's recentadmission that there are indeed arms caches still hidden throughoutthe country and that the process of demobilization of former rebelsremains incomplete.Despite continuing to refute suggestions that Renamo is considering areturn to war, these latest admissions contradict earlier statementsby Dhlakama which denied the presence of hidden arms.  In dealingwith this contradiction, Dhlakama now says that he would like to seethe arms caches that do exist collected and destroyed.  Given that,it would seem reasonable to assume that Dhlakama could institute sucha process, but there appears to be some confusion over who hascontrol of these loose weapons.Dhlakama claims that they are caches that belonged to the formerPopular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique (FPLM), but gives nosuggestion as to who is in control of them now.  The StateInformation and Security Service (SISE), on the other hand, says thatthey are in the control of Renamo units which are unwilling to givethem up.  Just who is telling the truth is unclear.  What does seemclear, however, is that there are arms available and, increasingly,there is the possibility that they may again see active service.As if to raise the temperature still further, rumors of an allegedcoup attempt by former Renamo soldiers now serving in the MozambiqueDefense Armed Forces (FADM) were rife during November.  The rumorswere denied to have any substance by both Prime Minister PascoalMucumbi and FADM General and former Renamo rebel, David Mongero.According to Mongero, the FADM was concerned by the rumors and didnot want the image of former Renamo soldiers now serving with FADM tobe tarnished by suggestions that they would take part in any suchaction.For his part, Dhlakama went much further in his denial of an allegedcoup plot, accusing the government of putting the rumors about inorder to justify the security clampdown he says is taking place inthe country.  Much of the violence that has recently taken place is,according to him, the result of provocation by members of the Frelimocontrolled Mozambique Police Force as opposed to being spontaneousacts of aggression by Renamo supporters.  He does however, concedethat in his visits around the country he is constantly being askedwhy, when Renamo won majorities in the central and northern provincesof Nampula, Zambezia, Sofala, Manica and Tete, the government hasinsisted on putting Frelimo governors into office.There is no suggestion on Dhlakama's part that the frustrationscaused by this situation have led Renamo members to switch frompolitical lobbying to direct action.  The fact that the question isbeing asked, however, does underline the feelings amongst rank andfile Renamo members that they are being denied a voice in thesupposedly democratic system they expected in return for laying downtheir weapons.These feelings have been accentuated by the government's continuedrefusal to allow nationwide local elections.  Despite the governmentclaiming, with some justification, that it has no money to hold suchelections, Renamo members suspect a thoroughly different motivation.As far as Renamo and Dhlakama are concerned, the government is simplyplain scared to hold nationwide elections for fear of being badlydefeated by Renamo.Given the startling success of Renamo in capturing 112 of the 250legislative seats in the October 1994 polls, there would appear to besome justification for this theory.  Renamo further sees the policyof installing Frelimo officials in important provincial positions inthe disputed provinces as a means by which the government isattempting to extend its influence prior to eventual local elections.In this manner, goes the argument, the government hopes to limit thedamage done to Frelimo when the local elections do come.How realistic this assessment is remains to be seen, but thesituation looks set to worsen following the government's decision towithdraw the local election bills from parliament in response to whatit described as a "lack of consensus" within the National Assembly.According to the announcement which accompanied the decision, theAssembly will now establish a working committee which will, incooperation with the government, set new dates for the elections.This does not mean, however, that the elections will necessarily nowtake place simultaneously throughout the country as demanded byRenamo.  The government has made clear its preference for a staggeredapproach to the elections and is unlikely to permit deviation fromthat.  In addition, the likelihood is that they will not now takeplace as scheduled during 1996, leaving an even longer period beforefrustrated Renamo supporters have the opportunity to test theirtheory of a local government landslide.  Dhlakama has asked theinternational community to give Mozambique financial help in order tospeed the electoral process along.The success of such a plea will depend in large part on what happensin the meantime.  If attacks on Frelimo officials continue, Chissanohas warned that there are (unidentified) voices within the governmentthat are calling for a tough line to be taken.  A possible descent toa state of emergency cannot be ruled out.Commonwealth MembershipMeanwhile, a fresh row has broken out between the government andRenamo over Mozambique's admission to the Commonwealth.  Mozambiquewas admitted as a "special case" to the organization in mid-Novemberdespite being neither a former British colony, nor an anglophonecountry.  Commonwealth secretary-general, Emeka Anyaoku, explainedthe decision to accept Mozambique's application for membership whenhe pointed out that the country has had associations with theCommonwealth since 1975 when it joined in sanctions against theminority white government of the then Rhodesia.Reactions to Mozambique's admission were swift.  Renamo led thecondemnation on the grounds that it was not consulted over thedecision to apply.  According to Renamo member of parliament (MP)Jafar Gulamo, given that Mozambique has no anglophone tradition thecountry's admission posed a fundamental question and, as such, shouldhave been subject to wide public discussion and possibly areferendum.Gulamo went on to say that Renamo would, however, give its fullsupport to the formation of a lusophone (Portuguese-speaking)commonwealth because the Portuguese language was one of the fewbinding factors within an otherwise varied country.   He criticizedthe former colonial power, somewhat unfairly, for its lack ofcooperation with Mozambique to date and called on the new Portuguesegovernment to do all in its power to neutralize the effects of thenew membership.Opposition ire aside, Mozambique's membership of the Commonwealthshould bring much needed economic rewards, especially given that manyof its neighbors are former British colonies and, as such, alreadylong standing members.  In addition to advantages in terms of trade,the country should also benefit from technical assistance through theCommonwealth fund for technical cooperation.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MOZAMBIQUEECONOMYWork has now begun on refurbishment of the Cabora Bassa hydroelectricscheme in Mozambique.  The scheme, operated by a joint committee withmembers from Portugal, South Africa and Mozambique, has now securedthe necessary funding from both committee members and the EuropeanCommunity.  No date has yet been set for the completion of the work,but when finished, the scheme is expected to produce some 2,000 MWwhich will be supplied to countries throughout the southern Africanregion.Meanwhile, higher import costs as a result of devaluation of themetical have been blamed by the Mineral Resources Ministry for the18% rise in fuel prices over the last quarter of 1995.  As a resultof the increases, the first since June 1995, diesel will costMM3,500/liter, paraffin MM2,690/liter and gasoline MM5750/liter.News of the changes will come as a disappointment to the country'sindustrial sector which, according to Industry Minister, OldemiroBaloi, is on line to outperform target growth for 1995 by some 1.5%.The original estimate for the sector's growth has been revised from2.5% to 4.0%.Banking SectorPresident Chissano inaugurated the Mozambique International Bank atthe beginning of November.  The bank has an initial capital of US$10million and shareholders include Portugal's Banco Comercial Portugues- Banco Portugues do Atlantico group with 50%, the Mozambicangovernment with 32.5% and the Mozambican Insurance Enterprise with12.5%.

Opposition attempts to have the entire electoralprocess nationwide declared null and void were rejected by the HighCourt and in a result which came as no surprise to anyone, BenjaminMkapa of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) was deemed to have wonthe presidency with 61.8% of the valid votes cast.Prior to the Dar es Salaam polls, nearly all opposition partiesdeclared a boycott in response to the elections throughout theremainder of the country, which are now widely accepted as havingbeen riven by fraud.  This boycott was subsequently declared illegalby the National Electoral Commission on the grounds that theopposition candidates could not boycott elections in 3% of theirconstituencies after having competed in the remaining 97%.Be that as it may, opposition leaders and parties went on to boycottthe new parliament and the inauguration of the new president.  Sostrong were the indications of widespread vote tampering that manyforeign diplomats joined the opposition in failing to attend theinauguration ceremony.While individual diplomats may have succeeded in sending a message ofdiscontent over the proceedings to the CCM, the community ofinternational donors at large has not taken any action against theruling party's apparent willingness to cheat in order to protect its30-year long reign in power.A joint statement issued by Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany,Ireland, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, the USA and UK following theelection results said that the donors believed that the result was inline with the wishes of the people of Tanzania.  Given the sheeramount of substantial evidence suggesting that the result borelittle, if any, resemblance to the actual voting that took place, itis difficult to determine how these countries can be sure of such anassertion.Equally ineffectual was the statement released by the UN, whichprovided the umbrella under which some 450 observers oversaw theelections.  The organization recommended to the authorities that they"correct anomalies" that had been found to be present.It would be unfair in the extreme to suggest that international donorand observer countries have an easy task in these situations.  Theend of the one party state is proving problematic throughoutsub-Saharan Africa.  It is questionable, however, whether it makeslong-term sense for those who promote democracy then to abdicate theresponsibility they have taken on.The message that appears to be being sent to African countries in thethroes of forming democratic systems is that provided they "gothrough the motions" of a democratic election, whether or not it isactually democratic doesn't really matter.  This is a dangerousmessage in a continent where the hope and belief in democracy is soyoung and fragile.The eventual outcome of smiling ruefully as if at some waywardyoungster is more likely to be the death of democracy in Africa thanits promotion.  Too many countries teeter on the brink of a return tocivil war for the international community to blithely disregard theundermining of democracy.  If democracy is perceived to be a sham,what realistic alternative is there for former rebel groups such asMozambique's Renamo, or Angola's Unita, other than a return to arms?So far, Tanzania's international donors, who provide some 70% of thecountry's national budget, have given little indication as to anyfinancial penalties that may ensue from the election irregularities.The only government yet to break the silence has been the Dutch.They have decided to resume balance of payments support suspended asa result of CCM corruption in 1994.  Another resounding victory fordemocracy.The New GovernmentTo some extent, all this is now academic.  Mkapa and the CCM are inoffice for the next five years.  Shortly after his inauguration onNovember 23, the new president announced that, given the CCM'soverwhelming victory in the general elections, he saw no requirementto include members of the opposition in his government.In line with this and his earlier pledge to slim down the Cabinetfrom 29 to 22 ministers by merging some ministries, the new Cabinetwas announced at the end of November.The vice-president is Omar Ali Juma and the Prime Minister, FrederickSumaye.Under the President's office there are two Ministers of State, MateoKaresi and Danile Yona, the latter of which is responsible forplanning.The vice president's office has one Minister of State, Mohammed SeifKhatib and the Prime Minister's office has two, Bakari Mbonde andJuma Mkangaa.

This latestworsening of relations began in early November when, according to theSudanese government, Ugandan troops took part in a military attack onthe southern border areas in collusion with the Sudanese rebelorganization, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).Sudan has made similar claims in the past, which have been matched infrequency by Ugandan accusations of cross-border attacks into itsterritory by the Sudan-based rebel forces of Joseph Kony's LordResistance Army (LRA).  The situation plunged to alarming depths atthe end of 1994 when Sudanese aircraft bombed a village in the northof Uganda.  Qhadafi intervened at that time as well, and theso-called Tripoli Declaration was signed by both governments.  Underthe terms of the declaration, both countries agreed to stop aidingthe other's rebel forces, but the agreement fell apart following afurther massacre inside the Ugandan border by soldiers of the LRA.Although Sudan denied involvement, Museveni unilaterally broke offdiplomatic relations.Since the two countries pulled back from the brink of war, Sudanesegovernment forces' have experienced considerable successes inadvancing into areas formerly controlled by the SPLA and its splintergroup, The South Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM).  These Sudaneseadvances have virtually wiped out the SSIM, but completing themopping up operation against the SPLA is proving more difficult thanSudan's President Omar Beshir would like.  Ending Sudan's civil warin the south was one of Beshir's pledges when he ousted the formerSudanese government in a coup in 1989.  His signal failure to do sohas caused considerable political pressure on him at home and hewould dearly love to see a resolution to the problem.In the SPLA, the Sudanese forces have met an enemy that, despitebeing overwhelming outnumbered and having suffered some stingingdefeats over the past two years, refuses to lie down and die.  Thereason the SPLA has been able to string things out so long, accordingto Sudan, is that Uganda is providing the rebels with arms andtechnical assistance.According to Sudan, the latest attacks inside its territory werecarried out by the Fourth Ugandan Division aided by tank crews fromEritrea, which President Museveni requested during EritreanPresident, Isayas Aferwerki's, recent visit to Uganda.  Eritrea brokeoff diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1994 after accusing the Sudanregime of training Islamic fundamentalists to destabilize thecountry. The evidence of Ugandan and Eritrean involvement in thelatest attacks is said to have come from prisoners captured bySudanese forces. Museveni, however, denies the involvement of Ugandantroops and maintains that Ugandan interest in the Sudan's civil waris limited to observation onlyOminously, President Beshir has said that having overcome this latestattack by the SPLA/Ugandan forces, the Sudanese army is now intent on"repaying the visit of those who visited".

It would nowappear, however, that such elections may be held sooner than wasexpected after the government's August decision to extend the periodof transition by a further two years.That decision caused widespread dismay among opponents of PresidentSese Mobutu who want to see a return to the premiership of EtienneTshisekedi, the prime minister ditched by Mobutu in 1994.  Inresponse to the decision members of the Sacred Union of the RadicalOpposition and Allies (SUR), which has Tshisekedi at its head,carried out a series of ghost-town operations in the country aimed atforcing a government rethink.Such actions appear to have borne fruit.  The Electoral Commissionresponsible for the organization of the elections was presented tothe Transitional Parliament at the end of November.  The Commissionconsists of 44 members, half of whom are drawn from the PoliticalForces of the Enclave (FPC) which supports Mobutu and the remaininghalf from SUR.  According to government sources, the Commission wouldhave been ready for presentation earlier had it not been for the SURsquabbling over who should sit on it.  The SUR is divided into twomain factions, that which supports a return of Tshisekedi and thatwhich supports Frederic Kibassa-Maliba.Now that the Commission is in place, there is a reasonable chancethat the elections, originally scheduled for July 1995, will takeplace within the two year extension period.  This view is supportedby the allocation of funds to do just that in the 1996 draft budget.Mobutu claims to see this as good news.  According to him, he is theonly politician in Zaire who has been pressing for early elections.Those within the SUR that have cast him as a dictator who isdeliberately stalling the path toward democracy are apparentlymisguided.  Nothing could be further from the truth in fact.  Mobutuwelcomes the prospect of international observers for the electionsand believes that it is the opposition, not he, that is afraid of theeventual outcome of the polls.  Just how long this new-foundenthusiasm will last remains to be seen, but Mobutu is doubtlessaware that the divisions within the opposition do, indeed, enhancethe likelihood of him retaining power after the elections.Meanwhile, Zaire's budget estimates for 1996 were submitted to thetransitional parliament in mid-November.  The draft projects abalanced budget of Zz5,700 billion.  To achieve the 70% rise inrevenue in real terms to meet the budget target, Zz1,428 billionwould be raised by an 88% increase in customs and excise duties and afurther Zz1,350.4 billion by way of a 107% hike in local taxes.  Oilrevenue is expected to grow by 53% to Zz698.2 billion and earningsfrom the General Quarries and Mines and Bakwanga Mines Companies isexpected to reach ZZ678.3 billion despite a slowdown in diamondproduction.Expenditure is set to rise by 54% in real terms.

MODERATE* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996BANGLADESHPOLITICSPrime Minister Zia finally succumbed to the pressure of theopposition parties and handed in her government's resignation onNovember 24.  The battle with the opposition parties - Awami League,Jatiya and Jamaat-e-Islami - began in December 1994 when, led by theAwami League, they refused to participate in a by-election, accusingthe government of blatant corruption, of winning the 1991 generalelection by fraud and of perpetrating the same practice in an earlierby-election in which the ruling Bangladesh National Party (BNP) wasvictorious in a known Awami League stronghold.  All 142 oppositionmembers then withdrew from parliament and started a campaign of"rolling" strikes or hartal in order to force the government'sresignation, the installation of a neutral caretaker government, andthe calling of a fresh general election.But Prime Minister Zia has not gone down without fighting.  Despitethe economic disruption, and violence, of the hartals, she has kepther government in office with only her own 138 BNP party memberssitting in parliament.  As a result, although she has finally beenforced to call an early general election, she has still managed toserve out almost all of her term of office which was due to end inMarch of this year anyway.  Moreover, although President Biswasaccepted her government's resignation he has not given way toopposition demands for a caretaker prime minister.  Instead he hasasked Ms. Zia to stay on as caretaker through to the new election.The end game in the struggle between government and opposition beganin late September when the hartal program was stepped up with a callfor a 48-hour strike on October 7 in the cities of Dhaka, Chittagong,Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal and Sylhet, to be followed by a four-daynationwide shutdown from October 16.  There was the usual violence.At least one person was killed and more than 40 injured in thegeneral strike.In an attempt to regain the initiative, Prime Minister Zia carriedout a minor reshuffle of her cabinet on October 18.  She thenannounced by-elections for all 145 vacant opposition seats inparliament to be held on December 15 and invited the oppositionparties to demonstrate their commitment to democracy by contestingfor their own seats.The opposition response was to call for a countrywide blockade ofroad, rail and water transport on November 6 to be followed by a12-hour general strike across the country on six consecutive daysfrom November 11.The transportation blockade brought the country to a virtualstandstill and at least 200 people, police and demonstrators, wereinjured in numerous clashes in which the police fired tear gas andrubber bullets.  The security situation deteriorated further when thegeneral strike began on November 11.  As far as is known there wereno fatalities.  However a number of grenades and home made bombs werethrown and at least 50 people were injured, including the leader ofthe Awami League, Motia Chowdhury and his wife.Presumably recognizing that any attempt to hold by-elections for theopposition seats would almost certainly even more widespreadviolence, with the danger that security could break down completely,Prime Minister Zia handed in her resignation saying she lookedforward to free and fair elections in which the opposition partieswould play a full part.She argued that the whole electoral process had been cleaned up underher administration.  The election laws have been extensively amendedand the electoral Commission strengthened to prevent any governmentor other force from illegally influencing the election process.  Inaddition, she said, her government had made provision to set up acommittee of judges for immediate arbitration if a party, individual,or candidate is accused of violating the election law or rules.  Newelectoral lists has been formulated to check rigging and identitycards are to be used to verify the registration of voters.The prime minister also stressed the difference between theconstitutional governance of the country at the last general electionand this.  In 1990, Bangladesh had an executive presidency underwhich an unelected person could be appointed vice-president.  Undersuch circumstances it was within the realms of possibility for aperson with no popular mandate to become the executive head of state.Now, as a result of the 12th amendment to the constitution approvedby parliament and referendum in 1991, the executive presidency hadbeen replaced by a parliamentary system in which the prime ministerwas head of government and only an elected member of parliament couldoccupy the post of prime minister.The fundamental difference between her and the opposition parties,she claimed, was that she supported the current system of governance,while they wanted to return to the executive presidency system, animpossibility under the current constitution.The response of the opposition parties to all this is not yet known.Neither is the election date.  Both are critical.  The oppositionparties will clearly be cheered by the fact that the prime ministerhas finally caved in, but will still be anxious that she remains headof government and, in their view, still able to exercise a malignrole in the election process.  With that in mind they will be lookingfor the election to be held sooner rather than later.  Prime MinisterZia on the other hand will probably want to delay as long aspossible.At the moment the outcome is impossible to predict, but we would notbe surprised if President Zip's BNP still emerged as the largestparty in the new parliament.ExpulsionsDhaka has responded angrily to Pakistan's November expulsion ofBangla speakers to Bangladesh, rejecting Islamabad's claim that theyare Bangladeshi nationals.  The Pakistani move hits at the heart of along-running sore in Bangladeshi-Pakistani relations - the status ofthe Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh.Under an agreement made in 1974, Pakistan undertook to accept asPakistani nationals all those Bihari Muslims who were still residentin the former East Pakistan and who did not accept the newlyestablished Bangladesh as their country.  Under the agreementPakistan did allow an initial  150,000 Biharis, who had bloodrelations in Pakistan, to immigrate.  However, no Bihari Muslims havebeen allowed into Pakistan since 1974, leaving some 250,000 strandedin Bangladesh.During an official visit to Pakistan in April last year, PrimeMinister Zia reminded her hosts of the 1974 commitment.  In addition,the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), which provides fundsfor the rehabilitation of repatriated Biharis, asked Pakistan to letthe stranded Biharis come back.  This was probably the background tothe arrival of some 700 Bangladeshi immigrants in Pakistan inOctober.However, these people were immediately ejected.  Then, on October 31,Pakistani interior minister, Nasirullah Babar, told the NationalAssembly that the government intended to "throw out" all illegalimmigrants.  As for the OIC's appeal to take back the strandedBiharis, he said "Let the Arabs take the Biharis" as there is plentyof land to settle them in the UAE, Iraq or elsewhere in West Asia.The reasons for Pakistan's reluctance to accept any more BihariMuslims and its ejection of those already resident in the countryprobably have far more to do with the troubles in Karachi and Sindprovince generally than with fears of overpopulation.  A large numberof the Bangla-speaking Pakistanis are sympathetic to the MohajirQaumi Movement (MQM) in urban Sind.  Getting rid of them reduces thesize of the MQM's support base.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996BANGLADESHECONOMYAlthough Prime Minister Zia has done her best to pump up an economicsuccess story, an election could hardly have come at a lesspropitious time in economic terms.  While, the free-market policy shelaunched four years ago did have some striking early successes, ithas run out of steam of late, forcing a reversal of many of theoriginal policy initiatives.Thus, while the prime minister boasted in October last that the GDPper head had risen from US$170 in 1991 to some US$236 in the currentfinancial year, she omitted to mention that his had been underminedby a huge jump in the inflation rate from 1.8% in 1993/94 to over 6%currently.  Moreover, the blanket inflation figure masks even greaterrises in prices of essential commodities, which hit harder on thepoor, and the poor make up the greater part of the population.One major cause of the sharp rise in inflation has been an enormousjump in the money supply as a direct result of the free marketpolicy, or, rather, its inadequate management.When the free market program was instituted, interest rates were cut,the system of Letter of Credit margins for imports was withdrawn, andthe maximum ceiling on project loans was abolished.  The overall aimof these measures was to encourage investment, by making borrowingcheaper, which would in turn create new large employmentopportunities.  The overall effect would be to bring a new dynamisminto the economy.Between June 1991 and April 1994, the bank rate was reduced ninetimes, from 9.75% to 5.5%.  Over the same period the interest rate onsavings accounts, which ranged between 8% and 11.5%, was reduced to4.5%.  The interest rate on fixed deposits, which ranged between 10%and 13.75%, was reduced to 5%.The package was well received by the international community.  Themobilization of domestic resources was increased, the foreignexchange rate stabilized, foreign exchange reserves increased, thedeficit in foreign transactions reduced, and domestic savingsincreased.  Against this background the annual GDP growth averaged4.4% between 1991/92 and 1993/94 while the inflation rate was broughtdown from 9% to under 2%.But now things have started to go wrong.  The government was rightthat lower interest rates would encourage borrowing.  The problem isit had no means of exercising control over how the borrowed money wasto be used.  Over the four years of the economic plan BT145 billionhas been withdrawn from the country's banks and financialinstitutions in the form of loans.  In 1994/95 alone these loansamounted to BT85 billion.However, neither the government nor the central bank has any reliablemeans of measuring where this money has gone.  For example, importshave risen from Bt135 billion in 1991/92 to Bt270 billion in 1994/95,but the central bank has virtually no information on the pattern ofthis growth.  It does not know which sectors of the economy areresponsible for the increase or why. The effects, however, are clear- foreign exchange reserves fell by US$900 million in the first fourmonths of the current financial year.What is known is that the growth in the money supply - up from 10% to18% over the four year period - has outstripped the increase in thevolume of trade and investment.  The obvious conclusion is that themoney taken in loans from the banks has been spent on consumptiongoods rather than invested in the productive sectors of the economy.Now, in order to cut back on the money supply and rein in inflation,almost all the free-market reforms have been reversed.  The currencyhas been devalued twice, the interbank rate raised three times from4.5% to 6.5% with consequent rises in the interest rates on savingsaccounts and fixed deposits in banks, a 25% margin rate for Lettersof Credit has been reimposed, and a maximum loan limit of Bt250million has been imposed on all large industrial projects.The problem for the central bank is that a strategy of using interestrates alone to solve the crisis may not be enough.  Up to 40% of thebank loans already made must be regarded as non-performing or lost.On top of that the upcoming general election will inevitably mean anincrease in spending, further boosting the money supply and inflationrate.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996INDIABASIC DATAHead of State. . . . . . .President Shankar Dayal Sharma (since 1992)Head of Government . . . . . . . .

Advani as its leader for a secondsuccessive term on October 21 last.  Advani was unopposed.The term of the present parliament expires on July 8, which makesJune the last possible month for the election.  At the time ofwriting no election date has been fixed, but it appears that most theopposition parties - the BJP, communist Party of India (CPI),communist Party of India - Marxist (CPI-M), Janata Dal and the SamataParty - favor a date in February, immediately after the fasting monthof Ramadan, with elections for some assemblies to be completed byMarch 10.  However, with its prospects uncertain, Congress (I) wantsto hold out as long as possible.  With that in mind, an electionsometime in the second half of April looks the most likely outcome.Although the parties differ on the date of the election, there is anapparent consensus for a single-day poll in states and for polls forthe federal parliament to be held over a maximum of three days.Jammu and KashmirThe government's elections plans have been thrown into dome disarrayby the decision of the Electoral commission on November 10 not to goahead with elections in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir.President's rule in the state was due to expire on January 17.  Itwas a principal part of the government's overall strategy to haveelections held in the state and a new state government installed wellbefore then.  It was a multi-target strategy.  First, the holding ofthe elections would have demonstrated, both at home and abroad, thatthe central government was sufficiently on top of the securitysituation to conduct the elections.  Second, it would have underminedgrowing international pressure on India by providing a democraticallyelected state government that was not committed to full independenceor absorption by Pakistan.  Third, it would have provided atremendous boost to the government's authority just ahead of thefederal elections.Despite the continuing widespread violence and terrorism in thestate, hopes that an election would be held were raised on October 25when the National Conference party (NC), which formed the stategovernment until President's rule was imposed on January 19, 1990,held its first public meeting for six years.  Over 2,000 peopleturned up for the meeting which was held in the apple township ofSopore, until recently a militant stronghold.Prime Minister Rao immediately initiated talks with the NC leader andformer chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, withthe aim of securing his agreement to the government's election anddevolution plans.  However, the talks broke down on November 2, withFarooq sticking to his demand for a return to pre-1953 status for thestate.  This conferred residuary sovereignty on Jammu and Kashmir inrespect of all matters except defense, foreign affairs andcommunications.  Rao's devolution package, on the other hand,specifies that the status of the state should be worked out after theelection in consultation with the election state parliament.After the talks deadlock, Dr. Farooq said the NC would boycott the"the election farce", With that he put himself in line with virtuallyevery other political party in India, both inside and outside Jammuand Kashmir, except Congress (I).  Despite this near unanimousopposition and a frightening security situation, Prime Minister Raowas determined to press ahead and announced that elections would beheld in the state in mid-December.He appeared not to have reckoned on the three-man ElectoralCommission, however.  After visiting the state, the Commissionunanimously declared that "the sum total of factors in the state ofJammu and Kashmir are not consistent with the conduct of a fair andfree election".  Rao had gambled, and lost.This leaves the government with precious little room for maneuver inthe state.  The daily murder toll is at alarming proportions in theborder areas; Pakistan has succeeded in internationalizing the issuewith India coming under increasing foreign criticism for its handlingof the situation and its alleged abuses of human rights; and, lastbut not least, there is now increasingly hard evidence of directPakistani involvement in the fighting.  This is exactly the mix thatbrought Pakistan and India to war in 1965 and 1971.In the meantime, the government has embarked on the massive task ofbuilding a barbed wire security fence along its entire border withPakistan.  The fence has already been completed in the Punjab and thefencing of the 1,035 kilometer border between Rajasthan state andPakistan  is planned to be completed by March 1996.  Fencing of the190-kilometer Kashmir border will then be undertaken.  According tothe government, the border fence in the Punjab has already beeneffective in deterring infiltrators.Despite the precarious security situation in the state, the federalgovernment claims that the agricultural and allied sectors in Jammuand Kashmir have recorded strong growth over the past six years.According to official figures, foodgrain production rose to 1.95million tonnes during 1994 from 1.45 million tonnes in 1991/92.  Overthe same period, rice production in the state increased from 550,000tonnes in 1991/92 to 807,000 tonnes; and fertilizer production from68,000 tonnes to 73,000 tonnes.   Fruit production also rose duringthe period.  Apple production has risen from 79,200 tonnes to 1,900tonnes, while the area under apple orchards has expanded from 46,000hectares  in 1974/75 to 83,000 hectares in 1993/94.  The per hectareyield of applies, the main fruit grown in the Kashmir Valley, hasrisen from 1.12 tonnes in 1974-75 to 10.04 tonnes in 1993-94.In addition, the state is to have its first-ever industrial growthcenter, to be located in Ompura.  Also, the Small Scale IndustriesInstitute relocated from Srinagar to Jammu due to militancy is to bemoved back to Srinagar.Civil DisorderCivil disorder, frequently descending to the level of politicalterrorism, continue to make parts of India, particularly in thenorth, extremely dangerous places in which to live.  On October 31, amass demonstration by Sikhs in the capital, New Delhi, resulted insome 200 arrests.  The demonstration was called to protest againstthe federal government's apparent inaction in punishing anyone ofsignificance for inciting the riots against Sikhs in 1984, followingthe assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh guard.In particular, the demonstrators demanded the arrest of the Congress(I) member of parliament from Outer Delhi, Sajjan Kumar, and formerfederal minister H.K.L. Bhagat, for their alleged roles in the riots.On November 10, a bomb blast in the capital injured an estimated 19people.On November 13, Thakiyudeen Wahid, managing director of East-WestAirlines, India's first private carrier, was shot dead byunidentified persons in Bombay.   on November 13.  Wahid was shotoutside his office and was dead on arrival at hospital.  He startedthe airline in 1992.As for violence elsewhere in the country:ManipurIn November, suspected activists of the underground People'sLiberation Army (PLA) shot dead a the district manage of thegovernment's Food Corporation of India in the state capital, Imphal.After his death, police found a threatening letter in his office fromthe Revolutionary People's Front, the political wing of the PLA fornot paying Ir500,000 to the group.TripuraInsurgents, believed to belong to the National Liberation Front ofTripura (NLFT) killed six people in separate incidents in the firsttwo days of October.  On October 3, four policemen were killed in anambush.  On October 4, five people, including three members of theruling CPI-M were killed in separate incidents and at the end of themonth there were three more murders in separate incidents.However, in November, the government claimed that "all 157 rebels ofan another, unnamed, "military movement" surrendered to theauthorities in after an appeal from the state government.  Therebels, led by a Captain Murari Mohant Saha, turned in their weaponsand ammunition.GujaratThere were violent demonstrations in Gujarat in early Octoberfollowing a split in the BJP when Shankar Sinh Vaghela, the leader ofa dissident BJP faction allied himself and 48 of his supporters withMadhya Pradesh.  More than 5,000 BJP activists, reportedly led by BJPparliament member A.K. Patel and state Health Minister Nalin Patel,attacked the building where the dissidents were staying, kidnappingone of them.AssamBodo tribal militants, operating under the banners of the BodoSecurity Force (BSF) and the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)killed at least 22 people - security personnel and civilians -  inOctober and November in sporadic attacks.Uttar Pradesh.Governance in the state was thrown into chaos in October, just aheadof municipal elections scheduled for November, when the BJP withdrewits support for the four-and-a-half month old Bahujan Samaj Partygovernment.  The BJP move appeared to have been prompted by themurder of its leader in the state, Babu Ram Gupta, by unknownassailants in Muzaffarnagar on October 8.The withdrawal of the BJP forced the resignation of the state's chiefminister, Ms Mayawati, on October 18.  With no party in the stateable to command a majority, president's rule was imposed on October18.As usual, violence ensued.  On October 24, about 34 people sufferedminor injures when a bomb exploded at a market near Allahabad, and inNovember two people, including a police officer, were killed in anexplosion in Jhansi.However, the municipal elections went ahead as planned, with the BJPemerging as the clear winner.  Also in November, the federalgovernment confirmed that it is willing to grant autonomous regionstatus to Uttarakhand.  There were violent incidents in the Garhwalmountain region in early October during a strike to press demands forUttarakhand to be granted separate statehood.Anti-foreigner SentimentSo far there have been no reported attacks on foreigners, outside ofJammu and Kashmir, but there is a rising tide of resentment against"Westerners" among militant Hindu groups.  In late October, the NewDelhi unit of the militant Hindu Shiv Sena group has threatened"direct action" against the recently opened Kentucky Fried Chickenoutlet in the city if it does not leave the country immediately.  Theorganization alleges that the multinational food chain is hurting thereligious sentiments of the Hindu people by indulging in the sale ofbeef products.This was followed up at the beginning of November by a conference,organized by the Karnataka state farmers' association, which calledfor multinational companies to be "driven out" of India.  Criticizingthe government's "globalizaton" policy, the conference speakersclaimed the multinationals were "exploiters" who would displace thelocal people and aggravate the unemployment problem.  There was alsoa call for a national movement to pursue the fight against them.Against that background, the November decision by the stategovernment in Maharashtra to renegotiate the US$2.8 billion Dabholpower project contract with Enron produced an enormous sigh of relieffrom both the federal government and foreign investor communityalike.State Chief Minister Manohar Joshi and his Shiv Sena-BJP governmentunilaterally canceled the agreement with Enron DevelopmentCorporation (EDC) in August last, after they succeeded the Congress(I) government that negotiated the deal.The decision dented confidence in federal government's ability topursue its energy sector development program, in which foreigninvestment was supposed to play a major role, particularly asneighboring Rajasthan then canceled its talks with Enron over a majorsolar power project.  Enron's response to the Maharashtra decisionwas to seek redress in law by opening arbitration proceedings againstthe state to achieve either a declaration from the government that itwould meet its contractual obligations or pay damages to the projectpartners.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996INDIAECONOMYIndia's GDP grew by an estimated 6.2% in the financial year 1994/95,to an estimated IR2,474.89 billion, against a growth of 5.3% toIR2,453.06 billion in 1993/94.The latest forecast for the Industry Ministry puts industrial sectorgrowth in the 1995/96 year at over 10%.  Industrial growth recoveredto 6% in 1993/94 and rose to 8.2% in 1994/95.  This year's impetus iscoming principally from strong export growth.  Currently theindustrial sector is contributing around 75% to total exports, which,in turn, are growing at an estimated 20%.In its 'World Economic Output' report, released on October 4, the IMFsaid that recovery in India was now well established with increasedsupply responses from structural reforms.  The report said that bytightening monetary policy early this year inflation had been broughtdown to single-digit levels.  It also remarked favorably on thesupply response to structural reforms and capital growth.It forecast that the GDP could rise by 5.5% this year, with exportscontinuing to grow at double-digit rates and private investmentremaining robust.  However, the IMF also advised that stronger actionbe taken to reduce the fiscal deficit further and that structuralreforms be speeded up to reduce the risk of a renewed rise ininflationary pressures.  So far, the fiscal deficit has been reducedfrom 8.8% of GDP in 1992/93 to a projected 5.6% in the current year.PrivatizationThe federal government accepted 167 bids for shares in four toppublic sector undertakings (PSUs) - Container Corporation of India,Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL),and the oil giant ONGC at the beginning of November.  The companiesform the first round of disinvestment of PSU shares in the currentfinancial year.All valid bids which had quoted at prices equal to or above thereserve price for each PSU were considered and the offers wereaccepted in descending order of the price offered.Inward InvestmentUSAThe USA is the largest foreign investor in India.  US investmentproposals increased from US$0.35 billion during the years 1975 to1991 to US$1.7 billion during the two subsequent years and the firstquarter of 1994.The bulk of the investment proposals were approved during 1993 andthe first half of 1994.  During this period, investment proposalsworth US$1.3 billion were approved.  In 1991-93, 804 collaborationswith the USA were approved.  However, the pace of investment appearsto be slowing.  In the first half of the current financial year, USinvestments touched US$1 billion, compared with US$1.2 billion in thesame period of the 1994/95 year.  Bilateral trade this year isexpected to exceed US$8 billion.According to a report by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce lastyear, US companies intending to invest in India in the current yearinclude ICMC Power Consortium Inc. a joint venture comprisingWestinghouse Electric Corp. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp. and Sergeantand Lundi.  The consortium plans to set up a power project and aharbor complex at Cuddalore to facilitate coal imports for the powersector.Areas identified for potential Indo-US collaboration aretelecommunications, power, biotechnology, chemicals and alliedproducts, computer hardware and software, electrical and electronicsequipment, food processing, food products for children, health careproducts, hybrid seeds, information technology, natural food productswith low cholesterol, petrochemicals, power generation,semi-conductors and transport equipment.The USA also has the highest number of technical collaborations inIndia.  From the period July 1991 to July 1993, the USA accounted for352 technical collaborations out of the total of 1719, i.e. 20% ofthe total.Meanwhile the government has said it is actively considering openingup the insurance sector to foreign investors.  A regulatory authorityhas already been set up to oversee the operations of insurancecompanies and the decision on when to open the insurance sector isexpected to be finalized soon.Legislation was passed last year to allow 49% private equity capitalin public sector banks, with the government retaining the controlling51%.  Several public sector banks, including the State Bank of India,have floated shares to raise capital from the public market.JapanLast November Japan announced its intention to participate in aventure capital fund, the South Asia Regional Apex fund (SARA), tohelp nurture local small businesses in India.  Japan's OverseasEconomic Cooperation Fund (OECF) will join forces in the fund withthe International Finance Corporation (IFC), an arm of the WorldBank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  Both OECF and the IFCwill each put N7.5 billion into the fund, while the ADB'scontribution will be N4.5 billion.The SARA fund expects to invest an average N20 million in smallbusiness projects through 10 state-level funds to create 100,000 jobsover a 15-year period.  The money will go mainly to venture companiesplanning stock listing.  The fund will recover its investment byselling stock in the firms when they go public.India and Japan have also agreed to set up a mechanism to resolveoutstanding bilateral trade issues.  It is hoped this will lead to anacceleration in Japanese investment in India.Non-Resident Indian InvestmentsOver the past four years, NRIs have made direct investment of aroundUS$1 billion.  In the first five months of 1995/96, NRIs have placedabout US$232million worth of foreign direct investment in India,three times the amount during the whole of 1992/93.So far, approvals for NRI direct investments total US$4 billion, 30%of total foreign direct investment approvals of US$13.6 billion.Total NRI deposits so far are in the region of US$17.5 billion andhave been coming in at the rate of US$1.7billion a year since1992/93.  To date US$4.4 billion are invested in India under the NRIscheme launched in 1970 and US$6.3 billion under the FCNR (A) schemeof 1975, which will terminate by August 1997.  The new FCNR (B)scheme has attracted US$4.04 billion and the non-residentnon-repatriable (NRNR) scheme has brought in US$2.7 billion.In order to boost NRI investment in the services sector, the ReserveBank of India (RBI - the central bank) has granted general permissionto NRIs to subscribe to company memoranda and articles of associationand to take up shares of Indian companies up to the amount ofIr10,000 with effect from November 1, last year.  The permissionapplies if the proposed venture pertains to any activity exceptagriculture and plantations.  Previously, this general permission wasavailable only for NRI investments in industrial activities.TourismTourism currently ranks third - after the gems, jewelry andready-made garments sectors - in terms of foreign exchange earnings.A total of 1.91million foreign tourists visited India in 1994/95, agrowth of 2.14% over 1993-94.  Foreign exchange earnings from tourismin the whole country grew by 13.16% from Ir65.09 billion in 1993/94to Ir73.6561 billion in 1994/95.As a result, the India Tourism Development Corp. (ITDC) has surpassedall previous achievements with an 80% increase in profits before tax,grossing Ir430.17 million during 1994/95.  ITDC earned Ir280.37million after tax, an increase of 132% on the figure for the previousyear.  The company has declared a dividend of Ir50.67 million for1994/95 - the highest dividend it has ever paid.  Turnover increasedby 25% from 1993/94 to Ir2.36 billion.The Corporation attributes the bulk of the improvement to its hotelsdivision - the Ashok Group - which had an increased turnover ofIr11.45 billion and net profits of Ir220.71 million.The violence in the Kashmir Valley has had an effect, costing thesector an estimated 25% of its revenue.  However, the government ishoping that this will be compensated for by a rise in tourism in theother northern states.  Despite continuing sporadic violence inAssam, Tripura and Mehalaya, the government has withdrawn theRestricted Area designation from them.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996INDIAFINANCEDespite the uplift in exports, India's trade deficit jumped toUS$1.976 billion in the April-August period last year, from a deficitof US$798.53 million in the same period of 1994. Imports in Augustare estimated at US$2.924 billion, compared with US$2.24 billion inAugust 1994.  The import growth during the month was 30.53%.  Theincrease in petroleum, oil and lubricant (POL) imports was 2.54%.Non-oil import growth was 38.99% in the month.Exports in the April-August period are estimated at US$12.302 billioncompared with US$9.613 in April-August 1994 - a growth of 27.97%.The level of exports in August 1995, at US$2.452 billion, is thehighest is the highest monthly figure so far in the current financialyear.  It is also 20% higher than exports of US$2.106 billion inAugust 1994.  Imports during April-August 1995 are estimated atUS$14.278 billion as against US$10.411 billion in the correspondingperiod of 1994.POL imports during April-August 1995 are estimated at US$2.762billion compared with US$2.263 billion during April-August 1994.  POLimports increased by 17% during this period.ReservesThe nation's foreign exchange reserves, excluding gold and specialdrawing rights (SDRs), fell sharply for the second month in a row atthe end of October last by US$3.052 billion to US$17.757 billion.The foreign exchange reserves stood at US$20.809 billion at the endof the 1994/95 financial year.The slow accretion in foreign exchange or the down slide in reservesis mainly accounted for by increased imports under the liberalizedregime, according to the Finance Ministry.Meanwhile, Russia agreed to settle about 900 Indian claims amountingto Ir800 million, during a meeting between the two sides in Moscow atthe end of October.  The claims relate to export contracts,non-exports, including personal savings with Soviet banks, pensions,fees and third country contracts.  They have been pending sinceDecember 1992 when the former Soviet Union collapsed.Exchange RateThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was forced to intervene again onOctober 26 to halt the slide of the rupee against the US dollar.  Thedollar opened at Ir35.50 and gradually went up to a high of Ir35 onthe interbank foreign exchange market.At this stage, the RBI intervened by selling dollar at a rate lowerthan the prevailing market price.  After the intervention, the rupeefirmed up and closed at Ir35.50/US$.Banking sources attributed the fall in the rupee value to short-termeconomic conditions arising out of a rise in imports and government'sdebt payments.  As a result of demand-supply gap, market forces arepushing the dollar upwards.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996PAKISTANBASIC DATAHead of State. . . .

MODERATE* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996PAKISTANPOLITICSPrime Minister Bhutto's policy of encouraging members of the formerinternational Islamic fundamentalist Mujaheddin that fought theRussians in Afghanistan to use Pakistan as a base to wage an intifada(her expression) against India's "occupation" of Kashmir, is possiblecoming back to haunt her.Not only is the violence in Karachi - almost certainly fueled by armsand expertise gathered in the Afghan conflict - continuing unabated,but the government's near "open-door" policy to militantfundamentalists from the Islamic world undoubtedly contributed to theease with which Arab terrorists were able to mount their devastatingattack on the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad on November 19.The embassy was wrecked by two explosions, which killed a total of 18people and injured 60.  Three Egyptian militant groups in Cairoclaimed responsibility for the attack and the evidence so far is thatit was carried out mainly, if not completely by foreign nationals.Talk in Islamabad is of a team of eight, mostly Egyptians, belongingto an extremist Islamic organization, Takfir wal-Hirjah.  However,there has been talk of Sudanese, Jordanians and Afghans beinginvolved as well.The group is believed to have entered Pakistan via Afghanistan andmay have had internal logistical support inside Pakistan from eitherthe immigrant Arab community in Peshawar or from the InternationalIslamic University in Islamabad.  After the bombing Interior MinisterNasirullah Khan Babar said that the University had become a "hideoutof terrorists".  President Leghari, however, dismissed the statementsaying there was no evidence of University people taking part in thebombing.ExpulsionsThe government did come to a belated recognition of the dangers ofgiving house-room to so many potential fanatics just before theembassy bombing, with Babar announcing a crackdown on illegalimmigrants in October.  However, the move was weighted entirely onthose immigrants who might add to the security collapse in Karachiand Sind province generally. Those groups who support or engage inthe struggle against Indian forces in Kashmir remained untouched asdid the religious seminaries, packed with Arab students, thatfulminate against the West and preach a doctrine of Islamunadulterated by 1,500 years of history.It was only after the bombing that the government ordered theexpulsion of all Arabs without legal documents.The 600-700 immigrants expelled by the government in October were allBangladeshis.  Interior Minister Babar said they had been expelledbecause they had fake documents.The more probable reason is that the government believes that themajority of them are at best sympathetic to, and at worst actualsupporters of, the ethnic Indian Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) that iswrecking such havoc in urban Sind.  According to the government thereare some two million illegal immigrants in Karachi.The move is also a slap in the a face to Bangladesh over thecontentious issue of the Bihari Muslims.  In 1974, Pakistan agreed toaccept as Pakistani nationals all those Bihari Muslims in Bangladeshwho did not accept the new country as theirs.Between then and 1992, Pakistan did admit around 150,000 Biharis, whohad blood relations in Pakistan, into the country.  However, it hasnot officially admitted any more since then, leaving some 250,000Biharis stranded in Bangladesh..During her state visit to Pakistan earlier last year, BangladeshiPrime Minister Khaleda Zia Rahman asked her hosts to make good ontheir 1974 commitment.  In this she was backed up by the Organizationof Islamic Conference (OIC), which provides funds for therehabilitation of repatriated Biharis.The Prime Minister and the OIC got there reply in October whenInterior Minister Babar said that if they were so concerned the Arabcountries should take the Biharis as there was plenty of room forthem in the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and elsewhere in West Asia.Military in PoliticsThe role of the military in the governance of the country has come tothe fore again with the announcement that the government had foiledan alleged coup attempt by a group of military officers.The significance of the coup bid, which was reportedly discovered inSeptember and announced in November, was to be carried out by a groupcalling itself Amirul Momineen (leaders of the faithful).  It was ledby Major-General Zahirul Islam Abbasi, a former defense attachi inthe Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi where he was expelled as aspy, and Brigadier Mustansar Billa.  They led a group of officers,including three colonels, and civilians, reportedly numbering around30 in all.  The group is also believed to have links with ex-generalsand right-wing politicians.It has been claimed that the plotters were caught by chance at ameeting on September 28 when they were putting the finishing touchesto their plans to "eliminate all senior commanders of the PakistanArmy, before taking over key government installations.The army and government have attempted to play down the seriousnessof the coup attempt.  However, it is significant, not only in that itwas apparently thwarted purely by chance, but also in that ithighlights a growing dissatisfaction in the military with PrimeMinister Bhutto's government (many senior officers much prefer herpredecessor Nawaz Sharif).  It also indicates a division in thesenior ranks of the military between those who are prepared to put upwith an elected civilian government so long as they and theirs aretaken care of, and those who want the army to return to its neartraditional role as direct political master.The message for Prime Minister Bhutto seems fairly clear.  If shewants to keep the premiership, and possibly her head, she will haveto pander to the military to an even greater extent than she hasalready.  That could mean even greater direct involvement in Kashmir,with all the dangers of an all-out war with India that such anescalation would bring.Political TerrorismWith talks between the government and the MQM still stalled, thesituation in the city remains as murderous as ever with tit-for-tatkillings by MQM-Altaf group activists and the security forces takingplace on a daily basis.The more notable atrocities include the killing of four MQM prisonerswhile in police custody in October; the murder of Syed Ehsan AliShah, a brother of the Sind Chief Minister Syed Abdullah Shah, withtwo other people on November 23; and the killing of 15 members of thesame family in a separate incident on the same day.Fourteen people were sentenced to death  for terrorist acts onNovember 27.Political murder is not, however confined to Karachi, or even to Sindprovince overall. Ali Ahmed Soomro, a former member of the rulingPakistan people's Party who had fallen out of favor was gunned downoutside his home in October (Prime Minister Bhutto's brother-in-law,Nasir Hussain was questioned by police over the incident andreleased).  In November, the provincial minister of Balochistan, AyubBuledi, the provincial election commissioner Faratullaha and theirdriver were all shot dead in Turbat.Political CorruptionThe campaign to "get" former prime minister and opposition PakistanMuslim League (PML) leader Nawaz Sharif continues apace.  Aftergetting out from under a treason charge in September last year,Sharif is now being undermined by the arrest of his brother, ShahbazSharif, and a new pile of fraud allegations against his family.  Inorder to ensure that the public at large recognizes the solidity ofthe case being made, Interior Minister Babar outlined the allegationson television on November 23.According to Babar, the Sharif family fraudulently acquired a totalof Pr6.16 billion from 31 banks and financial institutions throughthe use of political pressure during the period 1983-1993.The government's case is that the money had been pressured out ofPakistani banks and financial institutions by 19 companies owned bythe Sharif family.  A particular case in point is the family ownedIttefaq Foundry (IF).  Records of the New York Branch of the NationalBank of Pakistan apparently show that IF opened letters of creditwith a number of nationalized banks in order to finance the import ofscrap metal worth US$17.84 million.Not only did IF never meet any of its obligations on the letters ofcredit, it also used political pressure to force the banks to adjustthe amount of the letters of credit by securing loans from the banks.The scrap was sold on at a profit and none of the loans have everbeen repaid.It is also claimed that during 1990-1993, IF sold machinery to 11sugar mills for a total of Pr1,334 million.  The banks that financedthe deal were never repaid.  Moreover, political pressure was used toforce the sugar mills to buy machinery from IF and to force the banksto make loans only to those mills that did agree to buy machineryfrom IF.Other scams allegedly indulged in by the family include the illegalpurchase of travelers' checks.  According to Babar, the family hadarranged the purchase of US$1.13 million worth of travelers' checks,which were used as collateral "in a dubious manner" for securingheavy loans.  Shahbaz Sharif is also accused of taking loans frombanks by forging signatures of other partners in his companies, likeMian Khalid Diraj.The problem for Nawaz Sharif in all this is that if his brother goesdown, Nawaz will almost certainly follow suit.AfghanistanThe breakdown in relations with the regime of President BorhanoddinRabbani remains as deep as ever.  On November 22, the Pakistanigovernment stopped issuing permits for the transport of goods andfoodstuffs to Afghanistan until further notice and on November 28 itexpelled two representatives of the Hezb-e Wahdat faction, which isallied to the Rabbani government.  These latest expulsions bring thetotal of those expelled since the sacking of the Pakistani embassy inKabul in September to 19 Afghan diplomats and 11 officials, plusMasud Khalili, the Afghan president's special representative inIslamabad.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996PAKISTANECONOMYThe government has dismissed as baseless the general chorus of alarmwhich greeted its decision to devalue the Pakistani rupee by 7% atthe end of October.  The decision was not, she argued, forced on thegovernment by the domestic economic situation, but by the fact thatboth Bangladesh and India had devalued their currencies.  Given thecompeting nature of these economies, vis-`-vis Pakistan, Pakistan hadno alternative but to follow suit in order to maintain itscompetitive edge in world markets.Whatever the reason for devaluation were in these countries, sheargued, the fact that Pakistan needed to devalue by only 7% was anindicator of its relative economic strength.  Indeed, she claimed,rather than experiencing an economic decline, as some domesticobservers maintained, the economy was actually going from strength tostrength, recording a consistent rise in the GDP over the past twoyears.Any damage to the economy, she said, was being done by the media,whose reports were responsible for more than US$300 million incapital being withdrawn from the banks and stock exchanges prior tothe devaluation.  This capital flight, she said, also reflected theevil intentions of the vested interests who have no concern about thenational interest, but will do anything to serve their own interests.For its part the government said the media had seized on the factthat the 6.9% GDP growth target for 1994/95 had not been met (GDPgrowth in the year was actually 4.7%, compared with 3.8% in 1993/94)and had blown it up out of all proportion.  This failure, itintimated, was a minor, almost technical matter, due to the cottonsector failing to meet its production target, as it has for the pastthree years, to some other crops had been damaged by rains andfloods, and to problems in the textile sector.  Despite all this,industrial output grew by 5% in 1994/95 against 4.5% in 1993/94.A rather more accurate summation of the situation was given byPresident Leghari in an address to parliament on October 29.Although he too dismissed all talk of an economic crisis, he didadmit that economic performance in 1994/95 was "mixed".  On thepositive side inflation remains under control, the GDP is expanding,and fiscal and monetary policy should enable the inflation rate toless than 10% in the 1995/96 year.  In addition, the rapid growth inexports had resulted in a substantial increase in foreign exchangereserves.On the downside, the president admitted that reserves had begun todecline, but that the most pressing problem was the fiscal deficit.This stands somewhat at odds with the government's claim of successin bringing the deficit down from 8% of GDP in November 1994 to 5.5%of GDP in 1994/95.  The deficit is forecast to fall to 5% in 1995/96,with the GDP expanding by 6.5%.According to the government, its borrowing on the domestic market hadbeen reduced to Pr30 billion from Pr60 billion in 1994, and it hasrepaid foreign loans of US$200 million, for the first time.  Withthe privatization of the Kot Addu power plant, the repayment ofanother US$700 million in foreign debt will be repaid.  The totalforeign debt now stands at around US$30 billion.In November, the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet (EEC)announced a number of initiatives to promote growth.  The supportprice of wheat was increased from Pr160 to Pr165 per 40 kg to helpboost to agricultural growth.  In addition, the limit on loanswithout collateral was raised fromPr50,000 to Pr100,000 to help thedevelopment of the small business sector.  Action was also taken toboost the industrial output of some products that suffer fromsmuggling.Inward InvestmentForeign investment rose by US$0.65 billion in the 1994/95 year toUS$1.53 billion. The main investing countries are the USA, Canada,the UK, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.As for the current, 1995/96, year, the flow of foreign investmentmore than doubled in the first three months (July-September 1995)compared with the first quarter of 1994/95, to US$250 million,despite an "erratic" stock market.  Of the total investment, morethan US$220 million was in direct investment as compared with US$106million in the first quarter of last year.According to the Board of Investment, the private foreign investmentflow in 1994/995 amounted to over US$1.5 billion, compared withUS$640 million in 1993/94..Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SRI LANKABASIC DATAHead of State. .President Chandrika Kumaratunga (since November 1994)Head of Government . . . . . . .

MODERATE* = estimateBack to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SRI LANKAPOLITICSThe government launched its second and final offensive - OperationRivieresa (Sunshine) - against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) in the Jaffna peninsula on October 1.  In announcing theattack the deputy defense minister Anuruddha Ratwatte said thegovernment had no intention of slowing or aborting the war, butintend to press on to finish it by the end of the year.  The actualresult has been less decisive than the government had hoped..In terms of conventional military confrontation, the offensive hasbeen highly successful. Outnumbering the LTTE in men and materiel, aswell as in training and tactics, the Sri Lankan Army (SLA), madesteady advance towards the city of Jaffna throughout October, toughits progress did slow significantly as it drew nearer to its targetand LTTE defense became more and more desperate.  Well over 1,000LTTE fighters were killed in the operation and the SLA finallyentered Jaffna proper on the morning of November 20.However, the LTTE has refused to surrender or to negotiate.  Despitethe loss of the city which formed the capital of the LTTE's TamilEelam, the organization's leader, Veluppillai Prabhakaran, hasdispersed part of his forces to the eastern coastal area with the aimof continuing a guerrilla war against the state, while in Jaffnaproper up to 1,000 still continue to engage the SLA.The LTTE's ability to wreak havoc well outside of Jaffna wasdemonstrated, again, even during the SLA's offensive.  On October 20it launched an attack on the strategic Kolonnawa and Urogodawatte oilinstallations.  Fortunately for the government, the terrorists missedtheir main target, the gasoline tanks in zone two of the 95 acresite, and set fire to two kerosene tanks and a diesel tank instead.On November 11, LTTE suicide bombers set off two explosions near theSLA's headquarters in the capital, Colombo, killing at least 20civilians and injuring 30 others.The fact that a crushing military defeat for the LTTE in Jaffna willnot necessarily mean the end of its guerrilla and terror operations,has always been recognized by the government.  Its hope, however, isthat establishing its control in the Jaffna peninsula will enable itto install a democratically elected provincial Tamil  government inthe area.  This coupled with generous development aid, should, it ishoped, undercut popular support for the LTTE.  Without extensivegrassroots support, the LTTE will find it increasingly difficult tomount its guerrilla and terror operations.To the government's credit it has gone out of its way to secure thesupport of the democratic Tamil parties for this program.  In theirturn, these parties, particularly the Eelam People's RevolutionaryLiberation Front (EPRLF) and the Eelam people's Democratic Party(EPDP).  The EPDP, in particular, has suffered a great deal at thehands of the LTTE.  In October, the EPDP claimed that the LTTE hadkilled more than 3,000 Tamil political activists since 1986.  Ofthese, 1,700 were members of the EPDP, while most of the remainderbelonged to the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO).  Thosekilled included the leader of TELO, Sri Sabaratnam, the former leaderof the opposition A. Amirthalingam, and the human rights' lawyer SamThambimuthu.  The LTTE stepped up its offensive against its rivals in1987 after the Indo-Sri Lanka pact was signed.Despite its confident progress on the military front, the governmentvery nearly suffered a major political embarrassment at the beginningof November when the ubiquitous Doctor G.L. Peiris handed in hisresignation.  As deputy prime minister, deputy finance minister,justice minister and constitutional affairs minister. Peiris's losscould well have thrown the government into turmoil.The cause of the upset was a row between Peiris and the Secretary tothe Treasury A.S. Jayewardene over the settlement of a long-pendingcontroversy over a hotel.  Not surprisingly, President Kumaratungarefused to accept Peiris's resignation, and the matter was settledwhen Jayewardene resigned instead.With the LTTE resolved to continue to prosecute a guerrilla war, thegovernment has looked again at the organization's financing.  Thiswas brought into sharp relief in early November when two Catholicpriests - Saverimuttu Jebanason, secretary to the Bishop in Jaffna,and Mariapillai Emmanuel Pius of the Faxel Center of the CatholicChurch in nearby Kilinochchi - were stopped on their way to Jaffnaand found to be smuggling large amounts of cash and possiblebomb-making equipment.The Revered Saverimuttu Jebanason was found to be carrying Sr11.27million, while the Reverend Mariapillai Emmanuel Pius had Sr2.2million.  The money, together with copper wire and batteries, wasfound in the false bottoms of their suitcases.Subsequent police investigation found that the two men had a total ofSr24 million (Jebanason Sr19 million and Pius Sr5 million) in variousbank accounts.  This money, the police allege, was the result of alaundering operation to channel funds from various organizations tothe LTTE. Part of the money found in the bank accounts, Sr1.5million, appears to have originated from a series of bank robberiescarried out by an LTTE member, Kuttimani, in the early 1980s.Kuttimani was killed while in detention during the prison riots inColombo in 1983.  However, it now appears that before his death heentrusted at least Sr1.5 million of the money he stole to the prieststo be invested in a finance company.The authorities also believe that members of the Catholic clergy inare involved in a multi-million rupee foreign exchange racket tochannel funds to the LTTE.  They have now asked for Interpolassistance to pursue the investigation.According to government sources, around US$8 million and Sr10 millionwas collected from various foreign and local individuals andorganizations for the LTTE over the past few years.  They also claimthat another important source of income for the LTTE is drugtrafficking in the USA Europe and Asia.  According to the ForeignMinistry, about 481,000 Sri Lankans went abroad after 1983, themajority of them Tamils and LTTE sympathizers, many of whomcontribute to the LTTE.Of these expatriates, 60,000 are in Italy, 25,000 in Switzerland,30,000 in Denmark, 60,000 in Canada, 20,000 in the USA, 5,000 in theNetherlands, 60,000 in France, 70,000 in the UK, 65,000 in Germanyand 53,000 in India.  In future, fund raisers who maintain bankaccounts in support of the LTTE can be indicted and bank accountsfrozen under the emergency regulations.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SRI LANKAECONOMYThe economy continued to improve during the first seven months of1995, despite rising defense expenditure, largely as a result of a20% increase in exports, compared with the same period of 1994.Exports in the first seven months of last year US$2.072 billion.Amazingly, tourism was also up, with a total of 280,000 touristsvisiting the country by the end of August.  The rise in exports andtourism receipts boosted the foreign exchange reserves to Sr136,868by the end of August.The manufacturing sector grew by 9% in real terms last year andaccounted for 95% of the overall growth in the GDP. Overall, the GDPis estimated to have grown by 5.5% last year.This year, the government is aiming for a GDP growth of over 6%.Total investment in relation to GDP is projected to rise to about 27%from 25.5% last year.  The agricultural sector is expected to grow by3%, while exports are projected to grow by Sr44,592 million, withindustrial exports rising by 18% to Sr183,104 million.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOUNTRY RISK GUIDE: ASIA & THE PACIFIC via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SRI LANKAFINANCEHowever, with defense expenditure expected to have soared to Sr30-33billion by the end of last year against a 1995 budget estimate ofSr24 billion has thrown the government's finances off balance.  Theadditional defense expenditure, coupled with higher than expectedcosts for the government's wheat subsidy and rising debt servicecosts are expected to have pushed last year's budget deficit up toaround 9.3% of GDP, compared with the budget target of 7.5% of GDP.As a result, even if the military operations against the LTTEcontinue to go in the government's failure, Sri Lanka is going tohave to live with high budget deficits right through to the end ofthe century.The 1996 budget, presented to parliament on November 8, projectsrevenues at Sr18 billion.  On the expenditure side, a combination ofcuts and savings of Sr4.6 million produced a gross spending figure ofSr273.4 billion.  Against this there is Sr185.9 billion in revenueand grants, resulting in an overall deficit of Sr87.4 billion.  Thisis to be met by foreign borrowings of Sr32.7 billion and domesticnon-inflationary financing of Sr54.7 billion.   Overall, thegovernment is projecting a budget deficit of l7.8% of GDP this year,to be followed by deficits of 6.6% in 1997 and 5.1% in 1998.The budget package includes a package of tax concessions, reductionsin excise and customs duties, measures to develop the capital marketand investment, and a salary hike to civil servants.  The defenselevy introduced in 1992 and currently standing at 4.5% will continueat that level for through this year, but under a new name, thenational security levy.  It will however be reduced to 2% for importsof capital goods.The tax exemption threshold has been increased from Sr60,000 toSr100,000.  This will cost the government Sr40 million in lostrevenue.  The intermediate tax rates have also been reduced - thefirst Sr35,000 within the tax bracket will be subject to a 10% rate,the next bracket 15%, and the next two brackets to 25% and 35%.The budget introduces a new consolidated welfare program in place ofthe existing welfare programs.  Under this, the most vulnerablefamilies will be given a monthly income transfer of Sr1,000 perfamily, while other poor families are given Sr500 per family.  Thereare also incentives to sustain high production in the agriculturalsector.High priority will continue to be given to public enterprise reformswith a view to encouraging inward investment in the main sectors ofthe economy.  Peiris noted that last year's foreign aid commitment ofUS$843 million was confirmation of foreign confidence of thegovernment's handling of both the economy and the military conflict.On specific allocations, fundamental economic facilities are toreceive Sr14,900 million and ports' expansion Sr5,500 million. Largefinancial allocations have been made for transportation,telecommunications, power and highways.  The estimated expenditure onfundamental facilities is Sr6,920 million; agriculture Sr4,800million and the development of social infrastructure (education,health and youth affairs) Sr7,160 million.*****************************************************************************GOVERNMENT BUDGET FORECASTS*****************************************************************************Budget Item          1995      1996      1997      1998           (% of GDP)          (% of GDP)          (% of GDP)    (%of GDP)*****************************************************************************Total  Revenues      20.5      198.1     19.5      20.6Total Expenditures   (plus net lending)          29.8      26.9      26.1     25.7Current Account      -1.7      -2.8      +0.6      +3.0Budget Deficit   (before grants/assistance)  -9.3      -7.8      -6.6     -5.1*****************************************************************************Back to Headline List WT03-B04-21IA087-000634-B037-134http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it152.html 205.156.212.5 19970122024240 text/html 112641HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:39:36 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:35 GMTContent-length: 112453Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it152.html Sample Issue Copyright THE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNet September 18, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Akashi to receive Yomiuri Intl Cooperation Prize (231 words) Premier mulling offshore heliport in Okinawa Pref.

Premier mulling offshore heliport in Okinawa Pref.     Yomiuri     GINOWAN, Okinawa     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said here Tuesday that the governmentwill consider a U.S. proposal to build an offshore heliport in OkinawaPrefecture to replace Futenma Air Station.     Hashimoto visited the prefecture for the first time as prime minister atthe invitation of Okinawa Gov. Masahide Ota.     Hashimoto first held talks with Ota in Ginowan, home of the U.S. FutenmaMarine Corps Air Station. Following the meeting, Hashimoto delivered a speechto local politicians and business leaders.     "The United States offered a new proposal to conduct a joint feasibilitystudy for building a removable heliport at sea," Hashimoto said in the speech."I think this is an option worth considering."     The United States is proposing an ocean heliport off Urazoe, OkinawaPrefecture.     After returning from Okinawa Tuesday evening, Hashimoto said that he willpropose a Japan-U.S. joint discussion on the new heliport plan during summittalks with U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled for Sept. 24.     It is highly possible that at the summit meeting the two leaders willagree to study the heliport proposal.     Hashimoto told reporters in Tokyo that he had also considered theoffshore heliport plan because negotiations between the two countries overreplacement of Futenma Air Station were experiencing difficulties.     Japan proposed that the heliport in the air station be integrated intoKadena Air Base, but the United States has been hoping to buildt it at CampSchwab in the northern part of Okinawa Prefecture.     Hashimoto said he is also considering a removable floating heliportbecause it causes less harm to the environment than a man-made island.     In his Okinawa speech, Hashimoto expressed regret at the centralgovernment's lack of efforts to ease Okinawans' suffering over the dominantpresence of the U.S. military. The prime minister vowed continued effort toreduce U.S. bases in the prefecture.     Regarding economic development of the prefecture, Hashimoto proposedconstructiing an international convention center combined with a shoppingcenter.     Hashimoto's visit came on the heels of Ota's decision to abide by theprime minister's order to proceed with legal procedures to force Okinawalandowners to renew leases for U.S. bases.     In his speech, Hashimoto congratulated Ota for "making a very difficultdecision as governor."     Hashimoto added that, "Throughout history, Okinawans have undergone aseries of hardships. We, Japanese citizens, need to earnestly admit that wedid not necessarily make our best effort to understand the historic burden andfeelings of people in Okinawan, who played a key role in maintaining peace andbalance between our nation and Asia."     The prime minister said, "We will also try to improve situations in theprefecture by reviewing various issues concerning the Japan-U.S. Status ofForces Agreement."     "The U.S. proposal pertaining to a possible offshore heliport is worthconsidering despite the fact that many obstacles must be solved before such aplan is realized," Hashimoto added.     Regarding the various plans to promote Okinawa's economy, Hashimotoproposed building a health center and facilities designed for long stays. Healso proposed a marine and agricultural research institution to conductvarious studies under the subtropical climate.     Also proposed were an international convention center combined with atourism facility and shopping mall, as well as a special "multimedia"district.     Ocean heliport     The ocean heliport proposed by Hashimoto as a possible option to replacethe Futenma Air Station is generally known as a "mega float." The offshorestructure, which would be built with several huge iron blocks and anchored tothe seabed, would not be a permanent facility.     According to the government, such a facility has major advantages as itcould be easily dismantled, would not cause noise pollution or cause red sandto flow into the ocean, which was triggered in the past by construction ofbase facilities.     Japan has insisted that the Futenma air base be merged with the Kadenaairfield, while the United States has demanded that a new facility be built atCamp Schwab. Both sides rare deeply divided.     Task force to be formed     The government Tuesday formally decided to establish a new task force incharge of discussing basic plans for the development of Okinawa.     The government decided on the creation of the Okinawa Policy Council atTuesday's Cabinet meeting.     Hashimoto promised the establishment of a task force in his meeting withOta on Sept. 10.     The task force will debate various policies concerning the prefecture,including economic development and the base issues.     All Cabinet members except Hashimoto and the director-general of theHokkaido Development Agency will take part in the task force.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     37 legislators attend meeting to launch party     37 legislators attend meeting to launch party     Yomiuri     A committee set up Tuesday to organize the launch of Minshuto (DemocraticParty) attracted 37 legislators who are set to join the new party.     The participants included 16 lawmakers from the Social Democratic Party,eight from New Party Sakigake (Pioneers), five from Citizens Action League,six independents and two House of Councillors members from the SDP. Two of theparticipants also are deputies for two Diet members.     The inaugural meeting of the organizing committee named Yukio Hatoyama tohead a group that will devise strategies for the upcoming lower houseelection.     Hatoyama and Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan were chosen asco-directors of the organizing committee.     The committee will hold a meeting Sunday to celebrate the DemocraticParty's inauguration. The party's election strategy headquarters hopes toproduce by then a list of candidates who will run in the upcoming generalelection with the party's official backing, according to committee officials.     SDP leaders held several meetings Tuesday to discuss procedures forallowing party members to join the Democratic Party.     The SDP earlier said that all party members would be allowed toparticipate in the Democratic Party. But SDP chief Tomiichi Murayama toldparticipants at the meetings that he had changed his mind and opposedHatoyama's reported plan to screen SDP candidates who hope to run on the newparty's ticket in the election, sources said. Hatoyama's idea could mean thatsome SDP members would be admitted into the new party but not receive itsendorsement in the election.     Some SDP members have insisted on fielding candidates with the support oftheir party. That scenario could split the SDP, according to observers.     Tuesday's inaugural meeting of the Democratic Party's organizingcommittee marked a new phase in the party's creation.     Nonetheless, Hatoyama and Kan, both chief promoters of the DemocraticParty, remain split over some issues, such as whether and how to urge Sakigakemembers to join the new party, and its relationship with the administration ofPrime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.     Shoichi Ide, Hiroyuki Sonda and other Sakigake officials Tuesday told Kanand Hatoyama that they would not join the new party.     Hatoyama has said that he does not want Sakigake leaders to participatein the new party, while Kan has insisted that the new party includemid-ranking and experienced politicians, which would open the door to Sakigakeveterans.     Sakigake scrambles     New Party Sakigake (Pioneers) faces the desperate task of shoring up itsrapidly weakening position, as junior members are certain to leave Sakigake tojoin the ranks of the planned Democratic Party.     During a meeting Tuesday, Sakigake officials adopted proposals regardingpromoting administrative reform in an effort to impress voters with theirpolicies during the election campaign.     Sakigake's plan calls for individual politicians and parties to joinhands in establishing after the election an administration dedicated tostreamlining administrative operations.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Uranium unloaded at Rokkashomura port     Uranium unloaded at Rokkashomura port     Yomiuri     AOMORI     A ship from France carrying 620 tons of uranium for processing at auranium enrichment plant began unloading its cargo Tuesday at Mutsu OgawaraPort in Rokkashomura, Aomori Prefecture.     Japan Nuclear Fuel, Ltd., which announced the ship's schedule and theamount of uranium on board as instructed by the Science and Technology Agency,chartered the 5,600-ton Eastern Hero.     After the ship docked at about 7:20 a.m., 18 rods were loaded on atrailer and transported to the nearby enrichment plant.     Although police were on full alert when the rods were unloaded, therewere only about 10 protesters at the enrichment facility, which has been inoperation since 1992.     The protesters were calling for a complete stop to the use of nuclearenergy.     The cargo includes 50 uranium cylinders, and unloading will continueuntil Thursday.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Govt to simplify drug reporting methods     Govt to simplify drug reporting methods     Yomiuri     The Health and Welfare Ministry plans to simplify the system ofmonitoring medical products so that pharmacists and nurses--not justdoctors--can file reports with the ministry.     The ministry will revise the 1967 system because they received no reportson the side effects of the unheated blood products that infected manyhemophiliacs with HIV, the AIDS virus.     In addition, when 16 people died within a month of the introduction ofthe anti-shingles drug Sorivudine in 1993, there were "almost no reports,"ministry officials said.     Under the current system, about 3,000 medical institutions in Japan aredesignated to submit reports, but in fiscal 1995 the ministry received only1,900.     Some medical institutions have not filed any reports, ministry sourcessaid.     Under a similar system in the United States, more than 15,000 reports arechanneled to the U.S. government each year, the sources said.     They said the ministry is consulting specialists on ways to change thesystem.     The present system is laborious because it takes at least two hours tofill in the appropriate form, the sources said, and details of liver, kidneyand blood examinations must be included with each report.     Under the revised system, which will be implemented during fiscal 1997,the medical services will be able to submit reports to the ministry about evenvague side effects, and the forms will be simplified.     "Under the present system, pharmacists and nurses in theory can submitsuch reports, but in practice they are unable to do so because their reportsmust bear the seal of the medical doctors concerned," officials said.     Using the revised forms, they will only be required to fill in theirnames and the reports can be submitted directly to the ministry without goingthrough doctors, they said.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Teacher's abuse of student costs 500,000 yen     Teacher's abuse of student costs 500,000 yen     Yomiuri     The Tokyo District Court awarded 500,000 yen to a 15-year-old girl andher father Tuesday in a lawsuit against the city for abuse the girl sufferedwhen she was struck by her middle school teacher.     Kanako Soejima, now a high school student, was slapped across her facetwice by her social studies teacher in November 1994, when she was attendingChuo Middle School in Kurume, western Tokyo.     The male teacher hit her when she complained of the way he led the class.The teacher reportedly struck her, saying, "Just say that again" and "What isthis face you make?"     Presiding Judge Takashi Sonoo said the teacher's violence was out of lineand sparked by his emotions.     "The plaintiff was not injured and 500,000 yen might be seen as expensivecompensation," Sonoo said. But, he added, the court needed to hand down such aruling as an indication that corporal punishment should be eliminated from theclassroom.     After Soejima was slapped by her teacher, she and her father Hiroaki, alawyer, filed a complaint with the school. The teacher and the middle schoolprincipal then wrote them a written apology.     But the Soejimas said the apology was not earnest and decided to file alawsuit against the teacher, the middle school principal, the metropolitangovernment and the city's board of education.     They demanded 6 million yen in damages and insisted that the writtenapology be displayed on the school bulletin board.     In the ruling, Sonoo said corporal punishment was banned after World WarII under the School Education Law.     But, he said, it was a concern that corporal punishment had not beencompletely eliminated and that there were even people who defended it.     "Corporal punishment says to students that violence is the answer toproblems," Sonoo said, adding that violent acts by teachers could not becalled education.     Sonoo ruled that Soejima suffered grave mental anguish.     The district court's ruling follows an order by the Hachioji SummaryCourt for the teacher to pay 100,000 yen to Soejima. The order was handed downlast December in a criminal complaint filed against the teacher.     The teacher had resigned and began teaching at another school in Marchlast year.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Residents fight quake reconstruction     Residents fight quake reconstruction     Yomiuri     ASHIYA, Hyogo     Six landowners filed a lawsuit against the Construction Ministry onTuesday, demanding it stop an earthquake reconstruction project that requiresthem to give up part of their own properties for public use.     The project calls for more open public space and the widening of tworoads to make the 13.4-hectare area, which was damaged in the Great HanshinEarthquake, safer if there is another major disaster.     However, landowners have to contribute part of their own properties toprovide the extra space. If their properties are too small, they have tocontribute money equivalent to the value of the land they would otherwise berequired to surrender.     Kenzo Otani, 41, a company worker of Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, and fiveother landowners in the area filed a suit with Kobe District Court,complaining that it is unfair to force the project on residents against theirwill.     The plaintiffs say they will not get any benefit from wider roads andlarger public space, while reduction of their properties is a burden.     They also say it is a violation of their property rights and unfair toput such a financial cost on quake victims.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Green Cross exec approved shipments of unsafe blood     Green Cross exec approved shipments of unsafe blood     Yomiuri     OSAKA     A former Green Cross Corp. executive authorized continued shipments ofits products that were suspected of being contaminated with the AIDS-causingvirus on the request of sales division employees even after safe products hadbeen approved by the government, The Yomiuri Shimbun learned Tuesday.     According to sources close to Green Cross, the executive, 75, who headedthe sales division at the time, told his colleagues and associates that he hadallowed employees to distribute HIV-tainted unheated blood products after theHealth and Welfare Ministry approved the sale of heated blood products inDecember 1985.     A member of the company's administrative council at the time, he was alsoresponsible for the collection of unheated blood products that had alreadybeen shipped, following the ministry's approval of safe, heated bloodproducts.     After senior employees in the company's sales division decided tocontinue selling unheated blood products, the executive acknowledged theirdecision on his discretion, but failed to report this to the council, thesources said.     The executive is under investigation by the Osaka District PublicProsecutors Office in relation to a suit that was filed against the company'sformer president, Renzo Matsushita, also 75, for the death of a man who diedof AIDS after receiving doses of Green Cross products in the treatment of hisliver ailment.     The sales division in January 1986 distributed to the company's branchoffices a written notice under the name of Matsushita that instructed theshipments of the unheated blood products should continue "because it will takethree months to secure a sufficient supply of heated products."     Prosecutors are investigating whether Matsushita was aware of thecontinued shipments and are trying to determine who was responsible forfailing to collect and suspend sales of the unheated products.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Ministry eyes crisis management team     Ministry eyes crisis management team     Yomiuri     The Health and Welfare Ministry decided Tuesday to inaugurate a crisismanagement team next month to serve as a liaison between divisions and bureausin cases of medical emergencies, a ministry official said.     Learning valuable lessons from recent cases such as the widespread HIVinfection through tainted blood products and the O-157 epidemic, the ministrysaid it hopes to improve its lax crisis management system and set up onebetter equipped to handle emergency situations.     Ministry officials also said they plan to compile a "security crisismanagement manual" which should outline measures to be taken in states ofemergency.     A team, tentatively called a coordination team for security crisismanagement, will consist of more than 10 officials led by the health andwelfare science division chief and including assistant chiefs of thePharmaceutical Affairs bureau, the Health Services bureau and theEnvironmental Health bureau, officials said.     The team members regularly exchange information to prevent overlookingpossible dangers such as serious drug side effects, large-scale food poisoningand new infective diseases.     In the recent case of massive HIV infections caused by tainted bloodproducts, important information was funneled into a single division in theministry and was not shared with outside divisions. This is believed to be oneof causes that led to further spread of the infection.     The team will be created to overcome such a typical shortcoming of thevertical administrative structure.

According to police, a man broke into the house of Mayor Seizaburo Hiura,77, at about 8 p.m. Monday and threatened him and his wife, Saeko, 73, with akitchen knife, measuring about 30 centimeters in length. He told the couple,"I'm in trouble with too many debts." He then demanded money.     The man held Hiura and his wife captive in their living room on the firstfloor of their home. The intruder stayed in the mayor's house for 13 hoursuntil Tuesday morning.     Hiura was forced to phone Nagaoka city government official to ask him toprepare the money. The mayor turned over 40 million yen to the man whodeparted at about 9 a.m. Neither Hiura nor his wife were injured.     The mayor reported the incident to police at 3 p.m. after the cityassembly meeting on Tuesday. The Niigata prefectural police set up aninvestigation headquarters at its Nagaoka Police Station and mobilized 80police officers to hunt down the criminal.     Hiura and his wife told police the man appeared to be around 60, was 160centimeters tall and was of medium build. They said he was wearing glasses, awhite shirt, dark blue pants, black shoes and dark colored cap.     The man entered the house through the front door, which was unlocked,police said.     Hiura and his wife told police that they could not sleep because the mankept threatening them with his knife throughout the night. They said when theman left, he threatened their lives if they called the police.     Hiura eventually reported the incident to police through another citygovernment employee.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Mystery substance kills aged woman     Mystery substance kills aged woman     Yomiuri     Five residents of a nursing home for elderly people suffering fromdementia apparently ingested an unidentified substance, resulting in one deathand four of the residents hospitalized Monday night, police said.     At about 4:50 p.m., employees of the Daini Waraku Home in Ome, Tokyo,found four female residents and one male resident on the ground, foaming atthe mouth and in pain, near a table in the home's cafeteria.     Because there were several glasses on the table, the employees believedthe residents ingested a substance of some kind. Their stomachs were pumpedout and the five were then taken to a nearby hospital.     One of the women, 84-year-old Chitose Matsuba, died at the hospital at7:25 p.m. The other residents have been treated for throat pain.     Nursing home employees told police that it is the home's policy to keepmedicines out of the reach of residents.     There was reportedly a residue in the glasses that smelled like anantiseptic used by the nursing home to clean toothbrushes.     Police are continuing their investigations into the case and areconducting an autopsy on Matsuba.     Tokyo metropolitan government officials commented that they instructnursing homes for the elderly to keep drugs locked up and out of the reach oftheir residents.     The metropolitan government is currently questioning the home about itshandling of medicine and cleaning materials.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     GOP report alleges 'Travelgate' cover-up     GOP report alleges 'Travelgate' cover-up     Lani Cossette Yomiuri Shimbun Washington Bureau     PC3     WASHINGTON     Congressional Republicans conclude that White House officials engaged inan "elaborate coverup operation" to hide the involvement of President BillClinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in the controversial travel office affair,according to the draft of a House committee report.     Republicans investigating the matter allege that once the travel officestory was out, White House advisers constructed a "colossal damage controleffort" to protect the Clintons from political fallout by "smearing thereputations of innocent people" and withholding relevant documents throughfrivolous claims of executive privilege.     "Travelgate," which has led investigators to the highest levels of theWhite House, is the product of a 31/2-year investigation. The report targetsthe president directly, claiming he knew about the firing of seven careerWhite House employees two days before it happened and should be heldaccountable for obstructing the investigation and abusing the power of thepresidency.     Throughout the investigation, which was prolonged by battles with theWhite House over document requests, committee Republicans unearthed one pieceof evidence that served to motivate a separate investigation into the traveloffice affair, led by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr who is examining Mrs.Clinton's role in the matter.     The previously disclosed "soul cleansing" memo by David Watkins, a keyfigure in the affair, shows that Mrs. Clinton pressured senior White Houseaides to fire the travel office workers, according to the report. The memoreveals a conversation between Watkins and Mrs. Clinton in which she toldWatkins she wanted "those people out" and "our people in." Mrs. Clinton hasdenied having a role in the dismissals.     The report also claims to have records of meetings, phone calls andcontacts that demonstrate Mrs. Clinton's involvement including a letter fromWatkins to her in which he says he regretted revealing his conversation withher to investigators, and assured her that he knew who his "client" was.     Starr is looking into whether White House officials lied under oath orobstructed government investigations into the firings and whether the WhiteHouse politicized the FBI in announcing a criminal investigation of traveloffice employees.     The committee plans to officially release the report along with theDemocratic findings on Wednesday. The House committee's work stands in sharpcontrast to a report released earlier this summer by the Senate WhitewaterCommittee that made perjury recommendations to Starr on three senior WhiteHouse advisers based on evidence and testimony received by the committee.     The White House has dismissed the committee's 375-page report as a wasteof taxpayer dollars and an attempt at "last-ditch, negative campaigning byinnuendo and rumor."     The fiasco erupted in May 1993 when the story broke that seven longtimetravel office employees were fired and replaced by Clinton associates. WhiteHouse officials touted the dismissals as an accomplishment in efficiency; thepress reported it as divvying up political favors to Clinton supporters,"political cronyism," according to the report.     The White House accused the travel office employees of mismanagement andthe head of the office, Billy Dale, was indicted on charges of embezzlement,although he was acquitted on all charges. Dale has come to be something of acause celebre among Republicans and an embarrassment to the Clintons.     It was Dale's FBI file, which was mixed in with other documents andreleased to congressional investigators, that led the committee to discoverthat the White House had collected hundreds of FBI files from former Reaganand Bush administration officials, an issue that is also under investigationby the independent counsel. The White House maintains it was an innocentmistake.     The Senate voted Friday to reimburse the legal expenses Dale incurredfrom the lawsuit. A White House spokesman said earlier this year Clinton wouldsign it, but Clinton denied it last month, angrily responding to a reporterthat he did not believe in giving "special preference to one group of peopleover others" referring to White House employees who have racked up legal billsfrom Whitewater.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Finally, compromise reached over Okinawa--that settles nothing     Finally, compromise reached over Okinawa--that settles nothing     Hideaki Miyama     Yomiuri     The confrontation between the central government and the Okinawaprefectural government has ended, at least for now, following Okinawa Gov.Masahide Ota's decision last week to take legal steps to expropriate land forU.S. military bases.     Symbolic of the end to the yearlong wrangle, Prime Minister RyutaroHashimoto visited Okinawa on Tuesday although he was only there for about twohours.     However, Ota's decision to comply with the central government's requestthat steps be taken for the compulsory use of land by the U.S. military doesnot mean the issue has been settled.     Despite Ota's decision, it is not certain that the Okinawa prefecturalland expropriation committee will complete its examination of the plots beingused by the U.S. forces before the leases on them expire in May next year.     Thus, there is no guarantee that the Japanese government will be able tolegally lease plots of privately owned land at Kadena Air Base and otherfacilities.     If the committee's work is not completed in time, Kadena Air Base--thebiggest U.S. Air Force base in the Far East and considered the foremostfrontline facility under the Japan-U.S. security arrangement--will run therisk of illegally occupying the land.     Many problems remain for the governments of Japan, the United States andOkinawa Prefecture.     Last year marked the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. TheJapanese government planned to invite U.S. President Bill Clinton as a stateguest in November. Stressing that the bilateral security system was a majorfactor contributing to peace for Japan in the postwar years, the governmentwas preparing to reaffirm the alliance and issue a joint security declarationon the occasion of his visit.     However, the security system that was thought to be so strong was rockedby the rape of an Okinawa primary school girl by U.S. military servicemen onSept. 4.     With that incident as a turning point, antibase sentiment spread likewildfire through the prefecture. The incident also exacerbated a deeply rooteddistrust of the Japanese government.     Amid such developments, Ota refused to act as a proxy for antibaselandowners and sign documents for the forced use of their land by the U.S.military.     The central government countered by filing three separate suits againstthe governor. The central government and prefectural government thus squaredoff legally, politically and emotionally.     On the other hand, Clinton, who was to remain in Japan for the statevisit after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Osakain November last year, canceled the trip, citing strained relations betweenthe White House and Congress as the reason.     The Japan-U.S. security system served as an axis of Japan's postwardiplomacy. However, a single incident--and subsequent rebellion by aprefectural government--has revealed its fragility.     Clinton finally visited Japan in April this year. Seizing on the occasionof the Hashimoto-Clinton summit, the governments of the two countries reachedan agreement on the return of Futenma Air Station, a matter that the Okinawaprefectural government had termed the priority issue in consolidating andreducing U.S. bases. The two nations also issued, with much fanfare, a jointsecurity declaration that addressed the reduction of U.S. military bases inJapan and promotion of bilateral cooperation in emergencies.     However, the declaration was merely a scrap of paper representing apolitical agreement between the two countries.     Even after the declaration was issued, the central government and Okinawagovernment remained at loggerheads as they battled it out in court, with theformer continuing to illegally occupy land at the U.S. Navy's Sobecommunications installation.     The confrontation continued after the Supreme Court on Aug. 28 came downon the side of the central government, in effect ordering Ota to take legalsteps for the forced use of land.     Okinawa residents then voted in a prefecturewide referendum concerningthe reduction of U.S. bases and a review of the Japan-U.S. Status of ForcesAgreement.     Because some people apparently viewed the referendum as being too"political," with the questions worded in a way to encourage "yes" votes,turnout was 59.53 percent, which was lower than what the prefecturalgovernment had expected. However, 89.09 percent of those who cast ballotswanted the U.S. military presence reduced.     The central government and prefectural government finally moved toward acompromise following the referendum, which meant the resolution of a number ofOkinawa-related items on the political schedule.     Hashimoto met with Ota on Sept. 10 and explained a government plan forpromoting Okinawa's economy, complete with a concrete figure for financialassistance. Furthermore, it was supported by the Cabinet, so that thegovernment would not retreat from it.     Ota responded by saying on Sept. 13 that he would take the long-soughtsteps, including publicly posting land documents.     The central government withdrew its suits against the governor. It thustook a year for the two sides to work out their differences.     With Ota's reversal, some progress has been made, but Okinawa stillremains the most important strategic area under the Japan-U.S. securityalliance.     The government must now decide where the facilities at Futenma are to betransferred. Until this is done, the agreement on the return of the airstation will remain an empty promise.     On the other hand, the Okinawa prefectural government must now completesteps for the expropriation of plots scattered about Kadena Air Base and otherinstallations before the leases run out next May 14 so that the U.S. militarycan continue using them legally.     Since Futenma Air Station is located close to Naha and is surrounded byresidential areas, the prefectural government wants it to be returned first.     Thus, the Japanese and U.S. governments secretly reached an accord on itsreturn just before the summit in April. Hashimoto and U.S. Ambassador WalterMondale made a "lightning" announcement on it at a joint press conference.     However, it has not been decided where the heliport at the U.S. Marineinstallation will go, although six months have passed since the announcementwas made.     The prefectural government has called for it to be moved out of Okinawa,but the central government has asked the United States to move it to KadenaAir Base.     However, there is a deadlock, as the United States is opposed to theidea.     The agreement on Futenma's return will take on real meaning only if theJapanese government wins a concession from the United States on the site.     Ota decided to have the lease documents posted, but that did not settlethe problem of expropriation.     There is a plot of land right at the center of Kadena Air Base that issubject to expropriation. Including the owner of that land, there are 3,000people who own land at the 11 U.S. military installations in Okinawa.     In compliance with Ota's decision, the prefectural land expropriationcommittee on Tuesday started posting the documents in question for a period oftwo weeks. It will later hold public hearings where the landowners will beable to express their views.     Committee Chairman Kenji Kaneshiro said, "Since there are many landownerswho live outside the prefecture, it will take about three months for thecommittee to deal with just preparatory procedures."     If that is the case, the hearings cannot be held until early next year.And if the committee conducts such sessions at its usual pace, it will not beable to complete its work before the leases expire in May.     In that event, the landowners will probably demand that they be allowedto enter the installations where their land is situated.     It is possible for Kadena Air Base to occupy the land after the leasesexpire, just as the Sobe installation illegally occupies land now. However, inKadena's case, unlike the Sobe facility, there are 3,000 landowners involved.Since the majority of them firmly oppose the bases, it will perhaps bedifficult for the air base to carry out normal operations.     If that ensues, it would mean that Kadena Air Base, a symbol of theJapan-U.S. security alliance, would be using other people's propertyillegally. That would make the bilateral alliance a "castle in the air,"posing the possibility of collapse.     Many problems must be resolved if the joint declaration issued byHashimoto and Clinton in April is to have real meaning.

Sports Authority, the largest sporting goods chain store operator in theUnited States, has opened its first store in Japan in Nishi Ward, Nagoya. InGinza, there has been much consumer interest in a store opened by Gap Inc., anapparel chain store operator based in California. Office Depot, a major U.S.office supply company, plans to open stores in Japan in conjunction with amajor electrical appliance manufacturer. Several other major U.S. companiesreportedly plan to launch operations in Japan.     What has sparked this rush to enter the Japanese market? This is acrucial question, not just for the retail trade, but for the Japanese economyas a whole.     The answer was supplied by Rupert Murdoch, the media tycoon who hasbought a large stake in TV Asahi to begin a multichannel digital satellitebroadcasting service called JSkyB. When asked why he wanted to launchoperations in Japan, he said the country was a large untapped gold mine. Inthe eyes of foreign companies, it seems that Japan has become the land ofopportunity.     For foreign TV companies, this would appear to be the case. Withlong-established broadcasters still dominating the TV market and cabletelevision and multichannel satellite broadcasting yet to take root, Japanoffers lucrative opportunities to prospectors.     Likewise with the Japanese retail sector, where domestic entrepreneurstend to stick to traditional business practices. Foreign corporate executiveswith revolutionary ideas would appear to have immense opportunities to makeinroads in this field.     Another important but little recognized fact is that the income level inJapan in dollar terms has nearly tripled in the past 10 years.     The exchange rate, which was 250 yen to the dollar about a decade ago, isnow 110 yen to the dollar. Thus, while income levels in Japan have not grownspectacularly in yen terms, the appreciation of the yen means they have risen2.5 times in dollar terms. Japan's per capita income, which was about 12,000dollars in 1985, has risen to just under 35,000. dollars     Domestically, the Japanese market appears to be almost unchanged but,viewed from abroad, it has expanded enormously. Not surprisingly, foreigncorporations are keen to tap into this rich vein.     U.S. companies, which were rather hesitant in the past, have begun totake a more active interest in Japan. The recent trade dispute between Japanand the United States over cars and semiconductors stemmed largely fromgrowing U.S. interest in the Japanese market. This is a vast change from 10years ago when exports from Japan to the United States were the only cause ofbilateral trade disputes.     The fact that U.S. companies have resorted to what is basically politicalpressure reveals the extent of their desire to grab a share of the colossalJapanese market. In 1985, when Japanese income levels in dollar terms wereabout one-third of present levels, the Japanese market did not have the appealthat it does today.     The appearance of more foreign companies will stimulate a structuralchange in the Japanese economy. When Toys 'R' Us, a major U.S. toy retailer,first entered the Japanese market, it touched off a chain reaction ofderegulation in retailing. The many regulations and practices that serve asnontariff barriers to foreign business will be subject to internationalcriticism hereafter.     (Motoshige Ito is a professor of economics at Tokyo University.)Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Editorials Business must lead the way to recovery     Editorials Business must lead the way to recovery     Yomiuri     Various reports, including one that revealed real gross domestic productcame to minus 2.9 percent in the April-June quarter, indicate the nation'seconomy is on rather shaky ground.     Adding to the gloom was the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey on theshort-term business outlook, known as tankan, which reported in August thatthe number of major manufacturing firms that believed the economy wasrecovering had dropped by four percentage points.     An increasing number of companies are revising their business performanceforecasts downward for the current fiscal year.     All of this is apparently the result of widespread uncertainty over theprospects of the economy. This uncertainty was created by such factors as theworsening condition of the semiconductor market, weak employment statisticsand fewer public works projects planned for the months ahead. The planned twopercentage point increase in the consumption tax rate also appears to be acontributing factor.     ===     For better or for worse     The government, for its part, keeps telling us that the economy is stillrecovering. The private sector, however, is divided into pessimistic andoptimistic camps. The former says we are on the verge of economic breakdown,while the latter maintains we are only experiencing a lull, a temporary"slackening off."     There is no denying that the economy is currently at a low point in thebusiness cycle. The minus growth rate recorded in the April-June quarter,however, was nothing more than a backlash against the surprisingly high 12.2percent growth rate recorded during the January-March quarter. In this sense,the downturn should have been expected, even though the central bank's Augusttankan report said that an increasing number of major nonmanufacturing firmsbelieved that the economy was improving.     Viewed on a semiannual basis, the nation's economy shrank by 0.2 percentin real terms during the first half of last year. This compared with 3 percentgrowth in the latter half of 1995 and 6.4 percent growth in the first sixmonths of this year.     In the 1996 business year, the nation's economy would grow 2.8 percent ifit achieved 0.5 percent on a year-on-year basis during each quarter of theyear, up from a forecast projected by the government. There would be littlecause to complain about that figure if it were not for the fact that Japan--aneconomic power that generates about 20 percent of the world's economicoutput--is suffering greatly from the impact of massive nonperforming loansand a sharp decline in land prices in the wake of the collapsed bubbleeconomy.     First and foremost, it will be impossible for the nation to againexperience the kind of high economic growth that was recorded year in and yearout during the late '60s and early '70s, when Japan still had a modesteconomy. The growth rates seen during the bubble days are also long gone.     According to statistics on profits, debts, deposits and sales ofcorporations, new businesses specializing in such fields as information andcommunications are experiencing a boom. Also, the nation's shrinking tradesurplus in recent months indicates Japanese companies are learning tointegrate into the international division of labor, particularly in Asia.     Five years of recession are changing Japan's economic structure. Thesechanges should be better explained to the public, which would likelyappreciate the various adjustments that have been made. To put it another way,recession is the mother of new growth.     Many politicians have been running around making "pledges" to voters withthe next House of Representatives election just around the corner. Theirpromises include freezing the plan to increase the consumption tax or keepingit where it is, and formulating a large-scale supplementary budget after theelection.     These reckless moves have destabilized the stock market and discouragedthe business community from going it alone.     A question can be raised over whether the government, bogged down withits own massive accumulated deficits of 240 trillion yen, should shoulder evenmore financial burden considering the current economic circumstances.Politicians should stop trying to win support by making irresponsibleproposals. They should instead present the public with programs and practicalmethods to turn around the nation's troubled economy.     ===     Priorities vs pledges     The government should also declare that it will shift the focus of itseconomic policies. By departing from its emphasis on financial and othermacroeconomic policies, the government should adopt more bread-and-butterpolicies such as nurturing new industries, creating more jobs and encouragingland transactions.     The most important question, however, is whether private businesses willseek to go it alone. The nation will not achieve full-scale economic recoveryfor good if corporations continue to swing back and forth between optimism andpessimism with respect to every single economic indicator that comes out.     The engine of the economy is business, not government. It is about timecompanies look for business opportunities in the nation's economy during thistime of historic structural reform. This should serve to restoreentrepreneurship.     (From Sept. 18 Yomiuri Shimbun)ARF no substitute for U.S.-Japan alliance     What can be done to ensure peace and security for Japan in the post-ColdWar era?     One possibility is building a multilateral security framework in Asiathat would allow for the reduction of the U.S. military presence in Okinawaand other prefectures.     There is little doubt that a regional security system would contribute toworld peace.     Nevertheless, it would be hasty to conclude that Japan should shift itssecurity focus--from the Japan-U.S. security treaty to multilateralarrangements--in the belief that the nation can afford to weaken the bilateralalliance.     Any discussion of a regional security framework must start from the rightperspective.     Considered a harbinger of such a framework is a 19-member forum centeringon the Association of Southeast Asian Nations called the ASEAN Regional Forum(ARF).     The ARF, launched in July 1994, seeks to provide a forum for politicaland security dialogue in the Asia-Pacific region.     The forum is composed of the seven ASEAN nations and 12 others--Japan,the United States, Vietnam, South Korea, Russia, Papua New Guinea, NewZealand, Laos, the European Union, China, Canada and Australia.     Proponents of multilateral security arrangements in Asia apparentlyexpect the ARF to become the Asian version of the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe.     ===     European experience     They say that the ARF should seek to follow the precedent set by Europeannations.     The OSCE succeeded the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europein 1994.     The CSCE was inaugurated in 1975 when the leaders of 35 countries inEastern and Western Europe met in Helsinki to sign a document requiring themto respect national boundaries.     There is no doubt that the OSCE is working to build trust among Europeancountries and cement security in Europe. But it is a far cry from serving as aframework for collective security. That role has been played by the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization.     Even such an established organization as the OSCE appears to have a longway to go before it will be capable of ensuring security in Europe.     In this regard, it is not realistic to expect the ARF to play such arole.     At a conference in May in Canberra concerning security in theAsia-Pacific region, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said no oneexpected the ARF to become a framework for collective defense in the manner ofNATO. He added that no ARF member favored such a development.     In the next five to 10 years, the key factor for security in Asia will bealliances between Asian nations and the United States, which are strengthenedby the U.S. military presence in the region.     The ARF should be used as a forum for dialogue and contacts to complementthat framework.     ===     Bilateral pacts come first     Trust among allies is an important element of any effort to ensure peaceand security. In this sense, Japan must play an active role in promoting theARF.     However, the forum does not replace security pacts signed between theUnited States and Asian countries.     During the Canberra meeting, Downer said the Japan-U.S. relationship wasthe most important of all ties between the United States and Asian nations inensuring stability in the region.     Asia faces many potentially destabilizing elements today, includinguncertainties on the Korean Peninsula. To leave no void in the regionalsecurity setup, it is essential that Japan and the United States keep theiralliance intact.     This is a security foundation that must not be undermined when it comesto reducing the burden shouldered by Okinawans because of the U.S. militarypresence on their islands.

Trip to waterfront raises question: Is imitation stifling creativity?Much to t he surprise of many observers, Rinkai Fuk     Shintaro Kubo     Yomiuri     Much to the surprise of many observers, Rinkai Fukutoshin, the waterfrontsubcenter constructed on reclaimed land in Tokyo Bay, attracted more visitorsthan even nearby Tokyo Disneyland during Golden Week and the summer vacationperiod this year.     Being something of a novelty hunter myself, I visited the waterfront areaimmediately after the new Yurikamome transport system went into operation onNov. 1 last year.     But as Yurikamome left the terminal, I had a strong feeling of dejavu--the landscape outside the window looked extremely familiar. Then it cameto me--it was much like Docklands, the redevelopment area along the Thames inLondon's East End, once the center of British shipbuilding during its heyday.     It was four years ago that I visited Docklands. Having a few spare hoursbefore my flight back to Japan, I decided to take a look around the areaalone. I rode the subway to the City, then changed to the new transport systemto Docklands. My first stop was the visitor center, where I found, to my greatsurprise, a Japanese-language pamphlet on the development area--a clearindication of how many Japanese visitors were attracted to the area.     ===     Imitation of Docklands     In Britain, the Docklands redevelopment project drew a mixed response,but my own impression was favorable. I felt the British had done a good job.     Looking out of the window of Yurikamome, I recalled that experience inLondon and thought to myself that the development of Rinkai Fukutoshin was animitation of Docklands.     Metropolitan government officials might well argue that the Tokyowaterfront project is different because it has many advantages over Docklands.For example, it uses more sophisticated technology such as its vast centralcooling and heating system. However, I am not convinced the differences arethat great.     There is also a resemblance between the Rinkai Fukutoshin project andother waterfront projects overseas. In the United States, a project inBaltimore, Md., or Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, for instance, are verysimilar. When I visited those two places I saw crowds of Japanese visitors.     Other popular spots for Japanese visitors are the huge shopping malls inthe United States, Canada and Britain. One example is the wholesale center inMilton Keynes, about 60 kilometers north of London. In Japan, commercialdistrict redevelopment planners have adopted ideas from such overseasprojects.     ===     Nation of copycats?     No doubt this makes our lives more convenient and comfortable, butthinking about how Japan bases many of its policies on overseas models broughtto mind a remark made by my British assistant when I worked in London as acorrespondent. We had engaged in a heated discussion on the nature of theJapanese people, which ended when the assistant shouted, "At school, we weretaught that the Japanese imitate everything."     As soon as I crossed back over the Bay Bridge, I saw cars packing theroads bumper to bumper and found myself thinking, "This system is crazy. Whydoesn't someone do something about it?"     It can be said that progress comes from imitation and it cannot be deniedthat there is much to be learned from following others, but there are flaws inthe Japanese habit of copying foreign models.     According to Tohoku University President Junichi Nishizawa, the Japanesehave a strong creative capacity. Japanese inventions and discoveries seem toprove this, but when it comes to planning large-scale projects, such aseconomic reform, this creative spark apparently weakens.     In the post-Cold War period, Japan is struggling to reform variousdomestic systems to adapt to the so-called age of competition.     ===     Questions, questions     Is this because of a belief that we lack the imagination to conceive ofeffective plans on our own and have given up trying? Is it because we are nowlooking for a suitable foreign model to imitate? Or is it because people infinance and business are still searching for a way to nurture creative talent?     Something to mull over perhaps, the next time I ride on the Yurikamome toRinkai Fukutoshin.     (Shintaro Kubo is business editor of The Yomiuri Shimbun.)Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Media must sound the cry over national debt crisis     Media must sound the cry over national debt crisis     Kenichi Suematsu     Yomiuri     Since July, newspapers have run a number of timely features on fiscalstructural reform--an issue that must be addressed if the Japanese economy isto be revived.     The themes of such articles have varied: Newspaper A looked at "The Roadto Fiscal Reform," newspaper B had a piece titled "Dynamics of theGovernment's Restructuring Plan and Expenditure Growth," while newspaper C rana feature on "Reconstructing Finances--What a Major Debtor Nation Must Do."     They have also published commentary pieces with various experts outliningtheir views on what must be done to solve current fiscal problems, includingconcrete proposals on public works projects and agricultural administration.     As a result of this media coverage, a growing awareness of the criticalfiscal situation and the need for reform is spreading among the population.     In addition, the government recently issued a white paper on fiscalreform and announced a plan to thoroughly review government spending. Todemonstrate its determination, the next fiscal year has been designated "thefirst year of structural fiscal reform."     However, it remains true that government ministries and agencies continueto pursue their own interests in making budget requests for the next fiscalyear.     The figures are revealing. The current fiscal year shows a governmentdeficit of 21 trillion yen, with expenditure at 75 trillion yen and income atonly 54 trillion yen. The shortfall is covered by issuing government bonds: inother words, debt.     Government spending includes 12 trillion yen in interest payment on bondsissued in the past. Since the already colossal amount of debt will rise evenfurther this year, interest payments will be even higher for the next fiscalyear.     If a company were using more than 20 percent of its annual revenue justto pay interest on loans, it would consider the situation to be a crisis.     Yet ministries and agencies--which correspond to divisions of a company--appear dead set against changing their ways. To protect their vested interestsand justify their work, they continue to submit bigger requests every year.     The Finance Ministry, which is supposed to adjust budget requests, lacksthe resources to adequately scrutinize whether the money will be well spent.Instead it appears to distribute money across the board.     If this were happening in a company, the management would panic, fearingthat the firm could go under. Top executives would implement drastic measures,such as conducting a thorough review of the company's strategy andorganization, scaling down or even stopping unprofitable operations, cuttingcosts to the bone and laying off employees.     The Cabinet corresponds to management when it comes to national finances.As such, Cabinet members must exercise the same disciplined leadership asexecutives in the private sector. They should order ministries and agencies tomake cuts in inefficient areas of activity, pursue outsourcing, find ways tolower running costs and, where appropriate, pursue greater efficiency throughprivatization. The ministries and agencies would then be forced to get theiraccounts in better order.     Regarding measures to balance the budget, it should be noted that inrecent years the emphasis among the major economies, including the UnitedStates and European nations, has been on cutting expenditures rather thanattaining fiscal reconstruction through tax increases. This is because of afear that tax hikes would lead to a decline in international competitivenessand a hollowing out of industry.     For instance, the United States and Britain have introduced systems tocontrol and cap government spending, while many European nations haveimple-mented severe cuts in their social security programs. Welfare spendingis an act of kindness in the short term, but ultimately leaves a negativelegacy for future generations.     Compared to the austerity measures taken by other nations, I cannot helpbut feel that Japan has shown a lack of determination in the way that it hasaddressed fiscal reform.     A general election, expected soon, is likely to further dampen enthusiasmfor reform. There is a growing concern that pressure to increase spending onpublic works projects will increase as the fight for votes heats up.     Therefore I want to take this opportunity to express hope that the mediawill make an extra effort to explain to the people as simply and plainly aspossible how the disparity between revenue and expenditure is a cause forgreat national concern.     I suggest they use the metaphor of a company's balance of accounts toshow who will benefit from social security and who will pay. Then they shouldask the public to judge whether the government's welfare programs should becontinued, expanded or reduced.     Raising public awareness of the crisis is an indispensable first steptoward eliminating vested interests in government and can provide the impetusfor the bold policy changes that are needed.     It must also be made clear that if we are spendthrifts today, then wewill have to pay the consequences tomorrow.     For example, public works projects in construction and agriculture oftendo not increase productivity or international competitiveness. In fact, it iswidely recognized that such projects have sometimes led to increases inutility rates and the price of farm products.     If information concerning the cost-effectiveness of public works weredisclosed, taxpayers would be able to judge whether such projects areworthwhile. The same can be said of state funding for moribundgovernment-affiliated corporations.     If the public were told in clear and simple terms how their taxes arebeing spent, I believe there would be a national chorus for reform, which inturn would create enough momentum to overcome administrative inertia.     Of course, such a disclosure would mean that the public would have tomake tough choices about spending priorities, which they have been shieldedfrom in the past. But, for the first time, this would mean that politicalparties would no longer have to try to win votes by making policy pledges thatthe nation later comes to regret. In this sense, a more open economic policywould be a step toward politics that truly reflects the will of the people.

During the next two monthsuntil polling day on Nov. 5, every movement of Democratic candidate PresidentBill Clinton and Republican candidate Bob Dole will be watched and analyzed.     But it is still unclear what the main issues are. There has yet to be a"great debate," as Clinton put it, between the two candidates.     The only sign of action was U.S. missile strikes against Iraq, whichsuddenly occurred in the midst of campaigning. This move workedover-whelmingly in favor of the president.     A public opinion poll showed that 79 percent of the public supported thestrikes. Dole, who made a critical remark immediately after the attacks, waseventually forced to express support for them. This, however, fell far shortof a heated debate on political issues.     Meanwhile, the Democratic and Republican national conventions in Augustwere political shows aimed at television and followed well-planned scripts.     The main performers were movie star Christopher Reeve, who has beenparalyzed from the neck down since falling off a horse, and a downed U.S.pilot who survived in Bosnia by eating weeds.     Between speeches, singers went on stage and sang one song after another.Shops selling caps and T-shirts with the candidates' names were crowded withdelegates from across the country.     At the Democratic convention, Clinton proposed a 1,500 dollars tax creditfor college tuition, a system to encourage young people to purchase homes,introduction of uniforms in public schools and a curfew for children.     These mini-initiatives--which one might expect from candidates formunicipal assemblies or local education boards--were in response to everydayconcerns and complaints from the public. However, they hardly seemedappropriate in a campaign by a U.S. president who hopes to lead the worldcommunity in the 21st century.     Meanwhile, Dole proposed a 15 percent across-the-board income tax cut,claiming it would boost economic growth and benefit both the government andthe public.     His overly optimistic policy, however, gave the impression that he hadswitched from a long-held emphasis on balanced national finances to a generousoffer of money to voters.     So far, apart from the tax-cut proposal, there is no major differencebetween the policies of the two candidates.     Now that election consultants manage campaigns on the basis of opinionpolls, presidential candidates form policies to reflect the majority view.     With the end of the Cold War, the United States has lost its arch rival,the Soviet Union. This may be another factor behind the lack of dynamism inthe U.S. presidential race.     The two candidates are proposing policies in areas in which the public iskeenly interested, such as education, employment and crime, while foreignpolicy hardly appears--except for the missile strikes against Iraq.     Domestically, the massive cumulative budget deficit of 5 trillion dollarsmakes it difficult for the candidates to put forward policies requiring largebudget spending-- another reason why Clinton is proposing low-costmini-initiatives.     However, the candidates are stressing moral standards. A typical exampleis repeated calls for the restoration of "family values"--a term voiced manytimes at both parties' conventions as though it were the conferences' mainslogan.     In the United States, the number of families headed by single mothers issoaring, in particular among the poor and blacks, and such families accountfor nearly one-fourth of all households in the country.     Single mothers with small children are unable to work and depend onwelfare benefits for years. The number of recipients is now 14 million,equivalent to the population of a medium-sized nation. This expansion hasresulted in problems for the country's welfare programs.     As Uncle Sam moves toward a smaller government, it will become moredifficult to maintain existing welfare programs, and how to sustainsingle-parent families will become an even more serious problem.     Despite this gloomy outlook, Clinton has proposed tiny steps to restore"family values," calling on business to hire more people on welfare and onparents to read more books to their children.     The question is whether this preaching, done on behalf of clergymen, willbe effective in reforming U.S. society.     There is a danger that it may merely sound comforting to the voters'ears. All that can be done is to wait and see.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Helping Palestinians--perfect diplomatic role for Japan     Helping Palestinians--perfect diplomatic role for Japan     Tsuneo Sugishita     Yomiuri     The government's promise of a 3 million dollars emergency aid package toPalestinian President Yasser Arafat, who was in Japan last week, is widelyseen as an attempt to kick-start the stalled Middle East peace process.     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto met with Arafat and said Japan wouldextend aid through the United Nations Development Program to help create jobsfor Palestinians.     Japan has played an active role in promoting the peace process,announcing aid measures as early as 1993, two years before Israel and thePalestinian side signed the accord on Palestinian self-rule.     In September 1993, then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told the U.N.General Assembly that Japan planned to offer up to 2 million dollars over atwo-year period to the Palestinians.     Since then, it has earmarked official development assistance to help fundthe Palestinian economic committee on development and reconstruction, and forprojects such as the construction of houses for Palestinian police officersand the purchase of computers for police.     Former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama visited the Palestinian area inGaza in September last year, just before the self-rule accord was signed. Heannounced a plan to begin direct aid, in addition to the indirect assistanceJapan had already been giving through international organizations.     Japan's direct aid for fiscal 1996-97 comes to 41.65 million dollars,including medical equipment, teaching materials for higher education and aplan to construct a hospital in Jericho.     Thus far, including money given through international organizations,Japan has extended more than 200 million dollars in aid to the Palestinians,making it the largest donor nation.     The emergency aid that Hashimoto announced is to be used for job creationprojects in Khan Yunis, a city suffering acute unemployment as a result of theeconomic blockade imposed by Israel after a terrorist incident in March.     Hashimoto also pledged to send a study mission to the Palestinianself-rule area that will provide farm machinery, chemicals and fertilizer toincrease food production.     Japan's active role in the Middle East stems from self-interest, notablythe hope that peace in the region will lead to a stable and long-term energysupply.     It is also a good opportunity for Japan to make the internationalcontribution that is expected of it as a major economic power.     The central principle of Japan's Middle East policy is that peace willonly take root if the area's residents can lead stable lives. This requireseconomic development, hence the continuing growth of Japanese economiccooperation through ODA.     On the Palestinian side, there are great expectations of Japan. Arafathas repeatedly pointed out the importance of Japan's role in promoting peacein the Middle East.     Japan has several advantages in its involvement in the region. There isno major historical distrust between Japan and the Middle East and so Japaneseaid is accepted more readily.     Furthermore, while other advanced nations such as the United States andthose in Europe are suffering from donor fatigue, Japan shows no signs ofthat. There is fairly widespread support in Japan for extending assistance tothe Middle East.     Of course, there are obstacles. The biggest problem is that the peaceprocess has stalled since the election of a hard-line Israeli government underPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.     The effectiveness of Japanese assistance in a region facing suchdestabilizing factors is unclear.     The construction of bridges and roads linking the Palestinian self-rulearea to Jordan and other countries would be an important step forward.However, there is no precedent for a Japanese ODA project involving two ormore nations simultaneously. Japan is faced with the technical problem of howto work out such new forms of ODA.     However, the momentum started by Japan's assistance to the Palestinianscannot be slowed. For many years the Middle East was a central stage forEuropean diplomatic activity--now it offers opportunities for Japan to enhanceits international profile.     It is to be hoped that Japan's policy on the Palestinians will be drivenby independent initiatives and not merely follow the priorities of U.S.diplomacy.@:Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Taiheiyo Bank successor starts up     Taiheiyo Bank successor starts up     Yomiuri     Wakashio Bank, successor to the failed Taiheiyo Bank, launched operationson Tuesday as a regional bank based in Tokyo.     Wakashio Bank was set up with investment from four major commercialbanks. It has assets of 671 billion yen and deposits of 450 billion yen.     Sakura Bank supplied the entire capital of 40 billion yen, while FujiBank, Tokai Bank and Sanwa Bank extended subordinated loans totaling about 93billion yen.     The new bank has 42 branch offices in Tokyo, Kawasaki (KanagawaPrefecture), Yokohama, Ichikawa (Chiba Prefecture) and Urawa (SaitamaPrefecture) and 945 employees.     Before starting business, a ceremony was held at the bank's head officein Jimbocho, Chiyoda Ward, attended by top executives including PresidentHiroyasu Ichikawa.     Ichikawa addressed the staff saying he wanted to see the bank growsoundly, fully aware of its public mission as a regional bank.

This is a new record for the National Tax Administration Agency since thetax began in 1987.     The transfer-pricing tax is a penalty surtax imposed when a companymanipulates the value of transactions with overseas subsidiaries to concealtaxable income.     There are similar systems in Western countries including the UnitedStates.     During the past nine years, the agency has imposed a transfer-pricing taxin 130 cases, involving what is believed to be 194.8 billion yen movedoverseas to evade taxes.     The figures, which show a third of cases and a quarter of the valueoccurred in the most recent of the nine years, indicate the advances theagency has made in detecting transfer pricing.     A company found guilty of moving income can request a consultationbetween the tax agency and its foreign counterparts to avoid double taxation.     If the consultation is successful, the company can obtain a refund ofpart of the tax paid, in one or both of the countries.     Out of the 130 cases, more than 10 have been settled with foreignconsultation, while consultations are being held in 31 other cases.     There are also cases where foreign taxation authorities have imposed atransfer-pricing tax on the foreign subsidiaries of Japanese companies.     Because it usually takes a long time to settle cases and companies haveto bear a heavy financial burden until settlement, "a prior confirmationsystem" was set up in 1987 to enable companies to confirm with the tax agencythe proper value of goods bought and sold between the parent company and itsoverseas subsidiaries.     The agency received 42 inquiries under this system during the year toJune 1996.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Premium diesel fuels competition     Premium diesel fuels competition     Yomiuri     Competition among oil companies for diesel fuel sales has intensified assports-utility vehicless have gained popularity and as sales in general havedropped following import liberalization in April.     The industry is suffering reduced sales and dramatically lower gasolineprices since the liberalization.     Nippon Oil and Mitsubishi Oil, two major wholesalers, are trying toexpand distribution channels with the aim of boosting their lines of "premium"diesel fuel, which contains additives to improve fuel efficiency, according tosources.     Kygnus Sekiyu K.K. also plans to market premium diesel fuel as early asthis week.     There are high expectations in the industry for premium diesel fuelbecause most RVs have diesel engines. Industry sources also expect higherprices for the premium fuel to bring higher returns.     Premium diesel fuel burns more efficiently than regular diesel, givingmore kilometers per liter. It also is more efficient in staring a dieselengine on cold days and reduces exhaust pollutants.     Regular gasoline prices began falling two years ago in anticipation ofliberalization. In August 1994, regular gasoline averaged 120 yen a liter, inAugust 1995, 113, yen and this August, 105. yen     The first premium diesel, Nisseki proG, was introduced in 1993. Itsretail price is now about 8 yen a liter higher than regular diesel fuel, whichaverages 81 yen per liter.     Nisseki plans to expand gas stations dealing in the product from 300 to1,000 by the year 2000.     Mitsubishi started marketing its "RV Diesel" in August 1995. Companysources said it was selling 14 million liters a month, far exceeding theinitial projection of three million liters. It is priced 3 yen to 5 yen aboveregular diesel.     The company plans to have 1,000 of its gas stations marketing the productby the end of October, doubling the current 500.     Kygnus will test-market its version of the product in six gas stations inKanto and Nagoya regions from this month until next March.     After analyzing customer feedback, it expects to start full-fledgeddistribution next April, according to company sources.     Premium diesel fuel is said to be cost efficient because it is made bysimply adding chemicals to regular diesel and can be priced higher. Some viewit as the savior of a hard-hit industry.     On the downside, however, the product requires new investment such asseparate storage facilities and separate vehicles for transportation.     Because of this, the other oil wholesalers remain cautious aboutintroducing the product and are waiting to see how the other three fare.     But one of the other major wholesalers "might follow suit if the threecompanies perform well," according to a company source.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     economic perspective     economic perspective     Onoue     Yomiuri     Annual quotas for five types of fish and one type of crab will be appliedin Japanese waters, starting Jan. 1 next year, according to an official at theFisheries Ministry. The planned quota system, aimed at long-term preservationof marine resources, is based on the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea,which the Diet ratified last July.     For the time being, current hauls will be used to set quotas, theofficial said. However, the new measure is expected to have far-reachingconsequences for fishermen and consumers, since the agency is set gradually tointroduce quotas for other types of fish and also to revise quotas each year,based upon the extent to which fishing resources are being depleted.     The six species subject to quotas from the beginning of next year aremackerel, Alaska pollock, saury, horse mackerel, pilchard and snow crab. Atfirst, the agency had considered imposing quotas on 10 types of marinecreatures but four were dropped because, according to one agency official, thesix had a higher priority for preservation, and their fishing was consideredeasier to manage and verify,     Nevertheless, catches of the six totaled 2.57 million tons in 1994, abouthalf of the entire fishing haul around the Japanese archipelago.     The U.N. convention states that a country can impose an economic zonewithin 200 nautical miles of its coast, within which it can exercise theexclusive right to fish and develop marines resources. However, if a nationestablishes such a zone, international law obliges it to impose fishing quotasto preserve and manage marine resources. Japan's move to introduce quotas isin line with these requirements.     The agency explained the criteria it had used for selecting which fishwould be subject to quotas: first, those subject to intensive fishing andbearing high economic value; second, those whose stocks are heavily depletedand in urgent need of preservation and fishing management; and third, thosecaught in waters around Japan, not only by domestic fishing boats, but also byforeign vessels.     The agency plans to determine the exact quota for each of the six fishbefore the end of October, after which it will inform each prefecture of itsallotment. To minimize the impact on fishermen's quotas in the first year willbe almost the same as current catches, according to the agency official.     However, the depletion of these species is already a serious matter. Inrecent years the catch of Alaska pollock has dropped to one-tenth of its peakof 3 million tons, while hauls of snow crabs have fallen to one-fourth oftheir peak of 24,000 tons.     The sharp drop in catches is attributed to overfishing, which hasdepleted marine resources in Japanese waters.     The agency is concerned with the situation and from the second year ifplans gradually to lower quotas for those fish whose stocks are the worsedepleted .     The agency is also well aware that introducing strict quotas will hit theincome of fishermen and may leave some facing financial difficulties. Thus itis considering requesting extra spending in the fiscal 1998 budget to providesupport, such as low-interest loans and subsidies.     If fish hauls drop as a result of the new quotas, prices may raise, whichwould hit consumers. The agency, however, maintained that the new measure isin the long-term interest of consumers. "It is clear that continuedoverfishing will lead to further falls in the volume of catches. Managedfishing will help to maintain and nurture marine resources and create a stablesupply of fish to consumers," an agency official said.     To impose quotas, the agency will eventually have to order fishermen toreport their hauls on a regular basis and punish those whose catches are inexcess of limits. However, the planned quotas will not be binding until thenation's bilateral fishing agreements with South Korea and China are revised,said the agency official.     Japan introduced a 200-mile fishing zone in 1977, but South Korea andChina are exempt from this restriction because of existing bilateralagreements.     Under current arrangements boats in the zone are supervised by theircountry of origin. Therefore, as long as the present agreements remain intact,fishing boats belonging to South Korea and China are outside the Japanesegovernment's jurisdiction even if they fish inside the zone.     Applying quotas only for Japanese fishing boats would be unfair and anineffective way to reduce hauls, said the agency official.     To rectify the situation, the government is urging its two neighbors torevise the existing agreements so that Japan can exercise authority over anyfishing boat, regardless of nationality, within its 200-mile fishing zone.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     okura reform     okura reform     Yomiuri     A ruling coalition task force discussing reform of the Finance Ministryhas set Thursday as its deadline to come up with the coalition's unifiedproposal, despite apparent discord among its member parties.     The deadline was set Tuesday, when the task force decided to present thecoalition's proposal when it meets again on Thursday, according to sourcesclose to the team.     However, political observers question whether the three rulingparties--the Liberal Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party and New PartySakigake (Pioneers)--will be able to smooth over their difference on thissensitive issue by Thursday.     The LDP and SDP, the two largest parties in the coalition, are united inprinciple on a two-pillar plan.     Under the plan, the ministry's three key bureaus--securities, banking,and international finance--would be merged into two bureaus dealing withfinance and international affairs, while its banking and finance inspectionfunction would be separated from the ministry and be taken over by a new bodyattached to the ministry.     Sakigake, on the other hand, is demanding more drastic reform throughcomplete separation between its functions in dealing with fiscal and financialaffairs.     The LDP and SDP have given up on a plan to separate the supervisingfunction from the ministry, because it would involve other ministries, such asthe Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, which, according to LDP andSDP sources, would face insurmountable obstacles.     Presently the ministry has three fundamental functions concerningfinancial administration: drafting policies, inspecting and supervising banksand securities houses.     The LDP and SDP are calling for the inspection function to go to a neworganization whose jurisdiction would cover not only banks but alsoagricultural cooperatives and other non-bank financial institutions.     Under the LDP-SDP proposal, the organization would be affiliated with theministry and subject to the provision of Clause 8 of the National GovernmentOrganization Law.     Some coalition members had also called for the application of the law'sClause 3 to the proposed organization so as to give it more independence fromthe ministry.     However, the two parties eventually backed down, because this wouldrequire a drastic reform of the ministry, including its local inspectionsections, which LDP and SDP sources say is practically impossible.     Nevertheless, the LDP-SDP proposal attempts to reinforce the independenceof a new body by designating the prime minister, not the finance minister, asthe supreme authority in appointing its head.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     R.A.

McDonald, president of P&G Far East P&G's commitment to Kobe is partof o ne to Japan and the world     Ikuo Anai     Yomiuri     Kobe     According to your personal history, you graduated from the U.S. Armyacademy West Point in 1975--the year the Vietnam War ended. Five years later,you left the military and joined Procter & Gamble. Can you tell me what youdid in the military and why you left?     McDonald: It's a requirement that you serve in the army for five yearsafter graduating from West Point. I served primarily with the 82nd AirborneDivision as an infantry officer. It's a parachute unit.     Did you think of leaving the military early on?     No, not really. I found it fine to be an army officer. But over time Imet my wife and I went to an MBA program (at Utah State University). I thendecided that my goal had changed and this led me to private industry.     I'd like to take (the fall of) the Berlin Wall as an example. When I wentto West Point, I thought that would happen because the military createsfreedom for people in other countries. But the reality is that businessescreate freedom. People in East Germany wanted Levi's jeans and BMWs thatpeople in West Germany had. That made the wall come down--not really a battle.     So, in some way, global business plays an important role in liberatingpeople. Look at China. One could argue--at least the U.S. government wouldargue--that engaging China has resulted in more progress than in isolatingChina. That's probably the future trend of the world.     I think that is already an ongoing trend as many multinational companies,including your company, have already started operations in many developingcountries such as China.     I think so. We have quite large operations in China and employ a lot ofChinese people. In fact, we have many of those Chinese people working rightnow in this building--our regional technical center.     P&G Far East is not a public company so it isn't obliged to divulgeinformation about sales.     That's right. But I can tell you about total global company results ifyou are interested. As of June 30 this year, we announced record annualearnings of more than 3 billion dollars. That's the first time that we mademore than 3 billion dollars in profit--a 15 percent increase over the previousyear. Actual worldwide net sales were 35.28 billion dollars, up 5 percent.Again, that's the first time that we have ever made more than 35 billiondollars.     It's not surprising that each of our four regions--North America, Europe,Latin America and Asia--showed record volumes and record results. Asiaaccounted for about 4 billion dollars of that 35 billion dollars--actually3.79 billion dollars--and that was a 5 percent increase.     How about results in Japan?     We don't refer to Japan separately. But we would say that no matter howgood the result is, we want to do better. The presence of this building--atechnical center and our Asian headquarters--is evidence of our commitment toJapan and of the importance of Japan not only in Asia but really to our globalbusiness.     The way we like to think about it is that the Japanese consumer is one ofthe most critical and most discerning in the world. The Japanese consumer cansee product differences that other consumers often miss. We use the capabilityof the Japanese consumer and the tough competition we have here in Japan tonot only improve our products in Japan but improve our products globally.     Let me give you some examples. You may know that we introduced thedish-washing detergent called Joy in 1995 and it became the market leader in arelatively short period of time. It was formulated differently (from acomparable product in the United States) because habits are different inJapan.     In North America, consumers put dish-washing liquid in sinks, fill themwith water and create a solution. In Japan, consumers put drops ofdish-washing liquid on a sponge and then wash with it.     In hair care, we also have to formulate differently. Japanese, and Asian,hair is six times the diameter of Caucasian hair. If you understand geometry,the larger the diameter is, the more surface area you have and the moreconditioning you need.     I understand that in the early years of its operations in Japan, P&Gsimply brought U.S. products to Japan.     That's correct. And they failed.     When did your company actually realize there were differences in consumertastes?     I don't remember the exact year, but it was maybe 1985, with a program wecalled "Ichidai Hiyaku."     Meaning a great leap forward?     Exactly. We really got focused on creating products in Japan for Japaneseconsumers. That led to better business growth.     We now want to go a step further and use the Japanese consumer to help usinnovate products for the rest of the world. That's the reason you see thisbuilding here.     You know many, many foreign companies are going to places like Singaporeand Hong Kong. We purposely chose to come to Japan.     Let me ask you about the impact on your company of the bearish state ofthe Japanese economy in the wake of the economic bubble. You are lucky becauseyour arrival coincided with the very beginning of a recovery.     Is it recovering? (laughter)     Did your company suffer any adverse effects from the collapse of thebubble economy? Many Japanese companies blame it for their poor performance.     I think that of a number of issues, the most critical to me is (that) weneed to...get the economy growing again.     From our company's standpoint, we are trying to increase the rate ofinnovation in our products. I don't think the Japanese consumer has become anyless desirous of quality products or better value.     In fact, consumers have become even tougher--tougher judges. We know thatif we innovate in our products and if we give them a product that truly issuperior, they buy it. That's a challenge.     I have read an awful lot about price destruction after the bubbleeconomy. In some ways, price destruction is our own fault. As we look at some(of our) behavior as a company, we have found that many things that we did mayhave exacerbated and perpetuated price destruction.     Some of these things have perhaps hurt the consumer more than helped theconsumer. We have a strategy worldwide that we call ECR or efficient consumerresponse. ECR is the idea that you focus on specific consumer needs and givethe consumers what they want and eliminate all non-value-added activity.     In Japan, as you know, sometimes when you go shopping, you can find acertain product at one store at 200 yen and at another store at 1,200. yen Asa consumer, you immediately register in your mind: What's going on? Why isthere such a price disparity?     This is because the situation is not transparent. The consumer doesn'tunderstand the value of the products that they are buying. We want to create atransparent environment--an environment where the consumer can buy a productbecause of the product performance, the position of advertising andvariants--no deception...By eliminating all the inefficiencies in supplyingproducts, we can be the lowest price every day.     When I spoke with a New York fund manager the other day, he said hefavors household product manufacturers like yourself because their stockprices are not so vulnerable to the cyclical changes in the economy--theconsumer needs your products anyway regardless of the prevailing economicconditions. Is this observation correct?     Let me tell you the way we look at it. Our company's job is to increasetotal shareholder value. In order to measure our performance, we actuallymeasure ourselves against many other companies in our industry. And we'd liketo be in the top of that measurement.     Total shareholder value includes things like stock-price appreciation anddividends. A consumer goods stock is good to hold in a bearish market. Procter& Gamble in the last three years actually has been at the top of the industry.As a result, we've seen an exponential increase in the share price. We hope wewill be able to keep that up.     We believe it is very important for the employees to feel that they arethe owners of the company.     Procter & Gamble believes very deeply that the interests of its employeesand the company are inseparable. As a result, here in Japan in August, we gaveeach employee stock in P&G.     Was that stock offer the first of its kind?     Yes, the first time. Again it demonstrates our commitment to people. Theidea is to increase the feeling of their ownership of the company.     P&G has been in Japan for 23 years. Do you think this is long enough toachieve a solid customer base that can generate earnings automatically withoutpouring an enormous amount of money into advertising?     That's a great question. The interesting thing about Japan, as I told youbefore, is that the Japanese consumer is discerning. As a result of that, inJapan, you win big or you lose big.     There really is no in-between. If you develop a superior product likeJoy, you win very big. But if you have a product that is inferior, you canlose very big.     So I don't think that there are any automatic earnings or automaticmarket share in Japan.     I would say of all the countries I worked in--I worked in many and amfamiliar with our business all over the world--in this country, you have to beworking hard every single day to satisfy the consumer. Otherwise, you lose.     Part of that is the consumer and part of it is the competition, becausethe competition is working hard every day.     We have Kao-san (Kao Corp.), Lion-san (Lion Corp.) and Uni-Charm as ourcompetitors here in Japan. I am afraid that even if we are here for a century,there will be nothing like automatic earnings.Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Taka stays perfect; Akebono loses 2nd     Taka stays perfect; Akebono loses 2nd     Yomiuri     Yokozuna Takanohana maintained his hold on first place and a perfectrecord, defeating No. 3 maegashira Tamakasuga on the 10th day of the AutumnGrand Sumo Tournament at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan on Tuesday.     Takanohana (10-0) was sent sliding backwards by the maegashira's initialcharge, but quickly righted himself, and turned the momentum rapidly in hisdirection to push out Tamakasuga (4-6).     Yokozuna Akebono suffered his second loss of the basho when he was throwndown by No. 1 maegashira Asahiyutaka.     The two rikishi had to wrestle twice, after the judges called for arematch when the first bout ended in confusion.     Akebono (8-2) appeared to have lost when he inadvertently stepped out ofthe dohyo while trying to apply the final shove to Asahiyutaka (7-3).     Akebono had a solid two-hand belt hold on the maegashira at the time andhad him toeing the straw, when he accidentally stepped out with his right footas Asahiyutaka struggled to stave off the yokozuna.     Television replays clearly showed that the yokozuna had indeed steppedout first, but after a lengthy discussion, the judges ordered the pair towrestle again.     Ozeki Takanonami had to muster all his energy to avoid defeat at thehands of sekiwake Kaio, leaving both wrestlers at 7-3.     Kaio shot off the mark and stood the ozeki up, gaining a two-hand beltgrip in the process. The sekiwake moved the ozeki near the edge of the circle,before Takanonami finally fought off the charge and quickly turned the tablesand lifted Kaio out.     Ozeki Wakanohana fought off an aggressive effort from No. 2 maegashiraKotoinazuma (3-7) to bag his kachikoshi eighth victory.     Wakanohana stood firm in the face of the maegashira's repeated slaps andthrust, weathering the storm until he could wear down the maegashira and pushhim out of the dohyo.     Ozeki Musashimaru got his kachikoshi by prevailing over No. 1 maegashiraAkinoshima (3-7) in a bout that lasted just a split-second.     Akinoshima tried to fire off the tachi-ai at a low angle, hoping to knifein underneath the ozeki, but Musashimaru reacted quickly to foil themaegashira's plan.     Musashimaru extended both arms to steady himself by touching themaegashira's shoulders, then quickly pulled Akinoshima down by the back of theneck.     Sekiwake Takatoriki (5-5) dominated komusubi Kotonowaka (1-9) in a shortaffair. Takatoriki took charge of the match from the outset, using a left-handsmash to the throat of the komusubi to pave the way to victory.     Takatoriki kept his hand on Kotonowaka's throat, then moved in and got abelt-hold, which he used to twist the komusubi around in a circle beforepushing him out.     Komusubi Musoyama benefitted from some carelessness on the part of No. 2maegashira Kenko (1-9) for his sixth win .     Kenko came off the tachi-ai with the advantage, forcing the komusubibackward with a succession of slaps to the face. However, just as themaegashira moved in to finish Musoyama off, he allowed the komusubi to grabhis arms at the exact moment his body was extended in a precarious position.     Musoyama seized the opportunity, and moved to the side and pulled themaegashira down.     Komusubi Kotonishiki (8-2) made short work of No. 5 maegashira Daishoho(5-5).     The agile komusubi employed a combination of good hand and footwork toget himself behind the maegashira and push him out.     Flying off the mark, Kotonishiki kept himself out of Daishoho's reachwhile simultaneously applying deft blows to the shoulders and back of themaegashira to put himself in position for the win.     No. 3 maegashira Kotobeppu (1-9) finally got in the win column by scoringa victory over No. 4 maegashira Konishiki (5-5).     The two heavyweights bashed into each other repeatedly, before Kotobeppugot Konishiki off-balance, then used his ample stomach to move the largerKonishiki backward over the straw.     No. 7 maegashira Minatofuji threw down No. 4 maegashira Kitakachidoki(2-8) with a one-hand belt grip to garner his fourth win of the tournament.     Minatofuji (4-7) quickly gained a hold on Kitakachidoki's mawashi andthen lifted him in the air and flipped him over.     No. 6 maegashira Aogiyama (4-6) forced out No. 5 maegashira Asanowaka(3-7).Copyright 1996 The Daily YomiuriBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE DAILY YOMIURI via NewsNetSeptember 18, 1996     Ohio State men swing into lead of Topy Cup     Ohio State men swing into lead of Topy Cup     Yomiuri     TANAGURA, Fukushima     The Ohio State University men's golf team shot a collective 5-under-parTuesday to lead the team competition of the Topy Cup U.S.-JapanIntercollegiate Golf Championship at the Tanagura Country Club.

The bank's president, James Wolfensohn,listed 10 major project components for the three year programme to runfrom January 1996.  These are: water and sanitation ($380m); energy -to include power, district heating, natural gas distribution and coal($893m); transport ($698m); telecommunications ($567m); agriculture andrural reconstruction ($330m); industry ($400m); education ($275m);health ($540m); housing ($600m); and mine-clearing ($200m).Extent of destruction.  The programme is needed to cope with thedestruction or serious damage of two-thirds of the country's housingstock, half of its schools and colleges, and one-third of its healthfacilities, Mr Wolfensohn told the London Conference on PeaceImplementation in December.  It was also necessary to wean ordinaryBosnians back into economic life.  At present, nine out of 10 aredependent on humanitarian assistance, whilst family incomes areaveraging one-quarter of their pre-war level.Donor meeting.  The programme will have to be financed by a variety ofbilateral and international groups.  Mr Wolfensohn said that the IMFand the central banks of key potential donor countries are backing theprogramme.  The Netherlands is expected to play a major role in hostinga donors' conference in the next few weeks.  The European Bank forReconstruction and Development (EBRD) is currently preparing majorprojects in the power, telecommunications and transport sectors.EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere says technical missions have madepreliminary assessments and that detailed project preparation studieshave been defined.  The EBRD, he said, "is considering both equity andloan instruments, oriented to channel resources efficiently to Bosnianenterprises."  Mr de Larosiere stated that Bosnia would requiresignificant levels of concessional funding.  Both bank presidentsstressed the need for a dual approach: the revitalisation of localenterprises - which often amounts to the establishment or encouragementof private sector enterprise in an economy still dominated by the state- along with the physical reconstruction of key infrastructure.Palestinian experience.  The World Bank has learned from its experiencein the Palestinian areas of the West Bank and Gaza that if such anambitious reconstruction programme is to get off the ground, thenconcrete aid proposals will have to be formulated - and implemented -very quickly indeed.  In this context, it has already begunimplementing a priority three month programme to run from January 1 toMarch 31 1996, which Mr Wolfensohn estimates will require between $550mand $600m.  At a meeting in Brussels in December, the Bank, theEuropean Commission and the EBRD held an initial meeting of donorcountries and agencies to set out a comprehensive reconstructionprogramme and mobilise short-term commitments.Mr Wolfensohn has already committed the bank to contributing asignificant part of this short term financing, whilst the EuropeanUnion, the Islamic Conference Organisation and individual European andIslamic states are putting the finishing touches to contributions thatshould ensure the initial programme is fully funded.In stressing an integrated approach to reconstruction, Mr Wolfensohnand other potential donors have stressed that they will take intoaccount humanitarian and human rights issues as well as those ofpractical reconstruction.  It seems likely that a number of significantmajor projects will be initiated in 1996, not least in terms of therestoration of basic services in Sarajevo and other major cities.  Butit is impossible to predict what will happen in 1997 in view of thefact that the American-led military implementation force is supposed tocomplete its mission at the end of 1996, thus potentially removing oneof the key pillars of day-to-day security in Bosnia.Political strings.  In addition, the US has made it very clear thatreconstruction comes with tough political strings.  "Reconstructionfunds are not a right.  Those who fail to comply with the DaytonAgreement should not expect our help; those who do not co-operate withthe War Crimes Tribunal should not expect to receive the benefits ofeconomic and financial assistance," the US ambassador to the UN,Madeleine Albright, told the London conference.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996EBRD LOOKS TO BOSNIAThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is predicting an"explosion" of investment funds in war-torn former Yugoslavia, once thepeace settlement takes hold in the emerging patchwork of states.  A co-author (along with the European Union) of the region's nascent $3bn -$4bn World Bank-led reconstruction programme, the EBRD is to undertakethe rebuilding of the financial sector in order to "mobilise domesticand foreign capital".The government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has alreadyapplied for full membership of the international financialinstitutions.  But this has been held up pending a settlement of theissue of outstanding debt obligations of the former Yugoslavia.  Thepeace agreement means, however, that a solution to the problem willsoon be found.  Indeed, reconstruction plans, which will depend onWorld Bank and other international finance, are already in an advancedstage."Finance for local companies has been limited all over the Balkancountries", says Peter Bod, the bank's board member for Hungary, theCzech and Slovak Republics and Croatia.  "But as the region recoversfrom the transitional depression and opportunities improve followingthe implementation of the peace agreement, the demand for funds willcertainly explode.  The EBRD has been active in all member countriesand is willing to contribute to further modernisation in the Balkanregion".Croatian example.  The EBRD is pointing to neighbouring Croatia as arole model for its investment plans.  The country is a relatively newmember of the bank, but has been able to produce a selection ofbankable private and public sector projects.  In the last 12 months ithas become one of the most dynamically expanding clients of the EBRD.This was against a backdrop of hyper-inflation of 1,150 per cent in1993 (now down to 3 per cent) and surrounding instability.The bank's Croatia portfolio tops $300m worth of infrastructurereconstruction projects including $100m on new highways, $100m forelectricity network reconstruction and $80m for air traffic control.There are also strong industrial projects, like the pharmaceuticalproject at Pliva, and sizeable banking projects.  The bank is the soleinvestor in Croatia's financial sector."Among the institutional prerequisites, the banking sectorrehabilitation is perhaps the crucial one" says Mr Bod.  "Bilateralsupport and multilateral assistance should concentrate on this task.Reliable banking and savings institutions are needed to support savingsin the countries concerned.  Domestic sources must become the mainsource of investment and trade finance".  He points to the region'smore advanced transition countries where two thirds of financingrequirements are sourced domestically.Gap for EBRD.  None of the countries in the region has an "investmentgrade" classification from the World Bank.  Western investment banksare therefore reluctant to take long-term risk in the region.  Thelocal banks' capability and willingness to take longer term corporaterisk is also limited, partly because of a lack of longer term deposits. Moreover the structures of the banking industry in the region arehighly concentrated.  This is where the EBRD will come in.The EBRD sees a mammoth task ahead.  In previously war-stricken areasit has identified wholesale investment requirements in physicalinfrastructure - bridges, power, roads, water supplies, health care,housing.  The Trans-European routes have been neglected and suffereddestruction and require major reconstruction.  Formation of new statesneeds new cross-border transport and communication links.  And theregion is saddled with companies whose equipment is obsolete and callsfor extensive upgrading and modernisation.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996ASSISTANCE FOR COMPANY IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIAA group of former British Foreign Office Balkan specialists have set upa partnership to assist companies in former Yugoslavia.

Butthe "sherpas", who have been carrying out the donkey work since lastSeptember, believe they have cracked the main problems.Sofia's airport is a notorious bottle neck at normal times. Immigrationand customs would be completely overwhelmed by jumbo-loads of high-powered international politicians and bankers. Soviet administrations,however, were finely tuned to the needs of visiting dignitaries. Theirlegacy is a 1960s-built VIP wing as large as the main terminal itself.This will be placed at the disposal of the EBRD caravanserai.Electricity?  Sofia also boasts a late 1970s Congress Centre designedwith command economy mass rallies in mind. Officials have found itslayout and design more functional and easier to move around in thananything Budapest, St Petersburg or London have been able to supply.More importantly in this city of unreliable utilities, the centre hasindependent power supplies.Tight squeeze.  Hotel accommodation remains a bone of contention.Gilbert Sabathe, (the bank's assistant secretary-general) in charge ofconference planning and protocol, is confident of putting up the coredelegations in western comfort at the Sheraton, InterContinental andNovotel. A further 19 hotels have been chosen to accommodate theexpected 2,000 to 2,500 visiting foreign representatives, guests andpress. (Bulgarian attendees are expected to find privateaccommodation.)Even with these numbers - distinctly on the low side by Budapest and StPetersburg standards - the bank's travel agents have had to scour thecountryside and 2-star operations in the less salubrious inner cityquarters to come up with sufficient beds. No recommendations on roomsharing have yet been issued.Mr Sabathe concedes that Sofia, like some other East European capitals,may not be ideally suited to servicing pampered westerners but heregards it as central to EBRD's role to encourage such cities to reachinternational standards.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996HORN SHOWS IRRITATION"There is only one decision-making authority in this country and thisis the government," Gyula Horn, the Hungarian prime minister, said lastmonth. He is increasingly irritated by the rejection of some of hiseconomic policies either by parliament, by the Constitutional Court orhis own Socialist Party.In an interview with a local economic newspaper Mr Horn said he wassurprised by the parliament's vote (including some support from theruling coalition) demanding that the extra revenue generated byprivatisation sales is devoted to reducing Hungary's debt rather thanspent on domestic investments. However, Mr Horn is confident that hecan modify the decision when the full extent of the revenue is known.The rejection of some of the cutbacks in social provisions by theConstitutional Court forced the government to raise the top rate ofpersonal income tax from 44 per cent to 48 per cent but the "mainproblem is that this leads to the further weakening of the middlelayers", said the prime minister. "Many take the view that thegovernment is pursuing a kamikaze policy, working against its ownfuture. But what else can we do in the current economic situation? ...Here we cannot proceed according to party-political criteria".At the same time he conceded that it is "unjust that the wage positionof public sector workers is getting worse from year to year ... Nextyear we hope to stop this trend, although there is no scope forimprovement".About the next two years Mr Horn said that 1996 "will be the year ofcreating employment and stabilisation.

Rather, they were people with expertise in applyingforeign investment legislation and who had been confronted with theproblems in this field.  The framework is a kind of `how-to-do-it'document".OECD, which serves as a think-tank for the world's industrialisedcountries, said it will hopefully provide a source on which CIScountries can draw in revising foreign investment laws; a basis for co-ordinating advice to CIS countries; help harmonise CIS legislation withinternational standards, such as investment protection treaties, and,above all, "foster clarity and transparency in CIS countries' foreigninvestment legislation".The meeting was attended by representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan,Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Ukraine was a notable absentee.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996HUNGARIAN BANK TO LEAVE LONDONDue to anticipated changes in Hungarian legislation as well as to meetinternational requirements, Hungary's most successful foreign bankingoperations - the London-based Hungarian International Bank (HIB) - isto be wound up.The decision follows unsuccessful soundings by the 93 per cent ownersof the bank, the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) to sell it as a goingconcern to foreign interests.  OTP, the Hungarian savings bank owns theremaining 7 per cent.During its last financial year ending in September 1994 HIB made aprofit before tax of $4.3m.  While some of Hungary's larger banks wouldhave liked to acquire the operation - which has been active in Londonsince 1973 as a trade finance and forfaiting institution - bankingsources indicated that the capital strength of the would-be owners didnot impress the Bank of England sufficiently to endorse the change ofownership.The bank's operations are currently under winding down, with a view toclosure by end-1996.  However, it is understood that some activitymainly forfaiting may be carried on as a new operation by OTP, althoughno  statement was forthcoming either from HIB or OTP on futureintentions.The NBH in Hungary was unwilling to make a statement about theirreasons for their failure to sell HIB as a going concern.  Someobservers were surprised that HIB was not sold to third parties as itwould have represented considerable capital value.  However, contraryopinion was expressed by Jack Wilson, who was managing director of HIBduring the 1980s and now is chairman of London  Forfaiting Company, aleading player in the forfaiting market.

This is theprediction of Derek Chambers, banking specialist at James Capel Europe,who has singled out the country's nascent High Street banks as thesector's beneficiaries of the "most exciting growth".Speaking at a recent seminar in London on Poland's privatisationprogramme, Mr Chambers pointed out that the country's banking sector isalready beginning to see a rapid increase in the scale of itsactivities.  He pointed out that consumer borrowing is growing at arate similar to what was experienced in the UK in the 1970s."Inflation is 23 per cent this year" noted Mr Chambers.  "It will be 20per cent next year and fall to 14 per cent in 1997.  Our belief is thatthe retail banks will benefit from this situation.  Three or four ofthe privatised banks will have excellent prospects".His reasons for optimism are many.  Paradoxically, one is the  state ofhealth of the much-maligned zloty.  There has been a decline in foreigncurrency deposits in Poland following the zloty's stabilisation againstthe dollar, making zloty returns more attractive.  More employees arebeing paid by bank transfer, and the number of active personal accountshas soared over the past 12-18 months, doubling or even trebling insome banks.  Consumer finance for purchase of household durables is nowwithin reach with the fall of inflation and interest rates and it isestimated that as much as two thirds of consumer durables are nowpurchased on credit.Rapid growth of accounts.  Traditionally, the number of adult Poleswith bank accounts was low - not much more than 20 per cent.  MrChambers predicts that the changes in Poland's economic climate arehelping to revolutionise this situation.  "The development of theeconomy and the relatively small scale of banking intermediation at themoment, means that an annual double digit percentage real growth inbanking business volumes will be sustained for some years to come," hesaid.  "Lower margins will be required to make banking servicesaffordable, but the volume growth should offset the margin effect onprofitability".Lower real interest rates also make lending to private sectorenterprise more viable.  Business is showing increasing willingness toembark on large scale investment projects.  In the first half of 1995,private sector investment outlays increased by nearly 50 per cent inreal terms.  Overall, he believes that banking services could easilydouble relative to the economy over the next 10 years, which would add7 per cent per annum real growth to underlying 5 per cent growth.Although international banks are much in evidence in Poland, most ofthe future growth is likely to come from domestically-based bankinginstitutions.  "Some of the banks that have emerged from the statebanking sector are likely to be the best placed to provide the servicesthat the population and the economy will require", adds Mr Chambers.In the 1980s commercial banking in Poland was monopolised by thecentral bank. However, there were also other specialised institutions.Bank Handlowy was originally founded in the nineteenth century andregained its autonomy in the 1960s, specialising in foreign trade.Although it has lost its monopoly, it continues to handle about half offoreign trade finance.  PKO BP, the national savings bank, has thelargest branch network, and also finances home loans.Bank Pekao is the main foreign currency deposit-taker in Poland, andthe largest bank in terms of deposits.  In 1989, the central bank hivedoff its branches into nine regional banks, which developed into quasiregular commercial banks.  Three have been privatised, andprivatisation of a further two or three is likely during the next year. The rest will be taken out of state control before the end of 1996.Mr Chambers does, however, see one down side: "The banks have not beentotally privatised.  There are still substantial holdings in the handsof state agencies.  I would like to see a change in this."Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996ELECTION RESULTS: THE MEANINGWhy should a president with a popular rating in single-digits believehe can win re-election six months after the party of his supporterstakes a  drubbing?The victories of "Our House is Russia" in Moscow (19 per cent) and theCommunist Party in the country (22 per cent) once again provide MrYeltsin with the confrontationist card he has always enjoyed playing;the one he exploited in the early months of 1993 when he promotedpolarisation  with a "communist" parliament, and acted as if Russianshave only one reform  democrat choice to make.Now, as western governments and media rumble with warnings of acommunist return to power, Mr Yeltsin  can try to upstage oppositiondemocrat Grigory  Yavlinsky, whose failure to improve on the 8 per centvote his Yabloko party won in 1993 is a serious blow to hispresidential chances.After co-founder of Yabloko, Yury Boldyrev, recently resigned with awithering attack onMr Yavlinsky's  political morals (see below), andanother founder,  Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, left amidst criticism of MrYavlinsky,  competence,  Yabloko is floundering. As a one-man vehiclefor Mr Yavlinsky's ambitions,  the party has nowhere to turn now,except towards those who backed the  government on December 17, ortowards the Moscow democrats who split between Mr  Yavlinsky, YegorGaidar and Sviatoslav Fyodorov.If, as seems likely, Mr Yeltsin retains the  Prime Minister, ViktorChernomyrdin, and  strengthens the reform faction of ministers in hisgovernment, he can  outflank Mr Yavlinsky in the electorate. By acombination of bullying and  bribery, he should also be able to lurethe banks and oil companies away  from financing the huge costs MrYavlinsky will need to sink into television in  order to stay in therace.The replacement of the foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev - which even headmits  to expecting now - is an easy sop to the new parliament. It maybe a  consolation prize for Ivan Rybkin, the former speaker of theDuma, whose  Kremlin-sponsored bloc failed to win any seats.Last month's result confirms what has been obvious on both sides of theKremlin wall for months. Mr Chernomyrdin is unelectable for president,and cannot expect to take Yeltsin's mantle in what some Kremlinadvisers once imagined would be a "natural succession" to thepresidency. The election result also destroyed the reputation ofgovernment apparat and the oil and gas lobby - once presumed to be themost powerful vote-getting machines in the country.The two machines that emerge from the parliamentary election are theCommunist Party, and the city of Moscow. United, the two would almostcertainly defeat Yeltsin. Divided, Mr Yeltsin can defeat thecommunists. Thus, Gennady Zyuganov and Mr Yeltsin are bound to admittheir chances of  winning power depend on which way the mayor, YuryLuzhkov, decides to swing.With 22 per cent of the vote, plus 4 per cent for Viktor Anpilov'salternative communist bloc, and the eclipse of rural ally, the AgrarianParty, the  communist leadership  can read the election outcome as goodfor the  party, but not for  Mr Zyuganov as a presidential candidate.Senior party figures knew that beforehand. They told EEM they wouldanalyse  the Duma poll to judge whom to choose as the figurehead of analliance against Yeltsin.Lebed marginalised.  The surprise failure of the Congress of RussianCommunities (KRO) to reach  the 5 per cent required for party seats inparliament, can be explained by the lack of effective grassrootsorganisation, and the drift of votes from the industrial centres to theCommunist Party, not to Yury Skokov. His rivalry with General AlexanderLebed has cost KRO dear. Gen Lebed himself won a personal seat for thearms-manufacturing centre of Tula.  But without a KRO faction to sitwith, he is now a commander without troops. To advance further, he nowneeds the Communist Party. The election result doesn't suggest theyneed him, because the general is not a vote-winner in the big cities.The Duma election demonstrated again, if anyone needs to be told, howisolated Moscow has become from the rest of the country - an island ofaffluence in a sea of poverty and resentment.  Mr Yeltsin's re-electionstrategy  must capitalise on support from Moscow, and on the resistanceto a return of  the communists to power that is still felt throughoutthe country. The man  Mr Yeltsin needs is the same man the communistswill be looking to for their  figurehead - this is Mr Luzhkov.M r Yeltsin's confidante, Alexander Korzhakov, made it clear in atelevision interview just before the December poll that he expects MrLuzhkov to stay out of presidential politics - at least until the endof Yeltsin's second term. "If he decides to  run for re-election asmayor",  Mr Korzhakov said of Mr Luzhkov, "I will vote for him. But ifhe decides to run for president in 2000, I will not vote for him."Mr Luzhkov has three months to judge whether he is better off sidingwith Mr Yeltsin or against him. If Mr Yeltsin stokes the same fire withparliament as  in 1993, it is likely Mr Luzhkov will also follow thesame course, keeping his head down.Another sign to lift Yeltsin's presidential election chances was thesize of the no vote. Since Mr Yeltsin's first presidential election winin 1991, Russian voters have steadily reflected their disappointment bystaying home on election day. This time, however, turnout rose to 64per cent across the  country, confounding many politicians who expecteda further drop below the  51 per cent who voted in 1993.The gain in voters' sense of duty was partly an achievement of thedisciplined local Communist Party organisations. But an estimated 5 percent of Russian voters chose the bottom-line on their ballot paper inwhich they rejected all of the 43 parties listed.When parliament debated the law on presidential elections early lastyear, the Kremlin successfully pressed to remove this choice out offear the  no-vote may end up larger than the vote for the winningpresidential  candidate. That was done. When the presidential poll,planned in June, takes place, Mr Yeltsin can count on forcing a simplechoice on the voters - the communists or himself. Those who don't likethat will stay at home, and the result is one Mr Yeltsin has reason tobe confident he can win.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996SIGNIFICANCE OF MOSCOW RESULTSThe parliamentary election results have once again made clear that thepolicies of President Yeltsin and the popular reaction that  galvanisedthe Communist Party vote open a huge political divide separatingMoscow from the rest of the country.  Ironically, it is this whichsustains the government's confidence that it can continue in power, andposes the most serious obstacle to the  communist challenge. To bridgethe divide in the presidential election  starting up now will require acandidate who promises to keep Moscow's  affluence intact, whileconvincing provincial Russians that, however unfair  and miserabletheir lot may be, the communist alternative would be much worse.The most notable result of the Duma election campaign is that thecommunist gain is a consolidation, not a significant increase in theirnational vote. The government's loss of votes is a defeat in thecountry, but not in the capital. Put the two together, and you have acase of all that changes stays the same. The sensation of deja vu isbound to follow if  politicking in the early months of 1996 begin toresemble the same period of  1993.Support for government.  The election returns indicate Moscow was theonly major part of  the country where support for the governmentremained stable, and  where the pro-government bloc came in ahead ofthe opposition. Though the  parties and movements have changed namesand leaders, roughly 33 per cent of  Muscovites supported thegovernment in 1993; those votes were cast for  Russia's Choice (YegorGaidar), the Party of Russian Unity and Accord  (Sergei Shakhrai), anda number of small democratic reform groups. In December, the percentagewas almost identical, though this time the votes went  to PrimeMinister Chernomyrdin's "Our House is Russia" (NDR), Mr Gaidar'sDemocratic Choice of Russia, and another handful of democrats.In Moscow, the centre opposition or anti-government democrats have alsoremained more or less in the same position, with just under 20 per centof the votes. In 1993 they included Yabloko (12 per cent) and theDemocratic Party of Russia (6 per cent); this year Yabloko did better(15 per cent) and in place of the Democratic Party, SviatoslavFyodorov's Working People's Self-government party emerged (4.5 percent).Finally, the left opposition among Muscovites has changed character,but its share of the total vote has stayed much the same as in 1993.Then the Communist Party recorded 11 per cent; Vladimir Zhirinovsky'sLiberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) 13 per cent. This time, theCommunist Party grew to 15 per cent, the LDPR slipped below 5 per cent,and the Congress of Russian Communities (KRO) replaced it with 6 percent.  The national figures show some differences, but the underlyingpicture hasn't changed. Communist support is much greater than inMoscow, but  proportionally not very much greater countrywide than the1993 result.  Yabloko as the democratic alternative to the governmenthasn't budged, and  remains at the same 8 per cent mark.The government party NDR has been hit harder this time than Russia'sChoice  was in 1993. When Mr Gaidar drew 15 per cent, the defeat was astinging one. Now  that Mr Chernomyrdin has won just 10 per cent, theresult, though anticipated by  the Kremlin and press, ought not to beless painful. With Mr Gaidar just clearing the 5 per cent barrier,their combined total stays at 15 per cent. That  neither the Kremlinnor the White House appears to be feeling too much pain  is explainedby their location in the heart of Moscow. In a real sense, they  wonMoscow - though they lost the country. Holding on to their politicalpower would be impossible without Moscow. What sort of power they canexercise when the rest of the country has turned against them will beseen  as the presidential campaign accelerates - and as theindependently elected  deputies of the Duma, and the regionalrepresentatives in the Federation  Council take their new seats.Because so many parties competed, but fell short of the 5 per centminimum vote required to be represented, their vote has beenredistributed to the five parties that have qualified  This will havethe  effect of magnifying the number of the Communist Party's seatswell beyond  its proportional share of the vote. One estimate by aKremlin official  indicates the communists will occupy roughly one-third of the 450 Duma seats  - a big gain over the last parliament, butstill short of a majority.  The one in three Moscow voters whosupported Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Gaidar have  obvious economicinterests which a stable government can deliver more  reliably than MrYavlinsky's promises. So long as Yury Luzhkov, the mayor of  Moscow,stays loyal to Mr Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin, Moscow isn't likely tofall  to Mr Yavlinsky. The communists have proved they couldn't elect apresident unless they find a non-communist to lead them, and he wouldalso have to appeal to Moscow's pro-government interests.  That's apolitical improbability Mr Yeltsin should savour, for he can appeal toboth the pro-government Muscovites, and the large reservoir of anti-communist sentiment in the countryside. Mr Yeltsin can borrow CharlesDe Gaulle's slogan, "apres moi, le deluge". Even if still ailing, hemay not need to  convince the voters there really is a "moi", so longas the "deluge" is worrying enough.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996FIGHT OVER NEW OIL LAWYabloko leader and presidential candidate, Grigory Yavlinsky, has comeunder attack by the co-founder of his party, Yury Boldyrev, for tryingto promote oil company profits at the expense of Russia's nationalinterests.  The attack by Mr Boldyrev, who represents St Petersburg inthe outgoing  Federation Council, came on the eve of the December 19session of the Council, when the senators voted to approve amendmentsto the law on production-sharing in the oil and gas industry, and sendthe revised bill to the President for signing.Mr Boldyrev told EEM he resigned from Mr Yabloko several weeks agobecause of M r Yavlinsky's refusal to allow amendments to theproduction-sharing law favoured by a majority of the Duma. Mr Boldyrevis now deputy chairman of the Accounting Chamber, the independentwatchdog of government spending. Before his parliamentary career, MrBoldyrev headed anti-corruption investigations in the presidentialadministration.He led the Federation Council campaign to reject the Duma version ofthe law, which was passed in June after intense lobbying by oilcompanies and government officials. From July until October, theCouncil came under the same pressure, but finally voted to reject thekey provisions.That no-vote in the upper chamber included many regionalrepresentatives appointed by the president, who were antagonized by thelobbying campaign. The Council veto was the biggest defeat this yearfor the oil and gas lobby, provoking Prime Minister Chernomyrdin topublicly criticize the  fuel and  energy minister, Yury Shafranik, fornot lobbying hard enough."The first version [of the law] allowed the executive power to sign anykind of contract", Mr Boldyrev said. "Any contract was allowable anddid not take into account the national interest." When the AccountingChamber asked the government in August to provide details and contractsfor the major oil  and gas projects at stake, nothing was handed over.Opposing arguments.  These amendments were voted by the Duma onDecember 6. Mr Yavlinsky's Yabloko was united in voting against, butfailed. Mr Yavlinsky has argued that the concessions are vital ifforeign energy companies will agree to invest billions of dollars inRussian projects.  Mr Boldyrev says the amendments that have beenintroduced in the law "allows and guarantees foreign investors, butlimits loopholes and stops making gifts of deposits to friends."The amendments which were approved last month establish the primacy ofRussian civil and criminal law over contracts, and requires contractdisputes to be settled in Russian court. Tax and excise duty privilegeshave  been trimmed, and new limits introduced on the concessions foroil and gas  deposits which the government can award in contracts.Production-sharing  benefits are to be allowed only for those depositsand projects that are listed in federal law."These are the difficult deposits, which involve high costs and high-risk investment",  Mr Boldyrev said. "They aren't the cream of the cropwhich can be easily obtained."He said the new law will tighten control of oil and gas concessionsthat can be awarded without tender, and require investment contractsfor strategically important deposits to be approved by parliament.In the Council, representatives of Russia's oil regions foundthemselves in an ambiguous position over the terms of the production-sharing law. Though it promised to open the doors to foreign investmentthat is desperately needed in their regions, the small print of the lawtook away the power to decide contracts from the regional authorities,and gave it to the federal government. The regional senators are muchhappier with the amended law than with the original version.Explaining how the oil lobby was more successful in the opposition-ledDuma than in the more conservative Council, Mr Boldyrev said: "In theupper chamber there are more experienced people, and more diverseinterests."Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996FLOWER POWERWhen Muscovites celebrate national holidays, rose-growers on themountain slopes of Ecuador run out of roses to sell, and prices go uprapidly. Meanwhile in the Netherlands, where most of Europe's cutflowers are auctioned, if every Dutchman were to buy a rose between now and New Year, the number of roses traded would still be less than thenumber  of roses Moscow will buy in the same period. It is figures like this that make Moscow the largest, fastest growingmarket for cut flowers in Europe. And because fast growth also promisesfast money, dozens of speculators and short-term traders jostle thelarger Russian flower companies in what one executive calls "unhealthycompetition."Today, flower entrepreneurs told EEM, there are about 60 importers ofcut  flowers for sale in Moscow. The total is an inexact one, becausemany appear  for just one or two deals, often concentrating on salesfor a single  holiday, the March 8 "Women's Day." It is on that day theRussian flower  business reaches its annual peak. Retail sellers'margins, which usually  average around 100 per cent, leap to 200 percent and higher.Valery Stayen, chief executive of Business Bouquet, believes that about20 companies are regular importers of flowers. His company is one ofthe largest, bringing in from the Dutch auctions by truck 300,000 roseseach week. Another "five or six" companies, Mr Stayen calculates, maybe importing comparable volumes of flowers. Together with the smalleroperators, the total imports to Moscow may exceed 2m weekly, or 8m permonth.No-one in the flower trade knows for sure, and Customs figures aremisleading because most importers avoid paying the full 25 per centduty by official, as well as unofficial means.According to Mr Stayen, the Moscow flower market is quite unlike othercities in Europe or the US. Because of the long cold season, and thesale of flowers on the street, only thick-stemmed roses and carnationsare suitable for trade. Ecuador produces most of the roses Russiansbuy, but of the 30 types grown, only 10 can be sold to the Russiantrade. Inadequate and slow air transport between Quito, Ecuador'scapital, and Moscow, gives the Dutch brokers the chance to dominateRussian supply - at least until the Russian flower companies can startup their own plantations in Ecuador, and improve cargo delivery times.Carnations, the second Russian choice, mostly originate now fromColumbia, Spain, Kenya and Israel. Again, the Dutch market serves asthe intermediary, adding about 16 per cent in margin, plus extratransport costs. At least one Israeli horticultural company has a joint-venture investment in a Kaluga-region growing operation; but foreigninvestment of this kind is  rare.Fluctuating market.  Russian tastes are also unique. "In Europe flowerdemand is stable," Mr Stayen observed. "People use flowers in theirhouse each day. In Russia, there is  still the habit of buying forspecial occasions. And because of that, because you have to have theflower for that day, it doesn't matter how much it  costs."Imports face limited domestic competition. There are a handful ofhorticultural farms in the Moscow region. But they and Moscow's cottagegardeners were able to exploit this year's unusually dry, hot weatherto produce more than the usual supply of roses, together with othervarieties of flowers. Although the Dutch auction price doesn'tfluctuate much seasonally, domestic Russian flowers were able to pulldown the import price this year.Changed supplies.  Just over three years ago, at the start of 1992, themarket conditions were entirely different. Mostsvettorg, a stateenterprise, held the monopoly of imports, distribution, and retailsales through its own kiosks and shops. Uzbekistan and Azerbaijansupplied most of the roses and carnations within the Soviet economy;Bulgaria, Egypt and Vietnam provided imports as part of inter-statebarter trade.The collapse of the Soviet trading system, and war in Azerbaijan, havevirtually eliminated these sources of supply. Although Azeri tradersstill control some retail locations around Moscow, they no longerdominate the import business. The largest importers are now Russian.Mr Stayen's company started three years as a small floral decorator,providing exotic flower arrangements for companies, offices, andspecial occasions to order. It then moved into the import business, andbegan operating as a major wholesaler, not only to Moscow but  to anetwork of provincial cities. They now number more than two dozen."For us", Mr Stayen told EEM, "it is not necessary to be the biggestimporter.  Better to optimise profitability on operations." BusinessBouquet dismisses  the buy-cheap, sell-dear tactics of the smalloperators. It concentrates on  establishing regular volume clients, andcutting supply costs.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996CASPIAN SEA SAGA TO CONTINUEThe Caspian pipeline saga looks set to continue throughout 1996.  LastOctober, the consortium developing Azerbaijan's principal offshorereserves announced their intention to export "early oil" via bothRussia and Georgia - with a Russian contract to be signed by the end ofthe month.  That contract has still not been signed and, with Chechnyaagain embroiled in an increasingly violent conflict, the question iswhether Moscow can actually deliver on its promises concerningAzerbaijani oil exports via Grozny and the Russian Black sea oilterminal of Novorossiysk.Georgian problems.  Ironically, no progress seems to have been made onthe second project, the establishment/renovation of a pipeline fromBaku to the Georgian port of Soupsa, for eventual export by ship tonorthern Turkey.  For while the Russians have got bogged down over avariety of security, financial and capacity considerations, theGeorgian line ran into problems over project finance structuring.A fresh series of meetings scheduled for January could resolve the keyfinancial problems affecting both routes, but the security problems aremore difficult to resolve.  Negotiations on the northern routeinitially became stalled because the Russians began demanding port feesfor the use of Novorossiysk in addition to the charge of $2.80 intransit fees which would be levied for every barrel of Azerbaijanicrude shipped through the system.  The $2.80 figure is a net rate,taking into account the half dollar depreciation which would stem fromthe necessary blending of relatively high quality Azerbaijani crudewith Russia's own Urals blend.Although this is around 50 cents higher than the $2.30 calculation forcomparable cost of shipping early oil out via Soupsa, the consortiumdoes not appear to believe that cheaper oil shipment costs warrant anpreference being given to the Georgian route.  For one thing, the costsof this differential will be borne by Azerbaijan, in its capacity asowner of the actual reserves being exported.  The 1994 agreement underwhich Azerbaijan granted the three fields of Chirag, Guneshli and Azerito the consortium specified that capital and operational expenditureswere to be deducted before royalties were due, so transit costs, whichare generally covered by these headings, matter less to the consortiumthan they do to the Azerbaijani government, which would in effect bearthe cost of the extra 50 cents through decreased revenues.Russia's dilemma.  From the Russian perspective, the question iswhether capturing up to 5m tonnes (100,000 b/d) of Azerbaijani earlyoil for Novorossiysk is worth the fact that it will displace anequivalent volume of purely Russian exports, since Novorossiysk isalready working at its full capacity of just 32m tonnes per year and,with troubles dogging the rival Caspian Pipeline Consortium's proposalfor a capacity expansion line from Tikhoretsk to a single point mooringjust west of Novorossiysk, it looks as if it will be some years beforehandling capacity is increased. Such problems are capable of commercialresolution and the long-term prospect of securing full-scaleAzerbaijani exports for Novorossiysk can serve as a rationale for short-term cutbacks, or re-routing , of Russia's own exports, particularlywhere the volumes are so relatively small.  But the recent fighting inChechnya raises problems of an altogether different dimension, and herethe consortium remains dangerously vulnerable.Grozny route vital.  In the long run, it can certainly consider apipeline routing to Novorossiysk that avoids Chechnya, but in the shortrun, it has to use the Grozny line if it is to export early oil.  Thisrequires an essentially political decision and the impression atpresent is that two of the consortium's main pillars, Amoco of the USand British Petroleum , are still trying to secure use of the Groznyroute because they believe close co-operation with Moscow is essentialfor their other oil interests in the region whilst also being necessaryin terms of assuaging Moscow's concerns about the very fact that theyare developing the still controversial and politically disputed oilreserves off the coast of Azerbaijan.Turkish election result.  As for the Georgian route, Turkey continuesto stress that is would provide full political risk guarantees for anyoil shipped by that route in the hope that this will encourage theconsortium to shift its focus away from Novorossiysk.Now that it looks likely that the Islamist Refah party will not come topower in Ankara, prospects for the Georgian route have improved.  But,as always, nothing is certain in this enduring saga.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996EMPLOYEE RIGHTS DEMANDEDWith some exceptions "the rights of ordinary employees to take part inprivatisation are either non-existent or widely ignored in many formersocialist countries in this part of the world," according to RobertOakeshott, executive director of London's Job Ownership Ltd (JOL).  Hewas addressing an international seminar in Slovakia on employeeinvolvement in privatisation.He cited as exceptions Slovenia and Bulgaria, among five countries withwhich he worked; the others being Hungary, Romania and Macedonia.  Evenin Romania and Hungary however, despite "quite robust" laws onemployees rights, "it seems that managers and others with unusualinfluence are frequently able to trample over them."It was therefore significant that leading trade unions in at leastthree countries - Bulgaria, Slovenia, Macedonia - had "now woken up tothe fact that members' rights in privatisation may need to be foughtfor and then protected."Is privatisation in Eastern Europe therefore a rip-off, from theordinary working person's viewpoint?  Such a feeling was not far fromthe surface at the two-day seminar, where discussions focused onvarious forms of possible employee involvement, such as direct shareownership, MEBOs (Management-led Employee Buy-Outs) and ESOPs (EmployeeShare Ownership Plans), in which a trust is established to holdemployees' shares.  The meeting was hosted by the Slovak metalworkersunion Kovo, with some organisational and financial support respectivelyfrom JOL and Britain's Know-How Fund (KHF).Criticism of Slovakia.  The keynote speaker was Eugen Skultety's, Kovovice-president, who did not mince words about his government'sprivatisation methods.  Privatisation had taken an "unethical and oftenillegal  course."  Citizens were losing confidence in the process, butwere too frightened to complain.  The absence of controlling organs"creates an optimal milieu for a variety of speculators, illegal moneyexchangers and a number of, we can openly say, mafias acting in thisfield."After describing some of the techniques these people employed, MrSkultety recalled that in May the Slovak government had adopted fiveprinciples for the participation of employees, but these principleswere ignored by the National Property Fund, whose activity inimplementing privatisation was "completely non-transparent."Mr Skultety's criticisms were backed by a legal adviser, Prof GustavLesyk, who spoke of the privatisation of a chemical company employing3,400.  Seventten managers got 34 per cent of the shares, and employeesthe rest; the managers' shares were in bearer form so they could beavailable to political friends.  But Prof Lesyk added, the unions mustkeep out of politics.  "The unions role is to depoliticise the wholething."Slovak participants heard presentations on employee ownership inwestern companies like Republic Engineered Steels of US, Tullis Russel(paper making) and Baxi Partnership) (domestic heating) of Britain.They were also told about experiences nearer home, in Eastern Europe,where JOL and KHF have been working.Except for Macedonia, still at the starting line, the state of playcould be summed up as follows:* A successful example is that of Herend, the 126 year old Hungarianporcelain maker.  It described how an ESOP agreement establishingemployee ownership was signed in 1992.  Hungary is reported to haveabout 100 ESOP companies but not all do so well.* Eugenie Kostourkov, director of the Ownership Foundation, Sofia,spoke of lobbying to get employee ownership legislation passed inBulgaria, resulting in the birth so far of some 20 ESOPs. Heillustrated two successful pilot projects; one, a company makingtractor parts which are exported to Germany; the other, a batterymanufacturer which had lost business with Russia's car plant atTogliatti, but since diversified into other types of batteries.* Slovenia, after some questionable early grabs by managers while anold Yugoslav law was still in force, has probably the widest workerownership.  In 83 per cent of companies so far privatised, employeeshold the maximum permitted stake of 60 per cent.  Aleksandra Kanjuo-Mrcela of DEZAP  however pointed out that this represents only some 50per cent of capital value.

It is now  also thecountry's largest merchant hydrogen supplier, offering its customers ahigh purity gases capacity, with a combination of both locally-sourcedand imported product.The company was formed in April 1993 with the joint venture and wasbolstered by BOC Gazy's acquisition of three Polgaz (the former stategases company) plants in the towns of Siewierz, Poznan and Wroclaw.BOC Gazy has a 650-strong local workforce based on eight locations.  Itboasts between 25-30 per cent market share.  And it is extremely upbeatabout its experience."We were among the pioneers in joint venture investment in Poland"boasts John Filer, the BOC director responsible for the Polish venture. "And our operations have continued to expand with increasing success.From the start we took the view that Poland presented by far the bestinvestment opportunity.  And so far we have been proved right".BOC's investment to date is 30m ($45m) and this will rise to between#35m and #40m in the next few years.  The company paid 6m for theinitial deal for the three plants, and has pumped #2m a year into itsdistribution network.  Currently it is expanding with a 65 tonnes-a-dayoxygen production plant for Elstal Labedy in Gliwice to be opened inJanuary 1996 and a 450 tonnes-a-day cyrogenic air separation unit (ASU)at the Huta Czestochowa steelworks to come on-stream in mid-1996.Distribution.  The company found that Polish industrial gases companiesoperated on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, with customers compelled tocollect their goods.  "Distribution was the missing link and to thisday there remains a "production mentality.  I make it - the customercollects it".  As Mr Filer puts it: "Distribution was another word formiddleman - someone who got a cut without actually making anything.What's more, they found that Polish companies had no confidence instate producers, giving rise to a "DIY mentality."BOC Gazy set out to change that.  It invested a fleet of modern liquidtankers and palletised cylinder vehicles and is in the process ofestablishing a network of strategically-located retail outlets - bothcompany-owned and independent agencies.  As a result, it has given thecountry its first-ever reliable supplies of high purity liquidnitrogen.  This will form the basis for growth of a wide range ofcustomer applications including purging, food freezing and electronics.Its distribution asset programme includes the innovation - for Poland -of BOC-owned storage tanks for liquefied gases in customers' premises.BOC Gazy's will be the first two dedicated supply schemes in Poland,supplying industrial gases by pipeline to large customers.BOC Gazy's product range of liquid gases includes oxygen, nitrogen,argon, carbon dioxide, helium and hydrogen, as well as compressed gasesfor cutting and welding, oxy-fuel welding mixtures, and high puritygases.The company is bidding for business with major international companies,themselves onward investors - Philips,  Pilkington's, Coca Cola,PepsiCo (the latter currently have to import carbon dioxide), and thefreezing activity for McDonald's hamburgers.  "Before we came alongfrozen meat for the food chains came from Germany" says Mr Filer.  "Nowlocally produced meat is processed and frozen, and appears in thehamburgers of consumers in Poland".  The company also supplies oxygento Polish hospitals.Indigenous management.  Mr Filer puts much of the company's successdown to its indigenous management policy.  "This was deliberate fromthe start.  We did not send any UK-based staff to Poland to take over.The chairman is a Polish, so is his deputy.  We have recruited andtrained a professional sales team from within the ranks of the existingemployees.Headaches with the workforce?  "Poland is strong in trade unions andworkers councils.  All I can say is that their co-operation has beenadmirable.  And it should be taken into consideration that we pay ourworkers a proportion of the profits so that they know that they have astake in ensuring that the company is a success".Advice for others.  Mr Filer has some advice for western investors.  Hesays they must accept that a sudden massive injection of foreigncapital - and presence - is bound to be traumatic experience for allconcerned on the ground and should be borne in mind.  "We believe thatwestern companies setting up shop there must also be prepared to investin the country and in its local communities".Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996FRENCH HYPERMARKET FOR POLANDCentres Leclerc, a leading French hypermarket chain, has opened itsfirst Polish store at Ursynow, southern Warsaw, and plans a secondstore at Zoliborz, west of the capital, in February.Ninety per cent of goods on offer will be Polish food and clothesbecause of high import duties, but the stores will be run on co-operative lines established by the Centre's founder, Edouard Leclerc.The Leclerc system is to group independent retailers under one roof andone brand, giving them leverage with producers.The Polish stores will be sponsored by French Leclerc stores, whichhave invested FFr20m ($4m) in the programme.  Polish staff, accompaniedby their families, have been trained in France over three years.  Inall, the Polish expansion of Leclerc has been five years in thepreparation.The stores in the Warsaw suburbs represent the first Polish investmentby a leading French chain.  French hypermarkets have been expandingaround the world, but have tended to avoid Eastern Europe.Jean-Philippe Magre, the Leclerc executive in charge of the operation,told EEM, "It's going to be a difficult market as Polish shoppers arenot yet at the stage of mass consumption.  Suggestions that Polandrepresents a market of the kind that French chains found in Spain 20years ago are erroneous.  We will draw first on a local population of100,000 living five to 10 minutes from the store."We are starting modestly in Ursynow with only 2,000 square metres ofsales area, but plan to double this.  There will be petrol pumps, aMcDonald's and parking for 600 cars.  The Polish managers have all beentrained by us."Leclerc wants  young Polish managers to imitate its French system ofpowerful regional purchasing groups and to open quickly 10 stores-cum-training centres, the basis of a future national chain.  Leclerc addedto EEM that the French government regrettably had offered no aid,leaving it alone to fight "the German and Dutch groups investingmassively in Poland".Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996BULGARIAN GAS PROSPECTSA new natural gas and light oil (condensate) field has been discoveredin northern Bulgaria by a local oil and gas exploration company.According to the Oil and Gas Extraction Company  in Pleven, the fieldis located outside the town of Montana near an old gas field.Experts from the oil and natural gas department of the Committee forGeology and Mineral Resources (CGMR) have estimated that the filed hasthe potential of some 200,000 cu m of natural gas and around 40 cu m oflight oil per day.  Such a flow is considered to be very good as far ascurrent Bulgarian resources and demand are concerned.Evaluation work on the commercial potential of the field is expected tostart early this year. The Pleven company will finance the evaluationwork.Eight commercial natural gas fields have been discovered in Bulgaria sofar, all of them at a depth of 3,000m to 4,500m.  Experts believe thatthe fields can also be found at a greater depth at the foot of theBalkan mountain range.According to experts, the share of locally produced natural gas mayrise to meet 15-20 per cent of Bulgaria's demand. Currently, Bulgarianoil and gas reserves cover just about 1 per cent of the country'sneeds.  Bulgaria currently lacks funds for proper exploration.Six western companies have invested over $140m in oil and gasexploration in Bulgaria, but only Texaco has discovered so far anatural gas field that might be of commercial importance.  It islocated near the town of Varna on the Bulgarian Black Sea.  A finalassessment is being completed to determine the profitability of thefield considering extraction expenditures.In the first half of this year, Bulgarian officials are expected tomeet with Texaco, Austria's OMV and Enterprise Oil to discuss whetherto establish a joint venture to develop it.Investor protection row.  Bulgaria is planning to announce a new tenderwith international participation, but critics say that the recentlyadopted Concession Law creates obstacles rather than encourages foreigninvestors.  One problem is that the law does not provide guaranteesthat a company which has funded exploration work will also acquire aconcession for extraction - the company will have to participate in aseparate tender.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996BUSINESS TRAVEL GUIDEThe British travel company Worldmark has published a business guide totravel in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

The law, which is part of a broad governmenteffort to modernize the state, has provoked bitter oppositionfrom public and private-sector unions.  Among other things,labor leaders say the law is aimed at paving the way forprivatization of state enterprises by impeding the ability ofcivil servants to resist the sale of government firms.     When Guatemala's current Constitution took effect in1986, the country's labor movement strongly supported some ofthe clauses contained in the new Magna Carta, especially itsrecognition of the right of civil servants to organize unionsand to strike, which was an important break from pastconstitutions that prohibited such rights among publicemployees.  Even so, the Constitution places significantlimits on the right to strike to ensure that essential publicservices are never interrupted by labor disputes.     The country's labor code states that workers in publichealth services, sanitation, the energy sector, and waterservices cannot strike unless they first make arrangements forthose services to continue without interruption.  And, for anycivil-servant strike to be deemed "legal," the union in agiven state ministry or institute must first petition thecourts for a "strike permit."  Without such a permit, anydecision to walk off the job is considered illegal andadequate justification for dismissal or other punitive action.     Nevertheless, since 1986 there have been only a fewinstances in which public-sector unions have successfullypetitioned the courts for a strike permit.  In most cases, thelegal process takes many months--sometimes years--before ajudgement is forthcoming, forcing the unions to carry out defacto strikes to push their demands.  As a result, essentialservices, such as those provided by hospitals and healthclinics, have frequently been shut down during strikes,generating ongoing debate about the country's labor laws.     Since President Alvaro Arzu took office in January, thedebate has gained momentum, in part because of a series ofpublic-sector labor disputes that exploded this year.  InJanuary, for example, workers at two huge state hospitals inGuatemala City--San Juan de Dios and Roosevelt--shut downoutpatient services to press for wage hikes, and theythreatened to mount a nationwide general strike if thegovernment did not open negotiations with them (see Chronicleof Latin American Economic Affairs, 02/29/96).     Beginning in mid-March, the country's 3,700-memberSindicato de Trabajadores del Organismo Judicial (STOJ)paralyzed the country's entire judicial system for three weeksto press for wage hikes and approval of a new collectivebargaining agreement that the union had been negotiating withthe Supreme Court (Corte Suprema de Justicia, CSJ) since March1995.  The STOJ had petitioned the courts for a strike permit,but given the slow progress of the request, plus the CSJ'srefusal to accept a wage hike in negotiations, the uniondecided to forfeit legal permission and press forward with thewalkout.     During the three weeks that it lasted, the strike grippedpublic attention since it completely shut down the courtsthroughout the country, leading to huge conflicts in sometowns and villages where criminals were caught by police butthen set free because the judiciary was inoperative.  In abouta dozen cases, local mobs took justice into their own hands.A total of six men were lynched, and in four of the cases,angry citizens burned the bodies of the victims after killingthem.     Given the public backlash against the strike, the CSJhardened its position and successfully petitioned the courtsto declare the strike illegal.  Under threat of dismissal,STOJ members finally returned to work on April 8 without anyof their demands being met.     The conflict in the judiciary, however, emboldened theArzu administration to push forward with legislation tofurther restrict union rights among civil servants.  On April9, the day after the STOJ went back to work, the governingparty introduced a bill in Congress that would make it illegalto even partially shut down public services in some ministriesand institutes under any circumstances, and to make legalaction against civil servants who strike without a permit muchfaster and easier.     In particular, the bill prohibits strikes in about adozen public sectors, including health, sanitation,telecommunications, energy generation and distribution,aeronautics, postal and telegraph services, the judiciary, thesecurity forces, urban and rural transportation, and waterdistribution.  It also allows the executive to extend thestrike prohibition by decree to include other publicministries and institutes if the government deems that a laborwalkout will seriously affect the national economy or if itrepresents a grave risk to the public.  And, in those caseswhere a union does strike without a legal permit, the billgives authorities the right to fire the striking workerswithout need for court approval.     The government says that the bill is part of a muchbroader government plan to modernize the state.  According toVice President Luis Flores Asturias, in addition to the laborbill, the Arzu administration is preparing a series ofcomplementary public-sector reforms to reduce bureaucracy andincrease government efficiency.  The reforms include a plan tosignificantly cut back the civil servant work force.     The government is now negotiating a loan with the WorldBank to finance a "voluntary retirement" plan whereby public-sector employees would be given incentives to leave theirjobs.  The goal, according to Flores, is to reconcentrate theresponsibility for public services in the hands of a muchleaner and more technically qualified work force.  By reducingthe payroll, the government could offer better wages for thosewho remain, thereby attracting better trained professionalswho would be more efficient at their jobs.     "What we want is a smaller number of employees who willbe paid larger salaries that match their qualifications, bothtechnical and academic," said Flores.  "The modernizationprogram is still in the planning stages.  In the coming monthswe will send proposals to Congress for approval with the goalof implementing the full program at the beginning of nextyear."     Nevertheless, although reaction to other components ofthe modernization plan remains to be seen, the labor-reformbill has generated fierce disagreement since it was introducedin Congress, not just within the country's labor movement, butamong most of the opposition parties in the legislature.  Inpart, the criticism stems from the authoritarian approachtaken by PAN, which controls 43 of the 80 seats in theunicameral Congress.  (Cont.)Back to Headline List CopyrightECOCENTRAL: CENTRAL AMERICAN ECONOMY via NewsNetJune 6, 1996GUATEMALA: NEW LAW LIMITING UNION RIGHTS FORCIVIL SERVANTS PROVOKES HUGE LABOR PROTESTS (Part 2)     PAN has used its legislative majority to limit all debateon the bill, discarding suggestions by the opposition thatlabor leaders be consulted, or that the Constitutional Courtfirst be given an opportunity to rule on whether the billwould violate the Magna Carta.  As a result, on May 23 PANunilaterally approved the bill against the unanimousopposition of the remaining 37 congressional representatives,generating harsh criticism from opposition parties.     "A party dictatorship has been implanted in Congresswhere laws are simply approved by PAN representatives withouteven the slightest interest in listening to the opinion oflegislators from the other parties," said Aristides Villatoroof the Frente Republicano Guatemalteco (FRG), the secondlargest party in Congress.     In fact, the president of Congress, PAN leader CarlosGarcia Regas, prohibited the public from being present in thelegislature when the bill came up for a vote.  Garcia hopedthat measure would block union leaders and activists fromfilling the legislative auditorium in protest.     In Guatemala, a bill must be passed in three consecutivevotes in Congress to become law.  On May 21, when the billcame up for a second vote, Garcia Regas ordered the doors ofCongress shut to the public.     In retaliation, about 300 labor leaders from theFederacion Nacional de Trabajadores del Estado (FENASTEG) andthe Unidad de Accion Sindical y Popular (UASP) forced theirway into the building and held a sit-in in the voting chamber.The activists refused to leave until 1,000 police officers andarmy soldiers surrounded Congress and threatened to forciblyremove them.     When the bill received final approval in a third-roundvote on May 23, Congress remained under heavy guard by thearmy and police, including four armored cars sent by themilitary's Guardia de Honor, one of the largest bases in thecapital.     According to labor leaders, the approval of the law hasencouraged the country's unions to take a much more aggressivestance vis-a-vis the Arzu administration.  FENASTEG and theUASP are planning massive demonstrations during the month ofJune to protest the government's anti-union policies.     "This law is part of a broad government offensive to rollback the basic freedom of workers to organize unions, tonegotiate collectively, and to strike," said UASP leaderSergio Guzman.     Moreover, the unions believe that, in addition torestricting union freedoms in general, the labor reform isspecifically aimed at paving the way for the privatization ofstate firms and institutes in Guatemala by eliminating theability of public-sector unions to fight back.     "This is the first step toward privatization inGuatemala," said Guzman.  "The government is attempting toclear the path for powerful private groups to take control ofstate services, all of which tends toward the imposition of aneoliberal model in Guatemala."     Until now, adamant union opposition had preventedconsecutive governments from privatizing strategic state firmsin Guatemala, such as the telephone company EmpresaGuatemalteca de Telecomunicaciones (GUATEL) and the electricfirms Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion (INDE) and EmpresaElectrica de Guatemala (EEGSA).  In late April, however, theArzu administration announced plans to move forward with the"demonopolization" of GUATEL, and possibly INDE and EEGSA aswell (see Chronicle, 05/16/96).     That, in turn, has radicalized union opposition.  At thisyear's May Day demonstration, union leaders made opposition toprivatization a central theme of the march in the capital,attended by about 10,000 workers.  During the rally, theGUATEL union burned a huge artificial loaf of bread in effigyof the governing PAN, which means "bread" in Spanish.According to the union, the act was also a symbolicdemonstration that workers will not allow the governing partynor the private sector to "gobble up" public patrimony.     Perhaps more important, Guatemalan unions are now, forthe first time, seeking to forge an alliance with unions inother Central American countries to create a regional movementagainst privatization.  The week prior to May Day, thetelecommunications and electricity-sector unions fromGuatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua met in San Salvador,where they formed the Federacion Centroamericana deTrabajadores de las Telecomunicaciones y de la EnergiaElectrica (FESTEN).     FESTEN is aimed at forging a "common front" against plansby regional governments to sell off telecommunications andelectricity institutes, which is a stated goal of nearly allthe isthmian administrations.  FESTEN member unions willorganize simultaneous actions in their individual countries,including strikes, demonstrations, educational campaigns, andlobbying of diplomatic entities.  The unions from those threenations will also seek to incorporate telecommunications andenergy-sector unions from Costa Rica, Panama, and Honduras.     "FESTEN's creation is necessary because the problem ofprivatization is exactly the same in all the Central Americancountries," said Orlando Aguillon, secretary general of theSalvadoran electricity workers union Asociacion deTrabajadores de la Comision Ejecutiva del Rio Lempa (ATCEL).     According to Nicaraguan labor leader Ronald Membreno, thegoal is not to halt privatization programs outright since suchan objective is unrealistic.  Rather, FESTEN hopes toinfluence the process to make the outcome more favorable toworkers and lower-income groups.     "We are aware that we will not be able to reverse theprivatization process in Central America since it is a planthat is being imposed on local governments by internationallending institutions," said Membreno.  "But we canenergetically oppose the process to reduce the negativeeffects of privatization as much as possible."

Honduran officials, however,expect the embargo to be lifted within a few weeks, after aninspection team from the US certifies that Honduran shrimpboats are equipped with turtle-safe nets.     In 1993, owners of shrimp fleets in Caribbean Basincountries agreed to switch to the use of nets equipped withmetallic turtle-excluder devices (TED), which allow turtlesentangled in the net to escape.  But environmentalorganizations complained to the US State Department that therewas little or no compliance.     Following announcement of the embargo, Honduran viceminister of economy Edwin Araque admitted in a pressconference that the Honduran shrimp industry had indeed failedto equip its boats with turtle-safe nets.  As a result, theeconomy is threatened with an enormous loss of hard currencyfrom shrimp exports.  Shrimp is the most profitablenontraditional export and third among all Honduran exports,earning about US$120 million per year in foreign exchange.     The embargo is only against shrimp caught at sea, whichwill affect the Honduran catch from the Islas de la Bahiaregion along the northern Caribbean coast.     However, shrimp cultivated in tanks in the Gulf ofFonseca on the Pacific coast, which account for 75% ofHonduran shrimp exports, will continue to be admitted to theUS market, but their origin must be certified.  Araqueestimated the loss in hard currency at US$40 million per yearif the embargo is not lifted.     The embargo went into effect on May 1, but the US quicklygranted a reprieve until June 15.  During that time, acommission will be sent to Honduras to verify that the shrimpboats are being equipped with the required nets.     The Honduran government has taken immediate steps toavoid implementation of the embargo.  On May 9, the departmentof fish and aquiculture (Direccion General de Pesca yAcuicultura, DIGEPESCA) issued an order prohibiting the use ofthe old nets.     "By next week, no product from the [Caribbean] zone canleave the country if it does not have a certificate showingthat it uses dragnets with excluder devices," said Marco PoloMicheletti, vice minister of natural resources.     The navy and merchant marine will enforce the order, andviolators will loose their licenses, said Micheletti.     The ministry expects the cost of the new nets to beabsorbed by the shrimp industry.  The bill for equipping theentire shrimp fleet of 125 boats would be about US$600,000,far less than the US$40 million loss the embargo would cause,said Micheletti.     The US has issued embargo warnings against 50 nations inall, but has so far excluded 11 Latin American countries thathave taken steps to require the use of the new nets.  Belize,Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Mexico,Nicaragua, Panama, Venezuela, and Trinidad and Tobago have allbeen certified by the US as being in compliance with theturtle-safe requirement.     In a related incident, local press reports in Tegucigalpasay that US diplomatic representatives in Honduras suspectthat shrimp boats are being used by drug traffickers tosmuggle cocaine into the US.  The attorney general's officehas asked the US to supply information on the matter.(Sources: Agencia Centroamericana de Noticias--Spanish NewsService, 03/25/96, 05/04/96; La Prensa, 05/03/96, 05/08/96;Tiempo, 05/07/96, 05/10/96; Inter Press Service, 01/09/96,05/24/96)Back to Headline List CopyrightECOCENTRAL: CENTRAL AMERICAN ECONOMY via NewsNetJune 6, 1996NICARAGUA: AGRICULTURAL SECTOR CONFRONTS A CREDIT CRISIS (Part 1)     While coffee and a few nontraditional crops are bringinggood prices on the world market, Nicaragua's agriculturalsector is in crisis, largely because of insufficient credit.Growers blame government policies, which they say withholdassistance to agriculture while favoring selected industries.The government argues that the problem is not one of credit,but of overdue debt.     Nicaraguan agriculture has shown positive growth for thepast two years, both in profitability and amount of land undercultivation.  This growth is largely due to high prices forsome commodities and an increase in crop diversification.Coffee output in 1995, for example, grew by 32% over the 1994level.  Growers of nontraditional crops have been steadilyputting more land under cultivation in tropical fruits,cotton, and flowers.  The area devoted to the production ofmelons for export to the US and Europe increased by more than9% between 1994 and 1995.     However, even growers of nontraditional crops, which areaimed primarily at the export market, do not have adequatecapital to expand and keep up with changing technology.Rodolfo Delgado, director of the Nicaraguan investment fund,Financiera Nicaraguense de Inversiones (FNI), said that themost profitable products--such as tobacco, peanuts, andsesame--need US$89.6 million in credit for the 1996-1997growing season, but only US$60 million is available.According to Delgado, the credit shortage last year prevented80% of the sesame growers from planting.  FNI is looking toEuropean lenders to fill the gap.     Not surprisingly, the credit shortage has become aserious point of contention between growers and thegovernment.  Associations representing farmers, ranchers, andother agricultural segments accuse the government ofstrangling their livelihood through adverse policies.  Forexample, during the 1996-1997 season, the government'sdevelopment bank (Banco Nacional de Desarrollo, BANADES) willmake only US$30.4 million in agricultural loans.  Anyadditional amount, according to Central Bank President JoseTaboada, will have to come from funds recovered from overduedebt.     But according to Amilcar Navarro, head of the farmers andcattle ranchers organization (Union Nacional de Agricultoresy Ganaderos, UNAG), the credit demand for the season is morethan US$164 million.  He said that 80% of those who wantcredit will not get it and that the private banks are tooconservative to extend credit to small producers during thepresent economic crisis.     Furthermore, the cost of credit is prohibitively high fora majority of the producers and nearly impossible for thosewith overdue debt.  Interest and other bank charges areproblems, as well as the controlled monthly devaluation of thecurrency against the US dollar, since loans are calculated indollar terms.  These factors have pushed the real cost ofborrowing as high as 40% on commercial bank loans and somewhatless for state bank loans.  Some growers turn to exporters andother intermediaries for credit but at usurious interestrates.     The western department of Chinandega has been hard hit bythe crisis.  Growers there continue to cultivate sugar caneand other traditional crops but have also tried plantingnontraditionals such as peanuts, soy, sorghum, and cotton.These crops may offer a greater return on investment than thetraditional crops, but producers need credit to make thechangeover.     Some relief came in mid-March, when the regional Banco deAmerica Central (BAC) offered to finance cultivation of 1,400hectares of sugar cane in Chinandega.  The aid would be in theform of short-term credits at 14% interest, which is tenpercentage points below interest rates charged by the statebanks.     But the BAC loans will not help the poorest and mostindebted campesinos.  Nor will financing 1,400 ha go far toreactivate agriculture in Chinandega, since nearly 280,000 haneed assistance, according to UNAG.     Writing in the Sandinista newspaper Barricada, Navarrosaid that government policy was slowly killing theagricultural sector.  Navarro said that the governmentcollection agency Cobranzas de Nicaragua (COBANICSA),nicknamed the Cobra, "is designed to do away with agriculturein our country."     Although the Cobra is supposed to foreclose on the largerproducers, who owe the most money, it is also a threat to thesmaller growers.  Critics of the Cobra say that foreclosureswill eventually lead to severe social unrest and violence,without either reducing the debt or rejuvenating theagricultural sector.     "What good is the Cobra if there is no credit?" askedNavarro.  "Furthermore, what good is credit if it is asuicidal act to take it when you can't pay it back?  What goodis it to lower interest rates if trade policy allows importsto compete advantageously against our products?  And what goodis it to regulate imports if fiscal policy is loading us upwith taxes?"     The UNAG demanded in March that the government providesufficient credits for the 1996-1997 growing season.According to Juan Betancourth, president of UNAG inChinandega, 12,000 small and medium-size growers in thedepartment have been unable to get credit from BANADES.  Smallamounts of financial aid from nongovernmental organizationshave been the main sources of financing.  As a result of thecredit shortage some 269,000 ha of cultivable land are idleand 60,000 campesinos are finding it difficult or impossibleto meet their basic needs, says Betancourth.     Besides the financial hurdles campesinos face,Betancourth notes that many do not have legal title to theirland.  Without titles, banks will not lend money even when itis available.  Therefore, the organization has also demandedthat the government legalize ownership of 14,000 ha for whichit has not yet granted title.  (Cont.)Back to Headline List CopyrightECOCENTRAL: CENTRAL AMERICAN ECONOMY via NewsNetJune 6, 1996NICARAGUA: AGRICULTURAL SECTOR CONFRONTS A CREDIT CRISIS (Part 2)     On the national level, growers and ranchers associationspetitioned the National Assembly in March to pass two billsthat they believe will reactivate the depressed agriculturalsector.  One proposal, submitted by an alliance of ranchers,merchants, and manufacturers, is intended to revive theeconomy in general.  The text of the proposal describes theproductive elements of the economy as "in completeabandonment."     The law would mandate a declaration that the"rehabilitation" of agriculture and industry is "of nationalinterest."  The state banks would then be required tonegotiate favorable terms of repayment for those in bothsectors who carry overdue debt of less than US$365,000.  Theproposal contemplates the refinancing of these debts andsuspension of any seizure of the debtors' property.     The other proposal, submitted by the coffee growersassociation Union Nicaraguense de Cafetaleros (UNICAFE), isintended to improve market prices for coffee and increaseproducer profit.     "Producers have been forced by conditions of poverty tosell their coffee at a disadvantageous price," reads theproposal.     Most Nicaraguan coffee is grown by small and medium-sizedproducers who do not have enough clout to protect theirinterests in dealing with importers of machinery and supplies,coffee exporters, banks, tax collectors, and otherintermediaries in the coffee production and marketing chain.     The law would set up a national coffee council (ConsejoNicaraguense del Cafe), made up of Central Bank and othergovernment officials plus representatives from UNICAFE and thecoffee exporters.  The council would negotiate equitablebusiness terms among all participants in the industry. Inaddition, the law would establish a fund to stabilize prices(Fondo de Estabilizacion y Fomento), capitalized by a tax oncoffee sales.     The credit crunch is not the only problem facing thesmaller agricultural producers.  The movement toward freetrade means drastic reductions in tariff protection foragriculture.  At the same time, growers are burdened with newor higher taxes on inputs such as machinery and fertilizers.In addition, government efforts to favor one or anotherdomestic industry to make the Nicaraguan economy competitivein the global marketplace have provoked other concerns in theagricultural sector.     Cattle ranchers complain that these policies have helpedreduce their herds to dangerously low levels.  The cost ofinputs has risen year by year, but export prices have variedlittle in the last 20 years, according to Lorenzo Arguello ofthe ranchers organization Comision Nacional Ganadera(CONAGAN).     Ranchers and meatpackers have protested governmentpolicies that favor tanneries by holding down the price ofdomestically produced hides and by collecting a 25% customduty on imported leather.  Alfredo Marin, president of themeatpackers association (Asociacion de Mataderos), said thatit was unjust to sacrifice these two productive sectors, whichgenerate 100,000 jobs, to indulge 30 tanneries, which employonly 500.     CONAGAN leaders say that while ranchers are strugglingwith insufficient credit to overcome the obstacles of highcosts and low prices, the government is negotiating for beefimports from Argentina.     CONAGAN is also lobbying in the Assembly against a billintended to foster economic stability, investments, andemployment.  The organization argues that the bill would donone of these things.  Among other provisions, it wouldrapidly lower import duties but would offer no assistance toagriculture to make it more productive and competitive.     Another drag on the cattle industry is a 2% tax thatranchers must pay on their tangible assets and inventory.Cattle ranchers argue that they have low profit marginscompared to the fixed costs of their assets and that suchtaxes are the "coup de grace" for the industry.  Instead,CONAGAN is asking the Assembly's committee on economic policyto offer real economic incentives to ranching.     In contrast to the pessimism among these producerassociations, government officials are uniformly optimisticabout the economy and see the basic problem in agriculture asits inefficiency and lack of global competitiveness.     Cabinet officials and government economists arepredicting a strong 5% growth in GDP for 1996, and along withit continued growth in agricultural output.  As for credit,they say that domestic savings is on the upswing, growing 17%faster this year than in 1995.  As a result, there is amplecredit available--some US$608 million--says Mario Flores,general manager of the Central Bank.  The problem is not alack of funds but rather the borrowers' "culture of notpaying," he said.     "It's the quality of the borrowers, problems ofproductivity, poor management, and low profitability of theprojects," said Flores.     When asked what he thought of proposals to restructurethe debt, Flores said that if adopted, such proposals wouldbreak the Nicaraguan banks.     The government's policy is to avoid a collapse of theCentral Bank brought on by bad debt.  Some 30,000 producersare in arrears in their payments and the total overdue debt tostate banks is now US$182.5 million.  Until debtors liquidatetheir obligations, they will not be eligible for additionalstate bank credit, said Central Bank president Taboada.  Bankpolicy for the future will be to loan only to small andmedium-size producers.  It is the big growers who have thebiggest state-bank debts. About 200 of them account for 80% ofthe nation's overdue agricultural debt owed to the statebanks.  However, by most accounts few of the 30,000 debtorswill be eligible for additional state credit during thecurrent growing season.     To Flores and Taboada, the credit crunch, if not thegeneral crisis on the farm, is caused by mismanagement oroutright fraudulent use of credit.  But the president of theUNAG chapter in Masaya department, Jose Martinez, pointed outthat the government was also a debtor begging for debt relief.     "President Violeta de Chamorro's government received apardon of 80% of its foreign debt with the Paris Club," saidMartinez.  "So, the growers are proposing that the interest onthe debt they have with the state banks be reduced and theterm extended to 15 years."

The Commission is preparing draft Regulations and aCommunication to be submitted to the Council of Finance Ministers inNovember and December so that the Dublin Summit on December 13 and 14 canproceed with the final adoption of the architecture of the future MonetaryUnion, set to come into being on January 1, 1999. These proposals willtake into account the conclusions of the informal Finance Council held inDublin on September 20 and 21 and the meeting of the EU's influentialMonetary Committee on October 8.Legal status of the EuroA pair of draft Regulations designed to guarantee the continuity ofcontracts denominated in national currencies and offer legal security toEuro users, between January 1, 1999 (the start of the final stage ofEconomic and Monetary Union) and the complete demise of nationalcurrencies (no later than six months after January 1, 2002) were approvedby the European Commission The first Regulation clearly confirms thecontinuity of legal instruments, not least contracts, would be ensuredbetween the older national currencies and the Euro and between the ECU andthe Euro. It specifies in Article 2 that as soon as EMU stage three comesinto being any reference to the ECU shall be replaced by a reference tothe Euro. The conversion rate is one Euro for one ECU. Starting on January1, Regulation 3320/94, which fixes the composition of the ECU basket ofcurrencies, will be repealed. Article 3 of the proposal says the Euro doesnot allow a party to a legal instrument the right to change it orunilaterally cancel it. As for conversion rates, Article 4 envisages fourspecific provisions:- Conversion rates express the value of one Euro in each of the nationalcurrencies taking part in the process. They comprise six key figures; -The rates may not be rounded off nor truncated during conversion; - Theyare used for conversion between the Euro unit and national monetary unitsor the other way round. Reverse rates calculated on the basis ofconversion rates may not be used; - Any amount to be converted from anational monetary unit into another has first of all to be converted intoa Euro-denominated monetary amount, rounded off to three decimals thenconverted into the other national monetary unit. The second Regulationprovides that the single currency will be divided into100 sub-divisionscalled "cents" and will expressly include the list of countries takingpart in the final phase. During the transitional period, due to get underway on January 1, 1999, and end on December 31, 2001 at the latest, theMember States will be entitled to convert outstanding amounts of debts(bonds and loan securities) denominated in a national currency unit. Themarkets could also replace the national currency in the accounts of theiroperating procedures by the Euro. Notes and coins denominated in anational currency unit keep their legal rates within the countriesconcerned during the above-mentioned transitional period. By January 1,2002 at the latest, the ECB and the central banks of the participatingcountries would place Euro-denominated notes into circulation (notes andcoins may be introduced for practical reasons before the end of thetransitional period). Six months after the end of the transitional period,national currencies would cease to be legal tender.Stability pact.The EMU stability pact will be based on two draft Regulations defining asystem of sanctions for countries violating the criteria (as provided forin Article 104c of the Maastricht Treaty) and will establish a system ofreinforced convergence via stability programmes to prevent budgetaryexcesses on the part of the countries of the Euro zone. The Regulation onsanctions is to take effect on January 1, 1999, while that on reinforcedconvergence is scheduled to enter into force on July 1, 1998. TheCommission provides for each Member State participating in EMU to presenta compulsory and regularly updated stability programme setting outmedium-term macro-economic objectives. These programmes will be madepublic in the interests of transparency. The stability programme willcommit the Member States to correcting any budgetary excesses. An earlywarning system will also be introduced, based on the stability programmeand provisions for implementation established by the Commission, to put ahalt to any slippage of the budget deficit well before it reaches themaximum value of 3% of GDP. If, despite warnings, a Member State'sfinancial position continues to deteriorate, the Council of Ministers maydecide to apply the sanctions procedure. If, in fact, an excessive deficitdoes exist, the Council will immediately address recommendations to theMember State in question and give it a deadline for correcting thesituation. The Member State will have ten months from the time ofdetermination of an excessive deficit to take the necessary action beforesanctions are imposed. The first penalty would be applied in the form of anon-interest-bearing deposit, comprising a fixed part (0.2% of GDP) and avariable part (0.1%) of GDP per deficit point higher than the 3% budgetdeficit limit. A maximum penalty value equal to 0.5% of GDP willtheoretically be chosen. The afore-mentioned final figures might well berevised between now and the Commission meeting on October 16. If theMember States fail to cut their excessive deficits dow to size within two years, the deposit would be converted into a fine.The European Commission has adopted a communication to the Council onreinforced convergence procedures and a new exchange rate mechanism (ERM).The ERM will be a temporary waiting room for countries preparing to joinmonetary union. In line with the recommendations of the European MonetaryInstitute (EMI), there is a broad consensus among Member States on a "huband spoke" arrangement of bilateral links between the Euro and pre-incurrencies. The fluctuation margins will in general be relatively wide,with the possibility of closer links for countries with sufficientlystrong convergence performance: intervention by the European Central Bankwill be automatic at the margin of the fluctuation bands. However, it maybe suspended (and realignment discussions initiated) where the level ofintervention is incompatible with a monetary policy geared towards pricestability.Building on existing procedures for the examination of nationalconvergence programmes and multilateral surveillance of economic policies(under Article 103 of the Treaty), the Commission envisages the followinginnovations:- all pre-ins would be formally obliged to submit convergence programmes.- the first programmes in this new generation would be submitted before 1January 1999.they would be updated annually.- convergence programmes would contain more detail than at present, inparticular on the measures envisaged to achieve the convergence objectivesin terms of public finances, inflation and exchange rate stability. Theymight also contain indications of the supplementary action envisaged tocorrect any slippage from agreed targets.a more precise timetable would be set for the examination of nationalprogrammes by the Council.- the Council would have the right to endorse a country's convergenceprogramme after detailed examination and analysis by the Commission andthe Monetary Committee (which will be succeeded by the Economic andFinancial Committee on 1 January 1999).- the Council would exploit to the full the procedures of Article 103 ofthe Treaty, in particular the possibility to make policy recommendations(if appropriate publicly) to countries whose economic performance deviatesfrom agreed objectives.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN INSIGHTBack to Headline List WT03-B04-25IA087-000634-B037-248http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it132.html 205.156.212.5 19970122024454 text/html 190188HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:42:31 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:22 GMTContent-length: 190000Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it132.html Sample Issue Copyright EUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNet October 26, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES GETTING CYPRUS-REGISTERED SHIPS TO TOE THE LINE (252 words) STOP PRESS: HUMANITARIAN AID MUST GET THROUGH IN ZAIRE, BONINO SAYS (316 words) EU/MEDITERRANEAN STATES: INTERMEDIATE REPORT ON MEDA ACTIONS (522 words) MEPS CRITICISE BP ROLE IN COLOMBIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES (388 words) EU/SLOVENIA: PARLIAMENT PRESSES EU STATES TO RATIFY ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (726 words) PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR COMPLETE EU EMBARGO ON BURMA (308 words) EU/US: COMMISSION TRIES TO WRING DANISH SUPPORT FOR CUBA MEASURE (667 words) EU AND EGYPT STRIVE TO REVIVE TALKS (250 words) EU/PALESTINE: LEON BRITTAN AND PARIS SPAT OVER PEACE PROCESS (842 words) EU/LEBANON ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT LOOMING UP (259 words) EU/BULGARIA: "CONSTRUCTIVE" TECHNICAL MEETING WITH BULGARIA (472 words) EU/EAST EUROPE: EU LOOKS AT ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION WITH CEECS (766 words) EU/ZAIRE/RWANDA: EU REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR POLITICAL SOLUTION TO CONFLICT (283 words) EU/CENTRAL AMERICA: EU PROJECTS TO AID REFUGEES IN GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR (558 words) COMMISSION TO HOST SEMINAR ON TRANSPORT RESEARCH.

On a visit toCyprus on October 18, Neil Kinnock, European Commissioner for Transport,stressed that what the EU mainly had in mind were standards for shippingsafety and the flags of convenience policy, making it easy for foreignships to register in Cyprus. "This is of particular importance for us,given the size of the Cypriot fleet, which is currently the world's fourthlargest fleet and expanding rapidly, and because of the large number ofvessels which belong to EU companies yet fly the Cypriot flag", accordingto Mr Kinnock, who was in Nicosia to take part in a conference of Europeanmaritime experts. The Commissioner claims that because of Cyprus'potential EU membership (a matter that will be considered in 1998), theCommission is obliged to ensure high safety standards at sea as well asfair competition in the merchant shipping industry. Mr Kinnock was thusmaking a veiled criticism of the country's lax attitude to shipregistration.The tonnage of the Cypriot merchant fleet totalled 38.3 million in 1994,but nearly 80% of the Cyprus-registered tonnage was over 15 years of age.By way of comparison, 45% of Liberia's fleet, the biggest in the world, isless than five years old.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996STOP PRESS: HUMANITARIAN AID MUST GET THROUGH IN ZAIRE, BONINO SAYSfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Emma Bonino launched an urgent appeal onOctober 25 to the groups fighting around the border region of Zaire andRwanda to let humanitarian aid through to the 1.2 million refugeesaffected by the crisis, and said the international community had to makeit clear to those launching the attacks that a new genocide in the regionwill not be tolerated. She also criticised the functioning of the EU'sforeign and security policy, saying that it was not able to effectivelyseek solutions to the problem, and pleaded for an acceleration in theprocedures needed to release emergency budgetary reserves in response tothe crisis.The refugees have been grouped mainly in camps around the cities of Goma,Bukavu and Uvira in eastern Zaire. Following the outbreak of the fightingbetween the Zairean army and Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels, all of the 190,000people in the 12 camps around Uvira have fled and, along with tens ofthousands of the Zairean population, are taking to the hills in Zaire oron their way to Bukavu. Painting a bleak picture, Commissioner Bonino saidthe rebels - which she says seem to be following an organised plan todestabilise the Hutu refugee camps - are also advancing toward Bukavu,causing thousands to begin to flee camps in that area.While food stocks for several weeks exist around Bukavu and the EuropeanCommunity Humanitarian Office and other bodies are preparing to establishother emergency measures, such as food drops, the resources will be putunder considerable stress if most of the refugees from Uvira reach thecamps. However, even this is uncertain, the Commissioner said, becauseaccess to camps around Bukavu and Goma are being blocked by the army orthe rebels, and humanitarian workers are unable to reach them.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EU/MEDITERRANEAN STATES: INTERMEDIATE REPORT ON MEDA ACTIONSfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169Of the ECU 4.685 billion in EU subsidies earmarked for theEuro-Mediterranean partnership for the period 1995-99, ECU 414 million hadbeen allocated by October 1, 1996 to bilateral actions and projects, andECU 30 million to regional activities and projects. These figures arecontained in an interim report published by the European Commission onOctober 24. Euro-Mediterranean funding for regional projects andactivities extends to five areas: Barcelona process projects, economiccooperation, decentralised cooperation programmes, information technologyand media projects, and projects concerning cultural heritage, as well asto the MEDA Democracy programme.Economic cooperation.ECU 20 million has been granted this year to the MEDSTAT regionalcooperation project involving Eurostat (the Statistical Office of theEuropean Communities), and the statistics institutes of the twelveMediterranean partners and the fifteen EU Member States. Subsidies havealso been granted to events aimed at nurturing business contracts betweensmall and medium-sized enterprises in Mediterranean third countries andthe EU: "Med Interprise Bethlehem" (February 1996), "Med Interprise Cairo"(May 1996), "Med Interprise Algeria" (scheduled for December 1996) and atinvolving Mediterranean countries in the Europartnership events in Lulea(June 1996) and Genoa (November 1996). A frame-work contract has beendrawn up to cover the short term hiring of experts for the preparation ofeconomic cooperation projects (ECU 2 million)Decentralised cooperation.ECU 37 million has been granted to the "Med Campus" (cooperation betweenuniversities), "Med Urbs" (cooperation between local authorities), and"Med Media" (media cooperation) programmes. A further programme, "MedTechno", involved with technological cooperation will be launched shortly.Culture and media.Following the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Culture inBologna in April 1996, and the meeting of experts on cultural heritage inBrussels in September (both meetings were financed under the "Barcelonaprocess"), a initial list of 14 joint projects is being drawn up forfinancing in 1996 or the beginning of 1997. Funding granted to theseprojects will depend on fine details, notably the number of countriesparticipating in each project. In addition, two training projects havebeen provisionally financed under the Med Media programme, and a subsidygranted for the dissemination of information on the Euro-MediterraneanPartnership through Maghreb radio station Medi 1 (set up in the Moroccancity of Tangiers).Democracy.Financed through a separate MEDA budget line, implementation of the MEDADemocracy programme began in 1996 with subsidies totalling more than ECU 6million granted to 32 projects.Miscellaneous.Other activities benefiting from regional funding through MEDA include:support for the REDWG Secretariat (Regional Economic Development WorkingGroup, chaired by the European Union) in Amman (ECU 400,000), theEuro-Arab Management School in Granada (ECU 400,000), and "micro-actions"(ECU 1.8 million). A total of ECU 1.7 million has been granted over 1996to the preparation and organisation of sectoral meetings at Ministeriallevel and among experts in the following fields: culture, the informationsociety, energy, small and medium sized enterprises, investment, culturalheritage, shipping, water management, foreign policy institutes and theinstruction of diplomats.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996MEPS CRITICISE BP ROLE IN COLOMBIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSESfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The European Parliament criticised human rights abuses in Colombia onOctober 24 and asked that an unpublished Government Human RightsCommission report on the activities of British Petroleum, which MEPsaccused during a debate of complicity in human rights abuses andenvironmental damage in the Casanare region, be made public. In aResolution, the Parliament calls on all European oil companies to "observethe highest standards of respect for human rights and environmentalprotection, especially given the conditions of conflict in which they areworking". Backed by 127 to 62 with 7 abstentions and supported by Membersfrom most of the Parliament's major political groups, the Resolution saysa new dialogue should be established between the oil companies and thecommunity in Casanare to broker support for a new social and economicdevelopment plan for the region.British Socialist MEP Richard Howitt, a member of the Parliament's SouthAmerican delegation, accused BP during the debate earlier that day ofcollaborating with the military in the region, saying these allegationsare backed by the Human Rights Commission report. "The report makesaccusations of the passing of secret video evidence to the militaryleading to the death and disappearances of anti-oil protesters, andsuggests that military denunciations against the protesters lead toassassinations", he said.BP "rejects these charges completely", according to a company spokesman.The British oil group applies the same human rights standards in Colombiaas it does in other countries, he said, and "would never ask the Colombianmilitary to break up a strike". BP also questions whether the report isactually preliminary testimonies into oil industry activities in generalin two Colombian regions rather than a report on BP activities inparticular.In its Resolution, the Parliament "condemns unreservedly all human rightsabuses committed in Colombia" by the security forces or paramilitary orguerrilla groups. It also finds fault with the Government, calling on itto guarantee rather than restrict press freedom in the country, to stopthe use by the army of extrajudicial and arbitrary killings, torture andother human rights violations, to cooperate with the ColombianAttorney-General's office in its efforts to arrest those involved inextrajudicial killings and to continue its efforts to counterdrug-trafficking.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EU/SLOVENIA: PARLIAMENT PRESSES EU STATES TO RATIFY ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169Meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg on October 23, the EuropeanParliament adopted reports by Bernd Posselt (EPP, Germany) on the economicand commercial aspects of the Association Agreement between the EuropeanUnion and the Republic of Slovenia, and Ulpu Iivari (PES, Finland), on thepolitical aspects of this agreement, sending a clear message to MemberStates to ratify the Association Agreement without delay. The Parliamentis delighted that Slovenia lodged a request for accession to the EuropeanUnion on June 10, and will therefore be placed among the vanguard ofcandidates for the next enlargement.Rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mrs Iivari observed thatadoption of an Association Agreement between the Union and Slovenia hasbeen a long drawn-out process. Negotiations began on March 15, 1995, withthe Agreement signed more than a year later on June 10, 1996. Negotiationsbecame bogged down on the fact that - historically - a part of Italy wasannexed by the former Yugoslavia. Rome insisted that Italian nationalsforced to leave Yugoslavia in the 1950s should be granted the right torecover what real estate they abandoned. However, Slovenian legislationand constitutional law prohibits foreigners from owning real estate. Thetwo parties have now settled on a compromise whereby Slovenia has agreedto guarantee all EU citizens the right to acquire real estate from thefourth year after the entry into force of the Agreement. In addition, EUcitizens who have resided for at least three years on Slovenian territory(the case of Italians) will see their rights to acquire real estaterecognised from the entry into force of the Agreement.In her report, Mrs Iivari explains that the general situation in Sloveniais encouraging: per capita income stands at USUSD9,000 a year, andSlovenia already meets a number of the Maastricht criteria set forEconomic and Monetary Union. The text urges the Slovenian Government topursue privatisation and the European Commission to provide financialbacking for redevelopment projects and encourage economic and culturalcooperation. In his speech to the Parliament, EU External RelationsCommissioner Hans van de Broek called on the Member States' nationalParliaments to ratify the Association Agreement with Slovenia as quicklyas possible. Slovenia itself will need to amend its Constitution as regardthe acquisition of real estate, overhaul administrative structures, andconsolidate economic reforms.Encouraging the Slovenian Government to pursue the privatisation process,Bernd Posselt's report invites the European Commission to offer financialsupport to border regions between Slovenia and the EU for redevelopmentprojects to counteract the disappearance of traditional border activities,and to encourage economic and cultural cooperation. Member States are alsourged to provide long-term backing for major infrastructure projects inSlovenia and to include these projects in European planning fortrans-European transport networks. Finally, the report urges Slovenia tofurther improve protection for minority groups.Slovenia on the right road to EU membership.On the eve of the European Parliament's vote, the head of the Parliament'sdelegation for relations with Slovenia, Michel Ebner (EPP, Italy), said atthe end of a two-day meeting in Ljubljana that Slovenia was proceeding onschedule for meeting the preconditions for EU membership. The encounterwas held in the context of high-level meetings with senior politicalfigures, including Josef Skolc, President of Slovenia's parliament, JanezDrnovsek, Prime Minister, and Davorin Kracun, Foreign Minister. Theimpression given during the meeting was that all parties what ever theirstripe were much in favour of closer ties with Europe.The European Parliament's delegation judges that in order to ensure thecontinuing possibility of early EU membership, Slovenia would have to takesteps to complete its own ratification procedure as soon as possible afterthe November 10 elections. Other subjects raised at the meeting includethe EU's Inter-governmental Conference on the Maastricht Treaty reform andthe application of the PHARE programme of aid for economic reforms inEastern Europe, as well as a number of economic and environmental issues.Privatisation was considered with Mr De Prikmajer, State Secretary at theMinistry for Economic Relations and Development. The officials also mootedthe situation in Bosnia after the September 14 elections, and welcomed thepositive role that Slovenia is being called upon to play in the region.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR COMPLETE EU EMBARGO ON BURMAfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The European Parliament said on October 23 that the EU should implementeconomic sanctions against Burma (Myanmar) in an attempt to pressure itsmilitary rulers, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), toend widespread human rights violations. On the same day as Burma announcedthat it had detained Kyi Maung, a top advisor to Nobel Peace Prizelaureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the Parliament condemned in a Resolution "theviolations of human rights and fundamental freedoms being perpetratedagainst the Burmese people".It called in particular for the Council to "end all links between theEuropean Union and Burma based on trade, tourism and investment in Burmaby European companies" when it meets on October 28-29, and for theCommission to present without delay the conclusions of its present inquiryinto withdrawing Generalised System of Preferences trade concessions fromBurma. The withdrawal of GSP, which would cost Burma tens of millions ofDollars, is the only immediate step which may be taken to put effectivepressure on the SLORC, the Parliament said.Meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg, the MEPs took particular aim atforeign companies active in Burma. It expressed concern that investment inBurma by UNOCAL and French oil group Total has caused significantviolations of human rights and indirectly led to forced relocation andlabour, and welcomed the decisions by 15 international companies to stopinvesting in the country. International pressure should also be brought tobear on the country through the United Nations, says the Resolution. TheParliament called on the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)to refuse Burma's application for membership until the SLORC has steppeddown from power, warning that "Burma's full membership would harmrelations between the EU and ASEAN".Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EU/US: COMMISSION TRIES TO WRING DANISH SUPPORT FOR CUBA MEASUREfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The threat of a Danish veto on the European Union's common response to theUnited States' anti-Cuba laws has sent European Commission and EU Councilof Ministers officials into a frenzy as they seek to persuade the errantMember State of the merits of their proposal. The Commission has also usedthe deadlock as an argument for ending the use of a veto in EU foreignpolicy.The EU's Foreign Ministers will be meeting in Luxembourg on October 28 fortheir Council and the Commission wants the common response agreed againstthe so-called Helms-Burton law, by which the United States hopes to punishcompanies doing business with Cuba. But Denmark appears determined toresist the move, insisting it is not against a response as such, ratheragainst the legal means by which the Commission is proposing to pushthrough the measure. "Our position is firm and our Government clearlyindicated this in two meetings of COREPER", a Danish official said.In fact, Denmark actually supports EU arguments against Helms-Burton, andclaims its caution is based on a potential threat to EU Members Statesovereignty thanks to the rarely-used Article 235 of the EU Treaty. Theretaliatory measures will be taken under this Article which states thatthe Council has the power to act on issues not specified in other areas ofthe Treaty, but can only do so by unanimity. It says: "If action by theCommunity should prove necessary to attain, in the course of the operationof the common market, one of the objectives of the Community and thisTreaty has not provided the necessary powers, the Council shall, actingunanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting theEuropean Parliament, take appropriate measures".Denmark says it has held misgivings about Article 235 ever since joiningthe European Community in 1973, as it clashed with Article 20 of theDanish Constitution which says the Government cannot give away too muchsovereignty. "Denmark is not against the European Union takingprecautionary measures against the USA. It's just that we cannot acceptthe use of Article 235", Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said. "Iknow that others are trying to find an alternative basis on which toproceed."Some officials in Brussels suspect Denmark's reticence on ceding authorityto the Commission is linked to a pending court case in Copenhagen on theissue of sovereignty. A group of 11 citizens recently filed a suitclaiming the Danish Government's signature of the Maastricht Treaty onEuropean Union contravened the country's Constitution by transferring toomuch political and judicial authority to supranational institutions. Andthe sensitivity over sovereignty can also be traced to Denmark's tworeferendums on the Maastricht Treaty. The Danish Government only securedapproval for the Treaty during the second referendum, in 1993, afterrenegotiating Denmark's position so there could be an option on the finalstage of Economic and Monetary Union and other EU measures potentiallythreatening to national sovereignty.The European Commission discussed the problem during its weekly meeting onOctober 22, and the Commission President Jacques Santer said it proved howimportant it was for the EU to speak with one voice on such matters. "Thisis a very concrete example which shows that we have to take decisionsquickly without unanimity", Mr Santer's spokesman said. "What is importantis that the Union establishes a joint action as soon as possible as werisk losing our credibility on the international stage."As for finding a way around the problem, officials appear to be looking atall the available means within the EU's legal instruments to placate theDanes. "We are not being dogmatic about it and we are not fixated withArticle 235", said one official. "But we have gone through the Treaty witha fine tooth comb and we believe the combination of articles we are usingis the best."Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EU AND EGYPT STRIVE TO REVIVE TALKSfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The Middle East process, trade relations, Association Agreement talks,financial cooperation and regional cooperation - these are just a sampleof the key themes due to be discussed, on October 28 in Luxembourg by EUand Egyptian Foreign Ministers. Gathered for a Cooperation Councilmeeting, the two sides are likely to focus on problems that have succeededin stalling the Association Agreement negotiations for several months now.The European side believes the concessions being sought by the Egyptians,mainly concerning farm trade, are excessive and do not reflect the reallevel of trade between the two sides. Egypt wants the right to be able toenjoy zero or reduced-rated duties for products for which they are nottraditional exporters to the EU market. (potatoes, for example). They alsowant the export quota system to take account of reference years Egyptconsiders are most in the country's favour. These demands are not acceptedby the European Commission or the EU Member States, who are fearful ofseeing their own producers having to compete with farm produce from Egypt.The two sides will also be taking stock of EU financial assistance forEgypt. Under the new MEDA financial programme for non-EU Mediterraneancountries, Egypt is slated to receive ECU 275 million for 1996. 155million will be channelled into the Social Development Fund, 100 millioninto the basic education sector and 20 million into environment causes.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EU/PALESTINE: LEON BRITTAN AND PARIS SPAT OVER PEACE PROCESSfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169France is somewhat miffed over a statement that Leon Brittan EuropeanCommissioner for External Economic Relations, made on October 24 to theeffect that the conditions are not ripe for the EU to take part in theMiddle East peace process. Why? Because the Member States are unable towork together. He also called on the major EU countries to refrain fromtaking any independent addiction in this sphere. Sir Leon was making aveiled allusion to the role Paris wants France and the EU to play in theNear East. Catherine Colonna, spokeswoman for the French President, saidthat the Commission's words were singularly lacking in relevance. They arenot the sort of things one expects to hear from the European Commissionnor do they reflect reality, she stressed, adding that the Commission hasno powers in common foreign policy matters. Elsewhere, the Commission hassigned a three-year agreement with the UNRWA involving ECU 130 million.On a visit to the Middle East from October 20 to 26, President JacquesChirac made a call for Europe to become a joint sponsor of the peaceprocess. The US and Russia have been the two sponsors since the peaceprocess got under way in October 1991 in Madrid. Sir Leon Brittan judgedthat the conditions are not ripe for EU involvement. "If we succeed inworking together and we refrain from any independent action, we will thenbe able to work with the US in the region. Otherwise we will not succeedin this endeavour", he implied.Ms Colonna stresses that policy positions on the Middle East were beingtaken regularly at the highest level of the EU and that Europe isincreasingly present and active in this area via its Member States andcollectively. She recalled that before his trip to the Middle East, MrChirac took care to inform his partners that he would be reporting back tothem as soon as he got home.Aid for Palestinian refugees.The EU is to provide the hefty sum of ECU 106 million over three years forthe UN refugees welfare Agency. UNWRA's General Commissioner, Peter Hansensays the 4.5% increase in aid (in comparison with last year'scontribution) would help cover18% of his organisation's Budget. The EU isthe second biggest contributor to the UNWRA Budget after the US, but thefirst if donations from each Member States are taken into account. Themoney is used for programmes relating to food, education and health forthe 3.3 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the WestBank and Gaza.Mr Hansen says the EU aid has arrived just at the right moment, becausethe UNWRA Budget is running a 15% deficit and was on the verge of havingto stop making payments. The General Commissioner is planning to make atour of the Arab countries to ask them to boost their contributions(currently accounting for only 1% of the Budget). As for Israel, he issimply asking the authorities there to facilitate the efforts being madeto deliver aid.The aid for UNWRA is quite separate from that awarded to the PalestinianAuthority. The EU is also funding other projects such as one for a majorPalestine hospital due to open next year, for which the EU has paid ECU 20million.Gaza port.During his visit to Palestine, President Chirac announced on October 23his decision to revive the Palestinian shipping port project for Gaza.Sponsored by the Netherlands and France, the project is supposed to resultin the port being able to handle more than one million tonnes of cargoannually in six years' time. Mr Chirac visited the site during his visitto the Gaza Strip. A USD1.5 million contract was signed to allow Frenchengineers to press on with the preparations and to help with constructionimmediately after an Israeli/Palestinian agreement along these lines. "Theconstruction of a port in the Gaza Strip, that France has decided to fund,together with its European partners, is an economic and politicalnecessity", according to Mr Chirac.A first feasibility study, initiated with the support of Israel by theDutch firm Grabowsky and Poorts, was conducted by Tel Aviv University in1990/91. The autonomy agreements signed by Israel and the PLO have, in themeantime, conferred on the Palestinian Authority the right to its ownport. The Israelis and Palestinian have agreed upon a negotiating systemspecifying their mutual approval for each of the three project phases:studies, construction and port operations. The port exists only on paperfor the moment, but the Palestinian President, Yasser Arafat, symbolicallylaid the first stone last January 18 in the company of the Dutch PrimeMinister, Wim Kok. The cost of building the Gaza port is put at USD71million, with the Netherlands supplying FF 23 million, France 19 millionand the EU (via the European Investment Bank) 29 million.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EU/LEBANON ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT LOOMING UPfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169Lebanon and the European Union are likely to be in a position to sign apartnership deal before the end of the year, a European official hinted onOctober 22 in Beruit. Major progress had been made in the talks, accordingto Bernard Philippe, a senior European Commission official in charge ofnegotiating with Lebanon. At the end of a meeting with Zafer al-Hassan, ahigh-level official from the Lebanese Ministry for Foreign Affairs, MrPhilippe stressed that more talks were needed for farming, emigration andservices.

Implementation of Bulgaria'sEurope Agreement is "progressing according to schedule", delegates agreed,and the EU side - headed by Sipke Brouwer, Director for relations withCentral and East Europe in the European Commission's External PoliticalRelations Directorate-General, DG IA - welcomed the recent economicstabilisation and restructuring programme from the Government, andexpressed hope that it would help sustainable long-term development.Bulgaria's application to join the EU, its accession to the World TradeOrganisation, and its adoption of a national strategy to respond to the1995 White Paper on rules for the Internal Market were all welcomed (andBulgaria also reported on its work to set up a special framework agreementwith the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). There wasalso recognition of Bulgaria's efforts at developing regional cooperation,especially via the Sofia Ministerial meeting in July. Moreover, Bulgaria'splans for enterprise and financial sector restructuring and for cashprivatisation were judged appropriate for "substantial" assistance fromthe EU-coordinated PHARE programme for economic reform. The EUacknowledged the "important steps" taken towards "economically viable"electricity prices as a crucial aspect of energy reform.But it was made clear that any further EU macro-financial support would begiven only if Bulgaria brings the IMF-agreed macro-economic and structuralreform programme back on track. There is a need for more agriculturalreform, too, the EU side pointed out firmly, with emphasis on new rules onland ownership and market liberalisation. Bulgaria's recent request forfood aid to overcome a short-term cereal supply imbalance will be assessedin the light of how many concrete steps Bulgaria shows it is ready to makein that direction - particularly since the EU has already agreed tofacilitate planting by private farmers for the 1997 harvest.During the meeting - where the Bulgarian delegation was led by Emil Valev,Director of European Integration, and Peter Stefanov, the Deputy Ministerof Trade - most of the outstanding trade issues were resolved, but thereremains much to be done to meet Bulgaria's desire for greater freedom ofmovement for workers. The EU also stressed the need to keep to schedulefor bringing in - and for giving real effect to - legislativeapproximation, particularly in respect of competition, certification andstandards. Another urgent need, the EU side said, is for a civil servicelaw to promote a stable and professional public administration. And on thesore point of visas, the current aim is to develop PHARE programmes thatwill "create the conditions for a reconsideration by the EU of its visapolicy".Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EU/EAST EUROPE: EU LOOKS AT ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION WITH CEECSfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe(CEECs) is not only delivering a plethora of headlines on the politicalrelations between the EU and its candidates. It is also bringing thesecountries ever closer to EU operating methods, through a series of lessspectacular but nevertheless influential mechanisms. The meeting of EU andCEEC Internal Market Ministers in Luxembourg on October 25 was scheduledto look at one of the latest moves in these "back office" developments -what goes under the prosaic title of administrative cooperation. What itcomes down to is trying to ensure that all the CEEC rule changes result innew conditions on the ground as well as in their statute books, so that agenuine Single Market will be brought into being with enlargement.Administrative cooperation has already been a permanent feature ofrelations between existing EU Member States for years - based on theknowledge that no Single Market will work at all in practice withoutconstant common efforts to avert problems and prevent the emergence oflatent protectionism masquerading as national safeguard measures. BetweenMember States, regular meetings of officials at all levels and across allInternal Market sectors has made it possible to deal with potentialproblems early, before they become serious obstacles to free movement -and at the same time mutual confidence has been built.These existing mechanisms within the EU include the system of priornotification of new national measures of a technical nature (set up byDirective 83/189) and the related procedures for assessing derogationsfrom rules on free movement of goods, which will come into effect from thebeginning of 1997 (under Decision 3052/95), and a new procedure forensuring transparency of technical standards in the framework of theinformation society. They also include networks created, in line with anumber of Council Resolutions over the last two years, to establishnational contact points and information on national administrativestructures - aimed both at increasing cooperation between Member Statesand at helping companies to understand their rights for cross-borderoperation in the Single Market. And they include the programmes such asKarolus, Mattheus and Mattheus Tax for exchanges between Member States ofofficials working in customs and taxation.When CEECs join the EU, their officials too will have to play an activepart in these networks. To start preparations for that time - andparticularly since few East European officials have much experience ofmany of the market economy mechanisms which are at the heart of a SingleEuropean Market - the European Commission has made a number of specificsuggestions. Bringing CEEC officials progressively into the loop will getthem ready to work fully with their new colleagues after accession, andwill in the meantime also provide them with a lot of technical help inresolving some of the problems that their own national legislativeadaptations are presenting.Already the TAIEX office in Brussels provides the CEECs with technicalassistance and access to expertise - including short visits, contacts withEU Member State experts, and seminars. The Commission is also suggestingsetting up some ad hoc groups of EU and CEEC officials and experts inspecific domains - such as DG XVII is now doing for gas, where each MemberState has been asked to nominate one official and one industry expert. Andit recommends that specific meetings - such as DG XVII (again) organisedon energy matters at Director-General level in March - can be helpful.What the Commission is seeking from all the Internal Market Ministers isguidance on what they would themselves find most useful.Treading carefully.The Commission is conscious of the need for caution in such a process.Some of the EU mechanisms for administrative cooperation also have adecision-making (and sometimes even a legislative) role, and it would notbe appropriate for officials from non-Member States to take part, even asobservers - and there was some initial resistance from Member States tothe idea of premature cooperation. But the Commission, in its 1995 WhitePaper on integrating the East Europeans into the Internal Market, alreadyannounced its intention of suggesting some methods in which CEEC officialsmight gain a better understanding of the operation of the Single Market.Prior to the Council, Presidency sources downplayed the significance ofMember State resistance, suggesting it was based on a misunderstandingthat exaggerated the size and speed of the steps now under discussion.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EU/ZAIRE/RWANDA: EU REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR POLITICAL SOLUTION TO CONFLICTfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169EU Development Commissioner Jo_o de Deus Pinheiro and members of theCouncil's Africa Working group have thrown their support behind newefforts to calm tensions at the border between Zaire and Rwanda thatobservers fear could escalate into an all-out conflict.

Under the Commission proposal the guarantee would beraised from 30 to 100% A few months ago, the guarantee was suspended for"sensitive" goods, which are subject to high duties and taxes and are thusa favourite target for fraudulent activities. The matter was expected tobe considered by the October 25 Internal Market Council. In view of theproposed increase, EuroCommerce, which represents the EU's commercialsector, has already voiced its firm opposition to a plan, saying it isunwarranted. The association reckons that the low level of duties andtaxes to be paid for non-sensitive goods act as a disincentive to fraud.EuroCommerce is worried about the harmful consequences for the economicoperators involved. During a public hearing held by the EuropeanParliament's Committee of Inquiry, Community transport operators alsostressed what a heavy burden they would have to support as a result ofincreased guarantees. They are calling for more sharing ofresponsibilities between the different agents in the transit chain.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996AUDIOVISUAL POLICY: PARLIAMENT INDICATES SUPPORT FOR GUARANTEE FUNDfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169"The Americans have managed to inculcate the entire world with theirvalues. Europeans must use their film industry to defend and promote theideals of the European Community", declared French MEP ArmelleGuinebertire (UFE) in support of the creation of a European GuaranteeFund for audiovisual production during a debate in the EuropeanParliament's plenary session. In a report adopted by the Parliament onOctober 22, Mr Guinebertire issued a moving plea for a full-scaleEuropean response to American domination of the cinema. "A European filmindustry must have resources at its disposal", she said, calling theGuarantee Fund the answer to both a cultural and an economic need.Amendments to the Commission's proposal were nonetheless numerous andsupported special provisions for productions in less widely-spokenlanguages.The draft Decision establishing a Guarantee Fund for the audiovisualindustry was unveiled on November 14, 1995. Under the proposed system,banks would be granted guarantees for a portion of the loans they make tofilm producers or distributors. The European Union's contribution would beECU 90 million, this amount to be matched by the private sector and otherpublic bodies. This Fund would be administered by the European InvestmentFund (EIF). It will not be easy to put into practice, given thereservations expressed by the Council of Ministers, which must reach aunanimous decision for the proposal to go ahead. Furthermore, as MrsGuinebertire's report points out, the unresolved technical and financialissues shed doubt on the firmness of the Member States' political will toset up a Guarantee Fund of this kind. In any case, the Parliament plays amerely advisory role on this proposal, which based on Article 130 of theTreaty.Specific strategy for SMEs.The Audiovisual Guarantee Fund would have to take into account the demandsof the market, production issues and television rights, which do notconcern the cinema directly, but merit more consideration, theParliamentary report noted. Criteria for eligibility would give specialtreatment to small countries, those with a less widely-spoken language andsmaller firms. The MEPs were also sceptical about the choice of the EIF tomanage the Fund. Given the specific features of this sector and the legaland financial implications of the guarantees to be provided, an ad hocstructure would have to be set up within the EIF to represent the EuropeanUnion's funds. However, it would be assisted by a group of professionalexperts from the film industry and the world of banking, as the"particular nature of the audiovisual sector rules out the directapplication of the EIF's own criteria", according to the report.Mrs Guinebertire further recommended a pilot period of five years, duringwhich the Fund's impact on the European audiovisual sector could beassessed. Once its usefulness had been demonstrated, the Union could beginto think about laying the legal foundations for its future activities.Commission reaction.Marcelino Oreja, the European Commissioner for the Audiovisual portfolio,declared that he hoped the Council of Ministers will adopt the proposalfor setting up the Fund at its December 16 session on audiovisual affairs.He indicated willingness to incorporate 21 of the Parliament's amendments,in particular one emphasising the difficulties faced by countries withlesser-used languages. He also supports some other amendments inprinciple, including the one proposing an ad hoc structure whereinindustry professionals would be represented to administer the Fund, andanother in favour of support for SMEs and small-scale projects. However,Mr Oreja opposes the idea of setting up the Fund for a provisional periodof five years during which its impact on the European film industry couldbe assessed.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996CULTURE: PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR INCREASE IN CREDITS FOR ARIANEfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The financial package provided for the Ariane programme to promote booksand reading is too small, according to the European Parliament. On secondreading of a proposal on this cultural programme, the MEPs adopted areport by Nana Mouskouri (EPP, Greece) during their October 22 plenarysession in Strasbourg.Ariane is a programme of support for books and reading. First proposed inNovember 1994 (COM(94)356), it is based on Article 128 of the Treaty(requiring the Council of Ministers to take a unanimous decision). TheParliament gave its Opinion on first reading in April 1995 and the Counciladopted its common position in July. As Mrs Mouskouri pointed out, thiscommon position changed four points of the initial proposal:- The length of the programme was reduced from five years (1996-2000) totwo years (1994-1998), with the option of launching another programmeafter an assessment of the first one, to which the rapporteur had noobjections. Pilot projects in the areas covered by Ariane had a budget ofECU 2.5 million in 1996; this was the figure advanced by the Commissionfor the first year of the programme.- The budget was decreased from ECU 34 million over five years to ECUseven million over two years. The Council adopted the proposals containedin the revised version of the Commission's budget. This is unacceptable,in the Parliament's view, if the Union wants to have a real impact on thecurrent situation. The Parliamentary report thus proposed a budget of ECU10.5 million.- While the Commission proposed setting up an Advisory Committee toadminister the programme, the Council preferred a joint Advisory andManagement Committee. The Parliament is in favour of an Advisory Committeeas initially proposed.- The original proposal provided for three main actions, but the Councilestablished six priority measures. Mrs Mouskouri believes this approachprovides a clearer vision of the scope of application of the programme,but she emphasised promotion of reading via translation of works writtenin the Union's lesser-used languages.Marcelino Oreja, the European Commissioner responsible for CulturalAffairs, assured the Parliament that the Commission is particularlysensitive to arguments concerning the need to defend minority languages,but said he could not agree to the funding increase given budgetaryconstraints.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996MAD COW DISEASE: MIXED SIGNALS FROM COMMISSION ON "PROVEN" BSE/CJD LINKfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The European Commission sent out mixed signals on October 24 to news thatUK scientists may have proved a direct link between bovine spongiformencephalopathy (BSE) and a new variant of the human brain conditionCreutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (dubbed by experts "vCJD"). Speaking at a pressconference in Paris, EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said he thoughtin the light of the new findings, the European Union ought to bring instricter legislation on consumption of animal offal, and stressed that theUK authorities should now proceed with the planned targeted cull of some150,000 cattle, suspended by the Major Government in mid-September.Meanwhile back in Brussels, a Fischler aide spoke of both positive andnegative aspects of the scientific discovery. The negative side, he said,was the obvious public health risk, now shown to be very real, that eatersof infected beef tissue may have contracted brain disease. The positiveelement consisted in the fact that the new discovery would make it easierto trace animals incubating the disease, he stressed. Meanwhile, inStrasbourg, Members of the European Parliament voted to extend the mandateof the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE.BSE and vCJD prions "match".The British scientific journal Nature carried a report on October 23 of anew technique developed by Dr John Collinge and his colleagues in thePrion disease Group at Imperial College School of Medicine, London, fortracing the "molecular marker" of the prion protein which causes the braintissue of sufferers to degenerate into a spongy mass. "The biochemicalsignature of prions in patients who died from new variant CJD matches thatof prions in mice and macaque monkeys experimentally infected with BSE,but differs from that of prions in human patients with acquired orsporadic CJD", says the Nature report. This finding "greatly strengthensthe conclusion that vCJD is a consequence of the BSE epidemic in Britishcattle", it goes on. The new technique is likely to form the basis of arapid diagnostic test for spongiform encephalopathies, say the experts.Further safety precautions?Reacting to the news, a European Commission spokesman stressed that the EUexecutive had been proceeding on the assumption of a BSE/CJD link for sometime and that all necessary measures to protect the public were already inplace. The new study would go to the EU scientific committees forexamination, and any necessary new proposals would be made on the basis oftheir recommendations, the spokesman explained. However, from Paris, FranzFischler indicated to the press that he would be re-tabling to the FarmCouncil on October 28 proposals to completely exclude from the food chainthose cattle and sheep tissues found most likely to transmit the BSE agent.Harmonisation needed.The legal situation regarding use of brain, eyes, spinal cord, nervoustissues, spleen and lymph glands (shown to be capable of transmitting thefatal prions) from cattle and sheep varies across the European Union. Theonly EU-wide statute on the subject relates to UK bovine tissues, whichare banned from export. Also, ruminant waste may not be fed to cattle andsheep, but does constitute an important ingredient in the meat and bonemeal still fed to pigs, chickens and other farm animals. The Frenchauthorities paved the way towards tighter rules in June, when they bannedfrom both human foodstuffs and all animal feeds the tissues in question,from cattle aged over 6 months and sheep and goats aged over one year.Ireland and the UK have brought in similar regulations. Mr Fischlerbelieves Member States' rules should now be harmonised on the Frenchmodel. However, a proposal to that effect he tabled to the Council in Julymet with little enthusiasm from the EU Standing Veterinary Committee.The French Agriculture Ministry gave a favourable reaction on October 25to an announcement by the Bonn authorities of a new national legislativeBill that would, in line with French law, ban all imports from France ofthe sensitive tissues. The Ministry welcomed the move, as likely to fosterEU-wide harmonisation of measures. The German Government has since Julymaintained a unilateral ban on all products containing beef tissues fromthe UK and Switzerland, the two main centres of the BSE epidemic in Europe.Inquiry extended.Meanwhile the European Parliament voted in plenary session on October 24to extend the mandate of its Temporary Committee of Inquiry (TCI) into BSEfor another three months. The nineteen MEPs who have been interviewingCommission staff, government officials and scientific experts since earlySeptember feel they need more time to get to the bottom of all theevidence, some of which seems to point to an early cover-up of the dangersof "mad cow disease" for public health. The TCI will now produce itsreport sometime in late February.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996FISHERIES: PROCESSORS CALL FOR LIFTING OF FISH IMPORT TARIFFSfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The European Union's tariffs on fish imports have been sharply criticisedin a report by the European Fish Processors Association (AIPCEE) whichargues that they raise prices to the detriment of the consumer. The report- which calls for an end to import restrictions by quantity or by price -says the EU now depends on imports from third countries for half its fishconsumption.Tariffs harming EU industry's competitiveness.European Commission sources tried to dismiss the report as irrelevant andone-sided, but the AIPCEE, which represents the fish processing industryin twelve EU Member States, insists that the policy implications areclear. The report says that tariffs levied on imports harm thecompetitiveness of the EU processing industry on the international marketagainst those processors from countries where tariffs are negligible,especially on finished products. "The outcome of the regime can only be toraise prices to the detriment of the consumer, the processing industry andultimately to the fishermen themselves through the destruction of markets."Around 50% of total imports of fish and fishery products from thirdcountries are covered by imports of cod, saithe, redfish, haddock, hakeand Alaska pollack, the report says. "The supply of the EU market withthese species has to be safeguarded up to 83% by imports from thirdcountries like Norway, Russia, Iceland, Poland and Argentina." This meansthat only 17% of total white fish supply can be met by the EU's own fleet.The report argues that with demand outstripping supply, imports of thesestocks do not harm the EU's own fishermen. "Therefore, there is no purposein restricting imports by quantity or by price when supplies are notavailable from EU fishermen."The AIPCEE estimates that the supply of EU fish products amounted to 8.5million tonnes in 1995, up 29% from 6.6 million tonnes in 1986. Over thesame period, imports from third countries nearly doubled from 2.7 milliontonnes to 5.5 million tonnes in 1995. By contrast, exports from the EU tothird countries grew only from 1.3 million tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes."The continuous trend towards import dependence needs to be recognised ina further liberalisation of the conditions under which such imports fromthird countries are allowed", the report says.The report offers four policy recommendations for the European Commissionand the EU's Council of Ministers:- decisions on tariff suspensions should be taken sufficiently in advanceto give EU enterprises time to plan their forward purchases and avoidunnecessary costs for storage and financing;- there should be duty free access to raw material especially whenimportant third countries are granted duty free access to the EU forprocessed fish products;- further reductions should be made in import duties for species whichcannot be supplied in sufficient quantities from EU catches: such reducedduty imports should extend not only to frozen raw material, but also tofresh fish necessary for the processing industry;- autonomous tariff quotas should be converted for certain species intogeneral tariff suspensions.More generally, the AIPCEE makes four suggestions to contribute towardsimproving supplies for domestic fisheries:- using size control to produce more selective catches: cod, saithe andhaddock catches are generally too small and of low marketing standards;- improving quota management so that supplies are available on a reliableand continuous basis for the filleting industry: the report says theprocessing industry cannot cope with the successive gluts caused byerratic landing patterns of EU catches;- the plans to cut fishing capacity should be based on long-term analysesof the conditions necessary for sustainable fishing effort;- closer cooperation between EU fishermen and the processing industry onmeasures to improve domestic supply, based on the long-term sustainableavailability of fish at world market prices.Last March, the association called for the lifting of the Commission'splans for fish inspection charges. It listed four reasons for rejectingthe plans: the levy would act as a tax on the fish consumer, and demandwould fall further if prices rose; fish is very safe and becomesunpalatable before it becomes unsafe, making the checks an unnecessarybureaucratic procedure; the need for checks can only actually be judged bylocal inspectors after individual operations; and it would be impossibleto assess what a standard charge should be when the cost is not known."The White Fish Study 1996" is available upon request from the AIPCEE, Avede Roodebeek 30, 1030 Brussels, Belgium.

The seminar, organised by the Commission and theFisheries Committee of the European Parliament, is part of theCommission's effort to liaise with fisheries officials and hammer out theserious problems facing the European Union's fisheries sector.

Rumours about the reportsuggest that it may reveal continuing disparities in certain regions, butCommission officials are refusing to confirm or deny any speculation.The structure of the Cohesion Report can, however, be revealed. There willbe four sections dealing with different aspects of regional policy. Thefirst will be an overview of social and economic cohesion within the EU,showing past trends and developments. Then there will be a section dealingwith the individual efforts by the EU Member States to influence cohesionwithin their territories. The third part will be an examination of theEU's various complementary polices which have had an effect on theregions, like the Common Agricultural Policy, telecommunications, businessnetworks and social policy. And the final part will concern the effects ofthe EU's Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund on the regions.The impact of the report will be felt far beyond the Commission's regionalpolicies. The Commission is able to concede that the Cohesion Report willprovide a springboard to the 1999 review of the Structural Funds. And anyanalysis of the link between the EU's efforts and social and economiccohesion will be studied closely by the aspiring EU candidates in Centraland Eastern Europe (CEECs) hoping to gauge future EU regional policy.The current Structural Funds have a total budget of ECU 157 billion forthe 1994 to 1999 period, and Mrs Wulf-Mathies has suggested maintainingthe overall criteria for the package. This will mean the Structural Fundbudget would remain at the current 0.46% of the EU's gross domesticproduct, and the overall figure for the 2000 to 2006 period would be aboutECU 260 billion. But there is scepticism about keeping other aspects ofthe current Structural Funds. For example, the Cohesion Fund, whichprovides Funds for Member States with less than 90% of the EU's averagegross national product could be dominated by the CEECs if they join. Thesame goes for the current criteria for Objective 1 of the StructuralFunds, which goes to the EU's poorest regions, whose gross domesticproduct is 75% or less that the EU average.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996AGRICULTURE: 1995 EU FARM SPENDING DOWN AS PERCENTAGE OF GDPfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169Total expenditure under the Guarantee Section of the European AgriculturalGuidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) for 1995 rose to ECU 34,503 million,from the ECU 32,970 million disbursed in 1994. However, this figurerepresents a lower percentage of both the total EU Budget (51.7%, comparedwith 55% in 1994) and total Community Gross Domestic Product (0.53%, downfrom 0.58% in 1994). These facts emerge from the 25th EAGGF GuaranteeSection report*, newly approved by the European Commission. The report'sauthors point out that the 1995 expenditure figures are inflated by theinclusion for the first time of the three new Member States -Austria,Finland and Sweden - and by the fact that direct aid to farmers introducedunder the 1992 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was alsostepped up during the year.Expenditure well inside guideline.The final total of appropriations allocated to the EAGGF Guarantee Sectionin 1995, i.e. the original 1995 Budget, the Supplementary and AmendingBudget (SAB), letter of amendment, transfers and provisionalappropriations, totalled ECU 36,849.6 million (not including the monetaryreserve of ECU 500 million) plus automatic carry-overs amounting to ECU64.3 million. During the 1995 financial year, the agricultural guideline,which sets a ceiling on Guarantee Section spending, was fixed at ECU37,944 million, somewhat higher than the 1994 financial year (ECU 36,465).In the event, total expenditure came to ECU just 34,503 million. Nonon-automatic carry-overs were made from the 1994 Budget to that of 1995and there was therefore no expenditure under that heading. The trend inexpenditure since 1988 is shown below in Graph 1a. Graph 1b shows EAGGFGuarantee Section expenditure within the EU's General Budget.Expenditure breakdown.Looking at the different categories of spending, the figures show thatspending on export refunds continued to decline, falling from ECU 8,161million in 1994 to ECU 7,802 million in 1995. It thus now accounts foronly 22.6% of total EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure. Meanwhile,intervention spending in 1995 came to ECU 26,206 million, mainlyconsisting of storage aid and price compensatory aid (production,processing and marketing aid). As a result of a return to more balancedmarkets, expenditure on storage fell very steeply from ECU 5,386 millionin 1993 to ECU 1,070 million in 1994, and then again to ECU 339 million in1995. On the other hand, price compensatory aid was up (from ECU 24,490million in 1995 as compared with ECU 21,339 million in 1994). This was dueto the major expansion of production aid schemes (acreage payments,set-aside, suckler-cow premiums and premiums for male bovine animals)introduced as part of the 1992 reform of the CAP.Arable aid dominant.Comparing product sectors, arable crops, a heading which now subsumes fourformer expenditure headings (cereals, oilseeds, protein plants andset-aside), accounted for 43.5% of overall spending. This sector wasfollowed by milk products (11.7% ) and beef and veal (11.7%). (See Graph2a below.)France the chief beneficiary.Among the Member States, France is still the main recipient of GuaranteeSection expenditure at ECU 8,377 million - absorbing some 24% of overallspending. Next, at some distance, come Germany (ECU 5,380 million), Spain(ECU 4,562 million) and Italy (ECU 3,364 million) (see Graph 2b). In theirfirst year following accession, Austria received ECU 86 million, FinlandECU 62 million and Sweden ECU 75 million.Lengthy clearance of accounts process.One of the main features of the clearance of accounts procedure, thereport explains, is that it enables the Commission to recover from theMember States sums unduly paid in the application of the regulations onthe Common Agricultural Policy. After lengthy dialogue and conciliationstages with the Member States in question, decisions leading to recoveryare taken by the Commission. Following this path, clearance of theaccounts for 1991 was only adopted by the Commission on 21 December 1994,so that its consequences apply in the 1995 financial year. The sumrecovered amounted to ECU 1,518.3 million out of expenditure totalling ECU30,332 million, the report details.Conciliation body begins work.During 1995, under the accounts clearance procedure for 1992, a proposalwas put to the Commission for the recovery of ECU 1,026.5 million out of atotal of ECU 32,083 million. The Commission's final decision in February1996 reduced the amount to be recovered to ECU 997.5 million. 1995 wasalso the year in which the conciliation body began its work, whichinvolves observations on the clearance of the 1992 accounts. This led to aseries of new, lengthy preventive measures on the part of the CommissionEAGGF accounts clearance departments following upon the conciliationprocedure. At the same time, preparation of the accounts clearanceprocedure relating to the 1993 financial year continued to the stage ofdialogue with the Member States, says the EAGGF report.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996ENVIRONMENT: "NEW" PROPOSALS FOR ENFORCING LEGISLATIONfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169On October 22, the European Commission presented a three-point programmefor improving implementation of EU environmental legislation. This is nota superfluous initiative: in 1995, the Commission registered 265 suspectedbreaches of environmental Directives, representing no less than 20% of allinfringements against Community law. This is why, according to theCommission, "original proposals" must be now considered. However, itremains to be seen whether this "Communication on the implementation of EUenvironmental law" - which only sets out general guidelines - will haveany genuine effect as it does not contain any binding measures. It will atleast have the merit of launching a wide-ranging debate on the issue.As Ritt Bjerregaard, the Environment Commissioner, recalled, "improvingimplementation of EU environmental law is not just a question of takingMember States to Court". "It is neither possible nor practical for all thelegal actions that could arise from lack of compliance with Communityrules to be channelled through one enforcing authority, the Commission andone court of law, the Court of Justice", the Commission explains. Recourseto Articles 169 and 171 of the Treaty appears insufficient but will remaincomplementary to any new measures envisaged.According to the Communication, the following three initiatives are mostapt to effectively improve the implementation of EU environmentallegislation "because control of implementation begins at home, in theMember States":* the establishment of guidelines to assist the Member States in theirenvironmental inspections;* the establishment of a procedure within the Member States to receive andexamine complaints from the public about the implementation of Communityenvironmental law;* examination by the Commission of the question of guaranteed basic accessfor representative organisations to the national jurisdictions, "inkeeping with the principle of subsidiarity" (some Member States alreadyhave an Ombudsman system, while others have no provision). This is themost controversial issue. Following the adoption of the Communication, oneCommission official explained "we have no wish to create new mechanismswhere provisions already exist"."The solutions we are advocating would enable non-governmentalorganisations to appeal to the courts", he explained, imparting theCommission's wish for decisions to be taken at the most local levelpossible.On the Community level the Commission may, in future proposals (and whenrevision existing Directives), introduce a specific provision requiringthe Member States to provide sanctions in national legislation for failureto respect EU environmental law. These penal, administrative and othersanctions may for example take the form of withdrawing operating licencesfrom such factories as fail to respect a Directive.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT VOTES ON SAFETY OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND SHIPS.from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169Gathered in plenary session in Strasbourg between October 21 and 25, MEPsadopted two reports concerning transport.

To the Commission'sdismay, Sweden is still refusing to set a date for the end of a derogationallowing it, along with Denmark and Finland, to impose stricter limits onpurchases of alcoholic beverages by citizens travelling within theEuropean Union than those provided for in Community legislation. MarioMonti, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Customs andTaxation, held another round of talks with the Finance Ministers of thethree Nordic countries in Strasbourg on October 23. He said that heremained flexible as to the date when the exemption would end, but that hewanted this date, once specified, to be firm (see European Report N  s2167). If no agreement can be reached, the European Court of Justice willbe responsible for putting an end to the derogation, the Commission warnedfollowing the meeting.Denmark and Finland are reportedly willing to give up their special regimein 2004. The Commissioner feels, however, that five and half years issufficient time for these countries to adjust. He said following themeeting that he would suggest that the Commission set a deadline of June30, 2002. The Commission will present a proposal to this effect veryshortly, so that the Finance Ministers will have time to examine it beforethe end of the year. Unanimous agreement is required to extend theseexemptions beyond 1999, the date initially specified by the Commission.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO CREATE ENERGY ADVISORY COMMITTEEfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The European Commission is likely to adopt by early November a Decision tocreate an Energy Advisory Committee, as called for in its December 1995Energy Policy White Paper, as part of an effort to establish an informalbut institutionalised dialogue with the energy sector and ensure itssupport when new areas of action in the energy field are chosen. ThisCommittee will be expected to assist in identifying energy policy areaswhere Commission action is deemed to be necessary, provide advice on themeans needed to implement Commission proposals and give opinions on theseproposals before they are finalised.The Committee is to be composed of 31 representatives of energy producers,distributors, consumers, unions, and associations dealing with theprotection of the environment.

The Ministers held a debate on transparencyof rules covering information society services. Talks about administrativecooperation, in particular, were held with representatives of associatecountries from Central and Eastern Europe (see separate article). AsEuropean Report was going to press, the Council was on the verge ofpassing a Resolution on streamlining customs procedures and giving theEuropean Commission permission to negotiate a Customs CooperationAgreement with Norway.Toeing the line.Unless EU countries show a bit more determination in trying to applymutually-agreed rules, the Single Market will not be able to produce theanticipated benefits in terms of jobs, economic growth andcompetitiveness. This is the gist of the message that the Commissioner forthe Internal Market had to give to Ministers. In spite of the appeal madeat the EU Summit in Florence last June and the letter Mr Monti sent toeach Member State, there is little improvement to report in the way theMember States are transposing and applying Internal Market Directives: theoverall rate of transposition for all Member States is virtually the sameas that reported at the previous Internal Market Council in May (93.3% inthe case of Directives reflecting the 219 measures the 1985 White Paperthought necessary for completing the Single Market, and 90.9% for the1,140 Directives relating to the Internal Market).In the context of Single Market legislation as a whole, the Commission hasinstituted 11 proceedings against Member States in the EU Court ofJustice. Denmark and the Netherlands are the two most disciplinedcountries in this respect and far outstrip the larger countries. Spain andFrance come eighth and ninth respectively in the class, whereas, Germanyis last but one, the one being Austria. The most problematic sectorscontinue to be public procurement (Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlandsare alone in successfully transposing EU legislation in this area) andinsurance (Spain and Greece are lagging well behind). The Commissionerreported the presentation, in early November, of a CommissionCommunication on the impact and efficiency of the Single Market in theEuropean Union.Mr Monti explained to Ministers the key ideas in the Citizens Firstinitiative due to be launched on November 26 (and not November 20 as wemistakenly reported in our previous issue). The first information guidesfor the general public in Europe will focus on the themes of living,working, studying, training and carrying out research in an other EUcountry. Others due to be published in mid 1997 will cover consumers andthe social dimension of the Single Market. A free phone service will beset up in each country to enable individuals to gain access to the mediafor this large-scale information campaign The Commission also referred tothe progress made with pilot projects initiated under the SLIM programmeon legislative legislation. This matter is due to be given a higherprofile during the November 26 Internal Market Council.Openness in the information society.During the debate on the Commission's proposal for a Communication onregulatory transparency in the Internal Market for information societyservices, France was the only country to bristle at the strategy beingrecommended. Paris argued that the some of the services were treated inthe proposal "like pieces of merchandise". The French representative wasreferring to the Commission's idea of treating on-line services,interactive entertainment services and on-line information services ascoming within the scope of EU legislation on the free movement of goodsand not on telecommunications or the audiovisual sector. (European Reportwill return to this matter in a forthcoming issue.)Other subjects.As the afternoon was drawing to a close, on October 25, Ministers werestill preparing to adopt a Resolution on the simplification andrationalisation of customs rules and procedures. Ministers had alreadyreached an agreement on this matter prior to the Council meeting. Theywere also due to give permission to the Commission to negotiate a customscooperation agreement with Norway, an agreement that would take account oflinks this country has in this sphere with the Nordic EU countries. Theywere also set to adopt without further debate a Regulation for increasingfrom 30 to 100% the guarantee given by transport hauliers fornon-sensitive goods (less exposed to fraud) under the Community transitsystem. This decision gave rise to an agreement on October 23 betweenCOREPER (the Committee of Member States' Permanent Representatives to theEU) and the European Commission (see previous issue of European Report).The agreement nonetheless allows certain exemptions and maintains theguarantee at 30% for transporters above suspicion (established in theMember States where the guarantee is given, frequent users who have alwaysbehaved correctly, etc.).Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996FARM COUNCIL: BEEF DOMINATES AGENDA FOR OCTOBER 28/29 SESSIONfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169EU Agriculture Ministers meeting in Council in Luxembourg on October 28and 29 will return to a subject which has dominated the headlines in oneway or another since March, namely beef. The Farm Council will try toagree on a support package consisting of short-term crisis measures andlonger-term structural adaptations to help the beef sector cope withfalling demand in the wake of the BSE crisis. With a number of MemberStates unwilling to back some of the more far-reaching elements in theEuropean Commission proposals for cutting production volumes, theMinisters are unlikely to reach consensus without burning the customarymidnight oil. However, the financing question may prove to be the biggeststumbling block. The European Parliament has so far refused to considerproposals for slashing cereals aid to pay for beef support, which meansthe Council cannot legally adopt them. Meanwhile, the Commission isinsisting it cannot endorse the necessary ECU 1 billion-plus ofexpenditure without first balancing the books.Commission wants balanced budget.A package of three linked proposals tabled by Farm Commissioner FranzFischler on July 30 calls for reductions in arable aid payments and cutsin investment support to pay for higher beef intervention buying and othershort-term measures designed to absorb surplus EU beef production,estimated at 1.2 million tonnes per year since consumption has fallen inthe wake of the "mad cow" crisis. Parliament used its urgency procedure tovote an Opinion on the first part of the package - the purely beef sectormeasures - on September 20, but refused to do the same for thecontroversial arable aid cuts. The Commissioner has always expressedreluctance to see the three elements split up. If measures costing overECU1 billion are to be agreed, then the Ministers should decide at thesame time where the money is coming from, insisted a Fischler aide.However, a Commission spokesman insisted on October 25 that basicagreement on the medium-term measures - designed to cut back production byslaughtering very young calves, reducing premium rights for farmers andlowering stocking density - would have to be reached before Ministers headfor the airport on October 29 or 30.In fact, Franz Fischler has already given away an important bargainingchip in agreeing to raise the Community beef intervention ceiling from400,000 to 460,000 tonnes for 1996, and endorse public buying-in oflighter cattle ("weanlings") under 300 kilogrammes in weight. Thesedecisions, voted through on a Commission proposal by Ministers at theFisheries Council on October 14, have taken some of the urgency out of theissue, and the Member States' delegations may now be more inclined to holdout for better terms for their farmers in the overall package. The moreintensive farming countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgiumare opposed to moves to lower the regional stocking ceilings used forcalculating eligibility for special beef premium payments to farmers andreduce the stocking levels for eligibility to the "extensificationpremium". The Netherlands and Italy are unwilling to introduce thenew-born calf slaughter option, which they feel will outrage publicopinion, France wants to see premiums payable on suckler cows raised,while Portugal is fighting to maintain the second premium payable on itsolder, extensively-raised, bulls. (see European Report N   2158 for fulldetails of Member States' positions).Problem now less urgent?Meanwhile a report on the beef crisis drafted by experts in theCommission's Directorate-General for Agriculture (DGVI), which was due tobe discussed at the Council, has been held up in the pipeline by EdithCresson, one of France's two Commissioners. The conclusions of the reportbasically state that no further compensation should be paid to EU beeffarmers for losses incurred this year. Total producer losses since thebeef crisis began are put at just over ECU 1.1 billion for 1996. Councilhas already allocated a package of Community money worth ECU 850 million,with provisions for the Member States to match that figure with equalnational funds. Meanwhile some ECU 230 million has been brought forwardfrom the 1997 Budget allocation to pay advance suckler cow premia during1996. This will have the effect of freeing up an equal amount of Communityfunds to help finance beef measures next year. The French authorities arestill pushing however for extra compensation for their beef producers.Exports booming.On October 25 the EU Beef and Veal Management Committee accepted a further31,000 tonnes of prime beef, plus 180 tonnes of weanlings, intointervention, bringing to 396,000 tonnes the total amount of beef carcasesnow in public storage. The Commission spokesman stressed that 1996intervention would not now approach the 720,000 tonnes foreseen in earlypessimistic scenarios at the height of the crisis. Exports from the Unionare now running well over 22,000 tonnes per week and some 100,000 tonnesahead of schedule for the year 1996/97, as foreign demand has picked upagain. However, the GATT Agreement on Agriculture limit on export ofsubsidised EU beef is likely to be reached before June 1997, when theproblem will flare up again, he warned.Identification and labelling.The Council will also register its initial reaction to Commissionproposals for cattle identification and beef labelling rules. The idea isthat all EU cattle should be identified by means of an eartag and personalpassport. As regards labelling, individual producers and organisationswould be authorised to put in place voluntary schemes for providing thecustomer with detailed information on their beef products. The draftRegulation lays down what information may appear on a label (for detailssee European Report N   2163), and lays down rules for verifying the truthof any claims made. The Commission hopes this scheme will be up andrunning by January 1997, but the European Parliament will need to registerits Opinion before the Council can go ahead and adopt the legislation.Quickfire offals proposal?Franz Fischler has also announced he will be tabling proposals banning alldesignated "sensitive tissues" from cattle and sheep from the human-animalfood chain (see separate article on mad cow disease).Inspection Office.Under the final main point on the Council agenda, the Ministers will lookat the long-standing proposal to set up an EU Veterinary and PhytosanitaryInspection Office in Ireland. The proposals call for an independent agencyto take over part of the tasks currently being carried out by the Officeof Veterinary and Phytosanitary Inspection and Control (OVPIC) under theauspices of the Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture. TheCouncil has been asked to approve changes to the legal structure of thisnew body in order to ensure its effectiveness and speed of action. Anadvance staff has already set up shop in the town of Grange in CountyMeath as the site of the new Agency, but disagreements are still ragingover the status of the office, the powers to be accorded to its staff,numbers of new veterinary personnel to be hired, and the financing for theexpanded operation. Germany believes the Agency should remain a smalloperation, financed entirely from the Community Budget, rather thanobtaining its own finances from licence fees on products authorised.Other business.A number of Member States have tabled points they wish to discuss underany other business:- Austria is concerned about subsidised cattle exports from Switzerland,which are making life hard for Austrian exporters of calves to Italy;- the Spanish and Portuguese delegations are demanding that the Commissiondraft a "reflexion paper" for wide discussion before finalising itsupcoming proposals for reform of the olive oil sector;- France and Greece want to see the provisions for grubbing-up of apple,pear and nectarine orchards agreed under the 1996/97 price packageimplemented promptly;- the UK and the Netherlands want to keep up the pressure forthoroughgoing implementation of Directive 95/29/EC, safeguarding thewelfare of animals in transit, particularly as regards mandatory stagingposts and vehicle capacity;- the Greeks want to discuss the issue of foot-and-mouth disease in Turkey;- Portugal intends to bring to the fore the plight of farming and forestryin arid regions;- the Swedish delegation wants to discuss the upcoming World Food Summit,scheduled for November 13-17, urging that further CAP reforms wouldfacilitate cheaper worldwide provision of food.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996AMERICAN SURVEY ON FACTORS AFFECTING EUROPEAN BUSINESS FORTUNESfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169Switzerland, Ireland and the Netherlands are the European countries ratedas most favourable for business, according to a survey conducted by theEuropean Council of Chambers of Commerce (ECACC*). The ECACC members wereinvited to assess factors likely to affect the development of business in23 European countries and the Mediterranean basin. The factors includegovernment policies, infrastructure, employment and social securitylegislation, tax systems, and the quality of life. Countries with the mostunfavourable "climates" in this respect are Greece, Bulgaria, Poland, theSlovak Republic and Romania. ECACC members were also questioned about themedium-term (the next five years) prospects: the UK, Belgium, Switzerland,Italy and Germany are fairly pessimistic, believing that the economicclimate is set to get worse.Economic factors, including government incentives, banking systems, taxlevels and rates, social security costs, employee healthcare costs,foreign exchange rate stability and environmental policy, were mostfavourable in Luxembourg, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands andAustria, while they were rated as unfavourable in Poland, Hungary,Belgium, Romania and France. As for workforce-related issues, includingworker quality, labour costs, training and retraining, labour unions andworker involvement, Ireland, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Norway and Turkey wererated highest in terms of the most favourable business environment, andBelgium, France, Germany, Romania and Portugal came in lowest.* Set up in 1963, ECACC represents American Chambers of Commerce in 21countries, from Sweden to Israel and from Russia to Portugal.

Thisagreement is the first concerning the development of new jobs signed bysocial partners within the framework of a sectorial dialogue. The EuropeanCommissioner for Social Affairs, Padraig Flynn, described the agreement as"an innovative and realistic action marking an important step in theshared work of the social partners". The memorandum asks publicauthorities to create the conditions necessary for the exploitation ofthese new sources of jobs, the cost of which is often too high forindividuals. The social partners have suggested that the Member Statesintroduce subsidies to develop demand on the part of individuals anddiscourage work "off the books". Other mechanisms could include theintroduction of tax incentives and a reduction of the VAT rate on cleaningservices.

It comes as no surprise that the proposalson goods haulage by road presented by the Union of Industrial andEmployers' Confederations of Europe in Brussels on October 22 divergedwidely from the strategy pursued by the European Commission over the pastfew months. Concerned about European industry's ability to compete on theNorth American and Japanese markets, UNICE claimed that other modes oftransport are not competitive enough to handle the additional freight thatwould be shifted off the roads to rail, inland waterways or maritimecabotage. "European companies, on average, pay 16% more than those in theUnited States and 21% more than in Japan for transport and logisticsservices", says UNICE to justify its opposition to any increase in roadtaxes. The message is clear: road transport is the only mode that worksefficiently, and imposing higher taxes on it will make it more difficultfor European firms to compete and could lead to company transfers and joblosses.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996NEW CEEP SECRETARY-GENERAL APPOINTED.from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The General Assembly of the European Centre of Enterprises with PublicParticipation (CEEP) has appointed Jytte Fredensborg to becomeSecretary-General of the public enterprises' lobby group.

Spain would thereforeundertake to completely liberalise its telecommunications industry(services and infrastructure) by January 1, 1998. An EU-wide telecomsderegulation agreement, which hinges on the Spanish decision, would helpgive a fillip to the stalled World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks on theworldwide deregulation of telecommunications services, stresses theEuropean Commission.Exemptions.Spain has already made clear its intention not to use the five-yeartransitional period in full, but it is still seeking a 22-month stay ofgrace. This would mean that not before October 1999, the date when the newlegislation on licences would be introduced, would Madrid be required togrant permits to other vocal telephony operators. Commissioner Van Miertis apparently ready to grant Spain extra time to introduce the licensinglegislation, but no longer than six months. This would mean that no laterthan June 30, 1998, the Spanish telecoms market would be opened up tocompetition. Spain is the only Member State not to formally seek a delayfor opening up the sector to competition. Ireland, Portugal, Luxembourgand Greece also enjoy this possibility and have made requests along theselines (see table below).The Commission stresses that Telefonica, the operator with monopolycontrol over the basic vocal telephony service in Spain, is prepared toaccept liberalisation by January 1, 1998. Community sources also indicatethat the go-ahead for the merger between Telefonica and Unisource will benot be given until Spain has officially confirmed the timetable beingsought. Unisource is jointly owned by operators from Sweden (Telia AB),the Netherlands (PTT Telecom) and Switzerland (Sweizerische PTT-Betriebe).Karel Van Miert cites several reasons for minimising the periods of timecovered by the exemptions. Under the terms of EU Directives regulating theliberalisation process, transitional periods of this kind may be grantedonly in the light of the sophistication of the networks. Further, theCouncil of Ministers and the European Council have often stressed theimportance of a swift liberalisation process, in the interests of economicgrowth and the promotion of the information society. It is also importantfor the countries involved to become integrated as soon as possible intothe European telecoms market and thus be in a position to benefit frominvestment and corresponding services.WTO talks.The Commission believes the EU-wide telecoms deregulation process willalso make a major impact on the WTO talks on telecommunications. The EUdeadline has to be as close as possible to 1998 in the Member States, as1998 is also the target date set for liberalisation worldwide.The WTO talks are due to end on February 15, 1997. The 53 countries takingpart in the talks should have reached an agreement last April 30, but atthe eleventh hour, the US decided to harden its position and thusundermined the deal. The parties therefore gave themselves another nineand a half months. The next key stage will unfold from December 9 to 13 inSingapore, during the WTO Ministerial-level conference. In the meantime, ahigh-level meeting is scheduled for November 14, after the US Presidentialelections.Sir Leon Brittan, European Commissioner with the External Trade portfolio,is hoping to use the intervening period to put the final touches toEurope's improved offer to Geneva, with a firm commitment from Spain: thiscountry assumes particular importance in the WTO talks, given the size ofits domestic market and the inroads made by Telefonica in several LatinAmerican countries. Spain is the only country to be expressing reluctance,according to a sources closely involved with the matter. Belgium, France,Greece and Portugal also seemed disinclined, last March, to open up theirmarkets, but their doubts have now been dispelled, apparently.Reaction from Madrid.In a communique published on October 24, the Spanish Government confirmedits resolve to open up Spain's telecoms sector in 1999. Rafael AriasSagado, Spanish Ministers for Public Works, issued a timetable, on October9, for the programme of activities needed to ensure the telecoms marketsis fully exposed to competition. The timetable provides for the generalLaw on communications to be completed in December 1997 and for theRegulation on services and licensing procedures12 months later. TheRegulation governing the conditions for occupying the public sector is tobe adopted in the first quarter of 1999. Concrete licensing decisions aredue to be taken during the second quarter of 1999, according to theMinister.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996VAN MIERT SEEKS "CLARIFICATIONS" OVER ELECTRABEL ACCORDSfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has written to theBelgian Government asking for "clarifications" over plans by the powerutility Electrabel, to force local authorities into long-term electricitysupply contracts, it was revealed on October 22. In March this year,Electrabel, which is privately owned, offered the Belgian intercommunales(joint ventures between municipalities for electricity distribution) thechance to buy stakes in the company in return for signing 30-yearelectricity distribution contracts. Mr Van Miert has repeatedly said that,under EU rules on free and fair competition, he will not accept contractslasting more than 15 years.The Commissioner is now reported to have asked the Belgian authorities fora clearer explanation of how much freedom the local authorities will haveto end the contracts with Electrabel and choose to go to another supplier.An EU source said that although the Commission had recently received aletter from Leo Peeters, Flemish Minister for Home Affairs, agreeing "inprinciple" to the 15-year contracts, Mr Van Miert was concerned aboutrecent indications that the parties to the agreements might be planning aU-turn over commitments made in May for a definite reduction in theirduration.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996ENPA APPLAUDS GREEN PAPER ON COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATIONfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169Newspaper publishers represented by the European Newspaper PublishersAssociation (ENPA) have cheered the approach recommended by the EuropeanCommission in the Green Paper it published last May on commercialcommunication (COM 96/192). The paper offers several guidelines forharmonising the framework of rules on these sorts of communication (thatis advertising in all its forms) or at least for smoothing out thenational difference to some extent. The ENPA is particularly pleased aboutthe idea of a case-by-case probe of initiatives that European and nationalauthorities would be called upon to take in this realm. Subjecting theinitiatives to public scrutiny should prevent the emergence of newobstacles, particularly in the context of the information society. ENPAthinks that initially the country of origin rule should be strengthenedthroughout the Single Market. This may be achieved by mutual recognitionof national rules. The publishers are backing the Commission's aspirationsto streamline the European legal setting. They call on the EU authoritiesto take full account of the cultural diversities in the EU. The ENPA alsowants to see the Committee due to be instructed to monitor the rulesgoverning approximation process extended to publishers.The ENPA is a lot more scathing about the Commission media concentrationplan. Confected by the services of Mario Monti, European Commissioner forthe Internal Market, the project is still under negotiation at theCommission. The aim is to set a number of restrictions on mediaconcentrations so as to safeguard pluralism. The way the ENPA sees it, theplan in its present form would act as a major obstacle to the futuredevelopment of local or regional publishing houses. The criteria adoptedwould discourage the companies from growing as a de facto readershipthreshold of 30% is imposed on any newspaper hoping to get involved inbroadcasting, according to the ENPA. Moreover, the rules beingcontemplated would affect only time-honoured activities (daily newspapers,radio and TV) and would affect the ability to develop new products andservices in the media industry.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996COMMISSION CLEARS MANNESMANN STAKE IN GERMANY'S DBKOM.from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169A proposal under which German engineering group Mannesmann will buy a49.8% stake in DBKom in an agreement with fellow German railway company,Deutsche Bahn, was cleared by the European Commission under the EU MergerRegulation on October 24.

Itgoes on to call for internal audit to be made mandatory in largeorganisations.ECIIA says an "expectation gap" has opened up between what the publicexpects and what current rules provide on corporate governance. But"exclusive reliance on the statutory auditor" cannot ensure adequateinternal control, and only creates "unfulfillable expectations in thepublic mind". Certification of financial statements is not enough, itargues: a "snapshot" judgement as to whether a company has a chance ofstill being able to trade twelve months ahead "is hardly up to the task ofresponding fully to shareholder and creditor concerns", it says, insistingon the need for more systematic measurement - via an internal auditfunction - of more reliable business performance indicators. Similarly,the best way of dealing with fraud is by prevention rather than detection,ECIIA argues - again pointing to the role of internal audit.Above all, ECIIA says - contrary to the Commission's view - that boards ofdirectors are not in a position to respond to public concern over the needfor effective control. This is largely a day-to-day matter more properlyin the realm of management, the internal auditors claim. And any controlsystem put in place without an adequate review system "will probably failat critical points", warns ECIIA.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996GERMAN ENERGY SUPPLY DEAL UNDER MERGER TASK FORCE SCRUTINY.from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The proposed acquisition of German energy supplier, Isarwerke, byBayernwerk, the Bavarian electricity utility, was announced to be underinvestigation by the European Commission's Merger Task Force on October23.

The scheme operated on the basis ofpayments of a fixed percentage, up to a certain maximum, of the cost(minus VAT) of fuel and lubricants, calculated according to the weight ofthe vehicle, to travel within Italy.Under the scheme, Italian legislation provided for a system of tax creditsfor Italian road hauliers operating for other people (i.e. not on theirown account), and for a system of compensation for non-Italian EU hauliers(who are compensated for the fuel they use in travelling on Italianterritory). In 1992, the Commission started formal state aid proceedingsagainst the Italian State regarding a similar credit scheme in operationthat year, and found the aid to be incompatible with the Treaty. Two yearslater, the Commission took Italy to the European Court of Justice forfailing to observe its Decision.But the Italians continued with their tax incentives for road hauliers.The credit schemes proposed for 1993 and 1994 are in all but terms ofbudget, ceilings and application periods the same as those alreadyoutlawed by the Commission; the only new element is the compensation fornon-Italian EU hauliers. A formal state aid investigation into the1993/1994 scheme under Article 93(2) of the Treaty was opened in October1995.The Commission inquiry has found the scheme incompatible with the Treatyon the grounds that it is an operating aid that is not offered as part ofa restructuring plan for the sector. It does not, therefore, fill any ofthe conditions for exemptions to the Treaty's state aid rules. All aidalready paid out has been ordered to be recovered by the Italianauthorities.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996COMMISSION RE-OPENS SECURIPOST STATE AID CASEfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169A European Commission investigation into allegedly illegal state aid toFrench transport and security company, Securipost, prior to itsprivatisation in 1993, was re-opened on October 23.

A former flagship of East German industry,SKET Schwermaschinenbau Magdeburg, based in Magdeburg, Saxony-Anhalt, wentinto financial receivership in mid-October. A Commission spokesman said MrVan Miert was "concerned with the situation, and prepared to analyse a newplan with the same understanding he has already shown to SKET".The Commission opened a formal investigation in March 1995 overapproximately DM 957 million worth of state aid to the troubled company.The procedure was extended in July 1996 when additional measures worth DM352 million were announced after the original privatisation planfloundered (see European Report N   2153). SKET's recent efforts to restoreprofitability have amounted to a reduction in costs of DM 31 million, butthe Commission is still doubtful about its chances of long-term viability- something which a new plan must ensure if it is to be approved. Brusselsalso suspects that some of the aid may have been used to cover SKET'soperating costs or to sell products at dumping prices. SKET owns 120 smallsupply companies, and is currently under the control of the Bundesanstaltfur vereiningungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben (BvS) - the German public agencyfor special tasks related to reunification. Although there is no officialdeadline for the formal submission of the plan, German Government sourceshave said they hope it will be drawn up by the end of the year.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996COMPETITION: COURT REJECTS COMMISSION EUROTUNNEL CONTRACT DECISIONfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169A European Commission decision nearly two years ago to force French andBritish railway companies, Societe Nationale de Chemins de Fer (SNCF), andBritish Rail (BR) to give 25% of the Channel Tunnel's capacity to thirdparty operators (case T-79/T-80/95) was rejected by the European Court ofFirst Instance on October 22, on the grounds that it was based on afactual error. In a statement, the Court said it had found the Commissionto have made a "profound error of judgement" over the interpretation ofthe usage contract governing access to the tunnel.A fixed rail link beneath the English Channel between Frethen inNord-Pas-de-Calais, and Cheriton in Kent, was born of an agreement signedon February 12, 1986 by the French and British Governments. On March14,1996, two private companies, Channel Tunnel Group, and France Manche,secured the concession to build and operate the Channel Tunnel,establishing a joint-venture company under the name of 'Eurotunnel'. Theconcession, which was originally for 55 years, but later extended to 65years in 1994, provided for half the Channel Tunnel capacity to bereserved for passenger and goods trains between Britain and continentalEurope. SNCF and BR were to be entitled to retain full use of their shareof the capacity, on the condition that they arranged for the maximumnumber of trains possible, provided adequate national railwayinfrastructure (including for high-speed trains), and maintained theirpayments to Eurotunnel - including a share of upkeep and maintenance.But, after receiving comments from the interested parties, the Commissionruled on December 13, 1994 that the way the usage contract was structuredallowed BR and SNCF to hold 100% of hourly paths available forinternational freight, and that it was an infringement of Article 85 ofthe EU Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. It imposed a conditionon the two companies by which they would be required to make available 25%of the hourly capacity of the tunnel to competitors. SNCF and BR contestedthe Commission's Decision and lodged complaints at the Court of Justice onMarch 7 and March 8, 1995 respectively. On October 22, they successfullyconvinced the Court that third parties have always had access to theChannel Tunnel, and that they had never had any intention to secure morethan 50% of international capacity. Since the Commission Decision has beenin place, no parties have actually come forward to exercise the right tothe remaining 25%, which is now no longer likely to be applicable,following the Court's ruling. Meanwhile, loss-making Eurotunnel said onOctober 22 that it would shed 657 jobs in an attempt to improve itscompetitiveness.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EIB EURO-BOND ISSUE IN SPAIN.from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The European Investment Bank is preparing the first Peseta-denominatedbond issue in Spain intended for small savers. "Bonos Europeos" will beavailable in Spain from October 28 to November 15. Some 20 savings banksand commercial banks, with more than 15,000 agencies in the country, willoffer for subscription 40 billion Pesetas worth of EIB bonds for a nominalvalue of 10,000 Pesetas (ECU 62). The bonds are for 10 years and carry asix-month interest rate of 7% (annual rate of 7.12%). The managingunderwriters are guaranteeing individual investors liquidity of the bondswithin 24 hours. The issue will be jointly managed by the Caja de Madrid,Banco Central Hispano and Banco de Santander. The bond issue willstrengthen cooperation between the EIB and the Spanish banking sector andallow the Bank scope for continuing to diversify its system for collectingPeseta-denominated resources, according to the Bank. In Spain, the Bankhas helped along the development of the "Matador" market (bond market fornon-resident issuers of Peseta-denominated bonds) by its continuingpresence as a borrower of large amounts of funding. Between 1988 and 1995,the EIB launched 38 issues and managed to collect over 750,000 millionPesetas. Since the start of the year, it has raised over 200 billion.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996MILD IMPROVEMENT IN CONFIDENCE INDICATOR IN JULY/AUGUSTfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169Confidence in the economic outlook improved slightly between July andAugust, according to a European Commission survey conducted among companymanagers and consumer and published on October 21. The figures show thatthe period of zero growth is drawing to a close, even though economicindicators are still below the long-term average.Figures for August show that companies prepared to step up production inthe coming months outnumber those who expect to do the opposite.Nonetheless, EU industry orderbooks are far from full and exports continueto be too low. The level of durable stocks is also considered excessive interms of demand for industrial products. The outlook is less bleak interms of the predicted level of orders and growth in exports. Industry isalso counting on increased output in the near future. This mildimprovement will not make any immediate effect on employment in theindustrial sector, though. EU industry's utilisation capacity was runningat 80.8% in July, which is much the same as the level reported in theprevious quarter. As for consumers, they are now less pessimistic abouttheir own financial circumstances and future developments.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996TAXATION: COMMISSION WORRIED ABOUT GERMAN CAR INCENTIVESfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169Should Germany be allowed to provide tax incentives now for cars thatalready meet the next round of vehicle emission standards recommendedunder the Auto Oil air quality programme, which are still only at theproposal stage? As the matter has now taken an almost exclusive politicalturn (with "mistakes" being committed by all sides), it will be up toEuropean Commissioners to give an answer to the question, during theirOctober 30 meeting. On top of the political irritant, there are a seriesof legal "hitches" that can be traced right back to the complexcompromises that preceded the adoption of the last Directive on motorvehicle pollution.The European Commission sent a letter to the German authorities lastSeptember 23 to notify them that their draft Bill intended to allow lowerroad taxes for cars that are more environmentally-friendly than requiredby the standards in the Auto Oil proposals (tabled by the EuropeanCommission on June 18) were out of step with EU legislation (see EuropeanReport N   2161). Germany meekly withdrew its proposed Bill and it wasthought that was the end of the matter. Determined to press on with theirtax breaks, the German authorities soon tabled a new Bill and this toooffered tax incentives starting in 1997 but they are supposed to apply tocars that comply with the standards provided in the Auto Oil proposals.The Bill is therefore based on standards that are less strict than in theprevious plan.They might, however, turn out to be too strict for the Commission's taste.The matter is nevertheless still a highly controversial one. Article 3 ofDirective 94/12/EC (on motor vehicle pollution) certainly argues the casefor a unfavourable opinion from the Commission: it proposes that MemberStates may provide tax incentives only for vehicles complying with therequirements in this same Directive (the standards in the German Billextend beyond the confines of the Directive and are based on a proposalthat has still not been adopted by the EU Member States, far from it).However Article 4 of Directive 94/12 argues the case for retaining theGerman Bill: it specifies that the Commission and industry have to consultunder the Auto Oil programme in order for the Commission to recommend afurther tightening of the standards before the end of 1994 and that theseproposals should be adopted by the Council of Ministers before the end of1996. Even though the Commission is not entirely to blame, the Auto Oilproposals in the end were not presented until mid-1996 and have yet to beadopted. There are therefore grounds for considering that Germany couldlegitimately expect to be able to introduce, starting on January 1, 1997,tax incentives for cars that are cleaner than required by the 94/12standards (the Auto Oil proposals envisage the same kind of article asArticle 3 in the Directive 94/12).Faced with the politico-technical conundrum, the Commission is feelingextremely uncomfortable about the idea of refusing to allow Germany topress on with its plan. "The Commission might well decide not to run therisk of being taken by Germany to the EU Court of Justice fornon-observance of Article 4 of Directive 94/12", according to officialsclosely involved with the matter. Admittedly, Article 4 made it possible,when the Directive was being adopted, to rally the support of certaincountries which have long been more to the fore on the environmentalprotection front. But is also completely unrealistic, in that it leavesthe Commission only a few months in which to define its position in theface of the powerful interests of the motor industry and the oil industry.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996TAXATION/EXCISE DUTIES: COMMISSION SOON TO PROPOSE TAXES ON ALL ENERGYSOURCESfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The European Commission is expected to come up with a proposal before theend of November for an increase in minimum excise duty rates on mineraloils and the inclusion of other energy sources - electricity, natural gas,coal and perhaps even biofuels - in the excise duty system. If theproposal is approved by the full team of Commissioners and the Council ofFinance Ministers (which could be more difficult), excise duties onmineral oils would gradually be increased, particularly in those MemberStates that currently have the lowest taxes. With the proposed energy/CO2tax stalled for the past four years, the Commission's main goal is now towin acceptance for the principle of some kind of tax, no matter how small,on all energy sources. The proposal, which puts more emphasis on theprinciple than actual tax rates, has already created "very serioustensions" within the Commission, according to well-placed sources.Since January 1, 1993, the Member States have been required to set exciseduties rates on mineral oils above a Community minimum rate (expressed inECU) for each product and its particular use (heating oil, lead-freepetrol, etc.) under Directive 92/82/EEC governing excise duties on mineraloils. The same excise duty system covers tobacco and alcoholic drinks too(although the Commission does not intend to modify the rates for theseproducts at the moment). A closer convergence of duty rates among theMember States within the Single Market to prevent distortions ofcompetition was one of the Commission's and the Member States' objectivesin adopting this system. Some current minimum rates are listed below.* Heavy fuel oil: ECU 13 per 1,000 kg* liquefied petroleum gas and methane for industrial use: ECU 36/1,000 kg* leaded petrol: ECU 337 /1,000 litres* lead-free petrol: ECU 287/1,000 litresCommission sources say that minimum rates should now be increased, notonly to keep pace with inflation, but also as a first step towards acloser approximation of rates (setting a minimum rate tends to beineffective, since market forces push rates downward, according toexperts). This approximation of rates would discourage cross-bordershopping and would incorporate environmental concerns into policies inother areas, now that the specific proposal for an energy/CO2 tax hasfoundered. New rates should be high enough to create an incentive, but notso high as to ruin the proposal's chances of adoption by theCommissioners, informed sources explain. To soften the psychological andpractical impact of these measures, the increase would be gradual.Commission experts speak of raising rates by about 30% over five to tenyears, but this is only theoretical. Several Directorate-Generals - DG III(Industry), DG XXI (Taxation), DG XI (Environment), DG XV (InternalMarket) and DG XVII (Energy) must still consult among themselves.Most of the Member States apply taxes at levels well above Communityminimum rates. But others (Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg)impose rates on certain products (some types of mineral oils) that areequivalent to or only slightly higher than the minimum. These MemberStates would eventually be required to raise their minimum rates to complywith the new European minima (and for this reason are likely to oppose theproposal in Council). The rise would also concern those States whose ratesare already well above the minimum rates. "This increase would give MemberStates with high excise duty rates more room to manoeuvre, making exciseduties higher everywhere", says an expert on this issue, also bringing upthe concept of shifting taxes on labour to other bases, preferably with apositive impact in terms of environmental protection.These are exactly the arguments that have spurred the Commission tobroaden the scope of application of the Directive on excise duties toinclude other energy sources such as coal, natural gas and electricity.The Commission's first concern seems to be winning acceptance for theprinciple of taxation of these products, regardless of the rate, as afirst step towards compensating for the failure of the energy/CO2 taxproposal. As mentioned earlier, even biofuels could be include in thisproposal, which would thus supersede Directive 92/81/EEC on the structureof excise duties on mineral oils, that on excise duty rates (92/82/EEC)and the draft Directive on excise duty reductions for biofuels (still heldup in the Council).Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996COMMISSION ADOPTS TAX SYSTEMS REPORTfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169A European "code of good conduct" has to be developed to prevent nationaltax policies continuing to be threatened by too much fiscal competitionbetween Member States, said European Commissioner for Taxation MarioMonti, when presenting on October 22 the report the European Commissionhad just adopted on the development of tax systems (see previous issue ofEuropean Report for further details).The erosion of the tax base is the main problem singled out by theCommission, which recommends setting up a high-level forum, or a "FiscalPolicy Committee" that with its overview of policies would work ondeveloping a code of good conduct for use by the Member States. "It is notthe proposals that are lacking, it is a consensus that is missing", MrMonti stressed once again, referring to the numerous proposals that seekto complete the European fiscal area but have been held up in the EUCouncil of Ministers for many years owing to the rule on unanimous voting."Nowadays it is much more often the markets, and no longer the MemberStates, that are sovereign", he lamented, calling for greater coordinationbetween the Member States. "If the countries were to exercise thissovereignty together, they might then be able to recover it from themarkets". He urged the Member States to coordinate their fiscal policiesmore.Minimising tax evasion, ensuring the smooth functioning of the SingleMarket, promoting employment and environmental protection are just some ofthe main themes in this report due to be presented to EU governmentleaders at their December 13/14 Summit in Dublin. It will first beexamined by EU Finance Ministers in November.

The report by Ioannis Theonas (EUL,Greece), which formed the basis for the Parliament's Opinion, recognisesthat such a Committee would remedy a deficiency by creating an officialand stable structure charged with monitoring employment policy and theimplementation of multi-annual programmes.The Parliament believes this Committee should strengthen coordinationbetween the employment policies of the different Member States. It shouldalso participate in preparatory work on the annual report on theemployment situation and the joint report submitted to the EuropeanCouncil.The creation of a Committee similar to the Economic Policy Committee setup in 1974, with the objective of promoting the coordination of MemberStates' short- and long-term economic policies, was first proposed at theinformal Council of Social Affairs Ministers in October 1995. Since March1995, monitoring of the employment situation has been the responsibilityof the ad hoc group of personal representatives of Labour and EmploymentMinisters. However, this group has encountered difficulties in fulfillingthe task assigned to it, because of the lack of resources at its disposal.The European Commission believes the Committee should serve to: - monitoremployment trends in the EU;- examine Member States' employment and labour market policies;- exchange information and experience between the Member States and withthe Commission;- prepare reports and recommendations on these questions; and- draw up an annual comparative report on the employment situation in theMember States and the policies followed by the latter.A preliminary agreement on setting up the new Committee was secured at theSocial Affairs Council on September 24, and should be ratified at theDecember 2 Council (see European Report N   2160 for further details).Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996EMI TO UNVEIL EURO BANKNOTES THIS YEARfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The European Monetary Institute is expected to unveil the new Eurobanknotes this year, EMI President Alexandre Lamfalussy announced onOctober 22. These banknotes will begin circulating on January 1, 2002 atthe latest. The EMI, precursor to the future European Central Bank,launched a competition to design the Euro in mid-February, restricted toartists specialising in the design of banknotes and designated by theCentral Banks of the European Union Member States. The final choice mustbe approved by the EMI Council, which is composed of the Governors of the15 Central Banks of the European Union, at a meeting later this year,although no date has yet been set, Institute sources in Frankfurt said.The EMI has received 44 proposed designs for the Euro. "I believe that wewill be able to announce the result of the selection process this year",Mr Lamfalussy told a gathering of German businessmen.A committee of specialists chose two themes for the future currency:European historical periods and styles, and modern or abstract designs. MrLamfalussy indicated that the first theme had been used in 27 of thedesigns. A spokesman for the EMI explained that every aspect of each entryis now being examined to determine whether it meets the criteria laiddown. Each denomination (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 or 500) must bear thename of the currency, the initials of the European Central Bank in fivelanguages (BCE, ECB, EZB, EKB, EKP) and the stars symbolising the EuropeanUnion. The notes must also incorporate the latest anti-counterfeitingtechnology (a watermark, a security thread that turns black onphotocopies, colour-changing inks) and be easily distinguishable by thevisually impaired.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 1996ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEEfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169The next plenary session of the EU's Economic and Social Committee is tobe held on October 30 and 31 in Brussels.

Such were the conclusions of a Resolution onthe Budget adopted without amendment by the Parliament in plenary sessionon October 24.The Parliament is anxious to ensure that the necessary measures are takento prepare for the period after 2002, when the ECSC Treaty will expire,and in the meantime that existing credits are used as wisely as possible.In its Resolution, the Parliament said that the proposed operating budgetof ECU 265.5 million - an increase of ECU 24.5 million over the 1996 one -is inconsistent with the run-down of activities implied by the plan tophase out the Treaty. Also, noting that real needs estimated by theCommission are of the order of ECU 172 million rather than ECU 265.5million, the Parliament contests the Commission's decision to set asidesurplus revenue appropriations of ECU 93.5 million - almost the total sumof resources derived from the levy on companies in the coal and steelsectors - as a reserve for the successor body to the ECSC. For theParliament, the proposed Budget represents an imbalance between availableresources and requirements and, by containing a provisions for subsequentfinancing, runs counter to the principle of an annual budget.In its Resolution, the Parliament proposes increasing the sums allottedfor redeployment aid (from 56 to ECU 60 million), research (from 82 to ECU91 million), conversion aid (from 7 to ECU 11 million) and social measuresin the coal industry (from 22 to ECU 26 million).

The Council will be asked to decide on the "blocking statute" - adraft Council Regulation and a draft Joint Action - which would togetherprotect against the effects of third-country (for which, read "US")legislation on EU trade with third countries (for which read "Cuba","Iran" and "Libya"). The draft EU measures are subject to some questionsstill - with reservations on specific questions from the UK, Germany andSpain (principally, non-compliance, recovery of damages, and scope), andwith Denmark opposed to the entire legal base of the draft Regulation. Butthe Presidency says that discussions have now reached a point where it isup to Ministers to take a decision. The European Parliament was expectedto give its Opinion on the proposals on October 25.The Middle East features in several of the agenda items: the Council willexamine the Middle East peace process in the light of recent EU and MemberState contacts there, and will discuss the possible appointment of an EUenvoy in the region - although no precise EU view has yet been establishedof an envoy's role or status (unofficial candidates are being discussedalready, however, with an informal short list including the SpanishAmbassador to Israel, and a number of Italian and Swedish names); EuropeanCommissioner for relations with Mediterranean countries Manuel Marin willreport orally on negotiations for a Euro-Mediterranean AssociationAgreement with Egypt; the Council will be asked to adopt the commonposition on the 10th session of the Cooperation Council with Egypt - whichwill take place on October 28 at midday (see separate article in SectionV); and over the following a lunch broader political issues will bediscussed.On the Inter-Governmental Conference, the Council will look particularlyat external action of the EU under the headings of Common Foreign andSecurity Policy, external economic relations, and security and defence,where the Presidency is seeking political direction from Ministers (seeseparate article in this issue). The Ministers are planning an exchange ofviews with the President of the European Parliament, but no formaldiscussion of the recent Franco-German proposal on closer cooperation (seeDocument with this issue of European Report) is planned by the Presidency,which has merely noted the paper as one of several contributions to theIGC discussions, but is taking no view of it.

However, MEPs want toensure that this should not serve as an excuse for scaling down theambitions. Meanwhile, the Franco-German proposals for ways of promotingcloser cooperation between small groups of countries has been given acautious welcome in some EU quarters. Personal representatives of ForeignMinisters are due to consider the proposals on October 30 in the contextof the IGC. (European Report is publishing, as a supplement to this issue,a full version of the Franco-German proposals on greater cooperation.)Tabled by the Committee on Institutional Affairs, the ParliamentaryResolution expresses concern about the EU's Summit's failure to moveforward on institutional reforms. The European Commission's President, whowas there to take part in the Parliamentary debate, agreed that "thepositions adopted by the delegations were still a far cry from what isneeded" and a great deal of progress had yet to be made in this area. TheParliament nonetheless applauds the EU's resolve to stick to the timetableand in particular to round the talks off next June in Amsterdam. However,MEPs call for the draft Treaty, due to be presented by the IrishPresidency prior to the EU Summit in Dublin, to "demonstrate the Union'scapacity to acquire instruments adequate to the important commitments itwill have to fulfill in the near future".Generally speaking, the Parliament has stressed its commitment to the ideaof introducing a Treaty chapter on employment, adopting effective measuresto provide the EU with a Common Foreign and Security Policy and creating agenuine Euro-wide policy based on internal security and freedom. TheResolution underscores the need for decisions to be take by EU Heads ofState and Government when they gather for the next European Council inDublin, on December 13/14. Several MEPs in the Socialist, ChristianDemocrat, Liberal and Green camps are leaning on the Member States'governments to make a commitment soon to a full-blown public debate on theEU reform process.In the wake of an amendment tabled at the last minute, the Parliament gaveits reaction to the Franco-German plan to introduce a "general clause oncloser cooperation" allowing those who wish and have the ability to do so,to move at a faster pace towards economic and political integration. TheParliament judges that "any increased cooperation under the variouspillars must be achieved with due regard for the institutional framework,the acquis communautaire and the objectives of the Union and must be opento all Member States at any time".Caution and flexibility.The Franco-German idea of having a Maastricht Treaty clause to allowcertain countries to improve their cooperation in certain areas has beengiven a cautious welcome. The Member States and the Commission areplanning to go through the proposal with a fine tooth comb. "The issue offlexibility is one of the more importance ones to emerge from theInter-Governmental Conference. There is a strong feeling that there is aneed for something in this area, but there is also a very strong feelingthat this matter has to be given cautious consideration", Noel Dorr, thecurrent IGC Chairman, opined on October 22. During initial talks about theflexibility proposals, several Member States voiced fears about the riskof the Single Market being undermined. In Commission circles, the feelingis that the text, which still has to be converted into articles (and thiswill take some time), is going in the right direction.The Commission has several reasons to be pleased. First of all the Frenchand Germans are seeking to apply enhanced cooperation in areas whereunanimous decision-making is required.Second, the flexibility strategy is bracketed by stringent principles,such as the need to retain the single institutional framework: no MemberState would enjoy a right of veto, no Member State would be excluded, andthere must be full respect for the EU's legislative achievements, forCommunity law and the Treaty objectives. These principles would beguaranteed by verification procedures enforced by the EU Court of Justice,in particular, acting in response to a request from a Member State nottaking part in the enhanced cooperation.A third reason to be pleased is the Franco-German determination not totamper with the Single Market: the flexibility strategy would not apply tothe EU legislative achievements and therefore to the Internal Market andcommon polices. In the case of the first pillar, the Franco-German planstresses that "the need to list the possible areas would have to beexamined". The idea has been proposed for the flexibility approach to beused, for example, by Economic and Monetary Union participants to convergetheir tax laws, indeed even their compulsory levy systems, if unanimityvoting is to continue in these two areas by the end of the IGC. France andGermany's partners believe the system has the major drawback of imposingrules on those who intend to join the Euro zone at a later date, withouthaving allowed the newcomers to have their say.Another advantage of the flexibility strategy is that in the context ofthe Common Foreign and Security Policy and defining a common defencepolicy, enhanced forms of cooperation may help to take account, withoutnecessarily having too suffer the consequences, of the specificcircumstances of certain Member States and in particular of the neutralityof the Nordic countries, Ireland and Austria. The Franco-German planproposes to set a minimum threshold of Member States for implementing thecloser cooperation plan.As far as France and Germany are concerned, the flexibility would beanother kettle of fish in the context of Maastricht's third pillar(cooperation between the courts and police forces, immigration, right ofasylum, visas, combating drug-trafficking and crime). In this broad policyarea, the Franco-German plan envisages measures to slacken the system forConventions so that they would be able to come into effect after a certainnumber of ratifications by the Member States (and solely for the Stateshaving ratified according to a threshold to be set on a case-by-case basisas well as scope for concluding Conventions with less than 15 countries,thus committing only States that are parties to the Convention) and theimplementation of operational measures and material cooperation betweencertain Member States.The Franco-German plan certainly has its appeal, not least in the way itseeks to prevent Community activities from being thrown into a state ofparalysis. However, the closer cooperation idea raises a series ofquestions of a technical nature that have to be debated before being ableto be included in the Treaty. It also raises the fundamental question ofhow the system will operate. Instead of providing a coherent view ofEurope, the numerous alliances could, on the contrary, end up by creatingdisorder. The Member States would all be able to live under the same roof- the European Union - but would proceed at different speeds. In theory,and here were are looking some way into the future, countries joining thesingle currency will not necessarily be the same ones taking part inmilitary operations in the Middle East, say, nor those who haveestablished an area in which people may move without obstruction. Againstthis background, what will become of the family spirit and in particularthe financial solidarity on which the European Community is built? TheFranco-German plan still has to be spelled out in a bit more detail, butit is possible to see that the initiative could act like a tonic on theinstitutional negotiations: if it creates enough fear, it may induce theMember States to be more ambitious about extending qualified majorityvoting, to which the Germans and French are in theory still committed.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN REPORT via NewsNetOctober 26, 19961997 EU BUDGET: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT PROPOSES AN INCREASE OF ECU 800MILLIONfrom EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169On October 24, the European Parliament in first reading proposed anincrease of some ECU 800 million to the draft European Union GeneralBudget for 1997 adopted by the EU Council of Ministers in July. Paymentappropriations emerge from the Parliament's first reading at ECU 82.514billion, compared with the 81.646 billion voted by the Council. Theincrease advocated by MEPs would chiefly benefit spending linked to thefunctioning of the Internal Market - with an additional ECU 300 millionfor the trans-European networks - research and development, the NorthernIreland peace programme and external relations.The European Parliament subscribed to the principal amendments tabled byits Committee on Budgets on reports by the Dutch MEP Laurens JanBrinkhorst (on the General Budget and the European Commission's Budget)and the Spanish Member Juan Manuel Fabra Valles (on the Budgets of otherinstitutions - see separate article on the ECSC Operating Budget). TheParliament has chosen not to question the horizontal reduction of ECU 1billion in farm spending sanctioned by the Council of Ministers, excludingexceptional spending on the beef and veal sector and costs linked to theBSE crisis, and in Structural Fund spending except for the less-developedregions of the Community.By contrast, the Parliament exercised its rights within the limits of thefinancial perspectives, and voted to re-enter credits on internal policieslinked to the internal market and on external relations, revoked be theCouncil during its first reading. In respect of internal policies, theMEPs have chosen to put in reserve ECU 300 million including ECU 73million in a negative reserve to cover funding for the 14 prioritytransport projects and the IVth Framework Programme of Research andDevelopment, and ECU 100 million for the Northern Ireland peace programme.This accounting trick should enable funds to be lifted from current linesin Section 3 of the Budget. MEPs also expanded budget lines on things suchas the environment, consumer protection, equal opportunities, informationand communication, anti-fraud measures and transport, for which theCouncil had approved deep cuts (see table below).Turning to external relations, the MEPs voted through a ECU 335 millionincrease in payment appropriations over draft Budget approved by theCouncil. Among others, this increase will benefit the countries of Centraland Eastern Europe and the former USSR, Mediterranean and Latin Americancountries and cooperation with non-governmental organisations. TheParliament voted to withhold aid intended for Turkey (ECU 53 million forthe EU/Turkey Customs Union and ECU 3.5 million for technical measures).As regards the appropriation for the MEDA programme of assistance toMediterranean third countries, of which Turkey is just one beneficiary,the Parliament and the European Commission have agreed to finance projectslinked to promoting democracy and respect for human rights andstrengthening civilian structures in Turkish society. By contrast, theParliament complied with a Commission request and rejected projectsintended for South-Eastern Anatolia. A working party made up of 5 MEPs andthe European Commissioners Manuel Marin (Relations with MediterraneanStates) and Hans van den Broek (External Political Relations) will be setup to exercise prior control over projects the Commission proposes tofinance in Turkey in 1997. Finally, the European Parliament took a scytheto the Common Foreign and Security Policy line.The Budgets of EU institutions, and in particular the Commission, haveemerged from the Parliament's first reading with a number ofmodifications. MEPs decided to put in reserve 26% of remuneration forCommission officials, in order to force restructuring of theDirectorate-General for Enterprise Policy, Tourism and the Social Economy(DG XXIII), following the scandals that have sullied the Tourism Unit.They also voted to put in reserve 50% of the credits allocated to theDirectorate-General for Information and Communication (DG X) to force itto review its information policy. Discipline demands, the institutionswill not increase their personnel next year. However, in order toguarantee the proper functioning of the institutions, the Assemblyapproved a recommendation from Mr Fabra Valles, and voted to increase byECU 1.37 million the overall amount allocated to the Council of Ministers,the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and SocialCommittee, the Committee of the Regions and the joint ESC/CoR structure.This increase will finance measures involving personnel at the Court ofjustice (ECU 154,000 on ECU 1.138 million), the ESC (ECU 16,486 on 90,158)and the joint organisational structure (ECU 55,000 on 142,348).These sums are not final. The Council of Ministers can reinstate a moreaustere Budget in its second reading on November 19. However in respect ofso-called non-compulsory spending (with the exception of agriculture), theMEPs will have the last word in December. Between the two readings, theParliament hopes to succeed in negotiating two agreements with the Counciland the Commission. The first concerns the forty budget lines thatcorrespond to pilot projects and Community programmes whose credits arenot allocated for want of a legislative act of the Council. The secondconcerns the financing of EU fisheries agreements with third countries, onwhich the Parliament is anxious to have its say.Criticism of the execution of the 1996 Budget.The European Parliament has also adopted a highly critical resolution onthe execution of the 1996 Budget, tabled by British Conservative MEP JamesElles. The Assembly criticises the wretched quality of budget forecasts inthe farming sector, denounces the poor rate of execution of the StructuralFunds budget, and disapproves of the Commission's deliberate refusal toenact articles concerning the promotion of inter-regional cooperationactions and the centre for enterprise and innovation, on the grounds thatsimilar actions could be financed through the structural funds. MEPs havealso expressed concerns over the slow-down in the execution of the budgetof Community actions supporting peace in the Middle East and has called onthe Commission, without delay, to provide information on the planned useof credits covering special aid to refugees in the Republics of the formerYugoslavia.Copyright 1996 EUROPEAN REPORTBack to Headline List
