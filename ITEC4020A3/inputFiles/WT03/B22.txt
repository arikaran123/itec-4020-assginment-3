The author's goal indeveloping a commercially published test is to provide other professionalswith a means of assessing some characteristic of other people. Commercially published tests provide three great benefits.... Through their tests, the authors are able to share their expert knowledge of how assessments may be conducted. The economics of publishing is such that commercially published tests are often of a quality that would not be economicallyfeasible to produce for use in a single province or state. Standardized tests have been researched, so it is possible to relate the scores produced by any individual to those of a large population.The test manual provides normswhich rate an examinee's score on a test against the scores ofa large reference population (sometimes referred to as the standardizationsample). What Do Standardized Tests Measure? The process of assessment is a process of human interaction. During the process, one individual tries to form an understanding (opinion or belief) about another. In some cases, itis possible to provide questionnaires or present tasks which provide a sample of behavior that will assist the assessor in forming his oppinion. Standardized tests may be used to attempt to measure the relative prevalence of skills and abilities, target behaviors, reported feelings and beliefs, etc. Hard Area Tests Tests which measure skills and abilities are variouslycalled aptitude tests, achievement tests, diagnostic tests, IQtests, etc. These may be classed as within the "hard"area of measurement. It is possible for an examinee to adopt aresponding strategy on these tests so as to "fake bad"and cause a lower score on these tests than honest effort wouldobtain. However, it is not possible to "fake good" andget a higher score than honest effort would produce. Soft Area Tests Tests which ask questions about an individual's past behaviors, beliefs or feelingsare classed as operating in the "soft" area of measurement.These are called personality tests, interest inventories, honestyand reliability tests, etc. Since these tests are mostly self-reportsof thoughts, beliefs and feelings, or past behavior, there are no right or wrongresponses -- only honest and dishonest ones. It is possible for examinees to design their responsesto such tests in order to present themselves in a favorable light (called faking good), to answer honestly, to present themselves in an unfavorable light (called faking bad, or even to respond completely randomly. It is also possible forexaminees to respond differently from one day to another (dependingon other outside factors) in a manner which may still technicallybe considered honest.From the foregoing, one can see that the examiner is faced withthe task of assessing the client's responding strategy before(s)he even begins to assess what a soft area test suggests aboutthe examinee. Many such tests include "lie" scales thatattempt to identify examinees whose responding strategy isgrossly dishonest. However, even the best of these tests cannot control very well for some individuals' natural tendency toward "openness"and "frankness" and the tendency of others to be morecircumspect. Does this Mean Soft Area Tests are Useless? No! Soft area tests may be very useful for counsellorswho have the cooperation of their clients. Vocational cousellinghas been facilitated to a great extent by a group of tests called interestinventories. Though for pre-employment testing these inventoriesare essentially useless. Soft area tests also may be of help toexperienced psychologists who can make some sense of the client'sresponding strategy. The great danger of all soft area testsis that beginners (or those from other disciplines -- i.e. lawyers)often want to read more into a test result than is there. Mostwell designed and researched soft area scales comprised of twenty or more unique items are capable of ranking an individual as Low,Normal, or High in terms of a target characteristic. Attemptingto read more than this into a test score is usually not supportable. Whilethe experienced professional knows that the difference of a coupleof score points either way should signify nothing on soft areatests -- the problem exists that at some specific point it isconsidered necessary to begin calling a score high, or low. This fact alone frustrates computer analysis of test scores, because computers require an algorithm that includes a very specific point at which a score is to be considered high. The best solution is to retain the services of an experiencedprofessional psychologist if you require the type of informationthat is provided by soft area tests -- although this may not berequired in cases of vocational counselling.

Employment History and Resume Standardized tests, Interviewer impressions. Of these three sources, Interview has traditionally been the measure most relied on in making hiring decisions. Research suggests that this is entirely the wrong approach, as interview impressions are probably the least likely predictors of job success of the three sources of information listed above. History is the best indicator we have. Experience shows that past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. However an "honest" history can be difficult to obtain. If an employee was well liked or considered a personal friend by a previous employer, even though his/her previous employer was never highly satisfied with the quality of work produced and effort on the job, you could receive a glowing recommendation. Of course, if the employee was well-liked at previous places of employment, it may be that you will come to like this employee as well. The lesson to take from the information presented in this paragraph is: always check the history and references provided on the resume, verify somehow that the person you have been given as a reference is in fact someone who supervises employees, and question any gaps in the chronology of employment provided by the candidate. With regard to chronology, it could be that a previous employment where the individual got into trouble was omitted from the history, or it could be that the individual is someone who becomes periodically unable to work due to physical or mental health problems. Tests of maximum performance are used to identify the abilities of a prospective employee. Test results should be used to debunk the information obtained about employment history. Note that candidates can "fake bad" on these tests, but unless they have seen the test before, they cannot give a false-positive evaluation. This is not to say that aptitude tests are perfect measures of job performance. These tests do nothing to measure important personality characteristics such as honestly, reliability, job involvement, customer service orientation, team spirit, etc. Further they do a less than perfect job of measuring the elusive variable known as common sense which is important in the workplace. Our best estimates suggest that test results by themselves probably account for about 25% of the variance in job performance (Sternberg, American Psychologist vol 50 #11, Nov. 1995). What we hope to find in examining all three sources of information about an individual is convergence. For if three sources of information seem to indicate roughly the same things about an individual, then the probability that the "things" are correct increases. By contrast, divergence (where one source seems to contradict another) presents a problem that must be dealt with by the personnel manager. Further investigation will hopefully uncover a possible explanation for the contradictory information. Pre-employment tests should allow an individual to demonstrate a measurable amount of success and a measurable amount of failure on the task provided. I.E. if an individual gets most of the test items correct, it may be that the test is too "easy" to rate the individual accurately. The individual may even have more ability than the test results indicate. Test results are usually reported in terms of percentile ranks and/or standard scores. For those not trained in testing, I suggest sticking to percentile rank interpretation. A candidate scoring at the 90th %�ile can be expected to score better than 89% of the reference group which the standardization sample represents and worse than 9% of the reference group. It is not true that getting 90 percent of the test items correct necessarily means that the individual scores at the 90th %�ile. %�ile scores are derived from a table in the test manual. If you are unsure of how to use %�ile scores, get a good organizational psychologist or personnel manager to help you set a cutting score for each of the tests you want to use. Usually you can identify a score for each test below which an individual should not be hired, a range of scores where you might hire the individual if you were under time pressure to fill the position, and a score above which you would like your candidates to score. Do not assume that the highest test scores necessarily indicate the best prospective employee. This would be incorrect, as one can deduce from the preceding discussion above in which it is noted that probably only 25% of the variance in the ability of prospective employees is accounted for by pre-employment tests. Note: never average test results from different tests together. %�ile ranks are not equal interval scores. For example there are many more people who fall between the 50th and 55th %�ile than fall between the 90th and 95th %�ile. Although we have dealt only with tests of maximum performance so far, a word needs to be said about "personality tests" and "honesty and reliability tests". I believe that personality assessments should be performed using respected objective tests and should generally be done by (or under the supervision of) an experienced industrial psychologist. This is not to insult personnel managers (or inexperienced psychologists), but rather to say that personality tests generally require interpretation. The ability to provide this interpretation is a skill which is developed after a good deal of experience. Personality tests generally lend themselves to manipulation by examinees much more than do tests of maximum performance. Even though the best of these tests have scales that attempt to detect dissimulation on the part of examinees, they are necessarily less reliable than tests of maximum performance. They are said to operate in a "softer" area and users should be advised that such tests can provide both false-positive and false-negative scores. Despite the problems with personality assessment, some tests have been devised specifically for use by personnel managers in measuring some aspects of employee reliability. These tests tend to be quite expensive (in the order of $30.00 per examinee). Test developers have justified the price of these tests based on development costs and potential savings arising from not hiring employees who steal, who are unreliable, or even those who are likely to take stress leave or abuse the company benefits plan. Human resources managers should always remember that the administration of one or more personality test tests is not the same thing as a comprehensive personality assessment provided by an organizational psychologist. A comprehensive pre-employment assessment by an industrial psychologist should include ability and personality measures, plus an extensive interview. These assessments typically cost in the neighborhood of $500 - $1,000 per candidate, and should be based on an hourly rate charged by the psychologist. The professional psychologists association in your region will usually have a published recommended rate schedule for their members which may be used to verify that quoted charges for candidate assessments are within reason. Bear in mind that Psychologists with training in industrial/organizational work should be entitled to charge slightly more than the minimum recommended rates, due to the demand for their specialization.

(Bill) Angus, Test Consultant Recent requests for information from test consultants indicatesthat school psychologists are perceiving a belief among teachers,administrators, and/or parents that it is not valid orsupportable to use English language achievement tests or testsof cognitive functioning (IQ) in making educational decisionsabout ESL students. Some confusion over the definition of achievementtests and the objectives of such tests is evident in these conversations.A distinction should be made between achievement tests and ability(IQ) tests. A distinction also needs to be made between thosewho have not learned because they have not been offered instructionand those who have a handicap which requires that instructiontake the form of devising work-arounds for their handicap. Studentsfor whom English is a Second Language (ESL students) and otherswhose learning ability is not handicapped in some way are thesubject of this paper. Sullivan's Legacy for Learners It is important to consider the innapropriateness of using student age as a determinant of what instruction a the student should receive in school. All too often in our schools, students' chronological age is used to decide what materials should be presented for instruction. In the late 1980's a numerous series of reports by the BritishColumbia's Ministry of Education and by the Royal Commission onEducation (Sullivan, Barry M., 1987-88 Legacy for Learners andother publications) on the requirements for education in BritishColumbia for the Year 2000 and beyond were produced.Though Sullivan was a learned man possessed of an acute legalmind, he was not an experienced teacher of young children. He made the very good point thatstudents should be schooled with their same age-peers for reasonsof socialization and self-esteem. Unfortunately, much of his work was colouredby his personal belief that achievement is a personal thing nomatter what level of basic skills one possesses. Sullivan challengedthe traditional ideas that passing or grades were important,and questioned educational assessment that would in any way comparea student with his/her peers. In BC, the Ministry of Educationproduced documents too numerous to cite that attempted to provideimplementation details and policy information based on Sullivan'sreports. Sadly, Barry Sullivan was terminally ill at the timehe was finishing his work on the report which he entitled theLegacy for Learners. He did not live to see the legacy of thepolicies which resulted. If he had, it is possible that he might have revisedsome of his opinion. In 1996, nearly a decade after the Legacy to Learners, studentshave been routinely promoted into classes where they will receive instructionand independent assignments which merely frustrate them becausethe work is far too difficult for them to understand. This is not to be blamed entirely on Sullivan's reports, as promotion decisions which were changed in response to the Year 2000 document only made a minor contribution in this area. I argue this because of a personal observation that the school system as a whole was already doing very little to insure that instruction and materials of an appropriate level of difficulty were being offered to all students. It is true that after Sullivan's report, promotion to the next level of schooling (grade?) became almost automatic. The good idea of keeping students with age-peers was implemented. But insufficient means of insuring that teachers are provided with the resources needed to make diverse and appropriatelesson plans for every individual in their class has been provided. Today we can see that as class load increasedand external resources were reduced, the regular classroom teacherwas in fact given progressively less time and resources with which to prepareand correct individual assignments. It is an interesting aside that research in the U.S. has shownthat bright students face a problem similar to that of slow studentsin the regular classroom. When class instruction and assignmentsare well below their independent learning level, these studentswill experience a great deal of boredom and drop out in far greaternumbers than their age-peers who have lesser ability! The problem of bright studentsreceiving instructional material that is too easy, is even less likely to be resolved than the reverse problem that slow students face. Because even under more traditional views of education, a teacherwho could get all of his students to pass was consideredto be a wonderful teacher. This notwithstanding the factthat for the brightest students, merely being able to pass mayin fact mean that they have received unchallenging instructionthroughout the whole year. The above discussion was intended to deal only with the need to select appropriate educational materials and provide instruction to meet the needs of each student. The topic was broached in attempt to justify the need for good tests to help accomplish this goal. The writer may have seemed unfair in singling out the recommendations of B.C.'s Sullivan Commission for comment. The education system all accross North America has been fairly criticized by parents for failing to provide adequate instruction in the 3 R subjects (reading writing and arithmetic) for more than fifty years. To deal with whether or not the education system merits criticism, or even with the weaknesses of the Sullivan Commission Reports would be topics for a much longer article than this one is intended to be.However, if one accepts Sullivan's contention that schoolsshouldn't use standardized assessments which compare one student'sperformance to that of his/her age-peers,then read no further. This paper is not for you. The writer hasa reasonably thorough understanding of standardized achievement and ability tests andbelieves that they provide useful information. Standardized tests represent a technological advantage. They are very similar in effect to other technology -- for example the wheel and the lever -- in that a properly applied standardized test is a labour savingdevice. A very experienced and unbiased teacher will eventually getmuch of the same information as is provided by tests, simplythrough working with a student individually over time. Tests merely provideeducational information quickly and in an objective way. Achievement Tests and Their Use With Non-handicapped Students Achievement tests are designed to identify the level of academic/schoolskills that a student possesses. It is therefore entirely appropriateto use English language achievement tests when assessing the academicskills of any student who is enrolled in an English language programof instruction -- provided the test objectives match the materialsthe individual will have been exposed to in the curriculum reasonablyclosely. This is true whether or not the individual is a nativeEnglish speaker. By definition, achievement tests are thosetests which identify the appropriate instructional level at whichto begin teaching the student. A teacher who knows how to use standardized tests can use scoreson an achievement test to identify Independent Learning level,Instructional learning level and Frustration level. This allowsthe teacher to... select appropriate material for the student's use in independentlearning select slightly more difficult materials which will be suitablefor use in instructing the student screen out more difficult material which would be frustratingto the student because the pre-requisite skills and concepts forunderstanding instruction have not yet been acquired Diagnostic Achievement Tests: A Subset of Achievement Tests Diagnostic achievement tests are designed for use with individualsthought to be weak in basic skills. By basic skills, we mean thoseschool skills which were taught in previous grades and which arenow required as enabling skills to allow instruction at the individual'spresent grade level. For example, if a student cannot read adequately,then he/she may not be able to take regular class instructionwhere the reading requirements are beyond his/her level of achievement.Diagnostic tests are achievement tests designed to be used withthose who are behind their peers in terms of basic academic skills(usually reading and math). It is certainly appropriate to useEnglish language diagnostic tests with ESL students. However,one should always bear in mind that the distinction between aregular achievement test and a diagnostic achievement test isoften very subtle. For most purposes, there would be no sensein making a distinction, except that diagnostic tests sometimesinclude items one would not bother using with regular classroomstudents. The Stanford Diagnostic Series (SDRT-4th edition, 1996)for example tests knowledge of graphemes & phonemes plus literaland inferential reading comprehension. For students who are nothaving problems with reading it would be sufficient to identifyan overall level of reading comprehension in order to find anappropriate instructional or independent learning level. Thatis, one would expect to be able to measure reading as a wholeskill possibly using a test like Jerry Johns' Basic Reading Inventory (BRI - 6th ed., 1995), or the group administered Degrees of Reading Power (DRP, 1994). Achievement Tests & ESL Populations It is worth mentioning that teachers should not expect the achievementtest results of ESL students to indicate uniform grade placementin all subject areas. As is found with Adult Basic Education (ABE)students, ESL students can be expected to have scores in readingand language subjects which may be several grades behind theirmath and science/practical achievement scores. With ABE studentsreading at a grade five level, we often find math achievement to benear the grade eight level. For adults reading at the high school level however, this reading math difference disappears. The Canadian Adult Achievement Test(CAAT, 1988) and its parent the U.S. Adult Basic Learning ExaminationBattery include math items which would be at a higher grade level than the reading and language items -- if the test were to be presented to normal school-age students.Since there is no reason to assume that we must give a readingtest which is printed in the same booklet as the math tests wewish to use, it can be argued that any achievement battery canbe used with ESL or ABE students. Except for the fact that itis nice to use items that employ age-appropriate language and subject matter,the achievement tests we have available to us are quite adequate for use withESL students. ESL Student from Japan, 1995 Teachers should be aware that it may be necessary to use an achievementbattery with separate math and reading booklets (or to use a widerange test) when testing ESL students. It is possible to conceiveof a regular school achievement test booklet that could have amath test which is too simple for the student and reading andlanguage tests which are too difficult. This would suggest thatthe best achievement tests for use with ESL students might begood quality, individually administered, wide range tests likethe Woodcock-Johnson Achievement Test - Form A (WJ-R, 1989) andWechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT, 1992). If one requires group administerable tests, there are severalbatteries which have separate Math and Reading booklets like SDRT& SDMT (4th ed., 1995) that easily allow administration ofa reading test from one level along with a math test from a higherlevel. One should plan for the probability that a 15 year oldESL students can be expected to achieve faster than a 10 yearold native English speaker receiving the same curriculum. Thisis because the ESL student should have some transferable skillsand abilities that the native English student does not have. Thatis, do not expect a 15 year old ESL student to take the same amountof time to traverse the grade 6 curriculum that a native Englishspeaking grade 6 student will take. Re-assess the ESL studentfrequently to determine if more advanced materials can be presentedmore quickly in the sequence of instruction. Tests of Cognitive Functioning (IQ Tests) Ability tests are variously known as IQ tests, tests of cognitiveability, intelligence tests, tests of cognitive processes, aptitudetests, etc., etc. The goal of these tests is to provide a numberwhich will be relatively constant over the individual's lifetime(regardless of instruction) that represents how able to learnan individual is. These tests generally present tasks which maybe described as being like puzzles, or questions aboutgeneral knowledge. The tests can be verbal (requiringthe use of language) or non-verbal (requiring almost zero languageskills -- the individual may even be able to point to or circlea correct response). Non-verbal tests cannot really sample generalknowledge, and hence do not provide information about this areaof functioning. Luckily, most aptitude scores and most subtestsof IQ tests are highly intercorrelated (usually at approximately+0.8). This means that we can to a limited extent (accountingfor about 60% of the common variance) generalize from an individual'sability as measured by non-verbal IQ tests, to predict what his/herability on other types of IQ tests -- like a verbal ability test written in the student's own language. Until recently, most non-verbal tests (i.e.Ravens Matrices and TONI-2) have been brief unidimensional widerange tests which consisted of a small set of steeply graded items.These tests were characterized by relatively few items at eachlevel of difficulty. More recently a new test, the Comprehensivetest of Nonverbal Intelligence (CTONI, Don Hammill, 1995) hasbeen released which consists of six sets of steeply graded items.Admin. time for all 6 subtests is 1 hour. Though this test isa wide range test and hence has many of the same problems as themore unidimensional wide range tests, at least it presents a more multidimensional picture of non-verbal IQ. The problem with using English language IQ tests with people fromdifferent cultures, is that they may not fairly represent theindividual's ability to learn. This is especially trueof general knowledge types of items -- though the criticismhas been extended to even non-verbal items. The critics statethat in some cultures, the individual is only seldom exposed topaper and pencil types of tasks. Thus, say the critics, ratherthan measuring enabling skills our IQ tests are measuring achievement.Even the mere ability to sit and take a test may represent anachievement that the individual may have just learned. This argumentbecomes a bit like the nature-nurture question in psychology inthat it is best left to academics and ascetics to argue. For agood criticism of IQ tests see for example just about anythingthe very prolific Robert Sternberg has written over the last 15years. A whole issue of the American Psychologist was recentlydevoted to a good general discussion of IQ tests including a sectionby Sternberg (vol. 51, No.2, Feb, 1996). For practical informationon how to use these tests any one of a number of general textswill suffice. E.G. Assessment of Children (Jerome Sattler,1992), WISC-3 Companion (Truch, 1993). For general informationon Fairness in Testing see the American Psychologist,November 1994 (vol.49, no.11) although this article focuses somewhat on fairness issues in vocational testing. Contrary to one's impression from reading Sternberg's prolificwritings, what is most surprising to beginning practitioners isthat the authors of IQ tests have been able to accomplish theirtask moderately well. Results of IQ tests do seem to be reasonablyconstant and stable over time. It is amazing to some people (especiallyparents) that individuals with low IQ can often be given a greatdeal of high quality, expensive/intensive instruction and stillend up having IQ scores that are similar to the score they hadbefore the instruction. However, this is precisely how the testsare supposed to work, so it is really not all that surprising. The notion that ability scores stay reasonably stable over time meets with some resistance from certain teachers, who rightly contend that all children are capable of increasing their knowledge of basic skills. Children advance over time. However as one individual achieves greater proficiency, so too have his/her peers increased their knowledge. The result is that relative to same-age peers, an individual's ranking tends to remain relatively constant on IQ tests. Teaching the tasks on IQ tests would not help. A wise school psychologist once told me that we could give studentsclasses in block design (block design is one of the WISC-3 subtests),but that wouldn't really be increasing their intelligence. Allwe would actually accomplish would be to destroy the validityof the blocks subtest of Wechsler's scales for use as an indicatorof the intelligence of students. Use of Achievement & IQ Tests in Combination Achievement and ability tests should be used together. The properuse of IQ tests for educators teaching students who don't havea neurologically based problem, is in obtainingachievement vs. ability comparisons. If a biologically normalindividual has an IQ of 115 and obtains achievement scores atthe 45th %'ile, then it is probable that the individual can immediatelybenefit from having a teacher or school psychologist provide anindividualized educational plan (IEP) and may benefit from seeingthe school counselor to find out if something in his/her home life is interfering withlearning. If the individual has an IQ that isone standard deviation above the mean, then, through instruction,theory suggests that achievement test scores should be able to approach one standarddeviation above the mean. I use this example with tongue in cheeksince, with scores so near the mean, this individual is unlikely toqualify for the services of a learning assistance teacher (norprobably for the services of the school counselor) -- though they may receive help if they exhibit a behavior problem. Conclusion What benefits do standardized tests offer regular classroom teachers and/or learning assistance teachers of ESL students? Basicallyby the definition of achievement tests, it is supportable to useEnglish language achievement tests to place ESL students withinprovincial or state reading or math curricula. These tests are a labour-saving device that helps identify the best point in the curiculum to begin teaching. Some (diagnostic) achievement tests also provide information about strengths and weaknesses in terms of basic skills being taught in the curriculum. Diagnostic achievement tests should be used with those who seem tobe having difficulty acquiring basic reading or math -- for withoutthe enabling skills, higher academic learning is not possible.We may conclude that one should be very careful usingIQ tests with ESL students. That is, use the tests, but be awarethat they may not represent the ceiling of what an individualis capable of learning quite as much as they do with native Englishspeakers.

How Do I Get a Copy of a Test For Evaluation or To Use In My Research? You may be able to find some information that will help in evaluating a test in a book in your university library. For evaluating the test itself, you will need to buy a copy. Test publishers as a group have decided not to offer free copies for evaulation purposes. Moreover, you are expected to treat the evaluation copy you purchase in accordance with the proper procedures for handling tests, even though you are asked to pay for the evaluation copy. People who are new to testing sometimes have a problem with the expected standard of behavior for test users. However, if you view these standards from the perspective of the test publisher and the other users of these tests, they will come to make sense. Most test publishers allow for the purchase of a single copy of a test and/or manual for evaluation. That is, normally you do not have to buy 25 copies of a test just to look it over. Whenever you see an item entitled examination kit or specimen set it will usually contain a sample copy of the printed test forms and a manual (though usually not a scoring key). Sometimes it will be possible to purchase a test manual (which may have a copy of the test reproduced in an appendix). This at least will allow you to determine if you want to go to the expense of purchasing a kit which provides all the materials necessary for several administrations. Specimen sets are sold for evaluation purposes. Once you have received them, you may not return them for a refund. The test publishing industry does not function as a library system. Nor does it support the gratis promotional system common in book publishing. Free copies of tests are almost never given to people for promotional purposes. Most publishers will not reduce the rate at which copyrighted test materials are sold to researchers. If a special edition of a test needs to be printed, such arrangements can only be negotiated directly with the publisher. Typically rights to reproduce tests are not granted at all, or if they are granted require the purchaser to pay all costs of printing up their own copies, plus 60% of the regular edition selling price (as a royalty).

What Is Copyright Law and How Does It Apply to Testing Materials? Overview Copyright Law holds that an individual legal entity (the publisher) may own the rights to make and sell copies of an original work (sometimes referred to as an intellectual property). The rights of ownership of the work may be held by the publisher, but are more frequently held by an author who assigns his rights to a publisher in exchange for a contracted royalty based on returns from the sale of copies by the publisher. Copyright Law is therefore very important to authors and to members of the publishing industry. This industry includes book publishers, software publishers, test publishers, and many other types of businesses. Users who possess a legitimate copy of a test purchased from a test publisher do not have the right to make copies of the test, or any part thereof, without a contract which assigns the publisher's right to make copies. What Parts of Tests Are Considered Intellectual Property? Test publishers take a position that all parts of a test -- test booklets and questionnaire forms, answer documents, keys, norms, manual and instructions -- are copyright. This position is quite defensible, in that actual reproductions of a work are fairly blatant violations of the priciples outlined in copyright laws. However, test publishers also contend that the information as to how to score a test (the key and norms) is intellectual property that is covered by copyright law. That is, you may buy a copy of a test manual, but you may not use the information contained therein, except as specified by the test publisher. This contention is only marginally defensible, though case law and out of court settlements seems to favor test publishers. In a sense however, asking people to refrain from using information contained in books that they have purchased (test manuals), in whatever way they see fit, becomes a bit ridiculous. At a certain point this becomes like asking all grade 1 students who learn to read from a text book to only engage in reading as directed by the publisher of the text book -- for the rest of their lives. Because legal costs are so high, most individuals faced with a legal challenge by a large publishing company have backed down. Most have declared bankruptcy, some others have spent their resources trying to reach a settlement with the publisher. None seem to have taken the more expensive route of trying to establish sensible definitive copyright precedents. Most test users concur that it is best to let the publishers "have it their way". After all, if publishers did not invest in producing the tests, either there would be no easy access to high quality tests, or test publishers would simply refuse to sell copies of their keys and norms. Keys and norms could be kept as a trade secret of the publisher and tests could only be scored by a licensed agent of the publisher. The contention that test publishers make that would seem at first to be the most difficult to substantiate in a court, is the claim that whenever you administer a test to a client, you must use the test forms which they sell -- and that you must purchase these forms for whatever price the publisher wishes to charge -- if you wish to use the test. This charge can range from 1 dollar per page to several dollars per page, even if the page is only a form on which an examinee marks down his responses to test questions. The questions may be on a different form altogether which you also must purchase. The cost imposed on users by publishers seems to be born with good humor. Most people are happy to have some place where they can obtain tests, and realize that if publishers went broke, or if, as a group, they began to refuse to sell keys and norms, then the whole test user population would be worse off. The writer believes that, on balance, only a few test publishers abuse copyright law. Traditionally publishing has been an honorable business. Today this tradition shines through, even though tarnished in some places. Copyright © 1996, M.D. Angus & Associates Ltd.

Form A has been specially adapted for use with High School students, and High School norms are provided. Form B was normed on Community College and university Students. DAT is a battery of subtetsts, some or all of which may be administered. Inexpensive computer scoring is available for small or large group administrations of the test. Subtests: Verbal Reasoning, Numerical Ability, Abstract Reasoning, Clerical speed & Accuracy, Mechanical Reasoning, Space Relations, Spelling, and Language Usage. The subtests VR+NA are often used to give an index of General Ability to Learn. DAT attempts to assess "how well this individual may be expected to learn", rather than "at what grade level should materials in reading, math and science instruction be pitched to suit this individual". The verbal and numeric domains tested determine whether the examinee has the basic enabling skills which will allow him to excel in any course of instruction. A Career Planning Questionnaire (CPQ) is optionally included to provide a self report measure of the individual's interests that may be compared with his/her ability as determined by the DAT. A computer scoring option if both DAT & CPQ are administered is also available.

DAT is battery of 8 separately administered subtests. Verbal Reasoning (VR, Numerical Ability (NA), Abstract Reasononing (AR), Mechanical Reasoning (MR), Space Relations (SR), Manual Speed and Accuracy (MSA), Spelling (SP) and Language Usage (LU). DAT is widely used in vocational counselling and in pre-employment testing. The battery comes with a quick interest inventory, though vocational counsellors usually use the test with a more comprehensive interest inventory (like JVIS listed separately in this catalog). For pre-employment testing, the level 2 battery is used. The vocational interest test is never used and usually only a subset of the aptitude battery is administered. Frequently the first two subtests (VR & NA), plus any of the other DAT subtests which apply to the job one wishes to test for, are used. Exam. kit includes Level 1 Test Bklt., Level 2 Test Bklt., Directions for Administration, Level 1 and Level 2 Ans.doc with Career Interest Inventory, Perceptual Speed and Accuracy - Part 1 Ans.sheet, Practice Test, and Directions for Administration of Practice Test. Machine Scorable Ans. docs. are for use with NCS Sentry Scanners. Ready-Score answer docs (DAT only) record and score test responses at the same time. Includes one Perceptual Speed and Accuracy - Part 1 answer sheet and one pamphlet, Profiling Your DAT Scores, for each Ready-Score answer document. Counselor's manual is a guide to using the DAT in conjuction with the Career Interest Inventory. Sample score reports and suggestions for interpreting the reports are included. This manual is not needed for pre-employment testing. Level 1 is used with students and or adults who may have academic skills at a grade 7-9 level. Level 2 is used with high school students or adults who may have GED or better.

The 1986 edition of the GATB is comprised of two test booklets with 4 separately sold answer sheets and two pegboards (small parts and gross motor). The booklets refer to neither imperial nor metric measurement specifically. Canadian norms are available for Parts 1 to 7 of forms A & B of the test. NOTE: Because the pegboards are expensive and realtively difficult to administer, many people opt to use only the first seven GATB aptitude tests (omitting the manual board tests). For normal clients this is probably reasonable. However if information about the level of manual motor coordination of clients is needed, a full administration must be done. For example a full administration is often done if one suspects neurological impairment, as in alcoholics. RANGE: Grades 9 to Adult ADMINISTRATION: The test may be administered to small groups except for the small parts and gross motor test. Time required is just over one hour.

JVIS is a gender fair, psychometrically designed interest inventory, suitable for use in both the U.S. and Canada. The revised (1994) extended computer report was designed to assist individuals of high school age or older with educational and career planning decisions in today's economy. The basic scales include: creative arts, performing arts, mathematics, physical science, engineering, life science, social science, adventure, nature/agriculture, skilled trades, personal service, family activity, medical service, dominant leadership, job security, stamina, accountability, teaching, social service, elementary education, finance, business, office work, sales, supervision, human relations management, law, professional advertising, author/journalism, academic achievement, technical writing, independance, planfullness, and interpersonal confidence. Ten occupational themes are derived from these 34 basic scales. The extended computer report includes in addition to the above, a profile of similarity to 17 educational field clusters, ranking in terms of similarity of the examinees scores to those of 32 occupational group clusters, and a narrative summary of the three most similar groups. The test consists of 289 pairs of forced-choice statements which describe job related activities. In each item, the examinee must choose one of the two alternatives presented that best describes him or her. Hand scoring is easily accomplished without the use of a stencil key. Hence the test may be self-scored by examinees if they are able to follow directions accurately. However, the major benefit of the test is obtained via the extended report which is computer generated. The computer based scoring uses Pearson correlation to fit the scale configuration produced by the examinee to configurations produced by groups of workers and professionals engaged in different occupations. A rough approximation of this information is available to counsellors doing hand scoring using information contained in the Occupations Guide (1995). SigmaSoft is a computer administered version of JVIS which provides scoring and reporting of responses the examinee enters directly into an IBM-PC. For groups, paper and pencil administration using pre-paid answer sheets will probably be preferred. LANGUAGES: English, French, Spanish (English is assummed unless specified on your order). RANGE: Secondary School - Adult ADMINISTRATION: group, 45 minutes. Starter Set: contains Manual, Application Handbook, Test booklet, two handscore answer sheets and two profile/guide forms, plus one pre-paid extended report answer sheet. If you have used handscorable answer sheets, but want an Extended Report (app. 12 pages) for your client, mail or fax the answer sheets to us and the scoring can be performed in our office. The cost for this service is 16.50 per scoring (normal shipping charges apply).

VPI is essentially a brief personality test that employs occupational item content and is based on Holland's theory that occupations can be described in terms of personality characteristics. The VPI has proven useful as an aid to counsellors with those clients who obtain undifferentiated or ambiguous profiles on other interest tests, because it usually produces a clear-cut profile. Although similar to Holland's Self-Directed Search, the VPI is a psychological inventory rather than a vocational counselling tool. VPI assesses five dimensions not covered by the SDS, but offers less comprehensive career assessment. There are 160 occupations listed, divided into eleven scales: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional, Self-Control, Status, Masc/Fem, Infrequency, and Acquiescence. New all-in-one test booklet/answer sheet/profile forms are now available for easy administration and scoring, and eliminate the need for separate forms and a key.

Paul TTCT is probably the best available test of creativity. It can be used with a wide age range of clients -- from young school age children to adults. Four important mental characteristics of gifted and talented individuals are assesed: Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. TTCT asks the examinee to produce as many different solutions as he/she can in response to a presented problem. The examinees' responses are then scored based on production (the number of ideas presented) and divergence (the range of different types of ideas produced). Standardized scoring rules are provided which allow comparison of results. This test takes some time to score due to the free-response format. However, our experience has shown that creativity assessment is not very amenable to the more common multiple choice format. Verbal TTCT uses word-based exercises and Figural TTCT uses picture-based exercises. Verbal TTCT can be administered orally to students in the K-3 range. The authors suggest that scores should be interpreted by persons with psychometric training. The Technical Manual provides norms and validity/reliability data. Monograph #1 is titled Survey of uses of the TTCT. Monograph #2 is entitled Using the TTCT to Guide the Teaching of Creative Behavior. Monograph #3 is titled Guidelines for Administration and Scoring: Comments on Using the TTCT. Tests include: 20 booklets, directions manual, 20 scoring worksheets & 1 class record sheet. Verbal Technical Supplement includes information on recent norming studies for the verbal TTC. Examiner's kit includes only the stimuli needed to administer the test (drawings and stuffed animals) Streamlined scoring for figural tests is optional but recommended.

The questionnaire is divided into two parts. Part one assesses 16 normal personality dimensions -- all analogous to the well known 16 P.F. scales. Part two assesses hypochondriasis, agitated depression, suicidal depression, anxious depression, guilt, energy level, boredom, and five other dimensions in the pathology domain. Many psychologists use only part one with normal range clients (especially in pre-employment testing) as this reduces the time necessary for examination by half. However this practice will mean a) no information about the client's psychopathology will be provided b) the second order factors cannot be worked up from the resulting profile. A version of CAQ not listed below is available that includes the entire 16PF in addition to the CAQ items. Contact us if information on the longer version is required. RANGE: 16 years or older.

POD is a measure of attitudes and values in terms of concepts of the actualizing person - one who is more fully functioning and lives a more enriched life. The POD represents a refinement and extension of concepts first measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI) and meets the need of counselors, therapists and personnel administrators for a comprehensive objective measure of concepts in humanistic psychology. The POD makes operational the theoretical work of Maslow and the rhythmic polarity concepts of the author. POD items are comparatively non-threatening which facilitates communication of the results and provides a positive approach to personality assessment. NOTE: This test is only computer scored.

PRF yields 22 scores for broad personality traits relevant to the functioning of normal individuals in a variety of settings. Based on Murray's framework for the description of personality, PRF focusses on areas of normal functioning rather than on psychopathology. it is therefore perhaps most useful in organizational and educational settings. The current revision (1984) of PRF is form E, which is comprised of 352 true-false items. Scales include: Absement, Achievement, Affilliation, Aggression, Autonomy, Change, Cognitive Stucture, Defendence, Desireability, Dominance, Endurance, Exhibition, Harmavoidance, Impulsivity, Infrequency, Nurturance, Order, Play, Sentience, Social Recognition, Succorance, and Understanding. The wording of this test is simplified as much as possible to allow administration with low literacy individuals and young people. the test may be hand scored, or one of two computer generated reports can be purchased. The basic report is 2 pages long and provides scores on the PRF scales plus preprinted verbal descriptions of what each scale measures. The extended report provides scores for the PRF scales plus scores on 8 vocational preference scales. Introductory text and prose descriptions of the scales makes the extended report easier for examinees to understand. the SigmaSoft system allows onscreen administration and scoring of PRF on an IBM-PC.

BPI is a multiphasic personality inventory intended for use with both clinical and normal populations to identify sources of maladjustment and of personal strengths. BPI may be used with a variety of adolescent and adult groups. Consisting of 240 true/false items, 11 substantive clinical scales and one critical item scale are provided. Scales include: hypochondriasis, anxiety, depression, thinking disorder, denial, impulse expression, interpersonal problems, social introversion, alienation, self depreciation, persecutory ideas, and deviation (critical item scale). Scale construction was designed to emphasize the substantive relationship between item content and the construct underlying the scale. Empirical item selection procedures highlighted convergent and discriminant item properties, suppression of desirability responding, and scale homogeneity and generalizability. Separate adult and adolescent norms are reported in the manual. The BPI may be hand scored in less than 10 minutes, using a single template and profile sheets with male and female norms on alternative sides. Examination kit for handscoring includes: manual, 10 reusable test booklets, scoring template, 25 hand scorable answer sheets, and 25 profile sheets plus one prepaid coupon for a mail in computer generated report.

McKinley This new revision of MMPI provides a 577 item questionnaire with no duplicate items (the original MMPI was 550 items with 16 exactduplicates). MMPI-2 can be purchased in either hardcover or softcover edition -- though the test is priced to discourage use of the hardcover edition. The test revision involved two major changes. New norms for the basic clinical scales were provided and the item pool was expanded to include items useful on some new content scales. Though MMPI-1 scales were completely renormed, interpreting these scales requires equating the new "numbers" to the rresearch database of interpretive information (which was based on the old system of scoring). For those who use special scales, a table provided in the manual enables translation from MMPI-1 Group Form item numbers to MMPI-2 item numbers and vice-versa. Thus, if the items on which your own scale is based are still included in the table, you can easily make up your own key and score your research scales from the new edition questionnaires. The MMPI-2/MMPI Interpretive Manual (Greene, 1991 listed separately in this catalog) is a good source of information on interpreting the MMPI. The Microtest System requires specific hardware and software for in-house scoring which must be obtained through NCS. Arion II is a Teleprocessing Service where data is transmitted from your computer to NCS for scoring and reports are received on your own printer. Computer scoring of this test is expensive on a per case basis. No system exists whereby one can buy a computer scoring program that can be used an unlimited number of times to score this test -- unless the authors violate the test publisher's copyright.

MAACL-R measures affects of Anxiety, Depression and Hostility. 132 adjectives are available for administration under two standardized test sets, In General, and Today Now. Additional scales have been developed based on factor analysis. These are Positive Affect and Sensation Seeking. Both trait and state forms on the new MAACL-R are standardized scales which have been shown to differentiate patients with affective disorders from other types of patients as well as from normals. It is anticipated that the revised MAACL scales will be even more useful than the earlier scales in studies of stress and stress reduction, diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders, and in basic research on personality and emotions. Two summary scores obtained are: Dysphoria (Dys=A+D+H) and Positive Affect and Sensation Seeking (PASS=PA+SS) RANGE: high school, college, and adult ADMINISTRATION: 5 minutes for either form Specimen Set includes manual and 1 copy of all forms.

The SRE evolved from Adolf Meyer's "life chart". Beginning in 1949, 5,000 case histories of patients with a variety of disorders were reviewed, along with chronologically arranged information provided by the patient about his or her recent experiences.

The system is comprised of two questionnaires (BAP and post-BAP), plus an optional screener. The comprehensive BAP samples information about psychosocial factors that might influence pain. The post-treatment evaluation (post-BAP) samples information about the effectiveness of treatment and residual problems. BAP yields a total score "disability index" of pain and 35 separate clinical scales. The computer generated report runs to 17 pages. Post-BAP yields similar information. The Post-BAP computer scoring program allows analysis of the significance of changes over the course of treatment -- since the BAP was administered. The screening inventory (called BAP-SI) may be used to determine if assessment with the two comprehensive forms is warranted.

Six subtests are included. Subjects are asked to memorize 40 words presented in a paired-associates format. The learning list is presented twice and the subject effort is assessed in an immediate recognition (IR) subtest. One half hour later a Delayed recognition (DR) subtest is administered. Other subtests are Multiple Choice Recognition (MC), Paired Associates Recall (PA), Free Recall (FR) which use the same 40 stimulus words. An optional Long Delayed Free Recall (LD-FR) subtest may be given 20 minutes after FR. WMT is a dual purpose instrument in that it can be used simultaneously to assess memory and malingering. The computer scores the test and reports the results. Software is DOS based and is good for unlimited uses. The author's have done extensive research into the detection of malingering in neuropsychological cases. Computerized Assessment of Response Bias (CARB) is a feigning/malingering test masquerading as a memory test. It is administered by a microcomputer and is primarily useful in conjunction with WMT. A mallingering battery comprised of the WMT and the CARB provides the most reliable information about malingering. The battery is recommended for use with all clients suspected of malingering and with any clients for whom opportunity for secondary gain exists. It was specifically designed to be used in cases where a personal injury claims exist. Research by the authors has indicated... it may be necessary to administer more than one symptom validity test to reliably assess subject effort. Severe misclassification problems were encountered when using CVLT, 21 Items test or Warrington's RMT to assess symptom validity and subject effort. Experienced psychologists were uniformly unable to fake impaired memory on the WMT even when told prior to administration that the WMT is a malingering test.

The innovative theory on which the test is based is that ADD subjects will be less able to learn this task than normal clients. Correlation research is presented in the manual and in journal publications to support this contention. However, no claim is made that the test provides an infallible diagnosis of attention deficit in any individual case. The task is to respond in one of two different ways when given a visual cue on the computer monitor. The computer then plays the cues with a varying length of time in between presentations, and records the subject's ability to perceive and respond correctly to the presented stimulus. The task involves visual processing, immediate motor response, and a decision as to which of two responses to make.

The CBCL-R, and related inventories published by Dr. Achenbach are among the most widely used behaviour assessment tools available for use with schoolage children. The Parent edition (CBCL 4-18) is used to obtain parents' reports of children's competencies and problems. The Youth Self-Report (YSR) is filled out by youths with at least a 5th grade reading level. The Teacher's Report Form (TRF) obtains teachers' ratings of students' problems, and is a companion instrument to the CBCL 4-18. Many people who are ordering the inventories for the first time will be confused by the number of forms available under this title. We suggest that first time users start with the Manual for the CBCL, 1 package of CBCL for ages 4-18, 1 package of boys profiles, 1 package of girls profiles, and the scoring keys. If you plan to use the instrument a great deal the computer scoring option will be more cost effective than hand scoring, as you won't have to buy profile forms or hand scoring stencils. This is especially true if you want to use the Parent Questionnaire, TRF and the YSR together. The computer scoring option "Cross-Informant Report Software" and one package of each of CBCL 4-18, YSR & TRF is the "best buy". Although software may be purchased for each of the three companion instruments separately, the Cross-Informant software scores all three instruments separately OR provides analysis of the differences in perceptions of teacher versus parent, etc. when more than one instrument is used. All Software sold under this title is provided without copy protection and is licensed for an unlimited number of uses on a single PC. The scanning software package can process forms via fax, image scanners, or reflective-read scanners. Information is sent to an IBM compatible computer and converts it to input for the appropriate scoring software. NOTE: Computer scoring programs must be pruchased separately. Fax and Image scanners require Teleform or Remark software. Reflective-Read scanners require ScanTools, ScanBook, or TopScore software. The specimen set contains one copy of all the printed test forms under this title and is provided for content assessment only (each form is stamped SAMPLE). The Client-Entry program (unlimited usage) allows parents, youths, or teachers to enter data directly into the computer. Data is scored immediately using the CBCL/4-18, YSR, TRF, or Cross-Informant program.

Although normative data is based on developmentally disabled persons aged 18-42, it is believed SSKAT is also a valuable instrument in determining sexual knowledge and attitudes of non-retarded persons of all ages. Persons to be tested must have visual and verbal comprehension, but the requirement for expressive language is minimal, since responses to most questions on 13 of the 14 subtests consist of the subjects pointing to a choice of pictures, or indicating simply yes or no. The authors intend the SSKAT to be used as a criterion test to ascertain what an individual knows, believes, or does not know; and do not intend it to be used as a norm-referenced test. The SSKAT consists of realistic pictures illustrating 14 relevant socio-sexual topics. Kit: 227-page Stimulus book, Manual and 10 Record Forms.

For general vision fitness as part of a pre-employment assessment, we recommend the Industrial Screening test set. This is an 15 target set used to evaluate overall visual fitness. Tests include Stereopsis, color discrimination, distance usable vision, near point usable vision, vertical phoria, lateral phoria, and fusion. Form number 5545 should be used for this test. If you are specifcally interested in candidates' ability to see very fine wires or very fine printing on electrical components used in circuit board assembly, we recommend the Near Point Snellen Acuity test.

CDB assesses cognitive variables of primary importance in psychiatric and retarded populations. The test was developed to evaluate the nature and degree of intellectual disorders and to aid in differential diagnosis of mental retardation versus psychosis. Using a Piagetian framework, CDB also serves to distinguish between deficits related to impaired development versus later regression. It is especially useful with intellectually limited, nonverbal, inattentive or overtly psychotic patients who may be unassessable by other means. The CDB focuses on the qualitative deficits and abnormal processes that are of primary concern in a clinical setting. Research on the test shows that it may be used with success in differentiating between schizophrenia, retarded psychotics, normal adults, the elderly and children.

Lee Wiederholt ~ (1995, 1997) This test was first released in 1995. Due to the lack of recent efforts to produce multidimesional non-verbal IQ materials this publication was greeted with enthusiasm. The major criticism of the initial release was that norms were only collected on school-ages. This problem has now been remedied, as adult norms have now been released. The test has been designed to be as unbiased as possible toward language and other environmental factors which contribute to most IQ scores. The 6 subtests are Pictorial Analogies, Geometric Analogies, Pictorial Categories, Geometric Categories, Pictorial Sequences, and Geometric Sequences. Examinees can respond by pointing to the correct response if necessary. CTONI provides a generalized pictorial vs. geometric difference score for the complete test (Nonverbal IQ), as well as for Sequences, Analogies and Categories separately. In addition, Pictorial and Geometric IQ are provided. NORMS: based on more than 2,000 students from 22 different states, plus Canada and Panama -- aged 7-17, New adult norms are available as of Spring 1997. ADMINISTRATION: Individual, 1 hour for all 6 subtests NOTE: a new manual is in production that will provide revised norms and will extend the use of this test to adult ages.

Cattell CFIT were developed to yield a measure of general intelligence. Test scores are relatively free from educational and cultural influences and are useful where environmental factors may influence conventional test scores. Scale 1 consists of eight subtests, is not as free of cultural bias as the other scales and must be, in part, administered individually. Scale 2 and 3 consist of four subtests, all of which are perceptual and non-verbal in nature. Scale 2 & 3 are group administered, and each have 2 equivalent forms A and B.

Kasanin, L. Vigotsky, and P. Wang Also know as the Vigotsky Test, this block sorting task measures the ability to think using abstract concepts. The test consists of 22 blocks of different colors, shapes and sizes, but which are alike in some way. The subject must find the common factor in the blocks and sort them. It is particularly suited for use with uneducated adults, children and special groups such as psychotic patients. Modified manual and Record forms are not included with the set, and must be ordered separately.

Wright Knox's Cube Test (KCT) is a non-verbal mental test which measures the attention span and short-term memory of children and adults. Because attention span and short-term memory are basic to acquiring almost all other skills, the KCT is useful in a wide variety of psychological and educational evaluations. The manual provides procedures and a rationale for administering, scoring and interpreting a comprehensive version of Knox's Cube Test which incorporates previous versions. Directions for the KCT are few, and pantomime can be used for test administration. This makes the KCT useful in evaluating the mental status of the deaf, non-verbal and foreign speaking. This revision of Knox's Cube Test utilizes Rasch measurement procedures to develop an objective psychometric variable, along which both items and persons can be positioned.

Broad areas measured in the achievement area include Reading, Math, Written Language and Knowledge. Three new tests have been added to the Written Language cluster, making it a good measure of writing. New norms were based on over 6,200 subjects. The Cognitive battery was greatly expanded in this revision. It measures 7 different factors: Longterm memory, shortterm memory, processing speed, auditory processing, visual processing, comprehension-knowledge and fluid reasoning. The Cognitive battery is based on the Horn-Cattell model of intellectual processing, an extension of the Gf-Gc theory (fluid and crystalized thinking). A standard Cognitive battery and/or a more comprehensive supplementary cognitive battery are available. Each battery comes with test book, examiner's manual and norm tables, audio cassette, and 25 test records. The achievement battery comes in two equivalent forms. However, Canadian replacement pages are only available for form A. Form B is little used in Canada. SOFTWARE: The W-J-Writer scoring software is definitely recommended. Hand scoring this test is inconvenient because there are many separate tables in which to look up information. The software does all the lookup work and produces the "boiler plate" for a psychoeducational assessment report. All that remains for the psychologist is to "edit in" information from observations, personal interpretation and supplementary tests administered, and to "edit out" any information that doesn't apply. RANGE: 2 - 90 years ADMINISTRATION: Individual, approximately 40 minutes each for the Standard Cognitive and Achievement batteries. NOTE: Part four of the original WJ (Scales of Independent Behaviour) was not included in the revision and is now sold separately. NEW: The Report Writer scores and reports the WJ-R in a manner suitable for use as an aid in writing up psychoeducational assessments. Like the Compuscore, the software is licensed for an unlimited number of uses on a single machine. Orders of 5 or more Compuscores or Report Writers will receive a 10% discount.

The Select-a-Level determines which level to use on the individual. To assess the ability of an individual to perform academicly at the grade 12 level, we strongly recommend that level D be used. Level C does not contain enough difficult items to adequately assess whether or not academic skills are sufficient to allow the individual to do academic work presented in high school. To assess the ability of an adult to do high school level academic tasks, administer level D of this test.

It has a wide range of applications in assessing the level at which individuals or groups read. The test is ideally suited for school assessment of functional reading level at all grades. The Advanced forms and the more difficult levels of the Standard forms are useful in pre-employment testing. DRP measures reading as a "whole skill" using a modified cloze format (the examinee selects the word which best fills in a blank in a sentence from a set of five choices). DRP is unlike most norm referenced tests which examine specific subskill components of reading ability and then generalize that the subskills will be an accurate representation of "overall reading ability". The new 1994 revision of DRP includes two alternate equivalent forms (for test-retest). For students in grade 4 and older, DRP tests consist of 70 item, modified cloze, reading passages. New for 1995 are two Advanced levels of DRP which consist of a 20 item short form of the tests. These forms are designated T&U. The reading passages for these forms are more difficult than the wider-range, longer, tests (standard forms G & H). Actual test length and appropriate age levels are listed in the table below. Advanced DRP (1995) focuses on how well students are able to reason with prose. Primary test booklets are consumed -- there are no answer sheets for these forms. Standard and Advanced test booklets are reusable, and require separate answer sheets. Classroom sets contain all the materials needed to administer and interpret DRP for up to 30 students. Scoring keys must be purchased separately. We recommend the exam kits for evaluating test content. Each kit includes one copy of the test forms, practice exercises, and a manual. These kits are non-returnable.

This revsion of the test features two alternate equivalent forms and a profile analysis form. Three subtests are included. The reading test is a pronunciation test that presents the examinee with printed english words and asks him to read them aloud. In the spelling test the examiner reads a series of words and asks the examinee to write the correct spellings. Reading ability is generalized from the subject's ability to pronounce and to spell the words in the test. The arithmetic test is highly speeded series of progressively more difficult questions. The number of correct answers is tallied to score the test. Virtually nobody is able to complete the arithmetic test in the time given. In all three tests, the "wide range" format involves administration of a steeply graded series of items on which all examinees are expected to demonstrate a measurable amount of success (and failure).

Giddan and J. Stark ACLC (1983) identifies receptive language difficulties in young children and indicates guidelines for correction of language disorders. The test uses a core vocabulary of 50 common words combined into two, three, and four element phrases. No oral responses are required. The child points to an appropriate picture in response to a word or phrase from the examiner. The ACLC Manual (1983) contains helpful discussions of language impairment as well as guidelines for language training. The ACLC is essentially a criterion-referenced instrument, although the Manual does provide mean scores for 6-month age groups from 3 years to 6 years 5 months. A brief screening version is also identified in this new manual. ADMINISTRATION: 10 minutes.

It has also been effective in assessing dementia in developmentally disabled (MR) adults without Down syndrome. DSDS was designed so that persons in the severe and profound ranges can be assessed. The technique was standardized on 70 DS adults and 37 non-DS adults who were followed as part of a seven year longitudinal study in BC, Canada. A concurrent validity (kappa=.81) and reliability study (inter-rater reliability kappa=.91), was done with 50 DS adults in Ontario, Canada. DSDS reliably distinguishes between lifelong impairments and features that represent progressive cognitive deterioration. Scoring crieteria reflect severity of dementia in early middle or late stages. The author contends that younger DS adults may develop a dememtia which is symptomatically identical to Alzheimers disease. However, the early onset dementia is potentially reversible. A single DSDS booklet can be used up to 10 times with the same client. The booklet is used to track recovery in the event that the individual has a reversible dementia.
