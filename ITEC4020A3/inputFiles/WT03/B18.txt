Currently    research  is  being  conducted  by   theUSDA/ARS   in     Beltsville,  MD  and the National Aggregate and Stone Associations     have  a National Task  Force  on Remineralization. The U.S. Bureau     of  Mines  reports there are millions of tons of  gravel  and rock     dustas  a by-product of the sand and  gravel  and stone industries     that are appropriate for remineralization all  over the country.

Remineralize   the  Earth  has a rock dust  primer,  international     gravel and  rock  dust source list, letters and forum, network and     resource list.  You'll find out what's happening around the  world     for   gardens and   farms,    forests  and  orchards, health   and     nutrition    and stabilizing  the climate. You'll learn about  the     cooperative  efforts  of  others,  businesses and  eco-sustainable     projects  from  small  to large scale.     Remineralize  the  Earth is a reflection, forum,  round  table  of     ideas,  experiences   and  research   of  those  concerned    with     networking  and implementing  soil remineralization.     Each  issue  has  48-56  pages  of practical   how-to-remineralize     articles,   the  latest research  and experiences from around  the     world.   We   reach  an  emerging  global grass  roots   community     network.     Restoring Ecological Balance     Remineralization  is regarded by a growing movement  worldwide  as     a  blueprint  for the survival of the Earth, restoring  ecological     balance  and, perhaps, even recreating Eden. The  remineralization     of  forests,  farms, orchards  and  gardens with  glacial   gravel     and   rock  dust  is nature's  way  to  regenerate  and  fertilize     soils.        During   an  Ice  Age, as glaciers grind rock to a  fine   dust     over millennia,  a  fertile soil is created. Adding finely  ground     gravel  dust to soils is a tremendous boost to organic agriculture     and  can make it truly viable by adding up to  a  hundred elements     and  trace  minerals  needed by all life and  by  nourishing   the     microorganisms  in the soil, whose protoplasm is  the   basis   of     all  living   things.  It is an alternative  to  harmful  chemical     fertilizers and pesticides for a truly sustainable agriculture.     Remineralization and the Climate     There   is  evidence  to suggest that as forests  begin   to   die     off  worldwide,   giving off carbon dioxide, the climate  of   the     Earth   is  altered,  triggering  the  transition  from  the  warm     interglacial   to   an Ice  Age. (See Newsweek  11/23/92)  We  are     hastening  this  process   with  the  burning  of  fossil   fuels.     Undertaking  the task of remineralization is urgent   to   restore     our  agricultural  soils,  to  save the dying   forests   in   the     temperate latitudes and stabilize our climate.     A BRIEF PERSPECTIVE     As   Ward   Chesworth  and  co-researchers write  in  Agricultural     Alchemy:     Stones into Bread     "Our most optimistic expectations are no less than the realization     of   an   old   dream:  What  will  fertilizing  with  stone  dust     accomplish?   It  will   turn  stones into  bread...  make  barren     regions (fruitful)  (and) feed the hungry."  Julius Hensel     Bread From Stones  (1894) Soil Remineralization -      A Natural Fertilizer     The  soils of the entire world have become severely  demineralized     by  erosion  over thousands of years. Plants require a  continuous     intake of minerals, just as we do, and for very similar reasons  -     calcium  to  build  structural support, iron to carry oxygen,  and     so   on.  Plants growing on mineraldepleted soil do not get enough     nourishment and  so become smaller, less-abundant and less  hardy,     more  vulnerable to  the insects,  worms and fungi  that prey upon     them.    Remineralization   causes  a   phenomenal    growth    of     the  microorganisms   in   the  soil. It increases  the   nutrient     intake  of plants.     It   counters   the   effects of soil   acidity,   prevents   soil     erosion  (just  for  that reason it would be worth  applying  rock     dust), increases  the  storage  capacity of the  soil, contributes     to   the  building  of precious humus complexes,  has  anti-fungal     properties, and when you spray it on plants it repels  insects  as     well.  The plants and trees become  highly  resistant to  insects,     disease, frosts,  and  drought.     Remineralization  also  enhances  and  speeds  up   the    process     of  composting,  so  if  you  are composting  for   your   garden,     consider putting on some rock dust.     For Agriculture     The  best  source of soil minerals is simple crushed gravel dust.     In  1976   John Hamaker  spread gravel crusher screenings on  part     of    his ten acres  in  Michigan. The following year, in an  area     of  sparse rainfall  and dry summers, and with no irrigation,  his     corn produced 65  bushels per acre, compared to yields of under 25     from  other local farms. Moreover,  when independent analyses were     done,  Hamaker's  corn  was found  to  contain 28% more   protein,     47% more calcium,   57%  more phosphorous,  60% more magnesium and     90%  more   potassium    than  the same type of  corn  grown  with     chemical fertilizers nearby.  Don  Weaver grew 18-foot pole  beans     on remineralized soil  (Jack  and the  Beanstalk?)  and got two to     four  times the normal  organically grown yield.     Alan   LePage  of Vermont grew a crop of carrots averaging   1-1/2     feet  long. And  there  was  no insect damage to any   of    these     crops.  Hamaker  estimates  that  on  fully  remineralized   soil,     American agriculture could grow four times  as much food as it  is     capable   of now  - or the same amount of food at about one-fourth     the cost -  and with no pesticides     or chemical fertilizers.     For Forests     The  results of long term experiments released in 1986 showed that     in  a  forest  where pine seedlings were remineralized,  after  24     years the wood volume was four times higher  than in the untreated     area.  Recent remineralization  trials of a dying forest  on   Mt.     Mitchell   by  Dr.  Robert Bruck, Ph.D.,  showed  12  weeks  after     application  of  rock  dust, height  growth  of   red  spruce  was     increased by 27% over  non-treated controls,  and height growth of     Fraser fir was 19% greater  than  the untreated controls.     (Forestry Research packet p. 9)     The    Men    of    the  Trees  organization  in   Australia    is     doing  remineralization  trials with  many  species  of  trees  in     Australia  with phenomenal  results, such as five times the growth     of  tree   seedlings  of  one  variety  of  eucalyptus,  over  the     untreated controls. (See Forestry Research packet p.17)     The Nutritional Aspect     When   we   eat   food grown on depleted soil we  too,  like   the     plants,   lose  our  natural  resistance  to  disease.   All   the     degenerative  diseases  have  been  on the  rise  in  America   in     recent  decades.   Dietary   fat, cholesterol,  salt  and  overly-     refined   foods  seem  to  be  major   factors,  but   a   serious     deficiency of minerals in our food may  be  another.     Mineral   depletion  of  soils  has  been  found  to  be  directly     correlated  with death rates. And deficiencies of only  one  of  a     number  of   trace minerals  -  copper, iron,  selenium,  etc.   -     have  been  found  in laboratory  studies   to  be associated with     an   increased   risk  of cancer.  You  may   want  to  grow  more     complete, nourishing  food  for yourself and your family.     A Global Perspective On Climate     The    problem   of  soil  demineralization  also  has  a   global     perspective.   It   is  known  that  the  Earth's   soil   becomes     demineralized  during  each interglacial  period,  the  relatively     short 10,000-year  warm  period between each 90,000-year major Ice     Age.   Consequent  decline and death of the  world's  forests  and     other  vegetation which occurs causes great quantities  of  carbon     dioxide  to  be  given off. The level of  carbon dioxide   in  the     Earth's  atmosphere has been rising exponentially   for  the  past     century.  Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse  gases  trap  excess     heat from the sun, potentially affecting the world's climate.     It   is  also well-known that when the glaciers advance  and  then     recede  during each recurrent  Ice Age, they grind down  rocks  in     their  path,  and this mineral-rich  dust  is blown far  and  wide     over   the   surface   of  the Earth,  remineralizing   soils  and     causing plant life to thrive again.     John   Hamaker  has supplied one missing piece of a cosmic  puzzle     to provide  an explanation,  long sought, of the  awesome  100,000-     year cycle of major Ice Ages.     Hamaker points out that the greenhouse effect occurs primarily  in     the  tropics, which get  the most  sun, rather  than in the  polar     regions    which   get  very  little.  When  this  happens,    the     temperature  differential   between  the  tropics  and  the  poles     increases,   resulting  in  fierce  wind   systems,    hurricanes,     tornadoes and storms. The moisture picked up  by  these increasing     storm  systems also is transported to the higher latitudes,  where     it   gets  deposited  as snow and ice, eventually    bringing   on     glaciation and the next Ice Age.       This has  been happening  in  recent years,  with  record   snow     cover in the Northern Hemisphere  and  a shortening of the growing     season,  by  weeks  in  some places, a  pattern  which   is   also     accelerating year by year.  Hamaker  estimates  that within  a few     decades  the  growing  season may have decreased   so   much  that     millions of people will starve, in the richer nations as  well  as     the   poorer.   Remineralization of the world's soils and  forests     will  store   carbon   and  contribute to  climate  stability.  By     assuming  the task  of  remineralizing the Earth's soils, much  as     the   glaciers  do during an Ice Age, we can create fertile  soils     and abundance.  We can re-create Eden.     A ROCK DUST PRIMER     What Type of Rock Is Best?     Feeding  poor soil with mixed rock dust may be compared to feeding     an  ill   person  a  varied diet of unrefined, natural food.    If     no   one  single food is a panacea, it might follow that no single     rock type is "ideal." Indeed, the virtue of glacial gravel is said     to lie  in  its broad spectrum of rock types.     Hamaker   advocates  the use of glacial   gravel   dust,   ideally     followed   by  river and seashore gravels and mixtures  of  single     rock  types. John Hamaker in the book The Survival of Civilization     suggests finelyground  glacial gravel because that is nature's way     throughout     millennia  to  create  fertile soils.  Glacial  gravel,  which  is     a  natural  mixture  of rocks, will create  a  broad  spectrum  of     minerals in the  soil  in  a natural balance. Much of value can be     gleaned   from  Europe  and  the  research and  experiences  there     (where  single  rock types  and  combinations of single rock types     are  used.)   Hamaker's approach, however, may very well offer  an     even  greater potential  for an ecologically sustainable and sound     agriculture and forestry.     Does It Need To Be a Special Kind of Gravel?     Again,   the   analogy  of  feeding soils  to  feeding  humans  is     pertinent. From  simplistic  notions of human dietary requirements     as  straight protein-fat-carbohydrate ratios, our understanding of     specific    human   dietary   needs  has   grown   to   staggering     sophistication and complexity, and we are now learning  that  what     we don't know may exceed what we do.       Similarly,  we  have come a long way from the simple  NPK  idea.     But  no  amount  of controlled  research has conclusively told  us     (or   likely will  ever tell us) precisely which minerals specific     plants really need and  in what precise proportion.     The   attempt to second-guess nature in all her complexity is sure     to  be  a  futile and perpetual game of catch-up.  Hamaker asserts     that:  "Microorganisms select what they need to make the compounds     of   life, and  reject  to  the subsoil what is not needed,  [such     as]   aluminum, silicon, iron, etc., which are generally in excess     [in  gravel dust]," further pointing to "the  Kervran research  on     biological   transmutations",  which   suggests  that   biological     organisms   may  play  an  active  role not   only   in  selecting     specific elements, but also in modulating their     elemental  nature  to  create needed materials where they  are  in     short supply.     Hamaker  says: As long as the soil is neutral [in pH] or close  to     it,  microorganisms will control what goes into the  plant  roots.     These  controls are off  when the soil is acid or acidic chemicals     are added.     Composting With Rock Dust     Combining   gravel dust with organic materials in  compost  is   a     great  way   to   solve  application problems  and  speed  up  the     process.   Don't  forget   a  handful of soil  to  inoculate  with     organisms.   Gravel  dust improves  aeration  and   structure  and     therefore  prevents  rotting. Gravel dust is assimilated even more     quickly  in  compost than in poor soils. Compost and gravel   dust     are    a   symbiotic   combination:   the  compost  provides    an     excellent  medium   for  the "microorganism population  explosion"     promoted  by  the dust,  and  the  gravel dust will not only  help     create   more organic matter,  but  will  also  help  hold  it  in     place,  reduce  odors  and conserve it. Add 2-20 lb. of rock  dust     per  cubic  yard  of  compost,  if one is  doing  pile  or  window     composting.     Soil Acidity     Soil   pH   should   be  measured  annually.  If   the   soil   is     acidic,  agricultural  limestone may be added  together  with  the     rock   dust   to bring  the soil pH to neutral. Gravel  dust  will     also  neutralize  soils to  a  great degree, but  limestone  is  a     quick remedy for agricultural soils.  Limestone is not recommended     for  forests as it  will  destroy the humus-building complex  over     the long term.     Keep Insects In Natural Balance In Your Garden     For  short-term rescue, very fine  dust sprayed directly on plants     and  trees  has  been  shown  in  research  in  Germany  to  deter     insect  infestations very effectively. Trails of rock dust  around     the   garden  help   keep   slugs out. And  healthy  remineralized     plants  will  not  be plagued by insect infestations in  the  long     term.     How To Apply Gravel Dust     There   are many ways to apply dust to the soil; which method  you     use  depends  on the scale and your preference.  It can be  spread     by   hand out  of  a  wheelbarrow, or roto-tilled and disked   in.     Farmer   John Sundquist applies it with a manure spreader,  bander     or  an "E-Z  Flow" type  fertilizer applicator. He also uses  rock     dust in a potting soil made of compost, ashes and peat moss.      How Much To Use     A  grower  of crops or a gardener needs a good response the  first     year   after  a  fall application.  The response in any  one  year     depends   on    the   amount   of   minerals  available   to   the     microorganisms,   soil moisture and the amount  of  inert  organic     matter.          If the last two factors are satisfactory, as little as 3 tons     of  gravel  dust  per acre worked into the top 4  inches  of  soil     should  give good  results.  However, I prefer about 10  tons  per     acre   worked   in  about   8 inches, since one  application  will     eliminate the cost  of  a number of more frequent applications and     give high yields.     The   Application Conversion chart (shown in magazine)  will  help     you  to   determine  how  much gravel dust to use:   3  tons   per     acre  is considered  the  minimum  application,  10  tons/acre  is     Hamaker's  preferred long-term application, and  20  tons/acre  is     given as a major     remedial  application,  for especially  dry,  poor  soil.  Smaller     amounts are recommended if the rock dust is finer than 200 mesh.     Sources   of rock dust as a natural fertilizer and soil  amendment     are  available   from local sand and gravel  quarries,  and  there     are   many products  available on the market. Costs at a sand  and     gravel   quarry  vary    from  $1-8./ton.   Specially   formulated     products   are   more expensive   but  often  more  effective  and     easy   to   apply.

Let's talk about the cycles of the flea.  There are three differenttypes   of  fleas,  the  Cat  Flea  (Ctenocephalides),  The  Dog   Flea(Ctenocephalides) and The Human Flea (Pulex irritans). The Cat Flea  isthe  one we are most interested in as the other two are very rare.  CatFleas  not  only  like cats, dogs, and humans but they also  like  manyother species such as rats, chickens, etc. The Life Cycle of the Cat Flea      Adult  fleas lay eggs outside in the grass or any warm safe  place(usually near a warm blooded host). The eggs develop into legless larvawhich  feeds  on tiny amounts of organic matter for up  to  one  month.Usually  the eggs are laid on the hosts which then drop to the  ground.If inside they fall on the carpet, etc. The larvae do not bite but liveoff  dried blood defecated by the adult fleas. Outdoors the larva  willlie in a shady moist spot. The larva then becomes a pupae by spinning acocoon and emerge in about a week as a hungry adult.     The  cycle  for reproduction is 30 to 60 days and is triggered  bythe  presence of the host's warmth and the carbon dioxide given  off  bythe host's respiration. The Larvae can live up to 6 months and the pupaecan live to a year until the conditions are right for emergence.     What  this  means  is  that if you have  just  moved  into  a  newapartment  or  home  which previously had a dog or cat as a tenant  is  that  yourpresence,  or your  cat's  or  dog's could trigger off their  emergence!  Manypeople  have allergic reactions to flea bites while others never noticeit.  Fleas  usually do not bite humans unless there are no other  hostsaround. Control Methods      Your  treatment  should be spread out over a 60 day  period.  Thismeans that you should do regular flea treatments every month if you arein  areas  prone  to having fleas. I have two cats and one  dog.  I  knowfleas.  The cats clean themselves and generally don't like to  be  toldwhat  to do or to have anything done to them, but they can be helped  aswell as the dogs. Fleas and dogs, fleas and cats, they go together.  It'sunnatural  for  there  never to be fleas again. WE  can't  totally  ridourselves  of  them any more then we can totally rid ourselves  of  theants. The answer here is to control and reduce them. The formulas givenhere  along with the hints are to help you keep fleas out of the  houseand off your animals. Follow these hints and you will succeed.     Many  flea  collars on the market contain Sevin which attacks  thenervous  system of the insect (as well as your pet's nervous system  andours  as  well). I have seen flea collars which contain  DDT!  Thecompanies are getting smart and are using Pyrethrium but are screwing upwhen  they  add Piperonyl butoxide to boost it up. This  product  hasbeen  associated  with  liver disorders. You should  avoid  using  thisproduct.  Especially avoid using around children or  seniors  or  thosewith  health problems  1. Insist on using only pure pyrethrium flowers (thewhole  plant).  Read  the ingredients. ARBICO, REAL  GOODS,  GARDENER'SSUPPLY  are  a  few  places you can buy pure Pyrethrium  (see  resourcesdirectory). Also available at many garden centers, etc.,_______________________________     1 See pyrethrium info in ant chapter Last Update: 12/25/96 Web Author: Andrew Lopez Copyright �1997 by The Invisible Gardener - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WT03-B18-5IA072-000464-B044-388http://www.invisiblegardener.com:80/th30001.htm 207.158.219.161 19970121025426 text/html 21151HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Tue, 21 Jan 1997 02:54:23 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b4Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 08:17:39 GMTETag: "d0344e-51ac-32dde423"Content-Length: 20908Accept-Ranges: bytes Resources Resources Resources GOTO Resources!for links to other resources.

While  ants learn quickly, people do not. So  don't  beashamed  that  it will take you and the ants  some  time  tounderstand what you want of them and what they want of  you.Don't use any poison at this point.  Allow the ants to feed freelyfrom the ant cafe.  They need to know it as the source of  food.Watch and see if they are entering and actually taking awaythe food and or water.     During  this time you should be using the Dr.  BronnersPeppermint soap or some other natural soap as per chapter one"Dances with Ants", inside the house and along any paths theants are using. Do not spray the ant cafes!      Ants  like a mixture that has a lot of water in  it  since wateris an important part of their diet, so  I make  1/2 water andenough sugar, whether it is honey or white sugar  or whatever,and I make sure that I add enough to thicken the water justa little. Ants really do love honey and sugar, so give them that first! The results:     The results you'll get from using the ant cafe will  bethat  almost right away you will notice less ants  indoors!Soon  there will be only a few scouts looking around, but  themajority of the ants wll be staying outside. This is just a simplied answer to get you immediate help.There is more info available on natural ant control in theclubs section which is available to IGA members only.Plus there are many situations of ants that require differentsolutions to solve the proble. What works for one may not work forthe other. :)Andy LopezThe Invisible Gardener IGA members can also try Ant CafeIGA members can also go to Natural Ant Control Step 1 for more help.

In December 1971 he joined the Institute for Naval Automation (IAN) of Italy’s National Research Council (CNR) as a Research Scientist. In June 1988 he was promoted Senior Research Scientist and in April 1991 was nominated Research Manager for Electrotechnics, Measurement and Automatic Control after a nationwide public selection. Since 15 October 1990 he has been Director of the Naval Automation Institute. Under his guidance, the Institute’s research involvement in the field of marine technology has made a considerable leap forward, and impulse has also been given to securing national and international research contracts, which each year provide additional funding that doubles the Institute’s basic budgetary allocation. In his early years at IAN-CNR, his research activity centred on the development of software for vessel operation, the study of algorithms and mathematical models for computer-assisted navigation and the testing of these programs on board commercial vessels and later on CNR’s research vessels. He has served on the organizing and/or scientific committees of numerous national and international congresses in the field of automatic systems for safety in maritime navigation and engineering of marine systems. From 1982 to 1986 he was responsible for the Italo-Spanish research programme managed by the Universitat Politecnica de Cataluna in Barcelona, which was undertaken by IAN-CNR and the Institute of Cybernetics of the above university. The programme focused on studies and testing of "Navigation Safety in Congested Waters and/or Straits". From 1983 to 1986 he participated in the project for "Shorebased Aids to Maritime Navigation" under the European Union’s COST 301 Programme and coordinated experimental trials carried out by an international partnership that included Italy. The aim was to determine the feasibility of constructing a Mediterranean-wide system for surveillance and assistance to maritime navigation. He serves on numerous Italian commissions for maritime traffic and marine environment technology. From 1985 to 1990, he coordinated IAN’s research efforts in the following national research projects: feasibility study for an oceanographic ship; network of open-sea meteo-oceanographic buoys; innovative approaches to the design and management of bases and systems for marine environment monitoring. He leads IAN’s research in SNECOW (Shipping Noise Evaluation in Coastal Waters), a project funded by the EC MAST I Programme. (When)He was appointed Member of the Advisory Committee of CNR’s "Trasporti Due" Applied Project. In December 1991 he was appointed by the Italian Ministry for Research to an international commission of experts responsible for evaluating proposals submitted to the European Union under the MAST II Programme. Since 1993 he has been on the Consultory Board of the National Institute for Naval Research and Architecture (INSEAN); he was also appointed by the Ministry for Research to the Technical Scientific Committee for the development of applied research in the naval field within the Ministry for the Merchant Navy. In 1994 he was nominated scientific counsellor for the Centre of Marine-Maritime Technology in Genoa He has published over 80 papers in science journals, in the proceedings of national and international congresses and within internal technical reports documenting external contracts and specific projects.  BACK TO CNR-IAN WT03-B18-17IA085-000610-B038-46http://srvnt2.ian.ge.cnr.it:80/navig/basenavi.htm 150.145.4.16 19970216120100 text/html 2455HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Microsoft-IIS/3.0Date: Sun, 16 Feb 1997 12:01:56 GMTContent-Type: text/htmlAccept-Ranges: bytesLast-Modified: Mon, 20 Jan 1997 10:24:17 GMTContent-Length: 2257 CNR-IAN Genoa, Italy: Navigation and Maritime Traffic     CNR-IAN Navigation and Maritime Traffic With over twenty years' experience, IAN plays aleading role in this field at the national level.

The focus has been on increasing navigationsafety and efficiency and on developing systems for theprotection of coasts and the marine environment. The expertisegained in field research in collaboration with experts and scientists fromrelated disciplines has earned IAN a significant role in majornational and international programmes. IAN’s research has undergone a naturalevolution over the years in terms of objectives and now centreson the following areas:     Navigation and Maritime Traffic     Technology for Monitoring the Marine Environment     Marine robotics     Innovative Techniques in Signal Processing SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY INMARITIME NAVIGATION The earliest Italian studies on ship automationand safety in navigation were conducted in the mid- to latesixties by Genoa University’s Faculty of Engineering.Funding for this research was provided by Italy's NationalResearch Council (CNR), the state organization which encompassesIAN. The university workgroup was later joined by apurposely-created CNR laboratory, the Laboratorio per l'AutomazioneNavale, which constituted the initial core of present-day IAN andwas subsequently to gain Institute status. In collaboration withvarious Italian state organizations and industrial concerns, thetwo partners launched the Esquilino Project. The goal was toinstall a complex control system based on a central processingcomputer on board Lloyd Triestino’s m/v“Esquilino”, which served the route from Italy to theFar East. This centralized system would ensure automated engineoperation and navigation tasks, the latter involving optimizationprocedures designed to achieve minimum transit times and safetyon the specific leg. Sensors and instruments were employed toincrease knowledge of the naval process, and data collectedduring experimental campaigns from 1969 to 1973 was exhaustivelyprocessed. Following the advent of microprocessors, theconvenience of low-cost computers offering a high degree ofintegration steered IAN’s application projects towardsonboard automation and microcomputers linked into a localnetwork, with a supervisor which also had a backup function. The end of the 70’s saw the start ofintense experimentation to explore the feasibility of usingtelecommunications via INMARSAT satellites to optimizenavigation. The final goal was to increase cost-effectiveness andsafety in sea carriage while at the same time analysing theperformance of commercial operators. The program was alsointended to promote the construction of a national INMARSATsatellite terminal in collaboration with related industrialconcerns and the Istituto Superiore Poste and Telecomunicazioni.To pursue this goal, campaigns were conducted onboard CNR’soceanographic vessel "Bannock", which was equipped withsensors and instruments to collect navigation, meteo-oceanographicand propulsion data. These were initially processed by a localnetwork of microcomputers and then forwarded to the processorthat automated satellite terminal operation; subsequently aprogrammed transmission was sent in real time to the computationcentre at IAN via a ship-to-ship connection. The first phase ofthe project received scientific contribution from D.F.V.L.R.,West Germany’s Institute for Space Research, which hadentered into a long-term agreement for scientific partnershipwith IAN. Although progress in ship-to-shorecommunication virtually solved the problem of creating fast,reliable links between onboard and mainland networks, the needremained for a shore service that would be able to integratemessages from ships with information from ports, traffic controlstations, coastguards, shipping companies and shipping agencies.The Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) was the answer to this need.This is a shore service designed to collect systematically all seatraffic information available in its area by constantly checkingall vessels transiting within its range. The VTS can also relayto ships any information that may be needed and offer advice tohelp increase safety and regularity in the area's trafficpatterns. The technical-scientific know-how gained by IANin the maritime sector provided the ideal basis for further investigationof VTSs and the complex issues involved. In 1983 the Commissionof the European Communities launched the COST301 Project,“Shore-based Assistance to Maritime Navigation” and IANwas assigned an important role in organizing and co-ordinatingthe relevant national Workgroup, which was composed of expertswith different professional backgrounds. In view of its background, IAN was entrustedwith co-ordination of task 8.50, which involved a series ofreal-time experimental trials known as Meditrials. These were toprovide a preliminary framework for a feasibility study of a regionalVTS system covering the whole Mediterranean. The Mediterraneantrials required the establishment of a Co-ordination Centre inthe Port of Genoa (called MECC) and were made possible bylong-term partnership between four countries: France, Greece,Italy and Spain. After four preliminary tests, the actualMeditrials started and were completed between September andNovember 1986. The trials saw the active participation of 26ports, 8 transit stations, 5,000 vessels (33 of which offeringuninterrupted collaboration) and 16 shipowners, amounting to13,742 information packages - equal to approximately 150,000 dataitems. The trials’ considerable success has demonstrated thefeasibility of developing a Mediterranean-wide system of maritimetraffic services, called Regional Vessel Traffic Services. SYSTEMS FOR MARINEENVIRONMENT MONITORING AND PROTECTION The first research efforts in this field dateback to 1973 and were conducted both on the oceanographic vessel “Bannock”(for the studies partly described above) and throughcollaboration with various teams working on oceanographic vesselinstrumentation. In 1974, the National Research Council made IANresponsible for the management of oceanographic vesselinstrumentation. A new department was set up to carry out theactivity, which on the one hand complemented oceanographicresearch and on the other allowed the Institute to widen itsscope from merely providing assistance to studying and developingnew instruments. Thanks to the know-how gained in marine datacollection, IAN organized and led Italy’s participation (onm/v “Bannock”) in NATO’s 1975 InternationalCampaign in the Azores-based underwater electro-acoustic polygon. In the same period, IAN was involved indrafting the “Oceanography and Seafloors” AppliedProject, which centred on the following areas: databases for themarine environment, instrument calibration, steps to increaseItalian industry’s interest in oceanographicinstrumentation. Within this project, IAN investigated thefollowing subjects: development of modular systems for datacollection in the marine environment; acquisition and operationof a calibration system for CTD probes (salinity, temperature,depth); participation in the EC COST 43 research programme for anexperimental network of meteo-oceanographic buoys. The COST 43 Programme provided a suitableframework for a number of research projects in marine technology. Italyparticipated in the construction of two ODAS (Oceanographic DataAcquisition Systems) buoys: ODAS ITALIA 1, which startedoperation in 1979 and ODAS ITALIA 2, in 1982. ODAS ITALIA 1 is a spar buoy built incollaboration with various parties. The buoy was moored in theLigurian Sea, initially south of La Spezia at a depth of 500metres and subsequently 38 miles off the Genoa coast on the routeto Cape Corse, at a depth of 1270 metres. ODAS IT1 collectsmeteo-oceanographic and physical-chemical parameters of themarine environment and relays them at scheduled times to areceiver station set up at IAN. After playing a significant role incoordinating the development of the buoy, IAN subsequently becameresponsible for running the system and covering its runningcosts. The Institute has entirely redesigned and rebuilt both theLaboratory section (containing the supply and data collectionsystems) and the sensors. These are at the centre of majorstudies conducted by the Buoy Optimization Work Team, a groupwhich was set up and is co-ordinated by the Institute. The ODAS1 IT Project prompted the creation ofthe Open-Sea Marine Laboratory, which conducts research into severalissues: analysis of the buoy’s performance in rough seas, anindispensable notion to evaluate platform stability developmentof biological sampling systems, both on the buoy itself and itsmooring instrumentation and meteo-marine parameter measurementsystems designed for long-term operation in the open sea. MARINE ROBOTICS IAN’s Department ofRobotics was set up in 1989 toinvestigate control of complex underwater robotic systems designedto substitute the human operator in dangerous tasks and inhostile environments. The main aspects addressed to date havebeen mission control in autonomous underwater vehicles and thetesting of results achieved in theoretical study and simulation.One basic activity conducted in the past few years has been thedevelopment of a family of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles,which are intended to serve both as test-beds and experimentalfield vehicles for investigation of concrete problems. The first prototype vehicle, called ROBY, was completed in 1990. ROBY has been defined as a“Virtual AUV”, i.e. an ROV that combines a particularlyhigh-powered console with an underwater module featuringremarkable sensorial and operational capabilities. A second,vastly improved prototype vehicle, called ROBY2, was constructed in 1992 and tested throughout 1993. In the same year, the department developed a dynamic AUVsimulator called ROBYSIM. The system was designed to supplyqualitative guidelines for the development of various controlstrategies, the study of navigational algorithms and on-line pathplanning, the simulation of sensors and the construction of auser-friendly man-machine interface. The construction of the simulator, together with thedevelopment and testing of a semi-automatic console, were major undertakingsthat led up to ROBY2’s participation in the first Antarcticcampaign in underwater robotics, whichwas undertaken in 1993-94 as part of the 9th Italian Expeditionto Antarctica under the PNRA Programme (Programma Nazionale diRicerche in Antartide). ROBY2 helped scientists collectoceanographic data and supported the testing of SARA (SottomarinoAutonomo Robotizzato Antartico), a robotic system designed inpartnership with ENEA, Tecnomare and other concerns. This projectwas launched by the National Commission for Research inAntarctica and is funded by the Italian University and ResearchMinistry. The aim is to develop an underwater robot that can replaceresearchers in ‘impossible tasks’ (such as observationof the water-ice interface in undisturbed conditions and operationin wintertime). In January 1993, IAN was granted funding by the EuropeanCommission for a three-year project to be carried out by theRobotics Department in partnership with Heriot-WattUniversity in Edinburgh and DIST, adepartment of Genoa University. The project is known as AMADEUS and comes under the MAST II Framework Programme in thearea of Marine Technology. It centres on advanced manipulation indeep underwater systems, the main objective being to construct amultifingered gripper with tactile and force-feedback sensingfacilities. The project is due to terminate in March 1996. TheEuropean Commission has recently accepted a proposal for afollow-up of AMADEUS (1996-1998). Greater emphasis will be placedon autonomous sampling capabilities and scientific application,and to this effect the previous consortium has been extended toinclude the University of Barcelona and the Institute of MarineBiology in Crete. Since March 1994, the department has conducteda joint research study on sonar mapping and localization with the NavalPostgraduate School in Monterey, Ca.The study is based on real data collected through ahigh-frequency pencil beam profiling sonar (Tritech ST-1000) andis aimed at reconstructing a 2-D map of the operating environment inthe case of known sonar position. The study has been integratedwith a method for localizing the sonar in the case of awell-known environment and satisfactory results have also beenreached in the operational case of partially known environments. In 1994 ROBY2 was successfully deployed onanother scientific mission in collaboration with GenoaUniversity’s Institute of Zoology. The research program,which received funding from the Ministry of Agriculture, involveda survey of deep-sea red coral in the Ligurian Sea. The missionhas spotlighted vehicle features and functions that will need to beenhanced in order to improve performance for this kind ofapplication. Future additions will include miniature samplingsystems for sea water and bottom, as well as grasping devices forbiological and geological sampling. A new UUV prototype, named ROMEO, is currently being developed. After ROBY2’ssuccessful mission in Antarctica, it was decided that the vehicleshould be devoted to scientific applications in pools and in the Mediterranean,rather than being further upgraded. As the architecture adoptedfor the earlier vehicles has proved highly effective, ROMEO willmaintain the same approach but will be equipped with severalinnovative features designed to overcome the limitationsencountered so far.

While the traditional approach to performing complex tasks in these conditions is tele-operation, research is now oriented towards increasing autonomy to reduce human control, even in conditions of increasing uncertainty.                                 This can be done either by improving sensor technology to increase knowledge of system status or by increasing system intelligence, i.e. the ability to act in an uncertain environment in such way as to raise the probability of successful command execution. A particularly suitable approach that overcomes the present limitations of sensor technology is a hierarchical control architecture based on the principle of ‘Increasing Precision - Decreasing Intelligence'. A three-level hierarchical control architecture has been adopted on some of the latest UUVs (Vortex, NPS PHOENIX, MARIUS).     IPDI Three-Level Control Architecture     Continuous (Synchronous) sensing and        actuation level     Discrete (Asynchronous) decision-making        level     Interface between these levels             The upper level, called Organization/Mission/Strategic Level, answers the question: "What sequence of activities must the robot perform to execute commands given by the user?". This module plans the mission off-line according to user requirements. When working on line, the Organizer can decide whether the mission should be aborted or replanned according to information about detection of malfunction or deviations from the nominal plan.The medium level is called Coordination/Control-Task/Tactical Level and answers the question: "How can activities specified by the Organization Level be performed?". It schedules the specific tasks which are needed to perform the activity specified by the Organizer, chooses the "best" algorithm for carrying out each task, synchronizes tasks and allocates the necessary resources.The lower level, named Execution/Servo-control Level, performs direct sensing and actuation. This level is subject to severe time constraints, and for this reason its algorithms are synchronous. However, the Coordination Level can at any time detect an event based on data received from the Execution Level. In brief, the Coordination Level is the interface between the world of asynchronous event-driven decisions (AI) and synchronous continuous control.             Programming languages and operatingsystems Each control level performs activities whichare different in qualitative terms and for this reason need to be implementedin different languages. The Organization Level performs functionstypical of Artificial Intelligence: computation is purelysymbolic and contains mission/doctrine specifications. The Prologlanguage may be particularly suitable for implementing theOrganizer (NPS PHOENIX). The Coordination Level manages taskscheduling and synchronization and consists of object moduleswhich communicate via messages. It could be implemented using a programminglanguage that supports concurrency such as ADA. Conversely, theCoordination Level can be based on a C++ object-orientedimplementation and concurrency is managed by Basic OS, suppliedby VxWorksTM (ROMEO). The Execution Level will be written in C++with the implementation of objects which define not only sensormanagement and filtering, but also the control algorithms.Software implementation will be carried out according to ObjectOriented programming.               BACK TO CNR-IAN         BACK TO the ROBOTICS DEPT.

Task definition must take into account possibletechnical limitations, such as fuel consumption and actuatorperformance. Two distinct types of underwater navigation can be identified: long range navigation: reaching theproximity of the target frame (position and orientation); fine manoeuvring: hovering over the targetwith high precision even in the presence of disturbance. For simplicity, our studies focus on planar motion. While finemanoeuvring requires control of three degrees of freedom, withlong range navigation it is sufficient to control longitudinalspeed and orientation to pilot the vehicle. This may help reducecontrol efforts and power consumption. In fine manoeuvring the system is described using standardcartesian equations which, combined with appropriate Lyapunovfunctions, permit computation of suitable control laws.Conversely, in long range navigation the control law is based ona particular set of kinematic equations, which are more suited tothe purpose, and on appropriate Lyapunov functions. In both cases the control laws obtained are of a closed-looptype, so they do not require any on-line planning. However, thesecontrol laws define an external kinematic control loop, i.e. theycompute the speed reference values to be tracked by an internaldynamic control loop.

Underwater Environment:     positioning represents an outstanding problem: inertial        and acoustic positioning systems cannot determine the precise        position of an underwater vehicle; however, in a        well-known environment, fine positioning (localization) can        be computed on the basis of the vehicle's relationship        with its surroundings.     vision-based environment sensing might be unattractive        due to murky water, poor visibility and the need for lighting.        In these conditions, acoustic monitoring methods perform        better but their sampling frequency is lower. For this        reason, we have chosen a high-frequency (1.25 Mhz) pencil        beam profiling sonar, Tritech ST-1000. Research        topics:         Localization: Estimation of        kinematic status (linear and angular position and speed)     Map Reconstruction: Estimation of        the environment model (list of entities and map which        describes their distribution in space)         Current        Research:         cross-evaluation of the kinematic state of an intelligent        system and its internal geometric representation of the        environment.         The case under examination involves:                     stationary environment             planar motion (2-D)             well-known vehicle heading             constant linear speed             underwater environment: relationship between robot and real world is measured by a pencil beam profiling sonar: range and bearing information.                 Localization         Assuming perfect “a priori” knowledge of the        operating environment, the problem of underwater vehicle localization        using sonar returns from known features can be addressed        using a suitable potential function whose gradient        provides a measure of vehicle position error. The        estimated position is recursively updated on the basis of        the gradient of the potential function and vehicle        dynamics by either a simple Least Mean Squares algorithm or        a Kalman Filter for faster convergence. A fast        convergence estimation algorithm has been designed for        the case of marginal speed and position errors (Sliding        Mode Observer).         Map Reconstruction         Drawing on Gibson’s psycophysical observations        about perception of geometric space, Albus stated that sensor        data mainly describe the external physical world in terms        of surfaces. Results obtained from tests using the        Tritech ST-1000 indicate that sonar data describe the        external environment primarily in terms of reflecting surfaces        and their intersections (edges) [Leonard,Moran]. This        suggests that their projections on the motion plane        should be considered as the basic entities of the        environment model. Since linear approximation of reflecting        surfaces is adopted, segments and vertices are regarded        as being the fundamental elements for representing space        in the proposed geometric environment model.         Each basic entity is described by a set of geometric        parameters and its likelihood, which measures the probability        of a basic entity existing on the basis of the sensor        data acquired until that moment. A segment's geometric        parameters are position, orientation, length (coordinates        of the extremes) and their uncertainties. A segment is a        rigid body described by its center of mass and inertia        matrix, which specifies its orientation and position/orientation        uncertainty. It is the line that best fits a set of sonar        pings which belong to the same reflecting surface in the        sense of the Least Mean Squares.         Our map reconstruction algorithm is based on the        classical Prediction-Comparison-Updating scheme.                             BACK TO CNR-IAN BACK TO the ROBOTICS DEPT.

The effectiveness of the control schemes proposed has beenshown through dynamic simulation experiments, including both theconstrained motion of a single manipulator and the case ofmultiple robots handling a common object. Another study addresses the problem of co-ordinated control ina robotic head/eye system. A quantitative analysis of thesensitivity of turning images into world co-ordinates has beencarried out, achieving some preliminary results.

AMADEUS was conducted in partnership with Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, UK, and DIST, a department from Genoa University, Italy. The focus is on improving the dexterity and sensory abilities of underwater manipulation systems in support of marine geology and benthic science. The project involves: the design of a hydraulic manipulator with three tentacle-like fingers characterized by tactile and force sensing ability; the development of methodologies for planning and control of manipulator movements; the development of a hw/sw architecture for implementation of the control schemes; the design of a Man-Machine Interface to supervise manipulation. A dextrous three-fingered underwater gripper featuring force and slip sensors has been developed. The control system is designed to allow automatic grasping of objects up to 150 mm diameter and 5 kg mass in conditions of zero visibility. At the end of Phase I, the gripper operated as a prototype system in laboratory conditions and demonstrated sampling operations on typical objects.     Phase II of the AMADEUS Project was approved by the EuropeanCommission in early 1996 and started in April '96. Themanipulator will be upgraded to permit grasping of much largerand heavier objects and to carry out ocean trials with marinegeologists and benthic scientists. New objectives in this phaseinclude the co-ordinated use of a pair of UUV manipulators forgrasping and manipulation, and the incorporation and use ofadditional sensory information such as optical and acousticvision. To pursue the project goals, the previous consortium hasbeen enlarged to include two new partners, the University ofBarcelona and the Institute of Marine Biology of Crete.

The final goal is to produce an underwater vehicle that canreplace researchers in long repetitive missions and permit researchin extreme conditions; this includes tasks which are impossiblefor human operators, such as non-stop observation of the marineenvironment under the ice pack during winter. The approach is to develop an autonomous underwater vehiclethat can perform exploration and data acquisition at presetintervals. SARA will operate from an underwater docking stationin the proximity of the Terranova Bay Station and will return tothe station at the end of missions to download data, rechargebatteries and await instructions.

IAN's vehicles haveplayed a significant role in the following applied missions:     The 1997/98 Expedition to Antarctica         The 1993/94 Expedition to Antarctica         Monitoring of Deep-sea Red Coral     The1993/94 Expedition to Antarctica                     The 1993/94 Italian Expedition to Antarctica, funded under the National Program for Research in Antarctica, included the first underwater robotics campaign to be carried out in that region. This was conducted by IAN's Robotics Department using the underwater vehicle ROBY2, which was purposely modified to withstand extreme conditions.                 The campaign had several aims: to define requirements and specifications for SARA, an autonomous subsea vehicle which is being developed in collaboration with ENEA; to collect oceanographic and glaciologic data; and to conduct biological studies of benthos. ROBY2 performed well on all missions, undertaking 18 dives for a total of over 20 hours of navigation at a depth of up to 150 metres. No mechanical faults were recorded and no temperature-related problems were experienced in the batteries. The video recording system produced high-quality images of the environment. The vehicle's contribution to the success of the various scientific missions has demonstrated the importance of intelligent underwater vehicles in support of research in marine sciences.     At the same time, vehicle testing in extreme conditions hasyielded significant information, and potential improvements havebeen identified which will make the vehicle more responsive tothe actual needs of scientists. Monitoringof Deep-sea Red Coral In 1994 IAN 's Robotics Department and GenoaUniversity's Institute of Zoology carried out a joint study ofred coral in the Ligurian Sea. Funded by the Ministry ofAgriculture, the study was aimed at monitoring the slow growth ofthe local coral colonies, which in the past two decades wereseverely overexploited. IAN's underwater vehicle, ROBY2, performed 4dives in two days off Portofino Promontory to survey the deep-sea colonies.On each dive, the vehicle spent about two hours at a depth of upto 120 metres monitoring the seabed. A support boat followed thevehicle during the mission.             BACK TO CNR-IAN         BACK TO the ROBOTICS DEPT.

It was conceived as a "Virtual AUV", i.e. an ROV featuring a particularly high-powered control console and an underwater module with remarkable sensorial and operational capabilities. The resulting architecture is a distributed MASTER/SLAVE system, where the SLAVE (on board the vehicle) is initially used for communication management, data acquisition and execution of elementary control actions, whereas the MASTER (in the control console) is dedicated to the management of the operator interface and to all analysis and control functions related to tasks. One advantage offered by this kind of structure is great flexibility in the MASTER configuration, which can therefore be a network of processing units.                 Roby is an open-frame vehicle featuring a stainless steel frame that supports all the modules and accessories. The vehicle weighs approximately 130 kg in air and measures 79 x 79 x 75 cm. It is equipped with a 300 m cable and can dive to a maximum depth of 100 m.

In spring 1993, Roby2 was modified in preparation for theexpedition to Antarctica,which took place in winter 1993/94; the mechanics were adaptedand the hardware was perfected to cope with extreme environmental conditons. The study of suitable control algorithms for ROBY2 has reliedheavily on the development ROBYSIM, a simple dynamic AUVsimulator. ROBYSIM can supply qualitative guidelines for thedesign of various control strategies, the study of navigationalalgorithms and on-line path planning, the simulation of sensorsand the construction of a user-friendly man-machine interface.ROBYSIM features a central nucleus formed by a generic solid bodymodel floating in fluid and a numeric integrator which canintegrate differential equations of dynamics; it also features an operatorinterface, routines for the simulation of sensors and actuatorsand, finally, control, planning and sensor-filtering routines,which can be transferred unmodified to the real vehicle.

The new vehicle expands the approach adopted forthe architecture of the previous prototypes, which has producedsatisfactory results, and seeks to overcome the limitationsencountered in the past. The aim is to produce a highly flexible,easy-to-use testbed vehicle that will lend itself to a variety ofapplications both in robotics and marine science. Prospects for practical application are the guiding principlein the ROMEO project, in consideration of the substantial investmentand effort required to develop and test new tools that can solvethe complex problems typical of the subsea environment. Besidesassisting scientists, ROMEO is also to serve as a testbed for thedevelopment of UUV technology, particularly in the areas ofautonomous systems control and sensing. For both operational and research purposes,the vehicle must be capable of high performance in attitude,trajectory and hovering control and is required to handlerepetitive missions in a well-defined location on the sea bottom. ROMEO has the same open-frame structure as the ROBY family,which is easy to modify and maintain. The principle is to combinesmall size and low weight with substantial payload capacity.Great attention is being devoted to propulsion, seeking to ensuremaximum controllability and precision on the horizontal planewhile keeping pitch and roll to a miminum. Four symmetrichorizontal thrusters permit heading and hovering control andhorizontal motion in all directions; four vertical thrustersallow depth and attitude control. The open-frame structure andthe propeller configuration make ROMEO more suitable for finemanoeuvring rather than long-range autonomous navigation, allowingit for instance to remain parallel to the sea bottom, at least upto a certain inclination. One of ROMEO's distinctive features is improved payloadcapacity. The vehicle will be used for a variety of scientific applications,such as real-time computer-assisted analysis of the sea bottom,video recording and photo imaging, water measurement andsampling, and seabed sampling. ROMEO is being constructed with aneye to accommodating any special device needed by the final user.Although the systems involved are widely available, theygenerally require modification to take account of spaceconstraints and conditions in the underwater world. ROMEO'spayload chassis is designed to allow users to develop their ownsystem and easily mount it onto the vehicle. Chassis can beremoved and replaced without complex technical operations, thusmaking it possible for users to mount several different chassis in sequenceonto to the vehicle during the same testing campaign.

A series of theoretic studies has been performed atIAN-CNR in order to understand the global purpose of the ManMachine Interface (MMI) system; the aim of this activity has beennot only to define the technical specifications of the system,but also to understand how to maximize its efficiency and how to developthe most rational architecture: acorrect definition of tasks and good designing practice imply theuse of a fully modular structure; In particular, several issueshave been discussed and analyzed to define correctly the most importantMMI requirements: the necessity to deal with information which isdistributed over a series of different machines implies theimplementation of a standard communicationprotocol; the continuous data exchange between modules impliesthe use of a well-defined data structure.Synchronization techniques are used, and conflicts are managed byappropriate regulation mechanisms. The MMI has been designed in away that will allow complete reuse for different marine roboticsapplications, thanks to the total modularity and flexibility ofits structure; the same way, it grants the possibility of addingnew functionalities or hardware parts to the system, without anysubstantial change in the control flow or having to redesign theglobal control structure. One of the most meaningful tasks for aMMI is to understand a human request, no matter what way it isexpressed (mouse, written language, voice, movement of virtual objects...),interpret it and translate it into a series of commands which canbe used by the controlled machine. The MMI has the peculiarity ofeasing manipulation of objects in a hostile environment: inunderwater applications, the possibility of taking accuratemeasurements of objects’ features and positions (via avideo-camera, for example) is scarce: the MMI canprovide the operator with feedback from the manipulator’ssensors, and give a description of environment and actionsthrough simulation.

In classic control theories,the time domain can be defined as the interval required by afunction to perform its action to completion. This is importantto take time domain into consideration when adding new functionsand, above all, new decision-making capabilities to a vehiclewhich is already able to control its movement. As decision-makingcapabilities are not of the rapid kind, the problem may beresolved by layering all behaviours so that the upper layercomprises longer time-consuming functions than the lower layer:this is the concept of Hierarchical Time Domain. Hierarchicallayering based on time domains lets the system designer place anyfunction in a layer according to the time the function itself takesto produce its results. A layered, hierarchical architecture has been developed on thebasis of these considerations; moreover, as data acquisition andmanagement is strictly coupled with control, each level has beendesigned with a data manipulation side and an action controlside, both managed by an appropriate module. Four differentlevels have been designed. Real time level: the fastest level;this executes sensor management, data processing, computation oferror signals and computation of effector settings; it iscomposed of a Sensor Manager for data acquisition, and anEffector Manager for motion control. System level: controls andmaintains the vehicle system, as well as determining howaccurately the desired path has been followed; Data Assessmentmodule receives data collected by the lower Sensor Manager and keepstrack of them, and is able to compute trends in data evolution;the Guidance module stores a preprogrammed mission specificationand converts it into a series of motion commands, which aretransmitted to the Effector Manager for execution. Environmentlevel: this deals with the vehicle’s physical environment;the Situation Assessment module handles the process of buildingan understanding of the current state of the world; it recordsthe state of the vehicle and the features of the surroundingworld, and communicates this information to the Navigator. Thelatter’s task is to manage route planning: on the basis ofinformation from mission description (waypoints, tasks to beperformed, goals), of its own world model, and of data concerningpresent vehicle situation coming from Situation Assessment; the Navigatorcan generate recursively a series of actions to be performed toaccomplish a sequence of subgoals. Mission level: the top level;this handles aspects which are particular to the mission and thetasks to be accomplished; it is a very high-level missionplanner, which uses descriptive data from the Environment levelto retrieve overall system state, and then applies these data tocurrent mission requirements to obtain a sequence of missiongoals the Navigator the can use and arrange.

Preservation Level: this performs obstacle avoidanceon the basis of variations in a potential field and thesubsequent search for a ‘safety center’; ExplorationLevel: it performs high-level navigation and obstacle avoidance,by adding biased random forces to the potential field of theprevious level: this way motion is encouraged in one direction bybreaking the ‘dead zone’ of the potential;Socialization Level: for object following; there is no explicitcoding of ‘following objects’ but the behaviour is theresult of a summation of forces: attraction forces to turn themachine towards an object, and repulsive forces to keep it fromcolliding when the machine is getting too near an obstacle in themotion direction. Different layers of control may be identifiedwithin these functions, each one supported by the one below:Estimate Ranges: measures distance to surrounding objects on thebasis of sensor data; Feel Force: produces the resultant forcevector, where force is a function of the inverse of a power ofmeasured distance; Flee Force: calculates the heading for Move; Move:calculates the most appropriate set of velocities for the motors;Pre-empt Collisions: sends collision warnings; Monitor Power:determines how much power has been used on the basis of motorsettings; Brake: calculates reverse engine thrust if the vehiclemust be stopped; Estimate Dynamics: estimates the vehicle’stranslational and rotational velocities and inclination; SwimAround: generates the timed biased random vector to calculatemotion; Avoid: adds the new vector to Feel Force and suppressesthe output of Flee Force to allow the system to use the newheading; Follow: monitors angles and forces and may suppressheading calculated by lower levels if there could be an error; Bibliography     Boswell A.J. , Leaney J.R. , Using the subsumption        architecture in an autonomous underwater robot: expostulations,        extensions and experiences, Mobile Robots for Subsea        Environments, Monterey, CA (USA), 2-6 May 1994.

Propulsion System: controls propellers and rudders,tracks a series of set points provided by the Dynamic ControlSystem; it also feeds back propulsion data to the Dynamic ControlSystem for closed loop control, and to the Mission Supervisor forassessment of vehicle status. Dynamic Control System: accepts thereference trajectory from the Mission Supervisor and theinformation coming from the Navigation System and sends commandsto the Propulsion System. Environmental Inspection System: a seriesof sensors for environmental data acquisition. CommunicationsSystem: manages communications between the vehicle and the humanoperator, via exchange of messages, instructions, warnings and soon; it is also responsible for the encoding and decoding ofmessages. Navigation System: provides accurate estimates ofvehicle position and speed; it sends data to the Dynamic ControlSystem and to the Mission Supervisor for vehicle status andperformance assessment. Mission Supervisor: coordinates theexecution of mission tasks in accordance with the mission plan providedby the operator; it is composed of three blocks: a TaskScheduler, which performs task management on the basis ofoperator’s instructions and system status; a SystemCoordination Module, to manage the exchange of information withinsystem modules; and a Status Assessment Module, which determinesvehicle status by examining data from the other modules. The proposed control structure derives from the analysis ofthe global system organization of the MARIUS AUV. In order toachieve a well-defined plan and control mechanism, a hierarchicalstructure is proposed, which to some extent recalls the conceptof Increasing Intelligence with Decreasing Precision. Thestructure has a dynamic configuration capability: the system candynamically configure the connections between modules and storeinformation about the state of this configuration, in order toallow the most suitable translations of planned actions intocommands. Moreover, the hierarchical structure allows the use ofsome reactive behaviours, whose purpose is to handle safety andintegrity actions: they do not represent planned actions, but areactivated in certain conditions. Three different layers are proposed. Organization level: theMission Planner uses a well defined language and grammar togenerate mission plans (waypoints and attitudes) on the basis ofthe mission doctrine; Path Planner refines mission path in orderto obtain feasible trajectories; Mission Supervisor performsmission monitoring, teleoperations and interaction with theoperator. Coordination level: coordinates the execution ofactivities related to the accomplishment of mission goals; PlanInterpreter generates a detailed action plan on the basis ofsensor information about the vehicle and the environment; PlanSupervisor schedules the tasks for execution by the appropriatefunctional modules and reacts to emergency conditions;Architecture Coordinator manages the configuration of linksbetween the different modules of the functional layer: differentconfigurations may be scheduled depending on the evolution of themission situation, and the best available alternative is chosen;dynamic adaptation of architecture to changing environmental conditionsis performed to maintain operational consistency; Task Refinementtransforms specified tasks into sequences of actions, accordingto the mission context; Global Exception Handler is a high levelmanager of error conditions and is invoked when lower levelmodules are not able to cope with errors. Functional modules:primitive modules are responsible for sensing and actuation, andare connected according to decisions at the Coordination level; reactivesystem behaviours correspond to different connections betweenthese modules; complex functional modules are composed of groupsof primitive modules in order to achieve higher level behaviours,and to increase system modularity and expandability.

RBM is aspecialization of the SSS (Symbolic, Subsumption, Servo)architecture. Strategic level: entirely symbolic, with no globalvariables; its task is to designate and sequence particular goalsthrough decisional processes; it uses rule-based languages,Prolog and Clips; it executes top-down mission analysis based ongoal-directed reasoning, and decomposition of the root goal intoa sequence of primitive goals, until they can be simplified nofurther, and sends direct implementation messages to the Tacticallevel; it has non-interruptible functioning, is not event-driven,and receives lower level information by a polling technique. Tacticallevel: asynchronous interface between the other two levels; itdecomposes high-level tasks so as to produce commands for lowerlevel execution; it uses languages that support objecthierarchies and event-driven multitasking, such as CLOS (theobject-oriented version of Common Lisp) or ADA; it is acollection of objects and related methods, which may call onother methods at the same level or send commands to the Executionlevel; it executes data collection and replanning, if needed; inorder to prevent conflicts between behaviors, this level isimplemented as a hierarchy of objects: offspring objects arecomponents of parent objects and can only be accessed by them,while the single root object is responsible both forcommunications with the Strategic level and for transmission oforders to the Execution level; decisions are made in response toqueries received from the high level at any time, and information fromthe lower level is received using ‘interrupt’techniques. Execution level: synchronous and entirely numericallevel; it operates vehicle actuators and sensors in response tohigher-level commands; it uses languages such as C, C++ and ADA,which work within multitasking operating systems and utilizetimed interrupts; all commands and actions which could endangerthe vehicle are overridden here.

Missionspecifications consist of a set of particular blocks, each onehaving a particular task to perform. These blocks arecharacterized by a particular state, and are connected through anetwork of transition rules, which constitute the conditions formodifying vehicle operating modes. Each block is composed of aseries of behaviors that encompass separate basic mission skills,such as obstacle avoidance, bottom following, message posting,reaching a given point, and so on. One important part of thecontrol architecture is data structure, which is able to keeptrack of vehicle status and support the required behaviors: the Databasemodule contains a set of values collected by the sensors, as wellas a description of their features, while Behaviors Librarycontains all available behaviors that can be managed and usedwithin blocks of Layered Control. This data structure alsocontains a description of the actual configuration of LayeredControl. The whole control structure has been implemented on asystem that runs on the OS9 real-time multitasking operatingsystem.

The system ishierarchically partitioned, and layered at each level of thehierarchy, with the addition of cooperative functions. Proteus isan extension of the ‘event and action’ scheduler, as itis event-based and the concept of subsumption is applied. Thesystem is made up of several basic components (called atoms),each one having its own function, input and output. All thesegeneral-purpose components can be stored in a library and reused,so that constructing a particular mission simply consists inchoosing the required components from the library and defining interconnections.Events are data flows linking some components and activatingtheir actions. In order to achieve more reliable results, thetechnique of cooperation is used, sometimes allowing atoms toshare the same actuator rather than merely acting in asubsumptive way. To solve problems related to interaction betweencomponents with different speeds, a hierarchical structure isimplemented with a supervisory system of some kind. This can be,for example, a Navigation Module which generates points for theHeading Control module, which in turn generates commands for ActuatorControl. Missions are composed of sequences of operations calledtasks: to represent and configure a mission, the operator uses aparticular language to give instructions through a ‘scripteditor’. A script is a collection of sequential steps, eachof which may contain more than one task to perform. A typical control cycle for the system can be defined by theconcept of situation differentiation: on the basis of the idea that“to perceive is to distinguish” , actions are decidedin relation to what is perceived as happening in the environment:the sensors play the key role of differentiating situations toallow the appropriate actions to be performed. The state ofsensors, actuators and the environment is represented by threestate vectors, whereas connections between them representfunctions linking the different states. Sensor space provides allvehicle control information and is able to differentiate betweensituations. Actuator space controls vehicle actuators and thusinfluences environmental status. Environment space represents thereal world as influenced by actuators and perceived by sensors:it determines whether the goal of a given task has been reached.This control structure has been tested on ISER’s ARCS AUV,and used on the Theseus (in the picture) vehicle.

Its distributed architecture is of the MASTER/SLAVE type,where the SLAVE (on board the vehicle) is initially used only forcommunication management, data acquisition and execution ofelementary control actions, while the MASTER (in the controlconsole) is dedicated to the management of the operator interfaceand to all mission-related analysis and control functions. Thecontrol structure is composed of five main modules: Navigator,Motion System, Sensing System, World Model , World Interpreter. SensingSystem: composed of sensors to collect information and a sensorfiltering system to ensure that the measurement ofrobot-environment relations is reliable; three classes ofsensors: self-knowledge, kinematics and environmental. WorldModel: represents, at various degrees of abstraction, the spatialarrangement of objects and parameters of various nature;objective, a priori information may be updated with data from theNavigator and the World Interpreter. World Interpreter: utilizesa priori information provided by users, and updates informationon the basis of the latest experience and sensor measurements;data fusion in a complex 3D model. Navigator: composed of threemodules: Mission Planner, which, on the basis of missionrequirements and the world model, dynamically establishes asequence of way-points (each visible from the preceding ones) andoperations to be performed at each one, and supplies the PathPlanner with the current target (3D point) to be reached; PathPlanner which dynamically determines the path to be followed toreach current target point and performs obstacle avoidance; AutoPilot or Path Follower which interfaces the Navigator with theMotion System, driving the vehicle along the route established by PathPlanner. Motion System: composed of two modules: Actuator, orengines, and Control, which pilots the actuators to performactions dictated by Path Follower, thus allowing the operator tocontrol overall system motion rather than single engineparameters.

TBC is ahierarchical architecture composed of three levels: Servo Levelor Hardware Level: performs direct control of the actuatorsthrough closed-loop algorithms; Coordination Level: constitutesthe interface between the other two levels, and may also becalled the Task Level; it is composed of ‘tasks’, i.e.autonomous or semi-autonomous actions that the vehicle canperform without human supervision; Organizational Level: performs high-levelmission planning, unexpected situation handling, datainterpretation and so on, and it is managed by a human operator; Task Based Control has been conceived as a system fortele-operated or semi-autonomous vehicles, which reduces communicationlink problems, such as performance degradation due to bandwidthrestrictions: a set of task-level commands is defined, eachallowing the vehicle to perform a given action. A high-levellanguage, composed of high-density instructions, can be used tohandle transmission between the different levels. Differentmethods have been used to encode tasks, including rule-basedsystems (NPS) and Finite State Machines.

DVMA consists of three hierarchical layers of softwaremodules: Hardware level: the bottom level, which directly controlshardware interfaces. Functional level: composed of‘functional modules’ whose aim is to organize specified behaviours.An inter-layer communication module, for communications with theupper level, is also included; the operation of these modules isdirected by particular ‘behavioral scripts’. Behaviorallevel: the top level, where system status is determined; composedof modules that can make decisions according to missionspecifications and current situation; they can exchange messagesand send commands to the functional modules to perform necessaryactions to achieve specific mission behaviour; each action iscalled a ‘behavioral mode’: behavioral mode may bechanged only at behavioral level, independent of other levels.Vehicle behaviour can only be determined by concentrating on the behaviorallevel and acting within it. Vehicle functions can be extended bypreparing a software module for the new function and modifyingsome behavioral script.

The control softwareis a real-time, object-oriented system based on a C++ approach;object classes are applied to the vehicle's different types ofsubsystems: sensors, actuators, control laws, filters. Theoperating system is VxWorks. Two kinds of control laws areapplied: basic and complex control tasks: Basic control tasks:control of the vehicle's main state variables, governing thevehicle's internal state and enabling it to reach and maintain agiven state. Complex control tasks: higher-level vehicle controllaws for performance of different missions; these use dataprovided by sensors to perform specific tasks (wall following,target detection and tracking). A mission is defined by a set ofscheduled actions, each one modeled as a control task with functionaland behavioral aspects; mission behaviour is event-driven, i.e.its definition (start, end, task activation, recovery...) entailsdefining a set of signals for handling. The synchronousprogramming of reactive systems is performed through the use ofthe Esterel Language. The proposed top-down architecture iscomposed of different modules: Interpretation module: reads theplan written by the operator via the user interface and, bytranslating instructions, acts as an interface between theoperator and other modules. Knowledge data base: contains alldata related to the robot and the environment, as well as modelsof actions and the representation of actions in progress; it alsocontains some particular conditions which must be checked beforean action can be performed. Inference module: supervises theexecution of actions by checking their associated rules.Execution module: constitutes the interface between the controlsystem and machine actuators and sensors; it managescommunications between the different modules and translatesmessages and commands into orders, which are interpreted andexecuted by the machine.

The nucleus containsall functions related to the management of work sessions, datastorage and general graphic interface functions. The independentprocesses are related to specific activities and each refers to aparticular window. The Application Processesare a series of concurrent processes which are regulated andmanaged by kernel modules. MECON stores all data which can beused by more than one module and by processes, and all messageswhich can be exchanged with the ‘actuation’ parts ofthe gripper.

It controls the system's global initializationprocedures. It manages the input devices (mouse, keyboard ,9-knob board) and data entry into the system; it also displaysall messages answering system events, as well as diagnostic anderror messages. The Boss also runs a multi-level menu structurethat activates all windows and MMI modules. Slider Runs independent processes and manages conflicts in allsituations in which concurrent mode is needed. All application processesare managed via a series of ‘fork’ calls andcommunications with other modules are granted by the defined queues. Keeper Manages the Common memory area. It receives messages from HighLevel Control, verifies their integrity and inserts them intoMECON. It checks for command messages in MECON and dispatchesthem to lower control levels. All communications with the otherMMI modules are granted by the defined queues whilecommunications with lower control levels are achieved via LANlinks. In the case of loss of data linkage, Keeper waits tenminutes and then assumes that an unrecoverable error or shutdownhas occurred in one of lower modules. Recorder Saves on disk all significant data and commands processed bythe MMI. This allows the user to obtain up-to-date informationabout all MMI operation modes and actions so that an analysis ofthe system work-flow can be carried out. Every active MMI processand module writes significant data in a buffer inside MECON, andthe Recorder’s task is to read the buffer and transferinformation into disk file(s).

Session The MMI session control process. It enables the user to setall session parameters (software parameters, working directories,projects, priorities, and so on). It also monitors and displaysthe actual parameters, such as communications status, workingstatus of processes, status of lower-level processes, and so on. 3Dgraph The 3D graphic representation process. Its task is to create asynthetic image of the gripper on the basis of its geometricalmodel and of status information contained in MECON and receivedfrom the HLC. Special graphic techniques allow the user to choosethe preferred viewing options: type of visualisation, point ofview, distance, and so on. Press The pressure control process. It lets the user manuallycontrol the pressure of gripper palm and fingers. It can manage parameterssuch as: Knuckle: angle between palm and fingers; and Pressureof tubes in each finger; Finger The finger control process. It allows the user to manually setthe geometric position of the fingers. It can manage parameterssuch as: Knuckle: angle between palm and fingers; Length:length of each finger; Bend: curvature of each finger; Spin:rotation angle of the curvature plane of each finger. Grip The gripper control process. Its task is to enable the user tomanage the high-level and automatic operations of grasping,releasing and manipulating objects. This module is give thepre-defined values of: Speed: maximum working speed atfingers; Force: maximum force the gripper can exert onobjects. It also gives the gripper some fundamental high-levelcommands, such as: Grasp: grasp an object; the pre-definedvalues of force and speed may be used; Manipulate: rotateand translate the object on the basis of defined valuesdescribing the desired offset in position and spatialorientation, and which can be entered in the system through aprocedure that will be described in the ‘Data Entry’section; Release: release the object; the pre-definedspeed value may be used. Monitor The data monitoring process. Its purpose is to display thestatus of selected variables and parameters which could be readin MECON.

This is caused by the rich content of rust (iron oxide)in the top soil. In the Martian springtime the surface of the planet changescolor due to seasonal winds covering and uncovering darker surfaces ofreddish dust.

YOU DECIDE. Venerable ThichQuang Do on June 11, 1963. This Buddhist monk burned himself alive to send a message intoour minds and hearts. The image of a burning monk seared itself onto theworld's conscience and sharpened focus on Vietnam's civil strife. How farwill YOU go for what YOU BELIEVE IN? Obviously you don't have to gothis far.  It is just an example of how far some people will go forwhat they believe in. My belief is this: Even though most of the actions of the worldbring us closer to our certain destruction, the future is not fixed.  Meaningif you went back in time 5 times you would get the same results each timeyou went.  But if you went into the future 5 times it could be differenteach time. This is because man has Free Will and has the opportunity tochange his future.  The future is not fixed. A small effort on thepart of each person could change our current heading and start to reversethe horrid disasters of which most are man made. We are currently destroying our planet in the following ways& more. 1. Fossil Fuel. 2. Nuclear Energy. 3. Deforestation of the Rain Forests. 4. Pollution of the Air, Soil, Water table, Oceans, Magnetticspectrums. 5. Overpopulation. 6. Manipulation and destruction of the Animal Kingdom's naturalevolution. 7. Morally: The world is full of HATE & Jealousy. Why should YOU care?  The New World Order or whoever THEYmay be are too powerful for me to stop? Well perhaps you're right, youmiss the destruction of the world and you die young, you'll never haveto come back to this planet to see what happened right!

When a Soviet probe spun out of control near Phobos, one of two Martianmoons, experts called the accident an unavoidable hazard of venturing onhigh. But to some members of the UFO community, the crash was the evilhandiwork of aliens based on Phobos for years. Fueling this otherworldyrumor, it seems, was a statement by none other than Alexander Dunayev,chairman of the Soviet SPace organization responsible for the space probe,named Phobos 2. The doomed craft, Dunayev stated, had photographed theimaged of an odd-shaped object between itself and Mars. The object couldhave been "debris in the orbit of Phobos," Dunayev suggested,or perhaps the spacecraft's jettisoned "autonomous propulsion subsystem."But his tone of uncertainty-and the fact that the Russians never releasedthe spacecraft's final photographs-left saucer buffs guessing the mysteriousobject had been a genuine UFO. Their suspicions were heightened just recentlywhen retired Soviet Col. Marina Popovich made a trip to the United States.Speaking at a press conference in Los Angeles, UFO advocate Popovich statedthat the object had measured a whopping 25 kilometers, or 15.5 miles, inlength. A former test pilot and the wife of a highly decorated cosmonaut,Gen. Pavel Popovich, the visiting colonel said she had received the alarmingphoto itself from cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, her friend. But if Washing,DC, Astronomer Tom Van Flandern, formerly of the U.S. Naval Observatoryand now head of his own group, Meta Research, is correct, the failure ofthe probe was no mystery at all. The Soviets had long said that the crafthad spun out of control because of an erroneous ground command on March27, Van Flandern discovered, yet the photo of the mystery object had beendated March 25. "it was unlikely," he explains, "that theobject in the photo had anything to do with the spacecraft's demise."To determine the identity of the object, however, Van Flandern analyzedthe picture. "The first thing that struck me," he explains, "isthat the object was similar in brightness to Phobos, and asteroid likebody that is carbonaceous and dark." It did not reflect light as ametallic, artificial object would. Van Flandern also examined the timingof the Phobos II camera, set to track the motion of the Martian moon. Anythingnot matching the moon's relative motion would appear to streak or trailacross the photographic page. Thus, the "streak," thought tobe 25 kilometers long was, in face, a much smaller object imprinting itsmotion, not its length, across the image. Only the very end of the enlongatedstreak hints at the object's true shape: rounded but irregular, with oneend narrower than the other. To Van Flandern, the clues suggest the mysteryobject was a moonlet, or a third, miniature Martian moon. Of course, VanFlandern's conclusion has not pleased everybody. one German researchersays the image is just an artifact produced by the malfunction of the Phobos2 camera in space. And Popovich contends the object may be an alien craft.To make her point, she has even given a copy of the telling photo to DonEcker, director of research for UFO Magazine, based in Los Angeles. Ecker,deferring to "the facts as presented by the Russians," favorsthe notion of a Mars-based UFO. But Van Flandern contends the lack of alieninvolvement in the image should not detract from its importance: "Itis an exciting astronomical discovery," he contends, "and meansthat instead of just two moons revolving around Mars, we may have three." ============================================================================= ARTICLE #2 "SPACED OUT" Starstruck UFO freaks and the company they keep.. (Fringe-Group Profile by Doug Vincent) Typed in by [MEtONeR]-TRSI What's the difference between a transplanted alien from Venus and araving lunatic at a space nut convention? Who knows? The audience sits spellbound as the elderly gentleman before them tellshis story. His name is Alfred Bielek, he says, and he's a survivor of anincredible, secret U.S. military operation called the "PhiladelphiaExperiment" According to Bielek, in 1943 the U.S. Navy used Einstein's Unified FieldTheory to successfully turn the warship U.S.S. Eldridge entirely invisible.When the ship reappeared, however, some crewmen inexplicably burst intoflames. The bodies of others were horribly buried within the metal bulwarkof the ship. Those that remained went insane. Bielek and his brother, deep in the hold of the ship, were somehow sparedthe terrible fate of their fellow crewmen. Undeterred by the tragic resultsof the initial test trial, however, the Navy, anxious to employ this spectacularadvantage over the Nazis, involved them in a second attempt three weekslater, this time striving only to render the warship invisible to radar-supposedlya simpler, less deadly ambition. Again, thanks to Einsteinian, top-secret physics break- throughs, theexperiment worked. The Eldridge became radar invisible for about a minute-afterwhich,to the Navy's consternation, there was a blue flash, and the ship vanishedcompletely. The Bieleks-apparently protected by a special energy field in the ship'shold-recognized the now familiar signs of incipient insanity in their defenselessshipmates and jumped overboard. Instead of finding themselves floatingin the chilly waters of Philadelphia Harbor, however, they landed on solidground at Montauk Army Base in Long Island, New York- In 1983-where theywere greeted by the project's director, Dr. John Von Neumann, who had waited40 years for their arrival. Bielek was sent back in time to 1943. There he was brain- washed bymilitary brass, given a new identity and set free to live his life anew,totally unaware of what had happened to him. Alfred Bielek's audience at the National New Age and Alien Agenda Conferencein Phoenix, Arizona, hangs on every word. After the oldster's disturbingrevelation, hundreds jockey for the chance to query him on every sensationalaspect of his incredible tale. Many pay an additional fee for his specialevening workshop, where Bielek discusses the Philadelphia Experiment andother government cover-ups. Bielek's proof that his story is true? Nothing but the sudden recollectionof his incredible adventure during a visit to Montauk Army Base after havingseen the science fiction movie The Philadelphia Experiment. Lack of hard evidence doesn't deter conference attendees from avidlysupporting Bielek's astounding revelation. Most are convinced he is tellingthe truth. "Why would he lie?" asks a fiery conference attendee, a gray-haired,grandmotherly woman. "In light of Watergate and Contragate, and allthe other -gates, Alfred Bielek's story makes perfect sense. The governmentwill do anything to protect its ass. The cover-up of the Philadelphia Experimentis a prime example. I think poor Mr. Bielek should be compensated for thehell he's been through!" The woman's female companion, her sweater decorated with a We Are NotAlone! button, agrees. "The reality of time travel makes perfect sense,"she declares. "I wouldn't be at all surprised to find out that thegovernment discovered how to do it with help from extraterrestrial visitors.How can any ordinary person describe the tremendous technological achie-vements scientists have made in just a few years? People like Al Bielekshould be congratulated for coming forward with the truth." FollowingBielek on the National New Age and Alien Agenda Conference's schedule ofamazements, hypnotherapist Calvin Vanness and psychic Jack Stephens directorsof the House of the Dawn, a metaphysics center in Phoenix, Arizona, purportedlychannel the spirit of Nikola Tesla, the creator of the Tesla electricalcoil and the rumored mastermind behind the so called Philadelphia Experiment. Rambling in an odd, middle-European accent, Stephens/Tesla warns thatthe Earth is going to hell in a handbasket, and that things will get worseunless changes are made, after which dozens of people wave hands in theair, eager to ask the chann- eled spirit of the long-deceased electricalgenius more infor- mation on his involvement with the Philadelphia Experimentand the fate of the planet. * * * The National New Age and Alien Agenda Conference is one of dozens ofsuch symposiums covering the broad spectrum of UFO research, New Age prophecyand high weirdness held each year around the country. Judging by the vocal testimony of the audiences these assem- blies attract,the vast majority of Americans who are fasc- inated by UFOs and associatedparanormal activity sincerely believe in the existence of alien spacecraft.Many, in fact, are convinced they've had extraterrestrial encounters ofsome sort. Quiet, serene New Ager Jerry Wills claims he used to be a UFO alien,no less. According to Wills, his alien self died when his spaceship crashedin the desert outside Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. His extraterrestrialspirit wandered through the land for five years before finding a home insidethe obliging consciousness of a Kentucky infant named Jerry Wills. Wills claims his first close encounter with a fellow star person camewhen he was 13 years old. Some time later, he fell ill and believed hewas going to die. That night, a group of extraterrestrials took him aboardtheir craft and administered a healing medication. He recovered quickly,and has been relatively healthy since. Wills says he observed American prisoners being used as guinea pigsduring the testing of nuclear bombs in the Nevada desert. These unluckymen and women were promised freedom if they survived, he says, and freemedical care if problems arose. Unfortunately, nothing has been heard ofthem since. Like Al Bielek, Wills has little to offer as proof of his astoundingtale. Nevertheless, he is regularly mobbed at UFO conventions by peopleanxious to tell him they think they were "walk-ins" (strandedaliens) like him. At the 1992 Inter- national Symposium on UFO Researchin Denver, Colorado, a woman known only as Sheila happily proclaimed thatshe herself might have been an extraterrestrial in another life, an obser-vation apparently corroborated through hypnotic regression-a form of hypnosisregressing its subject to the reaches of earliest memory. That wasn't all, Sheila ecstatically related. In another regression,she found out that she'd been Moses's sister in Biblical times! Joining Bielek, Wills and other firsthand UFOologist at the New Ageand Alien Agenda Conference is a gospel minister named Dr. Frank Stranges.Stranges claims to have met a kindly visitor from Venus who had taken partin top-level discussions at the Pentagon. The alien told Stranges his name was Valient Thor (though his friendscalled him Val), and he purported to be visiting Earth to help the peoplesof all nations, though the specific nature of Val's employment at the Pentagonwas kept a mystery. Val was obviously an alien, according to Stranges,because he had no finger-prints, could heal people with a single touchand wore an indestructible coat. Pentagon officials deny any knowledge of the friendly, helpful Venusian,Stranges says, but he feels the infor- mation is too spectacular to keepto himself. A pretty blonde from Oaklahoma, named Christa Tilton, tells an enthralledcrowd at the National New Age and Alien Agenda Conference that she hasbeen repeatedly impregnated by the aliens-and that the extraterrestrialslater snatched the fetuses from her womb. Tolton is convinced that theepisode was the insidious work of aliens because she became pregnant duringa period when she wasn't sexually active. Tilton claims that in 1987 she was taken into an underground facilitybeneath the Oaklahoma desert, where she saw human military personnel andextraterrestrials working side by side on extremely mysterious projects. During that visit, Tilton announces, she was taken into a private roomand given a pelvic exam by human and alien doctors. Afterward, she wasmade to forget the entire visit, and returned to her home in Tucson, Arizona.The episode finally came to light when she underwent hypnotherapy to dealwith some disturb- ing dreams. "That poor girl," laments a tall, lanky man to the woman sitt-ing next to him. "What a horrible, horrible experience. Some of thosealiens are real bastards." The woman nods sympathetically. * * * Many UFOologists anticipate the future disclosure of a bizarre workingrelationship between extraterrestrials and the United States government.According to spacecase symposium rumor, the U.S. government has been incahoots with alien forces for decades. *The U.S. military is working hand in hand with ETs to create an alien/humanhybrid, which explains why many female abductees report having eggs orfetuses removed from their bodies during examination by extraterrestrials.*Aliens keep track of the humans they abduct by implanting special receiver/transmittersin their ears or noses. *A secret cabal of U.S. military leaders knownas Majestic-12 was established in 1947 by an executive order from PresidentHarry Truman, created as a liaison between the U.S. government and extraterrestrialcivilizations. *The military has dozens of dead aliens on ice at installationsnationwide, and also dozens of downed alien spacecraft, which are routinelytest-flown at a secret part of Nevada's Nellis Air Force Base known onlyas Area 51. * * * A great number of those who attend UFO symposiums are simply lookingfor answers. Some have had experiences that defy ration- al explanation,such as witnessing strange craft in the air or recurring, otherworldlydreams. Alien abduction is, without question, the most commonly discussedtopic. Much of clinical psychologist Dr. Edith Fiore's practice is devotedto the treatment of people who believe themselves to be victims of extraterrestrialabduction. A simple poll conducted during a Fiore alien-abduction workshopreveals that more than half of the audience believes that they have beenabducted by extraterrestrials. Fiore, who typically induces hypnotism in treatment of such cases, claimsto have treated many people plagued by the trauma. She has compiled theten most common signs of alien abduction: 1. Unaccountable periods of missingtime. 2. Persistent nightmares or dreams about flying saucers or extraterrestrials.3. Sleeping disorders. 4. The sudden appearance of unusual marks on thebody. 5. Awakening with strange bodily sensations, including tingling ortemporary paralysis of the limbs. 6. The feeling of being watched or communicatedwith. 7. Repeated sightings of UFOs. 8. Vague recollections of an abductionexperience. 9. The unexplained healing of ailments or diseases. 10. Reactingwith fear or discomfort when looking at pictures of flying saucers or extraterrestrials.("One woman wet her pants in a bookstore when she saw the cover ofWhitley Strieber's book Communion," Fiore notes.) During her workshop at the International Symposium on UFO research inDenver, Colorado, Fiore stresses that such symp- toms don't necessarilymean one has been abducted by aliens; but anyone with persistent doubtsmight want to consider a hypnotic regression for a more conclusive answer-andafter saying this, she produces her business cards. Phenomena researcher Linda Moulton Howe, author of An Alien Harvest:Further Evidence Linking Animal Mutilations and Human Abductions to AlienLife Forms, recalls the bizarre case of a Georgia man named David Hugginswho was seduced by a beautiful, female alien and used as a walking spermbank. According to Howe, Huggins met his alien lover when extra- terrestrialsled him aboard their craft. Later, an alien appeared in his apartment andasked him to use his body. Huggins said yes, and pretty soon found himselfhaving sex with the alien woman on a regular basis. Most times, Huggins would be awakened in the middle of the night tofind himself paralyzed in bed, a raging hard-on tenting his sheets. Whilea strange mantis-like creature watched from a discreet distance, the alienwoman appeared, mounted Huggins until he climaxed, after which she usuallyclimbed off and disappeared. One night, the alien woman appeared to Huggins with a hybrid baby inher arms-the apparent result of having mated with the fertile Georgia man.The woman told Huggins that the baby was dying. Suddenly Huggins foundhimself aboard her spacecraft. He touched the baby and felt an odd joltof static electricity. The baby immediately exhibited signs of reviving. The aliens becamevery excited about this. They took Huggins to a nursery where hundredsof hybrid babies were being kept in tiny incu- bators. The aliens toldHuggins that all of the babies were his, and asked him to give each a life-savingtouch. The next morning, Howe relates, Huggins became angry at being used bythe aliens simply as a sperm bank. He masturbated three or four times thatday so they wouldn't have anything to take the next time they dropped in.But an understanding was finally reached, and the climactic close encounterscontinued until reaching at least, a more amenable conclusion. Huggins who grew emotionally attached to his extraterrestrial lover,is unlike most other abductees in that he didn't need hypnosis to figureout what had happened. Instead, Howe reveals, vivid memories of his eroticexperience came flooding back while reading abduction specialist Budd Hopkins'sbook Intruders-espe- cially the seventh chapter, which deals with anotherman who reported similar sperm-retrieval methods utilized on his behalfby alien visitors. * * * UFO buffs appear to be, by nature, an open-minded lot, but there's onething they adamantly refuse to tolerate:debunking. Attendees know whatthey know-or have seen or experienced-and they aren't interested in beingtold that their particular phenomenon might be something else, no matterhow logical alternative explanations may be. Cynics in any New Age alien conference audience quickly learn that themajority of their fellow attendees are fervent devotees of the latest,hot abduction story or conspiracy theories, regardless of absurdity orlack of proof. A negative observation is almost always met with an equallyearnest re- buttal supporting the veracity of the disputed situation, inpart or entirely because: *A noted researcher said so. *The person tellingthe story would have nothing to gain by lying. *A skeptical analysis ofthe alleged facts would merely contribute to the government's ongoing disinformationcampaign to discredit reputable UFO research. One of the most hated figures in UFOology is Philip Klass, an aviationjournalist and author of several books debunking the UFO phenomenon. Klass's reputation within the UFO community is well deserved- he pullsno punches. In his 1983 book, UFOs: The Public Deceived, for example, henotes: "One possible explanation for the mush- rooming number of abductioncases in recent years is that (the UFOers) are growing bolder.... The alternativeexplanations that people have discovered how easy it is to fool famousUFOologists with tall tales and to become instant international celebritiesvia the pages of sensationalist tabloid newspapers." One would think that the UFO community would embrace people like Klasson the merit that a skeptical eye helps maintain objectivity. Instead,prominent UFOologists spend considerable time, especially before an audience,flogging Klass's research in the zealot's belief that skeptics do moreharm than good. The 1992 International Symposium on UFO Research is no exception. DanielDrasin, a writer and long-time UFO researcher, offers a somewhat tongue-in-cheekview of the situation in a humorous lecture titled "How To DebunkJust About Anything." In his talk, Drasin outlines in careful detailhow the debunkers and skeptics of the world go about the task of downplayingor explaining away every new finding in the UFO field. Not unexpectedly,his vicious tweak of Philip Klass gets one of the biggest laughs of all,as eyes once more turn to the inexplicable to explain all. ============================================================================= ARTICLE #3 TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF Urgent News: FBI DIRECTOR LAUNCHES POLICE STATE AGENDA AGAINST LAW-ABIDING GUN OWNERS. For the first time in its history, the Federal Bureau of Investigationhas marched into politics to attack law-abiding gun owners by recommendingradical gun control laws. This attack could spell disaster for civil rightsand the Second Amendment rights of all Americans. FBI Director WilliamSessions has officially recommended that the Justice Department endorsea wide range of gun control proposals, including: * Mandatory licensing of all handgun owners. * A ban on the manufacture,transport and possession of semiautomatic firearms, with no compensationfor current owners. * A ban on high-performance ammunition commonly usedfor hunting and self-defense. * Taxpayer-funded handgun buy-back programswithin an amnesty period. * Passage off the Brady bill "national waitingperiod." * Reallocation of FBI resources to increase regulation offederally licensed firearm dealers. It is the position of the National Rifle Association that this unprecedentedaction is beyond the purview of the FBI, repugnant to American freedoms,and an ominous sign of police state tactics against law-abiding gun owners.Since the FBI was founded in response to government corruption there hasbeen widespread concern that the Bureau might become a potent politicalpolice force. Recognizing that danger, the FBI acknowledged it should "remainapart from politics" because engaging in political debate "woulddestroy the confidence of the Executive Branch, the Congress and the Americanpeople." The Above quotation was taken directly from the FBI's June11, 1993 manifesto outlining the "FBI's Gun Control Policy."The hypocrisy is obvious. On one hand, the FBI claims it must avoid partisanpolitics to keep the confidence and trust of the American people. But DirectorSessions has ignored this critical principle and chosen to thrust the FBIinto the fray of one of the hottest political issues of the day. Even moreincredibly, the same document recommends that the FBI's Office of Publicand Congressional Affairs "develop a media strategy to publicize anddevelop support for the FBI's position." This directive defies federallaw Sec. 1913, Title 18, U.S.C., which prohibits the use of congressionallyappropriated funds for the purposes of lobbying. The entire BIll of Rightswas born of fear of the federal government infringing on the individualrights of law-abiding citizens. This is precisely the course now beingpursued by William Sessions. Unless he is brought under control, Sessions'policies will lead to a government-driven civil and Second Amendment rightsdisaster. It is an insult to the FBI and its agents that their Directorhas advanced a political agenda. It is doubly insulting that the justificationfor his proposals contain no citations of any evidence or any supportingcriminological research. Glaringly absent is the massive research conductedon firearms issues funded by the Department of Justice itself-researchwhich clearly proves gun control laws are a failure in reducing crime.Implementing Sessions' New York City-style anti-gun schemes will cost millionsof taxpayer dollars, restrict the rights of honest people to defend themselvesagainst violent predators, and could trigger an epidemic of infringementupon civil liberties protected by the U.S. Constitution. This amounts tonothing short of an attack by a federal police force on the rights exercisedin half the households in the country. In fact, the June 11 FBI documentreveals a wish list that included "a general ban on the possessionof handguns" but that "after careful consideration [it was] concludedthat a proposed ban would not receive sufficient support." So theysettled for mandatory licensing for anyone who wishes to possesses a handgun,and a handgun buy-back program for those who don't wish to submit to governmentlicensing or who are denied a license. Whatever the result of Sessions'recommendations, one thing is certain: Violent criminals will continueto plague American neighborhoods, unaffected by laws which only the lawabiding obey. What we need from government isn't more restrictions on honestcitizens, but more restrictions on violent criminals. And what membersof Congress need is to hear NRA members express their immediate outrageover WIlliam Sessoins' move to politicize the FBI, and insist that Congressand the Clinton Administration reject all such restrictive gun laws. Sessions'vision of the FBI is our Founding Fathers' worst fear: A federal policeforce disarming the law-abiding populace. IF YOU ARE A U.S. Citizen CALL YOU CONGRESSMAN NOW!!! 1 + 202 + 224+ 3121 ============================================================================= ARTICLE #4 Talking with Rosie: Home Robot Interfaces The Average person on the street could not care less about the turingtest, but if you mention a robot that could help around the house, thelevel of interest skyrockets. The next questions are where to buy it andhow much it costs. The general public has long been tantalized with Hollywoodimages such as Rosie Jetson, R2D2, and Short Circuit and is now waitingfor consumer service robotics to appear in the household section of thelocal department store along side vacuum cleaners and dishwashers. Getting"Rosie"into the American home is not only a mechanical challenge but also a majorlitmus test for AI technology. "We are living in a pre-Wright-Brothersera where home robots don't fly," says Brad Smallridge, director ofthe San Francisco-based Robotics Society of America. "Who will bethe one to put the right combination of mechanical and electronic devicestogether? It may be a big company, but I suspect it may also be a garage-typeinventor, possible working in conjunction with a local robot organization."Are technology pieces still missing? Six hundred and fifty thousand first-generation,industrial robots have already proven the ability to outperform humansin many repetitive tasks requiring advanced skills with high precisionin difficult factory environments. Simulation to alleviate programming,extended mobility, and augmented reality capabilities are a few of thereasons why advanced computing will continue to improve first-generationrobots for new manufacturing requirements. On the other hand, the unstructurednature of the home puts higher demands on robots to interact with humansand raises the specter of intelligent robotics. The general principle of"intelligent robotics" was developed by G. Saridis more thana decade ago in a quest to increase intelligence with decreased precision.If robots are to assist the handicapped and elderly, befriend the young,cook, clean, patrol, and perform other tasks, a primary target must bethe development of simple interfaces to intelligent machines. Maybe thereal feasibility of household robots requires something further: machineintelligence that involves situational awareness and human empathy. Wemay just need a fourth law to supplement Asimov's three laws of robotics:* One: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allowa human being come to harm. * Two: A robot must obey the orders given toit by human beings, except where such orders conflict with the first law.* Three: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protectiondoes not conflict with the first or second laws. * Four: A robot must understandthe dynamic environment and offer a helping hand to improve the environmentfor the human being (except when in conflict with the three laws). Developmentof the previously outlined intelligence capability is probably beyond ourtime. However, there is a huge market that would be content with a low-cost,metallic servant that can hear, understand, effectively perform a limitedset of "dirty work" household chores, and doesn't require socialsecurity tax payments! MAKING ROOM FOR ROSIE A recent roundtable session at the 1993 Robots& Vision Automation Conference in Detroit, Mich., was devoted to thetopic of household robots. Joseph Engelberger opened the debate with avideo presentation, prepared by Transitions Research Corp. (TRC) of Danbury,Conn., showing simulations of bathroom cleaning, car washing, and drinkserving. Other robotic tasks shown were window washing, dishwasher loading,and hospital courier service. The key concepts included: * Accurate sensorysuites are available today * The broad range of preprogrammed tasks mustnot require absolute locations * Tactile feedback must be able to adjustto the right amount of force. * Interchangeable end-effectors must be ableto match the right tool to the job. * Dynamic scene analysis must accompanyappropriate task nesting. * As long as the robot is ready for the nextassignment, time is a noncritical issue. * They keyboard form of human-machineinterface is not acceptable. * Voice recognition technology is now adequatefor many tasks. * A potentially profitable market exists for householdrobots. The Detroit roundtable debate discussed the national implications ofa program to develop the household robot. Brian Carlisle, president ofthe Robotic Industries Association, stated that a business plan was neededto get this program off the ground. He suggested that direct research funds,such as those in the Advanced Technology Program at the National Instituteof Standards and Technology (NIST), were needed. Carlisle pointed to thefact that in Japan 3% of the workforce is robots, compared with UnitedStates, where they only constitute .017% of the workforce. To overcomesuch inertia, Carlsile suggested that the United States would need a multibilliondollar robotics program, which would be analogous in program commitmentto sending someone to the moon. The debate quickly turned to costs. Engelbergerreminded everybody that the first VCR was very costly and that initialglobal positioning systems (GPS) cost $25,000, while today a GPS unit costsless than $25. Engelberger speculated that the first household robots wouldprobably cost about $50,000 and could be included in the mortgage. Engelbergerstated that the current cost of the technology behind "smart houses,"which are essentially data collection networks of the microchips attachedto everything, is approximately $30,000-$60,000. In promoting home robotics,Engelberger said that, rather than merely pushing data around, the householdrobot would also be capable of pushing things around. James Albus, chiefof the Robot Systems Division at NIST, posed that replacing the neighborhoodkid who cuts the grass for $20, the local drive-through, or $6 car washis not practical. However, Albus declared that home robotics could helpreduce the cost of health care. Albus stated that a leading cause for theelderly giving up the comfort of their own homes for a nursing home, atan annual cost of approximately $25,000 per person, is hip injury fromfalling on the way to the bathroom. If, for example, a home robot couldprovide physical assistance for the elderly, and postpone relocation toa nursing home by merely two years, the robot cost could be covered. LarryLeifer, director at the Center for Design Research at Stanford Universityin Palo ALto, Calif., pointed to the home robot as a solution to reducethe $84 billion the United States spends annually to care for 80,000 severelyphysically or mentally impaired persons: Robots would be able to provideimmediate benefit in such circumstances. William Harwin, director of RehabilitationRobotics at the A.I. duPont INstitute in Wilmington, Del, suggested thatpeople with disabilities are "techno-friendly" and could readilymake the transition to using home robots. James Hwang, project managerof Automation and Robotics at Johnson NASA, suggested that developmentof the house robot could leverage the advanced work in dexterous and mobilerobots and teleoperations at government robotics laboratories. For example,Hwang suggested that the ability to control robotic tasks from a desktophas already been developed at NASA. He pointed to the advanced roboticsat numerous universities, including Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, MIT, andTexas. The roundtable session concluded with different viewpoints regardingwhether home robots should be developed as multipurpose machines or asbasic, single-task units with optional, add-on modules to perform specializedtasks. It was argued that the economics of providing optional $3,000 modules(to wash dishes, clean windows, and so on) would entice more customersto invest in the basic model. Others argued that while the basic "stripped-down"model may be cheaper to build initially, only the multipurpose robot couldintegrate tasks intelligently and provide the necessary flexibility theconsumer market will eventually demand. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU Robotics will continue to benefit from theexploding developments in sensor technology: smart sensors, adaptive architectures,microlens imaging, and embedded fiber-optic sensors. Intelligence processingis slowly migrating to the distributed sensors. For example, the aerospaceindustry has long been interested in smart structures for applicationsin structural dynamics, active vibration control, and aircraft health monitoring.Likewise, the utility industries are interested in solutions requiringremote operation and tolerance for harsh environments including radiation.Surely if robots can clean up Chernobyl, they should be able to clean mosthomes. An important principle for home robotic flexibility is force-feedback.A simple device that demonstrates this principal was recently developedat Stanford. An operator commands the cutting action of a remote set ofscissor blades ("slave") through the use of a standard scissors-typepair of handles ("master"). The intermediate electronics ("controllogic") take the positional input from the master and direct the slaveto move accordingly while reading the force interaction data from the slaveand furnishing the master with the movements to reproduce the same response:This gives the operator the sensation of actually cutting an object, eventhough no direct physical connection exists. Applications of teleoperationprinciples to robotic devices have been successful at A.I. duPont and areimproving manipulator control for people with severe disabilities. Individualswith spinal cord and other paralyzing injuries may have complete loss ofmotor and sensory functions that can impair their abilities to interactwith the environment and perform tasks such as feeding themselves or turningthe pages of a book. To enable these individuals, voice input and visualfeedback provide an electronic interface that approaches the integrityof a physical linkage. Such research proves that systems that provide proprioceptivefeedback can offer superior control. T. Rahman and W. Harwin suggest thatpersons with physical disabilities could use teleoperative methods remotelyto operate robotics devices for tasks such as vacuum cleaning. However,for people who are seldom at home and want a robot that can automaticallyvacuum the house at a convenient time, other issues are involved. The robotmust monitor itself and be able to return to base to recharge batteriesor dispose of trash. The robot must be able to distinguish between a lostearning and household dirt and recognize task completion. The robot mustbe designed so that it does not fall down the stairs, leave the house tovacuum the lawn, or attempt to vacuum the cat. In recent years, considerablediscussion has surfaced in robotics literature about the automatic acquisitionof skills, while avoiding the high computational costs associated withsensory processing, planning, and control. For example, J. Gefland discussesa hybrid architecture of vision and neural nets for teaching a robot todribble a basketball. This skill requires the robot to learn to interactdynamically with an external object at the correct force levels. The roboticarm dribbles the basketball, and the position of the ball, arm, and obstaclesare sensed. A neural net learns the proper response through kinestheticinformation from the joint angle sensors, and the acquired control lawscompensate for errors in joint locations and velocities. The ball-dribblingskill cannot be preprogrammed. Replacing human manipulation with electromechanicalanalogues also introduces another significant challenge-the issue of safetyand the Asimov laws. Consider the recent successful application of roboticsto the orthopedic procedure of total hip replacement by the ROBODOC surgicalassistant, from Integrated Surgical Systems INc. of Sacramento, Calif.With a human surgeon present, ROBODOC machines a cavity in the patient'sfemur bone before the prosthetic implant is inserted. This procedure requiresa person-machine interface that is powerful and easy to use by individualswho are not roboticists. In industry, gates, pressure-sensitive mats, flashinglights, cages, and other devices keep people out of the robot workspace.Since the surgical staff and the patient must be inside the ROBODOC workenvelope, a safety subsystem must ensure that people are not harmed inthe event of a robotic malfunction. ROBODOC has an independent safety hardwareprocessor with a direct interface to a second set of position encoders,force sensors, and motion monitors for detection of potential collisions,task failures, or other inconsistencies. Resolution of safety concernsis critical. The household robot is envisioned as a general factor: partbutler, cook, maid, bodyguard, and grounds keeper. This list of roles demonstratesthat the heavy-handed approach in industry of isolating the robot is notacceptable in home application. Electronic auras around robots could beused to prevent robot movement whenever a human enters a robot's territoryor vice versa. Meanwhile, household robotics must continue to meet Asimov'scriteria. SAY IT AGAIN, SAM Humans should not have to agonize over makingtheir wants known. The robot must be able to recognize and understand thespoken word, and, using voice synthesis, it must respond as situationsdemand. This interface requirement is within current voice recognitionand speech synthesis capabilities. Consider the speech-activated manipulator(SAM), the research tool developed over the last decade at AT&T BellLaboratories in Murray Hill, N.J. SAM has been used in the study of roboticsin which executing complex tasks without requiring detailed programminginstruction is necessary. SAM is a 450-pound, six-axis arm equipped withadvanced sensory capabilities and can interact with a human via spokenlanguage-thus simulating a certain level of intelligence. According toM. Brown, speech recognition has been augmented in SAM with semantic evaluationto form a natural language understanding system that makes it easy to use,without requiring that the user know about robots, computers, or programming.SAM is connected to a knowledge base, which makes it more resistant touser errors. SAM uses minimal descriptions thus, the user is spared thetedium of listening to protracted descriptions every time SAM referencesan object. SAM obtains information interactively from the user while attemptingto complete a command task. For example, a human may request that the robotmove an object that has been given an ambiguous object description, promptingSAM to ask questions to resolve ambiguity. In other situations SAM canresolve knowledge or task inconsistencies by initiating dialogue. One escapeis always provided for the user-the choice to stop SAM's line of questioningat any time by telling it to "ignore." Since semantic knowledgeis obtained by SAM through dialogue and direct teaching, much depends oncorrect responses from the user. Brown suggests that this may be the weakestpart of the system; that is, if the user misleads SAM about the meaningof words, SAM has no way of knowing or correcting the error. Future accessto commonsense reasoning, via access to the CYC-type, large knowledge bases,could provide more robust interface solutions. SPEECH REVUE In the earliestspeech recognition developments, systems recognized isolated words (wordstypically separated by about 1/4 second) from a small vocabulary (lessthan 100 words) uttered by a specific speaker ("speaker dependent").Such systems worked by storing normalized templates of known words, whichhad been spoken by each speaker. The incoming speech signals were spliteasily into word segments because silence delimited the word segments.The word segments then were normalized and matched against word templates,using dynamic time-warping methods. This technique worked well for thewell constrained problem. However, once any of the constraints were relaxed,this technique ran into serious problems. Such systems had to store andsearch not only the word templates, but all potential combinations of wordtemplates. This process was necessary because of coarticulation, wheretwo speech sounds occurring together could combine to produce a differentsound (such as did you = didja or some milk = somilk). Even for a 50 word,continuous-speech system, this approach required storing and searchingseveral thousand templates for each word. This technique proved to be unscalable.The next generation of speech recognition systems attempted to work withcontinuous speech. Word templates were scrapped, and an attempt was madeto understand the whole by understanding the parts. Word segments werebroken into word syllables, or atomic speech units, called phonemes. Forexample, the word "Rosie" would be represented as "r owjh iy." In this process, speech units were identified, and dictionariesof words were build from these basic units. This approach constrained thesearch over a finite and relatively small number of phonemes, since coarticulationeffects between phonemes could be accounted for by phonological rules.While systems using this technique cleared the scalability hurdle, otherproblems were created * Segmentation: Deciding where a segment starts andwhere it ends is very difficult because there is no clear, well-establisheddelimiter between phonemes. Most systems resolve this problem by usingheuristic rules. * Labeling: Assigning a phoneme name to a segment is questionablebecause phonemes come in various sizes and shapes, and distinguishing themin nonrivial. Multiple labels with corresponding matching scores are oftenassigned to a segment. Some systems, such as Dragon, use a segment-levelword-dictionary instead of labels. * Word Matching: The sets of labelsand matching scores from the incoming stream must be quickly mapped towords, while retaining the ability to backtrack and pick the next-bestcandidate word if the first choice is found incorrect. A majority of speechrecognition systems now use the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) network- a probabilisticfinite-state automation method for mapping label sets to words. These problemsand others, including noise, unexpected starts or stops, corrections, andgrammatically incorrect utterances have restricted speech technology fromrecognizing real-life, natural speech utterances from multiple speakersin real time with high accuracy. The interface requirement to recognizeevery word of speech rather than sentence recognition may need to be relaxedto understand essential robotic commands. High-speed computing advancesand parallel processing will contribute significantly toward improvingrecognition accuracy. Hybrid approaches (using neural networks as a firststage classifer and distance computation unit for local frames, dynamictime warping to compute normalized distances over frame-sequences, andthen to select the best match) hold great promise. For example, neuralnets were applied at duPont to characterize nonvocabulary utterances indisordered speech. The disordered speech that results from timing problemsassociated with dysarthria (cerebral palsy) is difficult to recognize becauseit often involves periods of extraneous silence or non-speech sounds, aswell as abnormally timed or misplaced speech gestures. S. Peters used aneural net to detect the presence of inappropriate or nonspeech sounds,and a conjugate gradient algorithm was used to train the system to recognizebreaths and silence in a single dysarthic speaker. Further research isnecessary to achieve robust systems that can provide adequate voice recognitionperformance in the presence of speech variability and noise. This includesthe problem of speakers under stress or with altered voices, such as thoseinduced by a cold. Another research area is prosodics, the features inhuman speech involving emotion, intention, or emphasis. Prosodic informationcan be detected from changes in intonation, tonality, vowel duration, pitch,and volume. Applications that could benefit from such research includeairborne pilot assistance, airline baggage handling and railway ticketingsystems, voice-activated assembly, stock market transactions, and, of course,household intelligent robotics. ROBOTS SAY THE DARNDEST THINGS Effective robot interaction demands two-waycommunication, as we saw with SAM. Speech synthesis capability has beenavailable for many years and is much less complex in implementation thanvoice recognition. Common metrics for speech synthesis are intelligibility(the degree to which a listener can correctly understand the output) andnaturalness (the degree to which speech sounds human, not like a machine).Current speech synthesis systems provide a "faceless" voice-ageneric voice rather than a personalized voice. For Rosie to be acceptablein many households, it would be desirable to have a distinct, personalizedvoice complete with localized accents and colloquialisms. Most speech systemscombine phonemes to produce speech. Such systems can effectively produceunlimited speech, but the quality of speech is very poor because most donot account for the coarticulation. Speech systems that combine large unitsof words can produce excellent-quality speech, but there are severe limitationsin storage and retrieval. An intermediate approach-combining intermediatesize units such as diphones-to produce fair-quality speech with a substantialvocabulary would probably be acceptable for robots. The number of commercialproducts for speech recognition and synthesis is increasing. Apple Computerdeveloped the Casper voice-activated interface, IBM introduced numerousvoice technology products this year, and Northern Telecom has developeda Flexible Vocabulary Recognition system to recognize thousands of wordsover noise phone lines. New "command-and-control" products areappearing on the market for improved VCR programming, automated tellermachine security, and speech translation. If such capability is enteringthe living room with the TV and the phone, how long will it be before thesame technology can be integrated into a household robot? A "homerobot standard" would help define the voice interface. This mightinclude restricted domain models and language vocabularies, defined noisethresholds, and limitations on continuous speech and speaker independence.Easy integration of standardized voice interface components will let householdrobotics integrators concentrate again on the intelligent tasking requirements. A FEW GOOD ROBOTS Some service robots are already hard at work. Forexample, HelpMate, TRC's mobile robotic courier product, designed to performmaterial transport tasks, is employed in a dozen hospitals across the country.The robots work around the clock, delivering meals, pharmaceuticals, medicalrecords, and lab results to nursing units. By assuming the time-consuming"go-fer" tasks, the HelpMates free up hospital staff for moreimportant, direct patient-care duties. The health care industry is notalone in successfully applying mobile-robot technology. Other service industryapplications include security and patrol, commercial floor care, hazardouswaste handling, bomb disposal, nuclear plant clean-up, janitorial services,rehabilitation programs, and the military. A clearinghouse for informationon service robotics is the National Service Robot Association of Ann Arbor,Mich. Let's look at some of the household robot design requirements (rememberingthat the robot must function in an environment designed primarily for humancomfort and convenience). The household robot must: * Be able to navigatethroughout the house. Humans can be made very comfortable in surroundingsamenable to the wheeled locomotion necessary for robots; that is, homesthat are modified for wheelchairs. *Be able to locate in designated workzones. The robot memory will contain a map of all regions to be visited,and sensory perception will continuously analyze to the current location:This is analogous to the maps posted strategically in theme parks and museumsthat tell visitors, "You are here." The robot's memory tellsit not only where it is but also where everything else is, of should be,located. * Be robust, with smooth joint servos and load-bearing capabilitiesappropriate for the job. End-effectors will be equipped with quick disconnectwrists so that general purpose hands can be selectively replaced by specialpurpose tools. Tactile sensing will be of two types: With its finger tips,it will recognize shapes and grasping postures, and with its wrists, itwill recognize what is in hand and optimized interaction forces and torques.*Have few speed requirements. Most industrial robots are bound to the assemblyline where production rates are directly proportional to robot arm point-to-pointspeed. Meanwhile, the built-in servant has 24 hours a day and seven daysa week to get the job done. Some work is scheduled, such as meal preparation,but much can be done at night or a time when humans are not at home. Expensiveglobal optimization computer calculations would rarely have to be run forperformance improvement. * Have vision and other sensory perception, tosee, recognize, and understand. The robot needs vision for navigation andmodest scene analysis and object location capabilities. Because the environmentwill be intimately known, the vision requirements do not need to exceedthe current state-of-the-art. Enhancements in the next decade will reducethe cost of vision components. THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME Each household has a peculiar set of requirements.Domestic robots will have a unique definition of setup and run-time parameters,corresponding to the particular home. This requires a unique informationinterface that stat with global task descriptions, develop into the robotprograms, and are tested in simulation. Simulation has shown significantsavings in cost and schedule for industrial robotic applications such aswelding, painting, and assembly. Simulation lets developers quickly andeasily model robot environments to optimize robot kinematics off-line beforerunning them on the shop floor. Robots can then be calibrated to the tasks,routines sequenced, collisions detected, and exception handling defined.This can reduce programmer requirements and disruptions due to error. Thearchitecture for such simulation is described by R. Bernhardt for a systemcalled ROSI (Robot Simulation). A similar approach could be used beforebringing Rosie into a home. They layout of the particular home environmentand task expectations would be available through databases and knowledgebases. Simulation then could be used to define tasks, tine-tune parameters,and identify potential problems. Eventually, simulation capability shouldbe automatically available to Rosie and transparent to the human user.The "Rosie the Maid" character, created in the early 1960's forthe Jetsons cartoon series, was definitely fictional. However, with today'sadvanced computing technologies and new research in robotics, sensors,interfaces, and so on, the "intelligent" home robot will becomea reality. This venture seems like a reasonable challenge for AI technologies;however, we should probably not say that too loudly, or the general publicwill start beating down our doors. ============================================================================= ARTICLE #5 From:Popular Mechanics/July.93! TYPED BY CoB/\LT! America's Invisible Ship. If on a certain night themoon were full off the California coast, and you could somehow infiltratethe encircling picket line of military vessels to get within a few hundredyards of the right spot,you might see with your naked eye what you couldsee no other way. Disgorged from a hulking, barge-like mothership, a thin,prismatic shadow glides silently out onto the shining water like a splinterof obsidian. It is a ship of some kind, but there is something bafflingabout its shape. As it slowly turns to head for open water, its facetedsurface presents the silou- ette of a different object with every few degreesof rotation. One moment, it is long, sloping trapezoid, then it foreshortensinto a jumbled gemstone, then it resolves into a truncated letter A standingupright on the water. If you happened to have with you a battery of sonar,radar and infrared sensors, they would have told you that what you wereseeing wasn't there at all. Out of the black.. Until Friday, April 9, ofthis year, the U.S. Navy would have told you the same thing. The vesselis the Sea Shadow, Americas only known attempt to dis- appear as effectivelyon water as the F-117 Stealth fighter can disappear in air. Constructiontook place in total secrecy nearly a decade ago at the lock- heed Missilesand Space Co.'s closely guarded Redwood city, California, facility. Asone of the Defense Department's "black" programs, the whole $200-millionund- ertaking officially did not exist. That changed this Spring with aterse, page-long memorandum issued from the Pentagon. The need to conducttesting during daylight, it said, had forced dis- closure to the program.Beyond that, the Navy kept a lid on the details. Except for a single "Mediaavailability" at 8am on Easter morning, reporters' questions met withbrief answers from a script that public affairs officers were forbiddento stray from. Among the sparse facts made available were these: length-160ft.,width-70 ft., draft-14 ft., displacement-500 tons. The ships purposeaccording to the memo, was "to explore the application of a varietyadvanced technologies to surface ships. These technologies involve shipcontrol, structures, automation, seakeeping and signature control."Signature control is just another way of saying Stealth. One look at theship confirms that escaping detection was the dominant design concern.It has been shaped according to the same principles that led to the F-117,another Lockheed product. "If you put wings on it and cut off thepont- oons, you could probably fly it." joked Stan Zimmerman, a veteranPentagon wat- cher and editor of the newsletter Navy News & UnderseaTechnology. So why did the Navy decide to build a stealth ship? How didthey do it? And what will they do with the capabilities thus gained? Exocet's impact Part of the Navy's motivation can be read in the grisly headlines thathave followed the sea skirmishes of the past decade. The radar-guided seascimming missile, most notoriously the French Exocet, has shown itselfto be a deadly eq- ualizer, giving the small Navies of the world a wayto draw blood from much larger, better equipped forces. Launched from asmall patrol boat, helicopter, or attack plane, theses missiles close inon a target at near supersonic speeds, while presenting a radar cross sectionthe size of a sea bird. They fly so low that they're less than a minutefrom impact by the time they pop over the horizon and into view of eventhe most powerful radars. Under these circumstances, currently availablecountermeasures--chaff decoys, and defense gun and missile systems-- arefar from fullproof. Moreover, with a few hundred pounds of high explosiveaboard, seaskimming missiles pack a tremendous bang for their relativelyfew bucks. Although, as was the case with the U.S. frigate Stark, heroicdamage-control measures may prevent a ship from actually sinking--that'sabout the best that can be hoped for. "If a ship gets hit by a cruisemissile, I think it's fair to say that their fighting for the day is over,"says U.S. Navy Capt. John Mc Gillvray, who recently resea- rched stealthshiptechnology at the Naval War College. He estimates that there are more than15,000 sea-skimming missiles of one type or another in the hands of morethan 50 Navies in the world. Little wonder, then, that there are timeswhen a ships commander would like nothing better than simply to disappear. Mystery Barge On Nov. 4, 1982, an astute reader of the San Francisco papers mighthave been puzzled by a brief item on the impending departure of a tremendousfloating dry- dock from thr Todd Shipyard there. Known as the Hughes MiningBarge, the 4700- ton vessel was originally built for a secret CIA projectin the early 70's, and had been in mothballs for years. The CIA project,it has since come out, was an attempt to recover a Soviet nuclear sub thatsank off the coast of Hawaii in 1968. This time, about all a Navy spokesmanwould say was, "I can assure you it is not going to be used to goafter a submarine. Inside the Barge is a 180-ft.-long, 70-ft.-high enclosurecovered by an ar- ched roof, where work can be conducted out of sight.by flooding ballast tanks, operators can sink the interior floor beneaththe level of the surrounding sea- water and float vessels in and out. TheBarge left Todd in the summer of 1983 and arrived at Lockheed Missiles& Space in Redwood City shortly afterward. Har- dly anyone knew whyuntil this spring. According to the sketchy history released by the Navy,construction of the Sea Shadow took place inside the Barge, apparentlybetween 1983 and '85. Night test were conducted in 1985 and '86, with theBarge keeping the ship under co- ver for repairs and replenishment duringdaylight. The tests were suspended in 1986 and not resumed until this spring,when the ship was unveiled. Shaping a shadow.. Although few specifics have been given on the reasoning behind the SeaSh- adow's design, its stealthy shape and unusual twin-hull configurationgive clues to the intentions and past experiences of those who built it.Creating useful shapes with very small radar cross sections is still ablack art, but such shapes do have recognizable trademarks. Sea Shadowappe- ars to be a product of first-generation stealth technology, whichwould ex- plain its resemblance to the F-117. The shapes of both bear theimprint of a computer program called ECHO 1. Developed by Lockheed in themid-1970's, this program was key to the company's success in winning theF-117 contract. ECHO 1 was a breakthrough because it permitted designersto predict the radar cross section of a shape before building it. The programlimited opt- ions, however, because it could only analyze shapes made upof a finite num- ber of 2-dimensional panels. This accounts for the facetedappearance of ea- rly stealth designs. Since then, more powerful computersand software have made it possible to create more complex stealth designslike the B-2 Stealth Bomber. But stealth ships have intended to stick withthe older approach. According to the naval architect Harold Armstrong ofDowty Signature Management, an English maker of radar absorbing materials,it's mostly a matter of cost. "Welding toge- ther flat plates is mucheasier than anything which is curved," he points out. Stealth on stilts.. Of course, stealth at sea requires much more than just reducing a ship'sradar cross section. Sonar and infrared sensors can be equally threatening.And even if the ship itself could be made completely undetectable, itswake might still give it away. Modern radars can spot the waves kickedup by small boats, and the Navy has worried that Russia might be workingon satellite- borne wake sensors that could watch vast expanses of ocean. INVISIBLE WARSHIP.. The Sea Shadow addresses all of these concerns with a single neat designstroke. The two thin struts that support its main hull stand on a pairof submerged, torpedo-like pontoons in what's known as a small water planetwin hull(SWATH) configuration. SWATH designs have long been known forexceptional stability in heavy seas, but in the case of the Sea Shadow,therare important additional advantages. First, with only the knife-like strutsslicing the waters surface, the wake is reduced to almost nothing. Secondly,the noisier of the propulsion system can be placed high above the water,where their difficult to hear with passive sonar. The Navy says Sea Shadow'spropulsion is diesel electric, so the probable layout is one electric motorin each pontoon, powered by one or more diesel generators up above. Photosshow exhaust venting between the SWATH hull's struts, where the heat wouldbe masked from infrared sensors. Swath also appears to help in evadingradar because it provides a wide base of support, from which the ship'ssides can slope inward. Normally, a ship's sides are nearly vertical, meetingthe water at close to 90 degrees. This pro- duces a bright radar echo calleda broadside flash, which is easy to home in on. Unfortunately, all thosecapability has a price. A look at the Navy's TAGOS-19 SWATH surveillanceships, which are said to incorporate lessons from the Sea Shadow, illustratesthe tradeoffs. Built to tow sub-hunting sonar arrays at high latitudes,where punishing seas damage equipment and wear out crews aboard con- ventionalships, the 3397-long-ton TAGOS-19s are the largest U.S. made SWATH vessels.According to Joseph McMahon, a naval architect at McDermont Internat- ionalwhere the vessels are built, the SWATH configuration is well suited tothe TAGOS-19 mission, but suffers weight carrying and calm-water speedlimitations that would be a problem in other roles. Looking at picturesof the Sea Shadow, McMahon commented on the inward slant, or dihedral,of the hull struts. This would damp out heaving motions in heavy seas bycreating vertical drag. It also requires a nightmarishly complex stru-cture. "It's outstanding hydrodynamically. It's awful for the builder,"says McMahon. What is it for?.. So in the Sea Shadow the navy has a ship that's stealthy, but difficultto build, capable of only 13 knots, and unable to carry a heavy weaponsload. It's fair to ask, then what do they want with it> At the veryleast, they want information. According to what's been released, Sea Shadowis strictly a one-off research tool. It's credited, for instance, withinsights that helped reduce the radar cross section of the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. But, like several other new warship designs under constructionaround the world, the Arleigh Burke is better described as low observablethan as completely stealthy. Arleigh Burke's builders made the ship hardenough to track that its other countermeasures are more effective, butcouldn't make the performance compromises needed to make it disappear fromradar. That brings us to the question of whether there is a role for aship that, like Sea Shadow or the F-117, puts stealth almost above everythingelse. Maybe there is. Although critics of the idea point out that withnuclear submarines the Navy can can already operate undetected at sea,a stealthy ship would have at least two key advantages.One, it could beused for air defense of convoys, which subs presently cannot. Two, it couldoperate in a number of areas--some of them strategically important--wherethe water is to shallow for the subs to get close to shore. The bottomline is that, given how little we knew of the Sea Shadow until the momentof its unveiling, there's no telling what other "invisible ships"the Navy may have lurking at sea. ============================================================================= ARTICLE #6 It's time someone told you the truth about the AIDS cover up! TYPEDBY CoB/\LT! Whats your fear about Aids? I'll tell you what mine is. It's the factthat i'm being deceived by the very health authorities that are supposedto be protecting me. And my fears are entirely justified. There is a coverup;the authorities are running scared; and there's only one way to fight it;with the truth! Dear friend, The person i'm about to introduce to you has literallylived thr- ough hell to get vital truths about Aids to the people who aremost in danger. Yet, he has been scorned, ignored, betrayed, and viciouslyslan- dered by the press, politicians, his own trusted colleagues -- notto men- tion various special interest groups -- for his heroic stand againstthis silent killer. Dr. Strecker submitted paper after paper on his findingsto all the prestigious medical journals in America and in Europe. Theywere refused. Later , newspapers turned down paid advertising for The StreckerMemorandum. Few T.V. or radio stations would allow him to be interviewed.He also suff- ered the loss of two close associates, including his ownbrother, under very questionable and mysterious circumstances -- afterrepeated threats of vio- lence. This fine physician is even-handed andfair in his treatment of the fa- cts. But he is ruthless in the sense thathe will tell all the whole truth... even if it offends some special interests.And often it has. Dr. Strecker has sworn, to get the truth out no matterwhat the cost... and he has paid dearly for it. The fact that you're ableto get this material at all is a miracle. Now, take a look at The StreckerMemorandum. I can al- most guarantee that, like me, you'll be hopping madbefore you're threw rea- ding. We'd better move fast, or there will be no tomorrow!! Are you scared? Good! Because it's time someone told the truth aboutAids. And it's time we started demanding our elected officials to do some-thing about it. Over a 100,000 Americans have died because they didn'tknow the truth about Aids. That's more people than we lost in the entireVietnam war! I can't tell you how angry all of this makes me. Millionsand millions are going to die because of the complacency of the very peoplewe've appoi- nted and elected to protect us from this dread disease. Thereis no time to waste; we have no more time. The number of Aids- infectedpeople is doubling every 12 months -- in some areas even sooner. We mustdo something to protect our children and ourselves ... or there will beno more tomorrow. Urgently, William Campbell Douglas, MD Did someone finally go too far fooling around with Mother Nature? "I will show you how the Aids virus was actually predicted, requested,created, produced, and developed-- and now threatens the very existenceof mankind--be- cause it works." --Robert Strecker, MD, PhD Would scientists design and create a deadly virus on purpose? Couldit really be done? Were two horribly fatal animal viruses somehow combinedto create the worlds most deadly plague to hit mankind--one that may welldeci- mate the population within our lifetimes? Then answer, unfortunately,is yes. Who did this? Who ordered the creation of a virus that could potentiallydestroy mankind? And worse--how did it ever get into humans? That's justone of the tough questions that Dr. Robert Strecker faces head-on in theincredible video, The Strecker Memorandum. Was it intentional? Dr. Streckersays it's entirely possible that the Aids virus was deliberately introducedinto the human population. The international infections of human groupsfor scientific study has been well-documented. Or was it an accidental? The frightening thought of a scientist foo-ling around with the building blocks of nature is all to real a possi-bility. Dr Strecker takes you inside the halls of science to reveal justhow possible this is. That's not even the tip of the iceberg as far as the Aids deceptionis concerned. Dr. Robert Strecker spent five exhausting years studying the Aids virus,it's origins, methods of transmission, and the devastating effects it hason the human body. He did not like what he saw. And now he's telling you. You get a quick, easy lesson in what Aids really is--not what "they"want you to think it is. And at the end while your still reeling from allthe information, Dr. Strecker holds a riveting Q&A session with severalskeptical colleagues. You will not believe your eyes...but you'd better! Here's just a sample of what you'll learn in the Strecker Memorandum: * What Aids really is * How the virus could have been created * Howit replicates * How long it really takes to show up * How it kills * Howit transmits between people * Four reasons it wasn't a green monkey * Whythe govt. doesn't want you to know where and why the virus ori- ginated* How many viruses there really are--and worse, how many more there willbe * Why a vaccine is literally impossible * Why the cure is much morelikely--and whats standing in the way * Why condoms don't work to stopinfection And there's much more you'll learn in The Strecker Memorandum. Afteryou watch The Strecker Memorandum, you'll know more about Aids than 99%of the doctors in America! Even if Science wasn't your favorite subject in school, you'll findthis video, not only eye opening--but easy to follow as well. Dr. Strecker doesn't pull any punches. I've never seen a medical problemexplained in such a clear-cut,easy to understand way. He is a professionalin every sense of the word- and he has no agenda to serve except to explainand disseminate the truth. There is so much that we aren't told--intentionally or otherwise- aboutwhat the virus really is, what it does and how it kills. Now, you can knowthe scientific truth about this silent killer. And it's vital that youdo understand it. Because ignorance today could have devastating consequencesfor you and your loved ones tomorrow. If you think you are safe because you are not gay or promiscuous, oreven sexually active, then you must watch The Strecker Memorandum verycarefully... over and over again if necessary. Dr. Robert Strecker practices internal medicine and gastroenterologyin Los Angeles. He is a trained pathologist and holds a Ph.D pharmacology.Dr. Strecker and his brother, Ted, an attorney, were preparing a proposalfor a health main- tenance organization (HMO), and needed to know the long-termfinancial effects of insuring the treating of Aids patients. The informationthey covered from the beginning was so startling, so hard to believe, thatit would dramatically alter both their lives and lead them on a five-yearquest culminating in the creation of The Strecker Memorandum..

The 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles was the first modern Olympiadto ac- tually turn a tidy profit for the host city--thanks to some shrewdmaneuvering by olympic officials who relied on barter to trade licensingrights for $116 million worth of goods and services from 30 major corporations.Today, more than 240,000 businesses, ranging from doctors, lawyers, cate-rers, dentists, restaurants, accountants, hotels,and building contractorsto household names like Xerox, Pan Am, Ramada Inns, MCDonnel Douglas, Mattel,and Hilton, conducted $5.9 billion of barter transactions in 1991, accordingto the International Reciprocal Trade Association, up from 90,000 firmsdoing $2.2 bi- llion worth if swaps a decade earlier. The sluggish economyis fueling this phenomenal growth because barter can preserve cash andswell business 10 to 15 percent by using excess services and inventory.For Fortune 500 corporations,the concept of barter used to be a dirty littlesecret because it reeked of unloading unsalable inventories at distresssale prices. No longer. The cataclysmic shifts in the geopolitical havechanged that, too. Former Eastern Bloc nations simply don't have hard currency.So companies like Pepsi, eager to capitalize on these untapped markets,have been unashamedly swapping soft syrup for vodka. Plus the recent developmentof a trading network that harnesses the speed of supercomputers may bethe gateway to a cashless so- ciety in the twenty-first century. Barter,once relegated to the back door of the economic underground, has gone legit."Barter wont save a failing business. But it can give ones that aresurviving a real competitive edge, because it allows them to buy retailwith their own wh- olesale cost," says Stephen Friedland, presidentof Los Angeles-based BXI Inter- national, which has more than 12,500 membersand 75 branches. Founded in 1960, BXI was the first modern barter exchangeand is still the largest of the nati- on's estimated 400 trading networks.Typically, exchanges handle record keeping, expedite the flow of trades,and promote clients through directories and newsletters. In return, theytake a 10- to 15- percent slice off the top of each trade. All transactionsare now repo- rted to the IRS, so bartering is no longer a convenient taxdodge. People offer goods and services for "credits" or "dollars"that can be traded on barter exchanges. And those "trade dollars"can add up. For example, a gra- phic designer used barter credits for a$20,000 down payment on a house, and a music teacher went on a photo safariin Kenya-courtesy of her local barter exch- ange. Last year, New York'sLexington Hotel acquired a $150,000 computer system in exchange for $300,000worth of room credits. Since the Lexington always has vacant rooms , it'sonly real expense was paying housekeepers to tidy rooms. If you think yourbusiness could benefit from barter, check out the track record of a tradeexchange before you join. Fond out how long the exchange has been around.Does the network have a directory of its members? Does it offer productsand services you can genuinely? Can you trade leftover inventory or servicesfor items you would otherwise pay for in cash? A new state-of-the-art softwaresystem, UltraTrade, designed for superco- mputers may ultimately even transformthe way we do business. About 400 midsi- zed companies in Southern Californiaare already online with UltraTrade. If all major U.S. companies used thistrading system, experts estimate it would generate additional annual salesof $1.5 trillion. "We're on the edge of som- ething unbelievable,"says Bob Meyer, editor of BarterNews. "The day you can get anythingyou want on this exchange-which would require a critical mass of about4,000 major companies-this will take off exponentially." and probablymake the green stuff obsolete.

No. 3 March 1993 TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF MACH 25 TRANSPORTER About the size of a Mercury capsule, Lightcraft is powered by a laserbeams relayed down from satellites orbiting Earth. Mirrors bounce the lasersto a pulse-jet engine. Sometime early in 2010, a passenger might take off from Albany, ridea one person craft into space, and touch down 45 minutes later in Australia-allwithout burning an ounce of fossil fuel. Lightcraft, a concept vehicledesigned by engineers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy,N.Y., will be powered by lasers of microwaves beamed to it from satellitesorbiting Earth. Leik Myrabo, head of the RPI design team working on Lightcraft,says the vehicle will fill a niche: "Lightcraft will be a cheap, reliableway to send individuals around the globe or into orbit. Many of the componentsof the system were first developed for the Strategic Defense Initiative,and we are testing models of the craft and is engine right now." Myraboenvisions a Lightcraft perched on its slender tripod landing gear, waitingfor a satellite-based solar power station to come into position. When itdoes, it will relay laser or microwave beams under the vehicle, heatingthe air within a small area to 30,000 degrees K. At this temperature, moleculesof gases in the air explode, creating a series of blast waves that propelsthe craft up through the atmosphere. When the craft reaches Mach 11 (8,000mph) and 90,000 feet, it will switch to magnetohydrodynamic propulsion.In the upper atmosphere, the air is too rarefied to detonate, but therewill still be enough propulsive force to creative a shock wave as the craftzooms upward. Two rings of superconductive magnets and a laser-to-electric-powerconverter will accelerate the glowing air plasma behind the shock wave,blowing it backward to boost the craft to its orbital velocity of Mach25. The converter uses a small amount of liquid hydrogen-the only fuelLIghtcraft carries. The RPI team has already tested the liftoff pulse-jetlaser-powered engine at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C.The result: performance equal to the jet engines of 1942. "We needto bring out thrust-to-power ratios much higher," admits Myrabo, "butfor the very first test of a new design, we think this shows great promise."An unmanned demonstrator could be tested within five years. ============================================================================= ARTICLE #9 Popular Science: March 1993 Vol 242. No. 3 TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF OUT OF THE BLACK: SECRET MACH 6 SPY PLANE Does the U.S. Air Force-or perhaps one of America's intelligence agencies-havea new secret spy lane in action? A growing body of evidence suggests thatthe answer is yes. A startling disclosure came recently when Chris Gibson,a British oil engineer and highly trained aircraft-spotter, produced asketch that captured the shape and size of an unusual aircraft he saw duringdaylight hours in August 1989, flying over his drilling rig in the NorthSea. The expert eyewitness' drawing is the keystone that, with other evidence,provides an understanding of a secret hypersonic reconnaissance aircraftthat is widely rumored to exist, but routinely denied by U.S. officials.Its nickname Aurora. Gibson-a former member of the disbanded Royal Observer Corps, a groupof volunteer aircraft spotters was able to estimate the strange airplane'slength and width by comparing it with the known dimensions of the K-135refueling tanker and two F-111 bombers flying alongside. But it wasn'tuntil last year, when he came across a magazine illustration of a hypersonic(faster than Mach 5) aircraft design, that Gibson suddenly made sense ofthe sharp triangular silhouette he saw. Analysts believe that Aurora is an operational spy plane that replacesthe retired Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. Like its predecessor, Aurora costsseveral million dollars per flight and is send out only on missions wherethe plane's sensors can gather vital information unobtainable by satellitereconnaissance or other means. It's plausible that Aurora was used to photograph Iraq during OperationDesert Storm in an attempt to provide tactical intelligence to ground-basedmilitary commanders. Aurora's unique capabilities also equip it for surveillanceof nuclear proliferation. The list of nations of varying political complexionsthat covertly possess or are pursuing nuclear arms capabilities includesIndia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, and South Africa. Surprisevisits by a reconnaissance aircraft can give intelligence analysts clues-suchas the presence of military trucks at an ostensibly civilian plant-whichwouldn't be left out in the open when a spy satellite is scheduled to makeits pass overhead. Aurora overflights of Russia have probably not occurred. Such missionswould violate an agreement in place since a Lockheed U-2 spy plane wasshow down over the Soviet Union in 1960. It is likely, however, that Auroramonitors the submarine-building programs of Russia, China, and other nationsfrom well outside their airspace using side-looking sensors. Gibson's North Sea sighting completes a puzzle that has obsessed military-aircraftanalysts for several years. Consider the following pieces of evidence hintingat the existence of something unacknowledged that flies high and fast: * In February 1990, the Air Force retired its SR-71 spy planes. Theofficial reason was saving the $200 million to $300 million a year it costto operate the fleet of Blackbirds. Reporters were told that the SR-71'srole had been taken over by advanced spy satellites. * The money saved was less than 7 percent of the approximately $4 billionthe Air Force spends yearly on satellite reconnaissance-mere chicken feedby Pentagon standards. Keeping the SR-71s in reserve would have providedcheap insurance against an unlucky string of satellite and rocket failures,such as the ones that occurred in 1985-86'. * The Air Force actually discouraged congressional attempts to reversethis termination of its most glamorous aircraft mission. Never in its historyhad the flying service walked away from a manned mission without a fight. * The pace of activity at the Air Force's top-secret Groom Lake testsite in the Nevada desert has increased dramatically in recent years, suggestingthe presence there of one or more secret aircraft programs. By comparingrecent photos of the base with ones taken in the late 1970s, it's apparentthat several large new buildings were added during the 1980s. Always visiblein the recent pictures are a number of charted Boing 737 airliners thatferry workers in from other defense-industry towns such as Palmdale, Burbank,or Edwards in Southern California, or from Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. * Since mid-1991, unexplained sonic booms have periodically rattledSouthern California Officials at the United States Geological Survey, theagency that monitors earthquake activity, no doubt irked the military withtheir public statements that a very fast, high-flying aircraft was causingthe "airquakes" registering on their array of seismographs. * The Federation of American Scientist, a private Washington, D.C.-basedpolicy group, issued a report late last year on the likelihood that unacknowledgedmilitary aircraft might exist. The cautious review of unclassified literatureon the subject concluded that several new types of aircraft may indeedbe covertly flying around. Gibson's sighting now makes it possible to reconstruct the Aurora program'shistory. The spy plane was operational, or nearly so, by August 1989, justbefore the Air Force parked its SR-71s for the last time. Aurora wouldhave made its first flight by 1986 at the latest, following a developmenteffort that was launched in 1981. This analysis elicited denials by high officials involved in defenseand intelligence matters. Ohio Democratic Sen. John Glenn asserted thathis sources in the intelligence community told him there was no such aircraft."I think they're telling the truth," he said. Pete Williams, chief spokesman for the Bush administration's Secretaryof Defense, Dick Cheney, gave a standard answer to a query about Aurora."If there were such a program, we wouldn't discuss it." Williamsexplained that Pentagon policy says the same answer "must always begiven" to queries about secret programs-whether or not they actuallyexist-to avoid revealing the truth. Donald B. Rice, Bush's Secretary ofthe Air Force, stated: "There's no program in the AIr Force, noneanywhere else that I know of. It simply doesn't exist." To some observersthe stridency of Rice's response was puzzling. Why didn't he simply utterthe usual Pentagon disclaimer? Black is the adjective most often applied to the hidden world in whichsuch engineering activities unfold. In a 1985 Pentagon budget documentrequesting production funds for 1987, a censor's slip let the line item"Aurora" appear, grouped with the SR-71 and U-2 programs. Evenif Aurora actually was the project's name at the time, it almost certainlywould have been changed after being thus compromised; "Senior Citizen"is one new label that has been reported. Rated by the Pentagon as an "unacknowledgedspecial-access program," the plane's existence and real name are secret,and therefore deniable. Unconfirmed reports of Aurora's existence first surfaced in 1986, andPopular Science conjectured about the airplane's likely design in the November1988 issue. Now, fresh reports from secret-airplane hunters like JamesGoodall, who heard and felt bone-shaking sounds coming from the Groom Lakefacility late in December, continue to flesh out the picture of Auroraand the technology that makes it work. Armed with patience and braced forthe occasional confrontation with no-nonsense security patrols, resoluteobservers like Goodall trek through the harsh Nevada desert to a mountainsideoverlooking desiccated Groom Lake. From several miles away-as close asthey can get without entering off-limits government land-the watchers cansee the large air base with its motley collection of hangars. Some of thebuildings are vast. Yet, like a mirage, the isolated facility with itssix-mile runway doesn't exist-officially, that is. And its non-existenceis longstanding. A 1992 Lockheed Corp. paper on the early days of the U-2program refers to flight-testing at Groom Lake 35 years ago as having occurredmerely at "a remote location." For some, monitoring events onthe dry lake bed provides the excitement of pursuing a mystery. Authorand photographer Goodall, who has been chasing classified programs foralmost 30 years, is motivated by enthusiasm for aircraft and a convictionthat he's entitled to know how his taxes are being spent. His earwitnessaccount indicated that the airplane's propulsion system is unconventional,to say the least. "We heard Aurora from 18 miles away. The sound isso intense that you feel it. It was quite something else-a pulsing noisethat you'll never forget." Aurora was almost certainly built by Lockheed's fabled Skunk Works,now called the Lockheed Advanced Development Co. Of all known design organizations,only the Skunk Works has the proven ability to manage large programs incorporatingbreakthrough technology in total secrecy. Analysis of Lockheed's financialstatements makes it possible to estimate Aurora's price tag at abut $1billion per aircraft. At most, 10 to 20 of the new spy planes have beenbuilt. A hypersonic prototype paved the way for Aurora. In 1975, Lockheed proposeda small hypersonic research aircraft that would be launched from the backof an early version of the SR-71. And a definitive survey of Lockheed aircraft,published in 1982, stated that the company had already flown a Mach 6 experimentalcraft. By the late 1970s the U.S. government probably had two main reasonsfor going ahead with Aurora. The first: improved Soviet surface-to-airmissile (SAM) systems posed an increasing threat to the SR-71, which fliesat Mach 3.2 (2,100 mph) and reaches altitudes above 80,000 feet. By 1980,two potent new Soviet antiaircraft weapons, the SA-10 Grumble and the SA-12Gladiator/Giant, were under development, Both have a maximum altitude ofabout 100,000 feet and feature advanced tracking and guidance systems. The second reason for building Aurora was that satellites alone arenot the best solution to reconnaissance requirements. While they take superbpictures, satellites also have inherent limitations. They follow fixed,predictable orbits, which make their appearance no surprised to a shrewdadversary. Although earthbound controllers can command satellites to firethrusters to adjust their orbits, this ability is strictly limited by afinite on-board fuel supply. In addition, because it is difficult to supplythe amount of power needed to operate an all-weather radar, most satellitescarry only daylight or low-light cameras. Although they cost several hundred million dollars apiece, spy satelliteslast, on average, only five years before they are dumped into the atmosphereand replaced. And it is difficult to increase surveillance quickly in acrisis unless a stockpile of reserve satellites and launchers is kept ready-asthe former Soviet Union once did. Aircraft are much more flexible. Theycan be dispatched exactly where and when they are needed, and they canbe fitted with day, night, or bad-weather sensors, depending on conditionsin the target area. An analysis of Aurora's three-dimensional shape can be extrapolatedfrom its 75-degree swept triangular outline. The aircraft corresponds almostexactly in form and size to hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft studiedin the 1970s and 1980s by McDonnel Douglas, according to Paul Czysz, nowa professor of aerospace engineering at St. Louis University. Czysz workedon hypersonics while at McDonnel Douglas, including the company's proposalfor the National Aerospace Plane program, and is an acknowledged expertin the field. Efficient hypersonic planes "are basically air-breathingpropulsion systems," he says. Like the SR-71, Aurora has a crew of two. Flying it is quite unlikepiloting a conventional aircraft. There is little if any outside view,because a normally angled windshield causes too much drag and gets toohot. For these reasons, Aurora may have a retractable windshield used onlyfor takeoffs and landings; at other times, the windshield would be coveredby a heat shield. Aurora's pilot is really a mission manager, monitoringthe aircraft and its systems and following the course of the flight onlarge-format video displays. his or her most important function is to copewith the unexpected: shifts in upper-atmospheric temperature, weather developmentsover the target area or refueling zone, or problems with the plane's mechanicalor electronic systems. The RSO supervises a battery of sensors. The mostimportant is a synthetic-aperture radar (SAR), a side-looking instrumentthat takes a sequence of snapshots of the target as the aircraft movesand complies them into a single radar image that is as sharp as if it hadbeen acquired using an antenna hundreds of feet wide. The best SAR imagesare classified, but have been described as "near-photographic,"allowing different types of land vehicles to be easily distinguished frommore than 100 miles away, regardless of clouds or smoke. In clear weather,Aurora uses daylight and infrared cameras for ultra-detailed work. Andunlike a satellite, the craft can be scheduled to make its reconnaissancepasses at the golden hour for covert imaging: early morning, when the lowsun provides even illumination and long shadows that highlight featureson the ground, before heat-induced haze forms. A phased-array antenna builtinto Aurora's upper surface-near the tail end, where aerodynamic heatingis minimal-allows the airplane to transmit real-time or near-real-timeimagery to the Pentagon's satellite network. Aurora uses ramjet engines, because no other type can work as efficientlyat the speeds the plane travels. in its simplest form, a ramjet is a pinchedtube that slows, compresses, and heats the incoming supersonic airstreambefore adding fuel to it, producing enormous thrust from the hot gas expandingout the exhaust nozzle. However, the compression process also generatestremendous drag. The ramjet designer's challenge is to keep the level ofdrag from canceling out the slim margin of thrust that propels the aircraft. One way to make a ramjet engine efficient is to stretch it along theentire length of the vehicle. In a hypersonic ramjet aircraft, the undersideof the forward body is a ramp that initially compresses the air beforeit enters the inlet ducts, and the curved underside of the afterbody guidesthe expansion of the exhaust gas. IT'S A LIFTING BODY The compressed air underneath the body serves a second purpose: It holdsthe airplane up. At Mach 6, conventional wings would be superfluous appendagescreating horrendous drag. Accordingly, the tips of Aurora's delta platformare mainly there to provide stability and control. The basic problem withramjets is that they don't work at all unless the aircraft is moving quitefast, and they are not very efficient at speeds less than Mach 2.5. Therefore,Aurora needs some other system to reach this speed. There are two clues to the way Aurora's designers solved the low-speedpropulsion problem. The team for the X-30/National Aerospace Plane (NASP),though tight-lipped about the "accelerator" portion of the NASPengine design, has indicated that it functions as a ducted rocket in partsof its operating cycle. The second clue is that Aurora has been associatedwith two unusual noises: very-low-frequency pulsing sounds and an extremelyloud roar on takeoff. ROCKET-ASSISTED RAMJETS The surging or pulsing sound is associated with a class of standstill-to-hypersonic"combined-cycle" propulsion systems invented in the late 1950sand shrouded since then by obscurity rather than security (see The Combined-CycleRamjet Engine). Czysz, who studied combined-cycle engines for hypersonicaircraft while at McDonnell Douglas, say that their performance is remarkable."they go like scalded rabbits," he says. According to Dr. FredBillig at the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University, whoexperimented with the combined-cycle engine in the 1960s, one of the attractivefeatures of this engine is that it delivers high thrust per unit of frontalarea, a drag-reducing characteristic helpful in pushing efficiently pastthe sound barrier. Most important, the combined-cycle engine can recoverenergy that most engines throw away. by using cold fuel to cool the airplane'sstructure and engines, for example, the system converts heat into mechanicalenergy used to supercharge the ramjet and generate additional thrust. SUPER-COLD FUEL Even though Aurora is 80 to 90 feet long, which is about 20 feet shorterthan the SR-71, it could weigh more-as much as 170,000 pounds when fullyloaded. A clear two-thirds of its total mass would be fuel. Choosing theright fuel was crucial to Aurora's design. Because various sections ofthe craft will reach cruising-speed temperatures ranging form 1,000 degreesF to more than 1,400 degrees F, its fuel must both provide energy for theengines and extract destructive heat from the airplane's structures. Thisis done on the SR-71, but at hypersonic speeds even an exotic kerosene,such as the special high-flashpoint JP-7 fuel used by the Blackbird, cannotabsorb enough heat. The solution for Aurora is a cryogenic fuel-a coldliquefied gas. The best candidates identified so far are methane and hydrogen. Liquidhydrogen provides more than twice as much energy and absorbs six timesmore hear per pound than any other fuel. The snag is its low density, whichmeans bigger fuel tanks, a larger airframe, and more drag. While liquidhydrogen is the fuel of choice for a spacelaunch vehicle that acceleratesquickly out of the atmosphere, studies have shown that liquid methane isbetter for an aircraft cruising at Mach 5 to Mach 7. Methane (natural gas) is widely available, provides more energy thanjet fuels, and can absorb five times as much heat as kerosene. Comparedwith liquid hydrogen, it is three times denser and easier to handle-inflightrefueling has been studied and poses no problems. Aurora can fly at subsonicspeeds because its entire body, which has a great deal of area, is a liftingsurface. Also, its sharply swept leading edge-like the Concorde's wing-generatesa powerful vortex at nose-high flight angels, which clings to the leadingedge and boost the body's lift. Unencumbered by aerodynamic freeloaderssuch as a conventional fuselage, Aurora's shape is structurally efficient.It packs a lot of fuel and useful equipment into a relative small volumethat saves weight and minimizes friction drag. The spy plane's airframe may incorporate some stealth technology, butit hardly needs it. Hypersonic aircraft are actually much harder to shootdown than a ballistic missile. Although a hypersonic plane isn't very maneuverablein the traditional sense, its velocity is such that, within tens of seconds,even a gentle turns puts it miles away from a SAM's projected interceptionpoint. So why bother with stealth? FLYING IN THE GOVERNMENT'S BLACK WORLD The Pentagon's "black world" isn't a mirror-military runningparallel to the familiar one. Rather, it is a submerged network of covertactivities distributed throughout the armed services and other agencies.It size can be gauged from unclassified Pentagon budget documents, whichinclude accurate total figures but conceal individual black programs bylabeling them with code names or burying them within other categories. This hidden ocean of funds for research, development, and productionof secret equipment amounts to $16 billion of the Pentagon's $254 billion1993 budget. When operations costs are included, the black budget's estimatedannual total comes to a staggering $35 billion. New construction at the Air Force's secret Groom Lake test facilityin Nevada, and the number or workers being flown to and from there in recentyears, suggests that a decent chunk of this invisible money is being directedtoward several unacknowledged, large-scale aircraft or missile projectsunder way at the remote site. The Air Force has hidden major aircraft programs before on two occasions.A giant Lockheed airplane called the CL-400 was the U-2 spy plane's intendedreplacement Code-named Suntan, the Mach 2.5 aircraft was to be poweredby radical hydrogen fueled engines. Lockheed had virtually completed the first four aircraft before Suntanwas canceled in 1958 due to technical snags. The project cost $250 millionin fat 1950's dollars. Not one word leaked out about Suntan until 20 yearslater, when Lockheed started talking about liquid hydrogen as a futureaircraft fuel. Suntan was replaced by a CIA project for a Mach 3 spy plane called Oxcart.After Lockheed was selected to build the plane, it was renamed the A-12.It first flew in April 196 from Groom Lake, which was made into a fullyequipped base supporting A-12 flight testing and the CIA's dozen operationalplanes. The Air Force subsequently ordered 30 SR-71 reconnaissance-strike aircraftderived from the A-12 prototype. The existence of the SR-71 was disclosedin a 1964 statement by President Lyndon Johnson. But the CIA's A-12s flewsecretly until mid-1968, and they were not revealed to the public until1982. Through a combination of tight security and disinformation, the A-12program was concealed for 23 years. Now ask yourself: Would your governmentlie to you? In "Mystery Aircraft" a report released last year, the Washington,D.C. based Federation of American Scientists (FAS) concluded that two ormore types of secret airplanes are likely to exist. Bases on an extensiveanalysis of unclassified Pentagon and corporate financial documents, technicalpapers, and a range or news reports, the study favors the view that someof the reported aircraft are prototypes, while at least one may be in regularservice. "It is probable that at least one high-speed, high-altitude experimentalair vehicle is currently undergoing flight tests," or may possiblyhave achieved operational statue, the report states. The craft could mannedor unmanned, it notes, fitting either the general description of a Mach-4to Mach-6 Aurora or a faster Mach-8 "exotic propulsion aircraft"using pulse-detonation or external-combustion technology to reach hypersoniccruise speed. The "doughnuts on a rope" exhaust contrail photographed lastyear in Texas might be the product of a pulse-detonation type of engine,which combusts its fuel in intermittent bursts. An aircraft using externalcombustion at high speeds would fit the description of a vehicle dubbed"The Pumpkin Seed". According to the FAS study, "there isalso the possibility that the possibility that SR-71 follows is hiddenin plain" within the National Aerospace Plane (NASP-also known asthe X-30) project, which is aimed at developing an air-breathing hypersoniccraft that can climb into low-Earth orbit from a runway in a single stage.Knowledge about propulsion and high-temperature structures gained in theNASP program may have proven applicable to a Mach 6 to Mach 8 aircraftnow flying. As many as a few dozen examples of a subsonic stealthy reconnaissanceaircraft called the TR-3A or "Black Manta," probably built byLockheed, may currently be in production or operational, the FAS analystssay. Finally, it is highly probable that some one-or two-of-a-kind stealthaircraft prototypes exist, the study concludes. Such aircraft would bebuilt to test concepts intended the B-2 bomber, the TR-3A, the Navy's canceledA-12 stealth attack plane (no relation to the SR-71's predecessor), orother aircraft. These planes could account for the number of differentmysterious aircraft described in sighting reports. Putting aside the romance sifting clues about secret airplanes possessingwondrous characteristics, the authors of the FAS report raise a broaderfundamental question: With the Cold War behind us, what's the effect ofcontinuing to support such vast and costly secret defense activities? The hard-nosed answer is provocative: "Secrecy tends to obstructtechnological development by inhibiting communication of useful information,increasing costs, generating public mistrust, and all too often promotingfraud and abuse," the study says. "It is being used to protectcontroversial programs from public awareness, more than from hostile intelligenceservices." Recent major examples of secrecy masking incompetence include the B-2Stealth bomber program, which has been shot through with cost overrunsand performance shortcomings, and the disgraced Navy A-12 program, whichwas killed after billions of dollars of misguided expenditures. The sentiment expressed by FAS is gathering broad support in Congressand elsewhere. Its message to the Pentagon is this: Unjustified secrecyis anti-democratic. PUMPKIN SEED Reports of a brightly glowing aircraft moving rapidly across the nightdesert sky at high altitudes may be attributed to the use of external combustion.The exotic hypersonic propulsion method involves igniting fuel releasedfrom ports girdling the plane's flattened, diamond-shaped body. Exhaustexpands in the conical area defined by its shock wave to produce thrust.Turbojets provide propulsion at low speeds. Here, an exotic propulsiondemonstrator is seen as it transitions from a turbojet-type acceleratorto external-burning powers. In theory, control at high speeds could beprovided by modulating the fuel flow to the propelling nozzles. This aircraftmay be unpiloted. MOTHERSHIP Observers in California's Mojave Desert have reported sighting a largeaircraft resembling both the SR-71 and the XB-70, a 1960s Mach 3 bomberprototype. A flat area atop the plane's aft fuselage appears to serveras a mounting point for an unknown object-hence its nickname, "TheMother Ship." Piggyback payloads could include an air-launched satellitedelivery vehicle, an antisatellite weapon, or a high-speed aircraft lackinga low-speed propulsion system. A vehicle of this kind could operate discreetlyfrom inland sites, and fly to overwater areas before accelerating to maximumspeed and launching its upper stages into orbit or ultra-high-altitudeflight. Engineers familiar with aircraft structure aerodynamics, and stealthdesign assisted in developing the drawing. TR-3A BLACK MANTA Somewhat bigger and much quieter than the F-117A stealthattack plane, a stealthy reconnaissance aircraft identified as the TR-3Amay already be in service, according to a report by the Federation of AmericanScientists. The subsonic, unarmed Black Manta's likely role would be toloiter unobserved as far as 100 miles from its target, taking picturesand conducting electronic eavesdropping. Its mission is similar to thatof the U2-R, a version of the veteran spy plane still in use, but the BlackManta's likely role would be to loiter unobserved as far as 100 miles fromits target, taking pictures and conducting electronic eavesdropping. Itsmission is similar to that of the U-2R, a version of the veteran spy planestill in use, but the Black Manta's likely role would be to loiter unobservedas far as 100 miles from its target, taking pictures and conducting electroniceavesdropping. Its mission is similar to that that of the U-2R, a versionof the veteran spy plane still in use, but the Black Manta's targets wouldprobably be unaware of its presence. A small fleet of Mantas (perhaps 20to 30) may have been produced by Lockheed or Northrop. ================================================================================ New interesting texts concerning topics ranging from UFO and Governmentcoverups to Disease and Computer related information is on it's way inthe next upcoming issue of the UMF Text Mag.. ================================================================================ BACK TO INDEXWT03-B18-94IA019-000202-B042-219http://www.kevinmitnick.com:80/umf/panther/umfmag2.htm 206.16.251.69 19970106191715 text/html 117501HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Monday, 06-Jan-97 19:21:06 GMTServer: WebSite/1.1Allow-ranges: bytesAccept-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thursday, 12-Sep-96 10:04:09 GMTContent-length: 117282         UMF Text Magazine Issue #2 Information for people with Brains!

"It seems much easier to explain the nonexistence of the moon thanits existence." -NASA scientist Dr. Robin Brett 1. The Puzzle of the Moon's Origin: Scientist have generally offeredthree major theories to account for the moon in orbit about our planet.All three are in serious trouble, but the least likely theory emerged fromthe Apollo missions as the favorite theory. one theory was that the moonmight have been born alongside the earth out of the same cosmic cloud ofgas dust about 4.6 billion years ago. Another theory was that the moonwas the earth's child, ripped out the Pacific basin, possibly. Evidencegathered by the Apollo program indicates though that the moon and the earthdiffer greatly in composition. Scientists now tend to lean toward the thirdtheory-that the moon was "captured" by the earth's gravitationalfield and locked into orbit ages ago. Opponents of the theory are in doubt,and none satisfactory. NASA scientist Dr. Robin Brett sums it up best. 2. The Puzzle of the Moon's Age: Incredibly, over 99 percent of themoon rocks brought back turned out upon analysis to be older than 90 percentof the oldest rocks that can be found on earth. The first rock that NeilArmstron picked up after landing on the Sea of Tranquility turned out tobe more than 3.6 billion years old. Other rocks turned out to be even older;4.3, 4.5, 4.6, and one even alleged to be 5.3 billion years old! The oldestrocks found on earth are about 3.7 billion years old, and the area thatthe moon rocks came from was thought by scientists to be one of the youngestarea of the moon! Based on such evidence, some scientist have concludedthat the moon was formed among the stars long before our sun was born. 3. The Puzzle Of How Moon Soil Could Be Older Than Lunar Rocks: Themystery of the age of the Moon is even more perplexing when rocks takenfrom the Sea of Tranquility were young compared to the soil on which theyrested. Upon analysis, the soil proved to be at least a billion years older.This would appear impossible, since the soil was presumably the powderedremains of the rocks, but from somewhere else. 4. The Puzzle of Why the Moon "Rings" like a Hollow SphereWhen a Large Object Hits it: During the Apollo Moon missions, ascent stagesof lunar modules as well as the spent third stages of rockets crashed onthe hard surface of the moon. Each time, these caused the moon, accordingto NASA to "ring like a gong or bell." One one of the Apollo12 flights, reverberations lasted from nearly an hour to as much as fourhours. NASA is reluctant to suggest that the moon may actually be hollow,but can otherwise not explain this strange fact. 5. The Puzzle of the Mystifying Maria of the Moon: The dark areas ofthe moon are known as maria (seas, as this is what they looked like toearly astronomers-dried-up seas). Some of these maria form the familiar"man-in-the-moon" and are, strangely, located almost entirelyon one side of the moon. Astronauts found it extremely difficult to drillinto surface of these dark plainlike areas. Soil samples were loaded withrare metals and elements like titanium, zirconium, yttrium, and beryllium.This dumbfounded scientists because these elements require tremendous heat,approximately 4,500 degrees fahrenheit, to melt and fuse with surroundingrock, as it had. 6. The Puzzle of the Rustproof Iron Found on the Moon: Samples broughtback to earth by both Soviet and American space probes contain pure ironparticles. The Soviets announced that pure iron particles brought backby the remote controlled lunar probe Zond 20 have not oxidized even afterseveral years on earth. Pure iron particles that do not rust are unheardof in the scientific world (although there is a solid iron pillar of unknownage in New Delhi, India, that has also never rusted, and no one knows why). 7. The Puzzle of the Moon's High Radioactivity: Apparently, the upper8 miles of the moon's crust are surprisingly radioactive. When Apollo 15astronauts used thermal equipment, they got unusually high readings, whichindicated that the heat flow near the Apennie Mountains was rather hot.In fact, one lunar expert confessed: "When we saw that we said, 'MyGod, this place is about to melt! The core must be very hot.'" Butthat is puzzle. The core is not hot at all, but cold (in fact, as was assumed,it is a hollow sphere). The amount of radioactive materials on the surfaceis not only "embarrassingly high" but, difficult to account for.Where did all this hot radioactive material (uranium, thorium, and potassium)come from? And if it came from the interior of the moon (unlikely), howdid it get to the moon's surface? 8. The Puzzle of the Immense Clouds of Water Vapor on the Dry Moon:The few lunar excursions indicated that the moon was a very dry world.One lunar expert said that it was "a million times as dry as the GobiDesert." The early Apollo missions did not even find the slightesttrace of water. But after Apollo 15, NASA experts were stunned when a cloudof water vapor more than 100 square miles in size was detected on the moon'ssurface. Red-faced scientists suggested that two tiny tanks, abandonedon the moon by U.S. astronauts, had somehow ruptured. But the tanks couldnot have produced a cloud of such magnitude. Nor would the astronauts'urine, which had been dumped into the lunar skies, be an answer. The watervapor appears to have come from the moon's interior, according to NASA.Mists, clouds and surface changes have allegedly been seen on the moonover the years by astronomers. For instance, six astronomers in the lastcentury have claimed to have seem a mist which obscured details in thefloor of the crater Plato. Clouds on the moon are extremely odd, becausethe moon's supposed small gravity (one sixth of the earth's, claim manyconventional scientists and NASA) could not hold an atmosphere or haveany clouds on it at all. 9. The Puzzle of the Glassy Surface on the Moon: Lunar explorationshave revealed that much of the moon's surface is covered with a glassyglaze, which indicates that the moon's surface has been scorched by anunknown source of intense heat. As one scientist put it, the moon is "pavedwith glass." The experts' analysis shows this did not result frommassive meteor impacts. One explanation forwarded was that an intense solarflare, of awesome proportions, scorched the moon some 30,000 years or soago. Scientists have remarked that the glassy glaze is not unlike thatcreated by atomic weapons (the high radiation of the moon should also beconsidered in light of this theory). 10. The Puzzle of the Moon's Strange Magnetism: Early lunar tests andstudies indicated that the moon had little or no magnetic field. Then lunarrocks proved upon analysis to be strongly magnetized. This was shockingto scientists who had always assumed that the rocks had "some verystrange magnetic properties...which were not expected." NASA can notexplain where this magnetic field came from. 11. The Puzzle of the Mysterious "Mascons" Inside the Moon:In 1968, tracking data of the lunar orbiters first indicated that massiveconcentrations (mascons) existed under the surface of the circular maria.NASA even reported that the gravitational pull caused by them was so pronouncedthat the spacecraft passing overhead dipped slightly and accelerated whenfitting by the circular lunar plains, thus revealing the existence of thesehidden structures, whatever they were. Scientists have calculated thatthey are enormous concentrations of dense, heavy matter centered like abull's-eye under the circular maria. As one scientist put it, "Noone seems to know quite what to do with them". =============================================================================ARTICLE #2 (Reprint of Nikola Tesla's last public work, written shortly beforehis death.) TYPED BY: [MEtONeR]/TRSI A Machine to End War By Nikola Tesla As Told To George Sylvester Viereck Editor's note: Nikola Tesla, now in his seventy-eighth year, has beencalled the father of radio, television, power transmission, the inductionmotor, and the robot, and the discovery of the cosmic ray. Recently hehas announced a heretofore unknown source of energy present everywherein unlimited amounts, and he is now working upon a device which he believeswill make war impracticable. Tesla and Edison have often been represented as rivals. They were rivals,to a certain extent, in the battle between the alternating and direct currentin which Tesla championed the former. He won; the great power plants atNiagara Falls and elsewhere are founded on the Tesla system. Otherwisethe two men were merely opposites. Edison had a genius for practical inventionsimmediately applicable. Tesla, whose inventions were far ahead of the time,aroused antagonisms which del- ayed the fruition of his ideas for years. However, great physicists like Kelvin and Crookes spoke of his inventionsas marvelous. "Tesla," said professor A.E. Kennely of HarvardUniversity when the Edison medal was presented to the inventor, "setthe wheels going round all over the world...What he showed was a revelationto science and art unto all time.." "Were we," remarks B.A. Behrend, distinguished author andeng- ineer, "to seize and to eliminate the results of Mr. Tesla'swork, the wheels of industry would cease to turn, our electric cars andtrains would stop, our towns would be dark, our mills would be dead andidle." Forecasting is perilous. No man can look very far into the future. Progressand invention evolve in directions other than those anticipated. Such hasbeen my experience, although I may flatter myself that many of the developmentswhich I forecast has been verified by events in the first third of thetwentieth century. It seems that I have always been ahead of my time. I had to wait nineteenyears before Niagra was harnessed by my system, fifteen years before thebasic inventions for wireless which I gave to the world in 1893 were applieduniversally. I announced the cosmic ray and my theory of radioactivityin 1896. One of my most important discoveries - terrestrial resonance -which is the foundation of wireless power tran- smission and which I announcedin 1899, is not understood even today. Nearly two years after I had flashedan electric current around the globe, Edison, Steinmetz, Marconi, and othersdeclared it would not be impossible to transmit even signals across theAtlantic. Having anticipated so many important developments, it is notwithout assurance that I attempt to predict what life is likely to be inthe twenty-first century. Life is and will ever remain an equation incapable of solution, butit contains certain known factors. We may definitely say that it is a movementeven if we do not fully understand its nature. Movement implies a bodywhich is being moved and a force which propels it against resistance. Man,in large, is a mass urged on by a force. Hence the general laws governingmovement in the realm of mechanics are applicable to humanity. There are three ways by which the energy which determines human progresscan be increased: First, we may increase the mass. This, in the case ofhumanity, would mean the improvement of living conditions, health, eugenic,etc. Second, we may reduce the frictional forces which impede progress,such as ignorance, insanity, and religious fanaticism. Third, we may multiplythe energy of the human mass by enchaining the forces of the universe,like those of the sun, the ocean, the winds and tides. The first method increases food and well-being. The second tends tobring peace. The third enhances our ability to work and to achieve. Therecan be no progress that is not constantly directed toward increa- singwell-being, peace, and achievement. Here the mechanistic conception oflife is one with the teaching of Buddha and the Sermon on the Mount. While I am not a believer in the orthodox sense, I commend religion,first, because every individual should have some ideal -religious, artistic,scientific, or humanitarian -to give significance to his life. Second,because all the great religions contain wise prescriptions relating tothe conduct of life, which hold good now as they did when they were promulgated. There is no conflict between the ideal of religion and the ideal ofscience, but science is opposed to theological dogmas because sci- enceis founded on fact. To me, the universe is simply a great machine whichnever came into being and will never end. The human being is no exceptionto the natural order. Man, like the universe, is a machine. Nothing entersour minds or determines our actions which is not direct- ly or indirectlya response to stimuli, and from the concordance of our reactions, understandis born. In the course of ages, mechanisms of infinite complexity are developed,but what we call "soul" or "spirit", is nothing morethan the sum of the functioning of the body. When this functioning ceases,the "soul" or the "spirit" ceases likewise. I expressed these ideas long before behaviorists, led by Pavlov in Russiaand by Watson in the United States, proclaimed their new psychol- ogy.This apparently mechanistic conception is not antagonistic to an ethicalconception of life. The acceptance by mankind at large of these tenetswill not destroy religious ideas. Today Buddhism and Christianity are thegreatest religions both in number of desciples and in importance. I believethat the essence of both will be the religion of the human race in thetwenty-first century. The year 2100 will see eugenics as firmly established. In past ages,the law governing the survival of the fittest roughly weeded out the lessdesirable strains. Then man's new sense of pity began to interfere withthe ruthless workings of nature. As a result, we continue to keep aliveand to breed the unfit. The only method compatible with our notions ofcivilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilizationand the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct. Sever- al Europeancountries and a number of states of the American Union steri- lize thecriminal and insane. This is not sufficient. The trend among eugenistsis that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is nota desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century fromnow it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person whois eugenically until than to marry a habitual criminal. Hygiene, physical culture will be recognized branches of education andgovernment. The Secretary of Hygiene of Physical Culture will be far moreimportant in the cabinet of the President of the United States who holdsoffice in the year 2035 than the Secretary of War. The pollution of ourbeaches as exists today around New York City will seem as unthinkable toour children and grandchildren as life without plumbing seems to us. Ourwater supply will be more carefully supervised, and only a lunatic willdrink unsterilized water. More die or grow sick from polluted water thanfrom coffee, tea, tobacco, and other stimulants. I myself eschew all stimulants.I also practically abstain from meat. I am convinced that within a centurycoffee, tea, and tobacco will no longer in vogue. Alcohol, however, willstill be used. It is not a stimulant but a veritable elixir of life. Theabolition of stimulants will not come about forcibly. It will simply nolonger be fashionable to poison the system with harmful ingredients. BenarrMacfadden has shown how it is possible to provide palatable food basedupon natural products such as milk, honey, and wheat. I believe that thefood which is served today in his penny restaurants will be the basis ofepicurean meals in the smartest banquet halls of the twenty- first century.There will be enough wheat and wheat products to feed the entire world,including the teem millions of China and India, now chronically on theverge of starvation. The earth is bountiful, and where her bounty fails,nitrogen drawn from the air will refertilize her womb. I developed a processfor this purpose in 1900. It was perfected fourteen years later under thestress of war by German chemists. Long before the next century dawns, systematicreforestation and the scientific management of natural resources will havemade an end of all devastating droughts, forest fires, and floods. Theuniversal utilization of water power and its long-distance transmissionwill supply every household with cheap power and will dispense with thenecessity or burning fuel. The struggle for existence being lessened, thereshould be development along ideal rather than material lines. Today the most civilized countries spend a maximum of their income onwar and a minimum on education. The twenty-first century will revise thisorder. It will be more glorious to fight against ignorance than to dieon the field of battle. The discovery of a new scientific truth will bemore important than the squabbles of diplomats. Even the newspapers ofour own day are beginning to treat scientific discoveries and the creationof fresh philosophical concepts as news. The newspapers of the twenty-firstcentury will give a mere "stick" in the back pages to accountsof crime or political controversies, but will headline of the front pagesthe proclamation of a new scientific hypothesis. Progress along such lines will be impossible while nations persist inthe savage practice of killing each other off. I inherited from my father,an erudite man who labored hard for peace, an ineradicable hatred of war.Like other inventors, I believed at one time that war could be stoppedby making it more destructive. But I found that I was mistaken. I underestimatedman's combative instinct, which it will take more than a century to breedout. We cannot abolish war by outlawing it. We cannot end it by disarmingthe strong. War can be stopped, not by making the strong weak but by makingevery nation weak or strong, able to defend itself. Hitherto all devicesthat could be used for defense could also be utilized to serve for aggression.This nullified the value of the improvement for purposes of peace. ButI was fortunate enough to evolve a new idea and to perfect means whichcan be used chiefly for defense. If it is adopted, it will revolutionizethe relations between nations. It will make any country, large or small,impregnable against armies, airplanes, and other means for attack. My inventionrequires a large plant, but once it is established it will be possibleto destroy anything, men or machines, approaching within a radius of 200miles. It will, so to speak, provide a wall of power offering an insuperableobstacle against any effective aggression. If no country can be attackedsuccessfully, there can be no purpose in war. My discovery ends the menaceof airplanes or submarines, but it ensures the supremacy of the battleship,because battleships may be provided with some of the required equipment.There might still be war at sea, but no warship could successfully attackthe shore line, as the coast equipment will be superior to the armamentof any battleship. I want to state explicitly that this invention of minedoes not contemplate the use of any so-called "death rays." Raysare not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantitiesand diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of NewYork City (approximately two million horsepower) transformed into raysand projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, accordingto a well-known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent asto be ineffectual. My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or ofmicroscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at greatdistance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of anykind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus be transmitted by a streamthinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist. This wonderful featurewill make it possible, among other things, to achieve undreamed-of resultsin television, for there will be almost no limit to the intensity of illumination,the size of the picture, or distance of projection. I do not say that theremay not be several destructive wars before the world accepts my gift. Imay not live to see its acceptance. But I am convinced that a century fromnow every nation will render itself immune from attack by my device orby a device based upon a similar principle. At present we suffer from thederangement of our civilization because we have not yet completely adjustedourselves to the machine age. The solution of our problems does not liein destroying but in mastering the machine. Innumerable activities still performed by human hands today will beperformed by automatons. At this very moment scientists working in thelaboratories of American Universities are attempting to create what hasbeen described as a "thinking machine." I anticipated this development. I actually constructed "robots." Today the robot is an acceptedfact, but the principle has not been pushed far enough. In the twenty-firstcentury the robot will take the place which slave labor occupied in ancientcivilization. There is no reason at all why most of this should not cometo pass in less than a century, freeing mankind to peruse its higher aspirations. And unless mankind's attention is too violently diverted by externalwars and internal revolutions, there is no reason why the elec- tric millenniumshould not begin in a few decades. =============================================================================ARTICLE #3 Taken from American Rifleman, October 1993 edition. TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF WE WARNED YOU THEY WERE COMING AND THEY'RE HERE The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. So just repealit. NRA warned its members. We tried to warn all Americans. We said thestakes couldn't be higher, that innocent lives were on the line. And wesaid it would be like no other threat. Today, that threat is crouching at freedom's door, ready to commit theultimate crime against the Bill of Rights. For the first time, an anti-gunWhite House is in league with anti-gun politicians in Congress. For thefirst time, power-hungry federal bureaucrats have ganged up with gun hungryenemies of the fundamental right to protect ourselves and our families.And while these enemies of the Constitution stalk our rights and threatenour values like never before, the media elite cover their tracks. Blindedby bias and feeding on its hatred for you and other law-abiding gun owners,the national press cheers on the gun ban movement, reserving greatest praisefor the greatest attack on your rights. Never before has such raw political muscle been brought to bear in thebiggest power grab in Second Amendment history. And lost in the struggleare not just patriots who salute the Second Amendment as a pillar of ourdemocracy, but crime victims-some 1.2 million annually who thwart criminalattack with privately owned firearms. To these Americans, the Second Amendmentis the right to say "No" to a criminal predator and make it stick. It's time for America to face the facts: the enemies of the right tokeep and bear arms always had a plan to infringe on the Second Amendment.Now they've got the power to finish it off. UNDER CLINTON: NO DEFENSE AGAINST "THE MAN IN THE SHADOWS" "We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights ofordinary Americans to legitimately own handguns and rifles...that we areunable to think about reality." When he said this on March 11, 1993(USA Today), President Bill Clinton was unable to think about the realityof criminal attack. Sonya Dowdy was and remembering her attack two yearsbefore, remains fixated on her right to defend herself: "I was livingalone. My father bought me a handgun that day and gave it to me that night.Fifteen minutes later, I was picking up my mail, and there was a man standingin the shadows."-Sonya Dowdy Bill Clinton could not have been clearer in his State of the Union address:"Send me [the Brady bill], and I'll sure sign it." And SarahBrady could not have been clearer in her statement to the New York Times(8-15-93): "Without the first step of the Brady bill, we're nevergoing to get anywhere...Once we get this [the Brady bill], I think it willbecome easier to get the laws we need passed." And Brady was clear on the laws she thinks you need: "[M]ore thoroughbackground checks," the Times disclosed, "including fingerprintingof purchasers, require safety training for gun buyers and a system of 'needs-basedlicensing' with different requirements for hunters, target shooters andsecurity guards." Crime victims need not apply for their rights. Theydon't even make her list. But to these crimes against the Bill of Rights,victims themselves can not be clearer: a president who asks them to waitis a president who asks them to die: "I pulled my gun, and he ranaway. If I had to wait," Sonya Dowdy said, "I would be dead now." UNDER CLINTON: CRIMINAL OFFENDERS "GET TREATMENT'" 3.2 CITIZENS"GET LOST" When crime threatens every American family, Americans demand that thenation's chief law enforcement officer be a fighter whose aim on criminalsnever falters and faith with crime victims is never broken. "I laterlearned he had committed a crime in Texas for which he got a 10-year sentence:he served three months. He just raped a 12 year old. And he had wedgedhimself between me and my car." -Sonya Dowdy Under Clinton, they get an Attorney General who told prosecutors thatthe Second Amendment's days are numbered: "We can do something aboutguns, if only this nation would rise up and tell the NRA to get lost!"In fact, we can do something about violent crime, if only this nation wouldrise up and tell the chief law enforcement officer of the United Statesto take her hatred of 3.2 million law-abiding citizens and channel it againstthe violent criminals-and reserve treatment programs for crime victims. UNDER CLINTON: AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO SMIRKS AT SELF-DEFENSE The day Clinton and Reno introduced their crime bill, NRA send CBS's"This Morning" press clips of women who've defended themselveswith handguns purchased hours before they were attacked: Sonya Dowdy ofNorth Carolina defended herself with a gun received 15 minutes before anattack. Rayna Ross of Virginia thwarted a knife attack with a gun purchasedthe day before. The family of Virgen Blanca of Texas thwarted a repeat-intruderwith a gun purchased the day before. But when CBS's Paula Zahn raised the issue of self-defense, the nation'scheif law enforcement officer had one response: a smirk. "This billis designed to get deadly assault weapons out of the hands of civilians."she added. UNDER CLINTON: A FEDERAL POLITICAL POLICE FORCE This summer, secret documents inadvertently released by the FederalBureau of Investigation revealed that, under Clinton, the agency was giventhe greed light to lobby for passages of the "Brady bill." Andeven for the FBI, Brady was just a start. FBI documents revealed a largercampaign: semiautomatic firearms bans, restrictive licensing, a ban onammunition commonly used in hunting and personal protection, gun ownerregistration, and federal qualifications for gun purchasers with buy-backprograms for the disqualified. The plan to convert FBI to a federal policeforce was made complete by a "publicity" campaign-a proposedtaxpayer-funded lobbying effort expressly forbidden by federal law. In firing FBI Director William Sessions soon after the documents weremade public, Bill Clinton faced a unique political opportunity. He couldassure the American people of the FBI's independence from politics andsalvage the morale of agents increasingly troubled over FBI politicizationin Clinton's own "TravelGate" fiasco-all with just four wordsto his nominee: "Stay out of politics." He didn't, or nomineeJudge Louis Freeh didn't listen. In responding to questions on the Bradybill before the U.S. Senate July 30th, Freeh said only that such initiativesshould not be made public: "I would not disagree or attempt to setaside a recommendation which my predecessor has already made-although notpublicly, his recommendation was made in confidence to the Attorney General.I would not set that aside or disagree with it." On the Brady bill,the "first step" to more restrictions: "I would enthusiasticallyand vigorously support its enforcement." And on banning guns, he said,"The strongest piece of gun legislation [which Congress passes] Iwould enforce diligently, completely and exhaustively. With that law onthe books...there would be no respite with respect to its enforcement.""Everybody has a right to be protected. And they deserve a chanceto have a gun. It's in the Bill of Rights." -Sonya Dowdy UNDER CLINTON: A MASS MURDER COVER-UP On July 23, 1993, U.S. Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) wrote to Lloyd Bentsenand Janet Reno, concerned about the investigation into the deadly assaulton the Idaho home of Randy Weaver and the deaths of some 80 people at thecompound in Waco, Texas. Craig wrote: "My own review has led me todraw some preliminary conclusions hinting at problems larger than the Weaver/Harrismatter-pre-existing problems that were manifested in Idaho and potentiallyin Waco, but are not limited to either case." "Do you think there'dbe any convincing the politicians?"-Sonya Dowdy Craig closed by sayinghe looked forward to the results of the investigation. The Senator mayhave quite a wait. The Clinton administration is covering up the Waco debacle.His Treasury Department is attempting to hide the work of the "WacoAdministrative Review Group" under the guise of a separate "systemof records" exempted from public disclosure. Arguing that releasing the records would "allow individuals tolearn whether they have been identified as suspects," Clinton's croniesforgot that most of the suspects are dead. Killed. Mention of any othersin official records can be bloated out to safeguard legitimate law enforcementinterests while the larger record is released in the public interest. Clinton'sunelected bureaucrats have given Americans only 30 days to object to thesecrecy. At press time, the Clinton cover-up is nearly a done deal. UNDER CLINTON: A CONGRESS HUNGRY FOR YOUR GUNS Politicians like Howard Metzenbaum and Charles Schumer have aimed foryour guns before. Now they've got a plan with presidential power. SenatorMetzenbaum's S.653 makes it a crime to "transfer or possess"certain semiautomatic firearms, including some .22 rimfire self-loadingrifles. The bill also gives the Treasury Department the power to ban anyother semiautomatic firearm at the discretion of a political appointeeelected by no one. Senator Dennis DeConcini bans specific domestic andimported self-loading firearms in S.639/H.R.1472. Senator Metzenbaum wantsmuch more: "Until we ban all of them, we might as well ban none..."Metzenbaum said during an August 3rd hearing. Politicians not only have the power to grab the guns millions of Americansown, but the ammunition used for self-defense. Senator Daniel Moynihan'sS.178 (called cosmetically the "Violent Crime Prevention Act")prohibits the manufacture, transfer or importation of 9mm,.32 and .25 caliberammunition. His S.179 slaps a 1000 percent federal tax on 9mm, .32 and.25 caliber ammunition. If you're wealthy, you have rights. If you're poor,you're dead. And Congressman Robert Torricelli (D-NJ), in H.R.544, wantsto make it a federal crime for any individual to purchase more than onehandgun within a 30 day period. To Torricelli, firearms ownership is aprivilege to be rationed, not a constitutional right to be safeguarded.Like other gun rationing advocates, he's ignorant of the facts. Since enactmentof a similar law in South Carolina, violent crime has risen steadily. They have a plan-and the power-to grab your guns, your ammo and yourland. In a move to stop hunting and hunter access in an area the size ofDelaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island combined, the misnamed "CaliforniaDesert Protection Act." turns back the clock on scientific wildlifemanagement and reverses progress made in restoring game and non-game speciesin the California desert. And it's a dangerous precedent: what they cando in the desert, they can do in the hills and mountains of anywhere inthe U.S.A. UNDER CLINTON: CITIZENS WHO'VE HAD ENOUGH Never before have Americans faced a U.S. President so bent on restrictingthe Second Amendment of the Constitution at the expense of crime victims. Never before has the director of the nation's premier law enforcementagency openly expressed support for the strongest infringements on SecondAmendment rights. And never before has the Congress so blatantly and adamantly calledfor laws clearly written to shred the Bill of Rights, roll back America'scultural tradition of hunting and our precious natural resources. For theBill of Rights, American history is beginning a new chapter. Only the individualmembers of the National Rifle Association of America will decide whetherit's the Second Amendment's last chapter or a lasting record of its continuingstruggle. With your commitment. Our children will read in the history of thiscrucial era the first account of renewed liberty. They will learn of ourconcerted drive against violent crime that carried us safely into the nextcentury. And they will discover that the ultimate crime against the Billof Rights was prevented, because American patriots cared enough to fightfor what's right. FIGHTING CRIME - THE NRA WAY. Each year, 60,000 predators are convicted of crime and never go to prison.That includes 1,200 murderers, 7,000 rapists and 36,000 convicted of aggravatedassault. And each year their numbers grow by 60,000 more. In the face of a tidal wave of violence, our nation is repeating itsworst domestic policy failure of the 1960s and 1970s: it is locking upproportionately fewer offenders. At a reckless pace, Bill Clinton and like-mindedpoliticians in a growing number of states are abandoning the proven policyof incapacitation and embracing the failed policy of rehabilitation. More"earned time" credit. More unchecked plea bargaining. More automaticparoles. More "alternatives to incarceration." More crime. Fewer rights for crime victims. Politicians like Bill Clintonare not surrendering our streets to the criminals. They're giving themaway. The father of basketball superstar Michael Jordan may have been thevictim of this catch-and-release criminal justice travesty. One suspectin the case served less than two years0for assault with a deadly weapon-anax-with intent to kill, plus armed robbery. The other suspect was monthson bond awaiting trial on charges that he nearly crushed a woman's skullwith a cinder block. President Bill Clinton's answer to this merciless revolving-door system?Spin the door faster. Clinton has cut a half a billion dollars from federalprison construction. In its place, he wants 50,000 new police-a down-paymenton his campaign pledge of 100,000 officers. Surely, there are jurisdictions that are under-patrolled and precinctsunder-staffed. Americans, both citizens and police, don't want 50,000 newpolice as much as they need 10,000 new prosecutors and judges. Withoutany of Clinton's new recruits, Lumberton, North Carolina, is drowning incriminal cases. The D.A> who's handling the Jordan murder case toldthe press he has a thousand pending cases. As in most locales, law enforcementthere is doing a great job. It's the bottleneck downstream-prosecutors,the courts, prisons-that keeps skull-crushing monsters in business. So why the Clinton bid for thousands of new police? Politics. Accordingto Clinton domestic policy advisor Bruce Reed: "The best thing politicallyfor Bill Clinton is to have people look out their window, see a cop onthe corner and say: 'Bill Clinton put that cop there.'" By focusingon appearances instead of action, Bill Clinton ensures that any thug hisnew officer arrests will be back on the streets faster than the officermakes it home. If the community policing strategy is right for your locale, fine. Butdon't ignore the real answer to runaway violent crime: more prosecutors,courts and prisons. Through its CrimeStrike Division, NRA has an answer to violent crime-18essential reforms for an effective criminal justice system. Representinga consensus of some of the best criminal justice minds in the country.CrimeStrike's "Essential Elements" include: *Mandatory prison sentences for the most serious offenders, includinguse of a deadly weapon and sex offenses against women and children. *"Real Offense" Sentencing to ensure offenders are sentencedfor their "real offense," not what they were able to plea-bargain. *Mandatory life without release for a third conviction of violent orserious felony similar to the "3 Strikes You're Out" initiativebacked by NRA in Washington state. *Death penalty for first degree murder with aggravating circumstances. *Tough, determinate sentences with "truth-in-sentencing,"coupled with prison release policies that require every inmate to serveno less than 85% of prison sentence. *Affordable prisons and jails which do not allow persons in custodyto live better than law-abiding persons living at the poverty level. *Comprehensive, effective juvenile justice reform with early interventionfor youth at risk. *Adequate prison capacity with authority to privatize institutions. *Protection against civil and criminal liability for a person's exerciseof reasonable defensive force, including deadly force in self-defense,defense of a third person or to prevent a serious felony.

Sir Isaac Newton formulated the Law of Universal Gravitationin 1666 which led to this conclusion. The famous law states that the gravitationalpull of one body on another body depends on the product of the masses ofthe two bodies. Therefore, a planet such as the earth will attract anotherobject with this force. The further out in space one goes, the less attractionis exerted on it by the body. That the moon's gravity is one sixth of theearth's has been assumed for centuries, through there is now evidence thatthis is not the case. William L. Brian II, a Nuclear Engineer from OregonState University investigated what he calls a "NASA cover-up"in his 1982 book entitled: "MOONGATE: SUPPRESSED FINDINGS OF THE U.S.SPACE PROGRAM (THE NASA-MILITARY COVERUP)." Brian centers his argumentfor a cover-up on the so-called "neutral point" between the earthand the moon. This neutral point, and all gravitational bodies have them,is the point where a space vehicle enters the predominant attractive zoneof the moon's gravity. It is the region in space where the earth's forceof attraction equals the moon's force of attraction. Since the moon issmaller and supposedly has a lesser surface gravity, the neutral pointshould be quite close to the moon. If the moon has one sixth of the earth'sgravity, the neutral point is calculated to be about nine-tenths of thedistance between the earth and the moon. The average distance to the moonis about 239,000 miles; hence this places the neutral point approximately23,900 miles from the moon's center. Throughout the fifties and sixties,the neutral point between the earth and the moon was given over and overagain as between 22,078 and 25,193 miles from the center of the moon. Thesefigures, merely logical guesses from trained scientists, were based uponNewton's Law of Universal Gravitation. However, only be observing fallingor orbiting bodies in the moon's vicinity could the actual neutral pointdistance, hence the moon's true gravity, be determined. Using the aboveneutral point and assumed gravity for their calculations, the U.S. andthe Soviet Union began to send space probes to the moon in the late fifties.They met with a miserable failure. The Russians were the first to launcha successful lunar probe, Luna 1, on January 2, 1959. It flew within 4,660miles of the moon and broadcast back information before continuing on intodeep space. The U.S. made three unsuccessful attempts before achievinga fly-by of 37,000 miles from the surface some months after Luna 1 withtheir Pioneer 4. The Russian's Luna 2 became the first space probe to hitthe moon and Luna 3 Circled the far side of the moon, approached within4,372 miles, and sent back photos of the far side. Strangely, Russian moonexploration came to a four year stop after these successes. Furthermore,the Russian's were intensely secretive about the data they collected. TheAmerican efforts were almost laughable at first. The Ranger Space Probeswere designed to hard land on the moon with seismometers in spherical containersdesigned to withstand the impacts on the moon. Ranger 3, launched on January26, 1962, missed its target completely and went into a solar orbit. Ranger4, hit the moon but did not send back any useful information. Ranger 5missed the moon by 450 miles and then the effort was put off for two yearswhile the entire program was reorganized--something was wrong with theircalculations! Ranger 6, launched on January 30, 1964, allegedly had itselectrical system burn out in flight and no pictures were sent. SubsequentRanger probes were more successful. The Russians reactivated their spaceprobes, but their Luna 5; launched on May 9, 1964; crashed at full speedon the moon, when it was intended to make a soft landing. Luna 6 utterlymissed the moon, and Luna 7 crashed on the moon's surface when its retro-rocketssupposedly fired too soon. Luna 8 also crashed on the moon, but Luna 9became the first probe to successfully soft land on the moon. Missionsbecame more successful after this, and Brian alleges that this is becausethe Soviets and Americans had been able to recalculate the neutral pointand correct gravity of the moon from the many failures (and the few successes).The strangest thing to come out of the reanalyzing of "observing bodiesfall and orbit the moon" was for NASA to come up with a new neutralpoint between the earth and the moon. And this is the key to "a NASAcover-up", according to Brian. The July 25, 1969 issue of Time magazinestated that the neutral point was 43,495 miles from the center of the moon.Werner von Braun in the 1969 edition of "History of Rocketry &Space Travel", said that the neutral point was 43,495 miles from thecenter of the moon. Other reliable sources, obtaining their informationfrom NASA, claimed that the neutral point was between 38,000 and 43,495miles from the center of the moon. The pre-Apollo distances were givenas 20,000 to 25,000 miles from the center of the moon. NASA, it appears,had recalculated the neutral point, which would indicate that the moon'sgravity is not one sixth, as Newton had stated. We invite readers to researchthese figures for themselves. According to Brian, if the neutral pointof the moon's gravity is 43,495 miles from the moon, then the gravitationof the moon is 64% of the Earth's surface gravity, not one-sixth or 16.7%as predicted by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation! Bizarrely, NASAand the status-quo of science and government continue to allude that themoon's gravity is one-sixth that of the earth's, representative of a neutralpoint less than 25,193 miles from the moon. Brian goes on to say that ifthe neutral point were more like 52,000 miles instead of 43,495 miles fromthe moon, the moon's surface gravity would be identical to the earths!Brian's data dwells heavily on inconsistent and contradictory informationreleased through NASA, indicating an official cover-up. Brian's book goeson to list other evidence that the moon has a higher gravity than previouslyassumed; in fact, a gravity nearly equal the earth's! He points out theflight times of the Apollo spacecraft are inconsistent and much fasterthan if the moon had only one-sixth gravity, as the vehicle would continueto decelerate until it reached the neutral point, at which point it wouldbegin to accelerate again as it became pulled by the moon's gravity. Assumingthat Brian is right about a higher surface gravity on the moon, then theramification of the high gravity on the fuel requirements of the lunardescent and ascent vehicle of the manned Apollo program to the moon arehorrific! The Apollo launch rocket weighed 6,400,000 pounds. The payloadsof the Lunar Module are correct, assuming that the moon had only one-sixthgravity. However, under a high lunar gravity the Lunar module would havehad to have been nearly as large as a Titan 2 rocket which weighs 330,000pounds and was 103 feet tall (the actual Lunar module, according to NASA,weighed 33,200 pounds)! The startling conclusion is that if men reallylanded on the moon in high lunar gravity conditions, it was not done withrockets! These amazing conclusions, backed up by many scientists and usingNASA data itself, raise a number of questions: Why did the Russians apparentlypull out of the space race when they were hot on the trail of putting aman on the moon? How did the United States succeed when rockets would clearlynot work in the high lunar gravity conditions? What was the military'sinvolvement in top secret research which led to the successful moon landings?Did we even go to the moon as claimed? One publication, also by a formerNASA employee, uses the same information from NASA used by Brian to "prove"that we never made the trip! (This book is "We Never Went To The Moon",by Bill Kaysing, 1981, Desert Publications, Cornville, Arizona). Briangoes on to offer more "proof" that the moon's gravity is nearlyequal to that of earth's, and that NASA staged the whole show in orderto fake a one-sixth gravity, presumably to hide the fact that they hadto use the ultra-secret "anti-gravity" device that were whatreally powered the Lunar Module. Consider these "facts": In onesixth gravity, a 180 pound man would weigh a mere 30 pounds. Writers hadprogrammed the public to expect athletic feats of a spectacular naturewhen astronauts explored the moon. In the November 1967 issue of ScienceDigest and article entitled, "How To Walk on the Moon" was printedthat predicted that men would be able to make 14-foot slow-motion leaps,perform backflips and other gymnastics like professionals, and be ableto easily move up ladders and poles with their arms. An astronaut, evenin a cumbersome suit could jump six times higher on the moon than earth.Even though the alleged weight of the spacesuits and backpacks of the astronautswas 185 pounds, the total combined weight of a 185 pound astronaut andhis suit would be only 62 pounds. This is still only one third of the astronaut'sweight. Therefore, the astronauts should have been able to jump verticallyfar higher than they could on Earth without any burden. Brian believesthat an average man can jump about 18 inches high without a run. Basketballplayers routinely jump over three feet high. However, though astronautssuch as John Young made a number of leaps while on the moon, they neverjumped more than about 18 inches in height, while they were theoreticallycapable of slow backflips! Brian believes that this is explained by theevidence that the moon's gravity is not one sixth, but much heavier, andthat the spacesuits did not weight as much as NASA said. Young and otherastronauts were, essentially not capable of jumping more than 18 inchesoff the ground. Evidence that the suits weighed far less and 185 poundsis given that the astronauts practiced in the same suits at an area ofOregon known as the "Bend". What would be the point of doingmaneuvers in a 185 pound space suit, when on the moon the astronaut andsuit would weigh a mere combined total of 62 pounds? Furthermore, how didthey manage to do maneuvers if the suits weighed so much in the first place?Brian estimates from his own research that the spacesuits and backpacksweighed a combined total of about 75 pounds. Brian also discusses the scenein which during Apollo 12 when astronaut Conrad jumped the final threefeet from the bottom of the ladder to the moon's surface. He mentionedthat the three foot jump may have been a short one for Neil, but for himit was a long one. Later, when he was scooping up a contingency sampleof moon material, astronaut Bean warned him not to fall over since he appearedto be leaning forward too far. Supposedly, it would be difficult for himto get up in the moon suit if he fell over. Brian analyses the scene bysaying that jumping off a three foot ladder in one sixth gravity wouldbe like jumping from a 6 inch height on the earth. Even with a heavy suitand back on, it would scarcely have been felt the astronaut, and they couldhave lowered themselves down with their arm strength alone. Furthermore,should Conrad have fallen over, they should have been able to right themselveswith a simple arm push. Furthermore, astronaut Charles Duke during Apollo16 fell a number of times while on the moon. Since objects on the moonwould supposedly take two and a half times longer to fall in one-sixthgravity, Duke should have had plenty of time to catch himself. Brian findsit incredible that the astronauts during Apollo 14 failed to climb conecrater as was planned. At one point during the mission, astronaut Sheppardwent down on one knee to pick up a rock and required the aid of astronautMitchell to stand up! About two-thirds of the way to their destination,their heart rates were up to 120 beats per minute as they moved uphill.After four hours of travel, the two astronauts were still a half hour away,they estimated from their goal, and Sheppard estimated that they couldnot reach the top of the crater in that time, so they abandoned the mission.This is all the more astonishing in that the crater is little more thana hill, the entire distance to be traveled was estimated as 1.8 miles.If the astronauts were two-thirds of the distance, they should have beenable to travel the remaining half a mile in six minutes, assuming thatthey traveled a speed of five miles an hour on the moon in one-sixth gravity.And yet, they estimated that half an hour would not be enough! Brian commentson a great deal more material which he finds inconsistent in the Apollomissions, including inconsistencies in the Moon Rover, but his final commentis quite revealing. During Apollo 17 astronauts Cernan and Schmitt begantheir first assignment by deploying and loading the Rover. Cernan apparentlybecame quite excited and his Capsule Communicator, astronaut Parker warnedhim that his metabolic rate was going up. This meant that he was usingmore oxygen. Cernan replied that he had never felt calmer in his life andindicated to Parker that they would take it easy. He mentioned to Parkerthat he thought Cernan was working at one-sixth gravity. Cernan's replywas, "Yes. You know where we are . . . whatever." Brian suggeststhat the latter remark by Cernan in response to the moon's gravity seemsto suggest that he wanted to avoid the discussion. Perhaps Parker was notaware of the high gravity situation and asked an embarrassing question.Brian's book is fascinating, though not without flaw. For instance, hedoes not seem to understand the difference between the fundamental physicalconcepts of mass and weight. However, his discussion of the discrepancyof stated values of the neutral point between the earth and the moon appearsvalid. If Brian is correct, and the moon's gravity is nearly that of theearth's, then we are faced with the question of how and if NASA "reallydid it." Perhaps NASA just faked it, as suggested in the movie CapricornOne and discussed in the book, We Never Went To The Moon. On the otherhand, Brian and others suggest that we did in fact go to the moon, butwe defeated the high gravity conditions not with rockets, but with anti-gravitydevices. That the Lunar Module was in reality an anti-gravity device hasbeen suggested by several researchers. Brian claims that in high lunargravity conditions, the LM could not have taken off from the moon, andthat it's ascent is not consistent with that of a rocket powered vehicle.he also states that no rocket exhaust can be seen from the lunar moduleafter it's initial explosion. Does the moon have a high surface gravity,greater than one-sixth? Does gravity control really exist? If so, why dowe continue to expend billions of dollars on dangerous rockets that canexplode on take-off? If NASA has developed anti-gravity devices based onEinstein's unified field, then have we really stopped going to the moon?Perhaps the science-fiction of the Star Wars movies is more of a realitythan NASA would have us believe! =============================================================================ARTICLE #5 OCR'd BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF WHY ARE FRENCH HEMOPHILIACS DYING OF AIDS? BECAUSE FRENCH OFFICIALSKNOWINGLY GAVE THEM TAINTED BLOOD. B L O O D M O N E Y This is a horror story, and it's far from over. It began in 1985 inFrance, a country often envied for its system of universal health careand tradition of medical excellence. In one of the most shameful episodesof the AIDS epidemic, physicians and government officials there knowinglyallowed at least a thousand people to receive blood or blood products contaminatedby the virus that causes the disease. Three hundred of those people-mainlyhemophiliacs, many of them children-are already dead. The rest are goingto die, barring a miracle. They are, of course, not the only victims of transfusion- related AIDS.At the epidemic's start in the early 1980s, before a viral cause was foundand the blood supply could be protected, many hemophiliacs and people whoreceived transfusions were likewise infected by contaminated blood. Thetragedy, born out of ignorance, occurred in nearly every country in theworld. But in France what began as ignorance turned into calculated connivance.Using tainted blood stocks became a matter of economic expediency and government-sanctionedpolicy. The callous handling of the affair is widely believed to have contributedto the rout of the ruling Socialist party in last March's elections. Twoyears ago, when the scandal broke, Georgina Dufoix, who in l985 oversawthe health system as minister of social affairs, protested her innocenceon television. "I feel re- sponsible," she told a flabbergastedaudience, "but not guilty" To the disgust of many, when the casefirst came to trial last summer both she and former health minister EdmondHerve, her subordinate, were conspicuously absent from the dock. Insteadthe rap was taken by lesser government officials and by Michel Garretta,a physician (now suspended) and former director of the National Centerfor Blood Transfusions (known as the CNTS in France). "I'm not ashamed,"he said in his defense, with a disingenuousness that echoed Dufoix's. "Thedecisions I made at the time, I would make again, for myself and my ownchildren." Garretta has never stopped claiming that not enough wasknown about AIDS even in early 1985 to foresee that hemophiliacs and transfuseeswere running a mortal risk. Nor was he alone, he insisted at his trial,in failing to act when he did know the truth. "Thousands of peoplewere informed," he said, "but they didn't necessarily draw theconsequences." Why not? There are answers, but none offers much comfort. IN 1983 U.S. BLOOD BANKS WARNED THAT THE CAUSE OF AIDS WAS PROBABLYTO BE FOUND IN BLOOD. THE FRENCH RESPONSE WAS "BEATIFIC OPTIMISM." Hemophilia is a genetic disease that afflicts males almost exclusively.Those affected suffer crises of uncontrolled internal bleeding becausethey lack proteins, most commonly one called factor VIII, that are neededto clot blood. Until the 1960s such a crisis was usually treated with ahospital transfusion of fresh whole blood or plasma (The fluid part ofthe blood, which contains the critical proteins). But all that changedwith the introduction of cryoprecipitate-the sediment of frozen plasma,which is five times richer than fresh blood in clotting proteins. A methodwas soon developed to concentrate clotting proteins from the pooled bloodof hundreds of donors. Available in easily stored powered form, these concentratesnot only let hemophiliacs treat themselves but also enabled them to workand travel with unprecedented freedom. The drawback of the concentrateswas that a single donor infected with a blood-borne disease (the most dreadedbefore the 1980s was hepatitis) could contaminate all the concentratesmade from a batch of pooled blood. France's hemophiliacs, however, feltrelatively safe from that risk. "In this country" explains FrancisGraeve, honorary presi- dent of the Association of French Hemophiliacs,"blood is freely donated." French addicts couldn't sell theirdisease-ridden blood for the price of a bottle or a fix (whereas in theUnited States it was technically possible to sell blood until 1981, andpaying for plasma remains the norm). In the French view, giving blood wasa noble act, and donors were respected as healthy, civic-minded people.Unfortunately many drug addicts in Paris gave blood to get the free sandwichesand coffee handed out at collection posts. The French blood system wasa perplexing marriage of genuine idealism and charity, hitched to a quasi-feudalpower structure. At the top was the Ministry for Social Affairs, whichpays all medical costs in France through the Social Security Administration.Next came the Ministry of Health, which granted the exclusive right tocollect and distribute blood to 160 transfusion centers (a network of independent, government- regulatedbodies). Seven of these were large regional centers responsible for manufacturingand distributing blood products such as clotting factors, according toprices set by the ministry. The most powerful regional fife (as you mightguess from its name) was the National Center for Blood Transfusions inParis, a gleaming black steel-and-glass bastion in the city's quiet fifteentharrondissement. Its factory was already satisfy - ing about half the nationaldemand for blood plasma and concentrates and was trying to do better. (In1982 the Ministry of Health granted the CNTS a monopoly on imported bloodproducts, with instructions to reduce them and bolster national self-sufficiency.)Together with its research advisers, who included top hematologists atParis 's giant public hospitals, the CNTS was a formidable operation. TheCNTS didn't initially think AIDS was its problem. In 1981 , when the U.S.Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced its first cases , most wereoccurring in homosexual men; the first AIDS diagnosis in an American hemophiliacin January 1982 didn't alter the French perception that this was a gaydisease whose prime vector was semen. By March 1983, however, more unsettlingnews had arrived from the United States. In the journal Transfusion, readby hematologists the world over, American blood banks joined forces toannounce "eight confirmed cases of AIDS in hemophiliacs treated withantihemophilic factor" and to warn that the still unknown causal agentwas probably to be found in blood. The startling response of the Ministryof Health to this news was "beatific optimism," according tophysician-journalist Anne-Marie Casteret, writing in the May 4 editionof the doctors' daily, Le Quotidien du medecin. The ministry was apparentlynot alone in ignoring the warning. The CNTS's research director, a hematologistnamed Jean-Pierre Alllain, maintained that "no relation has been demonstratedbetween a very high number of transfusions and AIDS." Yet in June. Allain himself published a study of 2,300 French hemophiliacs that suggestedotherwise: six of his subjects showed clinical signs of AIDS, such as swollenlymph nodes and striking weight loss.. (There were no tests yet for thestill mysterious causative agent. A retrovirus had been isolated from apatient that February by Luc Montagier at the Pasteur Institute in Paris,but whether this virus caused AIDS remained to be confirmed.) What's more,three of the six hemophiliacs showing signs of AIDS in Allain's study hadbeen receiving clotting factor made only from the blood of French donors.It seemed that the French blood supply might not be pristine after all.In July Ler Mode,France's newspaper of record, reported the first caseof AIDS in a French hemophiliac. That summer the ministry, chief medicalcounsel, General Director of Health Jacques Roux, circulated a letter totransfusion centers telling them to be wary off blood donations from peoplein all the known risk groups, which now included intravenous drug users.But beatific indifference prevailed. A ministry survey conducted shortlyafterward revealed that even in Paris-a city with a disproportionate shareof AIDS cases-a majority of blood banks didn't think of their donors aspresenting any risk. The myth of pure French blood was so pervasive thatin January 1984 a program to collect blood in prisons was actually steppedup. (Studies for the following year showed that 25% of France's contaminatedunits came from prisons.) By the fall of 1983 Montagnier, at the Pasteur Institute, had developeda prototype test to screen blood for antibodies to the virus he believedwas responsible for AIDS. This test involved mixing drops of blood withproteins from the virus that were known to cause an antibody response:a color change indicated that an antibody reaction had taken place andthat the blood was probably infected. An initial study of French hemophiliacsusing the Pasteur test identified "a strong incidence" of antibodiesto the virus in 133 French hemophiliacs. These results were announced-butnot published or fleshed out with numbers-by CNTS lab chief Anne-MarieCourouce at an in-house conference on March 13, 1984. The myth of pureFrench blood was crumbling fast. Yet the CNTS did not reveal these findingsto the Ministry of Health. Nor did CNTS share its information with thehemophiliacs' association, whose officers were in the very same building. This fog of willful optimism was penetrated almost by accident. Theevents were set in motion not long after U.S. AIDS researcher Robert Gallostole Luc Montagnier's thunder by announcing in April 1984 that the retrovirusboth had been studying, the one we now call the human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV), was indeed the cause of AIDS. That July an ener- getic Frenchimmunologist, Jacques Leibowitch, called Francois Pinon, chief of hematologyat the giant Cochin Hospital of] Paris, requesting a favor. A family memberwas to have surgery at the hospital, and Leibowitch wanted to send Pinonsome AIDS-free blood donors that he'd selected himself. Pinon was offended;he protested that his blood supplies were perfectly safe. But he was impressedthat Leibowitch had come up with his own way to screen blood for HIV antibodies-neither Montagnier's Pasteur test nor any other was yet on the market.(Leibowitch's method was to add blood samples to lab dishes containingHIV -infected cells; an antibody response in the dish meant that the bloodbeing tested contained antibodies to the virus and, thus, that the donorwas already infected.) The two men subsequently decided to run a studyon Pinon's stocks . Neither realized how terrifying the results would be.. That same July, at the congress of the International Blood TransfusionSociety in Munich, word went out that heating blood products could inactivatetbe AIDS virus. Even though there were no published data yet, no transfusionspecialist could afford to ignore the implications. Indeed, Garretta, thenassistant director of the CNTS, opened negotiations while still in Munichto license a heat treatment from Immuno, an Austrian firm. But at the time,no deal was closed. Garretta became director of the CNTS the followingOctober He inherited an institution that was deeply dependent on Ministryof Health subsidies to meet its operating losses; in addition, it was farfrom its goal of making France self-sufficient in blood products. Garrettaimmediately stepped up factor VIII production without waiting to developheating techniques, despite a report in the medical journal The Lancetin September that heat treatment killed animal retroviruses. It was a terriblemiscalculation. Just how terrible became clear on December 12, when Leibowitchfinished screening the Cochin blood stocks. Ten of the 2,000 blood samplesprovided by Pinon tested positive for HlV antibodies. (To make sure, theresults were independently confirmed by a much more laborious test calleda Western blot.) Aghast, Pinion did some fast mental arithmetic. Publichospitals in Paris alone used 500,000 units of blood per year, based onan infection rate of five units per thousand (0 . 5 percent) , that translatedinto 2,500 contamination per year, or roughly seven new infections perday. He issued a written warning to the doctors at Cochin to cut transfusionsto a bare minimum and then called the Ministry of Health and the CNTS. The implications for Garretta were inescapable: each batch of the CNTS'sfactor VIII was prepared from as many as 5,000 pooled blood donations,so the chances of any batches escaping contamination were almost nil. Byupping his production, Garretta had accelerated the epidemic. Pinon hadconfirmed what at least one of the CNTS 's top officials, the researchdirector Allain, already suspected. For some time Allain had been procuringimported, heated concentrates for a young patient of his, a hemophiliacteenager he'd taken into his own home; he warned the boy to destroy hisunheated CNTS stocks because tbe heated concentrates were "purer."But the vague admonition didn't stop the boy from injecting unheated factorVIII one night that December when he felt a Painful bleeding crisis comingon. Allain's wife, also a CNTS employee, exploded when she learned whathad happened. "You idiot! " she said to the boy. "How couldyou do that? " He had previously tested seronegative; he became seropositive.By February 1985 the case for heat-treating blood was closed. In two reportsin The Lancet, Montagnier confirmed that heat killed the AIDS virus andthat heated concentrates prevented infection. "Virgin" (previouslyuntreated) French hemophiliacs given only heated factor VIII tested negativefor HIV "while those treated with unheated factor VIII tested positive. Hurriedly" Garretta signed a deal with Immuno for its heating technology.But it would be months before his factory could be refitted, and only importsof heated factor VIII could avert a tragedy in tbe interim. Still he heldback. If the CNTS asked the ministry to cover the cost of the imports,its officials might want to know why it had taken so long to discover thetainted-blood crisis and protect the blood supply. As Allain had warnedGarretta in January (in what Allain later claimed was a last-ditch attemptto stop the catastrophe), "Garretta was exposing the CNTS to"discredit and failure, in the achievement of one of its fundamental missions.So Garretta began covering his track? That spring a CNTS official persuadedPinon to join an anti-AIDS strategy group. It was "a way to not reallytake into account, our alarm signal," Pinon summed up later, "andit is my impression that it delayed a decision." Pinon and the restof the group called for the immediate introduction of heat treated products,imported from abroad if necessary. But in May, when the presiding CNTSofficial submitted the group's report to the Ministry of Health, the documentincluded a phrase that recommended deferring the decision to recall orto leave the unheated products in circulation to a higher government authority. Not that the ministry would necessarily have heeded Pinon and his colleagues.On March 12, 1985, General Director of Health Roux had received a reportfrom an aide concerning Pinon and Leibowitch's latest finding. The twohad located 19 seropositive donors at Cochin and another hospital withblood bank facilities; recipients of factor VIII prepared from their bloodhad been located, too. All were seropositive. The report concluded: "Itis probable that all the blood products prepared from pools of Parisiandonors are now contaminated," with the word all underlined for emphasis.Roux couldn't ignore this report. Yet, he says now, he had "no powerto implement" health policy. Only Health Minister Herve could ordainthe destruction of contaminated stocks and speed up donor testing. (Montagnier'santibody test still wasn't available, but a test made by Abbott, a U.S.company, had been approved for American use on March 2, 1985.) So Rouxforwarded this report to Herve's office with a letter appealing for action.Herve denies receiving it. It wasn't until May 9, 1985 five long monthsafter Pinon Called the CNTS with his initial data-that Garretta himselfwrote to the Ministry of Social Affairs, saying that cleaning up the bloodsupply was "an absolute urgency." But the CNTS's boss also saidthat a "compromise" had to he found "between the imperativesof public health and the economic constraints." By his calculations"from that time on "every three months of delay" in testingdonor and using heated factor VIII meant "the deaths of five to tenhemophiliacs and some of their close relations." His guess was basedon studies showing that only 10 percent of HIV-positive patients had sofar developed AIDS. (The CDC now estimates that thus far 29 percent ofinfected people have gone on to develop AIDS; of those, some 63 percenthave died to date.) But the economic constrains, he groused , were "considerable": importing heated factor VIII alone would cost 41 millions francs (about$5 million at the time); destroying contaminated stocks and making up the20 percent production loss due to the heating process would cost millionsmore. The Ministries of Health and Social Affairs, of course, would haveto cover those costs. To minimize them, Garretta recommended that the CNTScontinue to provide unheated products to its clients until mid-July. Hewas proposing that they all accept a few more deaths between May and Julyfor the sake of staying on budget. On May 10 the officers of the Association of French Hemophiliacs trustinglyplayed into his hands. Garretta had recently promised them that the CNTSwould soon be making heated products. However, pleading technical problems,he had not named a date. He omitted one other detail, said the association'shonorary president Graeve: "He never told us the stocks of unheatedfactor VIII were contaminated." So the association asked only thatthe ministry ban the sale of unheated blood concentrates after October1, 1985-time enough, they figured, for Garretta to refit his plant. Itnever occurred to them, said Graeve, that Garretta also "needed toget rid of his stocks." Meanwhile, on May 9, another link had been forged in the chain of tragedy.That day representatives of the prime minister and the Ministries of Health,External Commerce, Social Affairs, and Finances met to discuss the PasteuInstitute's production arm, Pasteur Diagnostics, which was struggling towardcommercializing Montagnier's test. Its American competitor, Abbott, hadalready requested French government approval for its own test in February.Everyone knew that compulsory testing of blood donors was long overdue.But they figured that if Abbott seized the market for tests in France'stransfusion centers, there would be no market for Pasteur's product, inFrance or elsewhere. (Just as the French felt cheated out of the discoveryof HIV, they now felt in danger of being squeezed out of the antibody-testmarket.) It added up to a choice between buying foreign tests and savinglives, or saving an annual market estimated at 91 million francs ($11 million)for a French company. Once again, economics won. It was decided that "thelicensing file for Abbott be held awhile longer," until Pasteur caughtup. On May 29, in the CNTS building, Garretta held another meeting withhis top officers. The fundamental question facing them, he said, was this:"Should we accept that all our products are contaminated?" Unfortunately,he added, recalling contaminated products would entail "grave consequences."According to the meetings minutes, a CNTS doctor named Jean Yves Mullersaid: "The important thing is to avoid contaminating the hemophiliacswho aren't yet." But no one suggested how contaminations could beavoided if the deadly concentrates remained on the market. Instead theyresolved to wait "for the higher authorities"-meaning the Ministryof Health-"to forbid us to sell these products, with the financialconsequences that this represents." In effect, they were asking theirsuperiors to stop them before they killed again. On June 1, Allain met with the Consulting Commission on Blood Transfusion,a watchdog for the ministry composed of government officials and physicians.One regional center director who was present recalls that the commissiondecided discreetly-this does not appear in the recommendations signed bythe 31 physicians presents-that "just for a few weeks, a transitionperiod, you could inject the unheated product into people who were alreadyseropositive." Of course, he admitted, "we knew we needed heatedproducts for all hemophiliacs." There were medical as well as ethicalconcerns: Who knew what effect reinfection might have in an HIV-positivepatient? (According to CDC researchers, reinfection poses the risk of becomingcontaminated with a new strain of the virus that might be resistant toAIDS drugs and could exacerbate the disease.) There were scattered revolts against Garretta. In mid- June, Roux "slammedthe door on a meeting" of Health Minister Herve's cabinet and refusedto attend meetings of the Consulting Commission until heated blood productswere universally available. In a bureaucratic pique be declared that he"wouldn't defend the ministry's policy anymore." But that leftno one to oppose Garretta inside the Ministry of Health. No one upstairswas listening, anyway. On June 27 Jean Ducos, a usually influential directorof a transfusion center in Tonlouse, wrote to Dufoix, the minister of socialaffairs, begging to see her immediately. One month later her secretaryreplied that "previous engagements" made a meeting impossible.Ducos also wrote Herve at the Health Ministry that it was "impossible. . . in all conscience to continue to pressure hemophiliacs" to accept"noxions" products. Herve never responded. Meanwhile, Garrettabegan planning how to sell off his contaminated wares. On June 26 he wroteto his aides at the CNTS: "The distribution of nonheated productsremains the normal procedure, so long as they are in stock." If prescribingphysicians didn't ask for safe goods, they wouldn't get them. Heated concentrates,he added, were "authorized"-not required-only for recipientswho tested HIV-negative. His aides bullied physicians to accept unheated concentrates. "Youcouldn't just say, 'This patient's seronegative; give us the heated products,'"recalled Thierry Lambert, a Parisian hematologist and researcher. "Eachprescription had to be discussed"-and the discussions were "sometimesdifficult." To prevent sharing of the precious heated goods, no patientwas allowed more than a one-month supply. The worst of it, the awful catch-22, was that hardly any physicianscould prove their patients were seronegative-because there were still noscreening tests on the open market. Approval for the Pasteur tests cameonly at the end of June, when Prime Minister Laurent Fabius (alerted thatCasteret and other reporters were readying highly critical stories) announcedcompulsory testing of donors. Even then the promise rang hollow, sinceit was not until July 23 that the social security system agreed to reimbursethe costs of testing. (Abbott's test was approved in France the followingday.) What with delays in distribution and the training of test personnel,by the end of 1985 only 1,670 hemophiliacs-fewer than half the 4,000 inFrance-had been tested for HIV. That same July 23 the Ministries of Health and Social Affairs decidedthat Garretta could continue to sell his unheated stocks as long as anyonewould buy them. The only caveat was that after October 1 the social securityfund, which ordinarily reimburses prescription costs, wouldn't pay forunheated factor VIII. Apparently the transition period agreed to by theConsulting Commission in June would now extend into the fall. On September 6 the Association of French Hemophiliacs belatedly sawthe light. Agreement with Garretta's plans, their leaders said at a meeting,had not been meant as permission "to off-load cumbersome productsonto unsuspecting hemophiliacs." They called for a ban on unheatedconcentrates and alerted their membership and the media. Garretta subsequentlycomplained that they had ruined his "realistic and responsible"strategy. He'd been forced to import more heated factor VIII than he'dplanned, and he was stuck with "large stocks of unused French products."The contaminated ones, that is. In fact, he had already sold plenty. According to internal CNTS records,1.6 million units of its unheated factor VIII were off-loaded between Julyand October of 1985. The biggest sales were just before and after the summervacation-to hemophiliacs and parents of young hemophiliacs stocking upfor trips, or replenishing supplies when they came home. Graeve, of thehemophiliacs' association, was among them. On July 12 he bought some unheatedfactor VIII for his hemophiliac teenage son. Graeve doesn't know whetherthe batch he bought was contaminated and, if so, whether it hastened hisson's death from AIDS. But this much is certain: Graeve would never haveknowingly given his child a substance that might harm him. Just how many people were condemned to die between December 1984, whenthe CNTS became aware of the extent of the crisis, and October 1985, whenits last contaminated products were sold? Garretta and his aides have alwayscontended that upwards of 90 percent of France's seropositive hemophiliacswere infected before 1985, when contamination, so to speak, became officialpolicy. HOwever, a retrospective study conducted at two Paris hospitalsfound 60 hemophiliacs for whom "the year of seroconversion is knownwith precision thanks to a reference serum drawn less than a year before."Seventeen of the 60-28 percent-seroconverted in 1985. Nor were hemophiliacs the only victims. At an inquiry late last year,the CNTS's Courouce testified that "a simple calculation shows thataround 200 people per month were contaminated" by blood from infecteddonors from April through August 1985, in the months before AIDS testswere easily available. In other words, there were "about 1,000 victims,"not counting the victims' subsequently infected spouses, lovers, or newborns. The French judicial system is commonly viewed as an arm of the staterather than as an independent power. It thus surprised no one in Francethat when the first suit was filed by hemophiliacs in 1988, the investigatingmagistrate in charge of the case moved at an excruciatingly cautious pace.It would take four years for the case to come to trial. Meanwhile, amongthe press, only Casteret took the story seriously. She began to visit formerCNTS and ministry officials and to amass a gigantic file of official documents-afeat in a country where freedom of information has never existed. Yet thehardest part, she recalled, was to believe what she was seeing "I'ma doctor," she said, "and I couldn't conceive that a doctor wouldfollow an economic logic instead of a healing logic." She withheldfull publication until she had checked her work too much to doubt it. InApril 1991 her articles began to appear in the newsweekly L'Evenment dujeudi. One of her readers was Edmont-Luc Henry, an accountant and hemophiliacwho had been contaminated with HIV in 1984 while under treatment by a CNTSphysician. Enraged by Casteret's revelations, Henery filed charges against"a person or persons unknown" for "poisoning"-a felonythat, in the French penal code, carries a life sentence. Apparently toforestall a felony trial, the state's investigating magistrate abruptlyissued misdemeanor indictments against Garretta, Allain, Roux, and Roux'sMinistry of Health colleague Robert Netter. In March 1992 they were chargedwith "deception over the basis quality of a product," under alaw that Sabine Paugam, Henry's lawyer, acidly described as designed topunish vendors of spoiled mustard. (The indictment of Roux and Netter waswidely considered a maneuver to shield Herve himself.) The four men werefirst tried last summer by a panel of judges at Paris's Palace of Justice.In October 1992 Garretta was sentenced to four years in jail and a heavyfine. (He lost any hope of clemency when he absconded to Boston beforehis sentencing to work as a consultant for a biotech firm.) Roux receiveda suspended sentence, Netter was acquitted, and Allain, sentenced to twoyears in jail, appealed and was granted a retrial. In an unusual move,perhaps to satisfy public opinion, which considered the sentence too lenient,state prosecutors asked that all four men be retried. The object of thesecond trial, which began this past May in the Paris Court of Appeals,was to decide whether the original verdict would be upheld, lessened, orstiffened. This was still a criminal trial, conducted by state prosecutors.But in France victims and their lawyers are allowed to put their side ofthe story to the court. During the appeal, Paugam and other lawyers representinghemophiliacs pressed to move the case to the felony court on the toughercharges of poisoning. If so, additional defendants could be named. Thelawyers have also asked that charges of poisoning be filed against Herve,Dufoix, and former prime minister Fabius in the HIgh Court of Justice,the only tribunal in France that can try former ministers for offensescommitted while in office. As he awaited the outcome of this latest trial, Henry summed up thelegal and ethical issues at stake with the relentless simplicity of a dyingman: "If you're sitting in an office counting boxes of products, youcan talk about marketing," he said. "But not if you're treatinghuman beings. If you're a doctor, you don't give people products that canhurt them." Indeed, Garretta didn't just help destroy hundreds of lives; he deeplydamaged the relationship between patient and doctor. "What I mostreproach Garretta for," Pinon said recently, "is that he createddistrust in the blood system, which is completely built on trust."Garretta's performance in the May court hearings did nothing to restorethe French public's faith. Day after day, the haggard former head of theCNTS tearfully recited the same refrain: "It wasn't possible for meto decide alone. No one ever said we should do things differently."He was a scapegoat, he said, for a common failure of foresight and courage. Should doctors be better than the rest of us? Why blame Allain, forexample, for staying on at the CNTS and carrying out Garretta's policy?After all, as he said when interviewed during the trial, "I have fourchildren of my own, and I need to make a living." Behind him was acourtroom packed with anguished parents who used to have children of theirown. Their sons are dead now because men like Garretta and Allain-and nodoubt many others who will never be publicly named-betrayed them. =============================================================================ARTICLE #6 Taken from The Anti-Gravity Handbook TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF TALES FROM THE RED PLANET: MARS, UFOs,AND ANTI-GRAVITY "The improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledgeauthority as such; for every great advance in natural knowledge has involvedthe absolute rejection of authority" T. H. Huxley As if the moon were not the source of enough mysteries and cover-upsby NASA and the scientific community, in their apparent attempt to hidetheir own "flying saucer" research and other military schemes,the Red Planet, Mars adds its two bits to the whole bizarre scenario. Mars has featured in mankind's fantasies and mythology for thousandsof years. The planet itself is named after the Roman god of war (or viceversa). Jonathan Swift wrote in "Gulliver's Travels" in 1726that astronomers on "Laputa," the mythical floating land whichalso means "prostitute" in spanish, had discovered two swiftlymoving moons on Mars, and provided information on their distances fromMars and their periods of revolution about Mars. Astonishingly, the moonsof Mars had not been "discovered" yet, and would not be, officiallyfor another hundred and fifty years of so, though Kepler had surmised beforeSwift's time that Mars had two moons. Swift's information on the distancesfrom the planet and the revolution periods of Mars were two moons. mostScientists merely pass it off as a "good guess." This was justthe start of the mystery of the moons of Mars, and of Mars itself. Priorto 1877, when the moons were seen for the first time, no one (except possiblySwift) had seen any moons on Mars even through excellent telescopes wereat the disposal of astronomers, easily capable of discerning the moons.Mars was a popular planet to view, and literally hundreds of astronomersobserved Mars for some time, and even discovered moons on Uranus untilone day Asaph Hall found that Mars had two satellites where none had beenbefore. Not only this, but the two Martian satellites moved at very high speedsand, strangely, traveled in different directions! These and other factorshave led some prominent astronomers to actually put forth the suppositionthat the moons are artificial! The Soviet astronomer I.S. Schklovsky, pointedout that the Martian satellite Phobos exhibits a strange acceleration inits orbit, an irregularity which would be expected if the satellite werein reality a huge metallic sphere that was hollow. The same differencein speed, however, would be impossible for a natural astronomical body.Therefore, says, Dr. Schklovsky, at least one of the moons of Mars is nota natural object, but an artificial satellite placed in orbit around theplanet, possibly in 1877, or shortly before that time. A few years later, astronomers observing Mars began to notice markingson the planet that seemed to be connected in a system that covered thewhole planet. These markings were dubbed to be "canals" and wereactually thought to be just that by many of the foremost astronomers ofthe times. The Italian astronomer Schiaparelli was the first to note thecanals in the early 1890s, and other astronomers began to notice them aswell. The American astronomer Percival Lowell, who built one of the bestobservatories in the world in Flagstaff, Arizona, became obsessed withthe canals, drew detailed maps of them and worried that the Martians werefighting a losing battle to survive on a dying planet. The "canals" exist, there can be no doubt. Just what theyare, is the question. Considering the great variety of canals on the Martiansurface, it was thought by some scientists that the Martians were tryingto signal us. At one time plans were suggested for planting mid-westerncrops in patterns by way of acknowledging the communication. Canals wereseen to wax and wane by astronomers, and would apparently move at times,confusing everybody. In the 1910 issue of "Nature," the astronomer James Worthingtonmade the comment, after visiting Lowell at his observatory in Flagstaff(and Lowell was of the outspoken opinion that there was life on Mars andthe canals were of an artificial nature), "As to the deductions whichDr. Lowell had drawn from his observations I have nothing to say exceptthat the startlingly artificial and geometrical appearance of the markingsdid force itself upon me." Flashes of light were frequently seen on Mars and have been called TransientMartian Phenomena, much like the Transient Lunar Phenomena of the samenature. While some astronomers interpreted it as signals, others thoughtit to be clouds drifting across the surface. One prominent place wherethe "projections" (flashes of light) occurred, is the lcariumMare, and Percival Lowell stated at the American Philosophical Societymeeting in December 1901, that more han 400 projections seen in the Marewere clouds reflecting light. Icarium Mare, he said, was undoubtedly agreat tract of vegetation and was given to forming clouds. As time went on, and Percival Lowell died, other scientists were sureto make statements that there was no life on Mars, nor any of the otherplanets in our solar system. This did not stop the wave of hysteria whenOrson Wells broadcast his Halloween hoax of H.G. Wells' "War Of TheWorlds," simulating an actual invasion from Mars. After the Viking1 Orbiter flew by Mars on July 31, 1976 at an altitude of 1,278 miles,taking picture of the Martian surface, some new and interesting informationsuddenly came up in a photograph released and described by NASA only as"the northern latitudes of Mars." In the photograph since publishedseveral times in Omni magazine (April, 1982 and March, 1985), as well asin other journals, a huge rock formation that looks like a face can beseen in the center of the photo. This rock formation has been measuredas one mile across. NASA claims that it is an illusion caused by the angelof the sun. Furthermore, to the left of the photo are two rock formations whichappear to be pyramidical in shape. They are clearly throwing out triangularshadows. Parallel lines, looking like perfectly straight runways or roadsappear in the upper left hand portion on the photo. According to Jim Safranof Lunar Photos in Van Nuys, California, these markings appear in quitea few of the Viking Mars photos. Oddly, these artificial-looking markingshave been cropped out of the photos that appeared in Omni magazine andare not mentioned at all. Fortunately, two computer scientists who work for Computer Science TechnicolorAssociates, of Seabrook, Maryland, a company that does contract work forNASA, noticed the photos, and decided to analyze them themselves. The scientists,Vincent DiPietro and Greg Molenaar concluded that the face in the photos,taken of the Elysian Plains, would "appear to have been carved ratherthan formed by nature," as there is no surrounding sediment that couldhave resulted from natural erosion, as NASA claimed. They furthermore concluded that the face was truly symmetrical (theywere using computer enhanced photos to make their detailed analysis). Ithad two halves, each containing an "eye," a "cheek"and an appropriate continuation of the "mouth." They even discoveredwhat resembles an eyeball with a visible pupil in the eye socket. Theyalso discovered that there was a second NASA photograph of the "Facein Space," as it has been dubbed, and that it was just an illusioncaused by the angle of the sun on a natural formation. The whole affair got even sticker when a science writer who was a friendof DiPietro and Molenaar, named Richard Hoagland, got original copies ofthe photos and then claimed to have found, in the same photo, a "lostcivilization on Mars" (Omni, Vol 7 No. 6, March, 1985)! They had turnedtheir attentions to the pyramidical features to the west of the face, andto the grid-like pattern of rectilinear markings like the layout of a cityin the shadows of the upper pyramid. He also spotted a series of rightangles contributing to an overall impression of a main avenue leading towardthe face. Hoagland discovered that this main "avenue" seems to be alignedin a special way with the face, which itself runs along a northeast-southeastaxis with the Martian poles. Back then, a person standing in the centerof the "city," gazing east over the face, would be sighting alonga solstice alignment; that is, seeing the sun rise directly over the faceon the longest day of the Martian year. Hoagland surmised that for 50,000years, the first summer sun of the year would have risen above the face.Later, as the planet tilted, the alignment of the solstice viewing wouldhave passed right through the top of the pyramid as well. The honeycomb like tracery that exists in the shadow of the pyramidcould be optical "glitches" caused by the photo-enhancing process.Yet, these walls cast shadows, and DiPietro and Molenaar claim they didnot get these kinds of glitches with enhancements of aerial photos takenhere on Earth. The grid spacing suspiciously resembles that of real citystreets, and the layout is aligned toward the winter solstice sunrise.An architect friend of Hoagland's calculated the buildings would have beenoriented in a manner that would best use the scant winter warmth of theshortest day of the Martian year. Incredibly, the senior scientist withthe U.S. Geological Survey and one of the world's leading experts on Martiangeology, a man who headed the NASA group in charge of selecting the siteswhere the Viking landers set down, Harold Masursky, told Omni magazine,"If you're going to say features like that are evidence for a pastcivilization, that's total nonsense. I'm working on finding landing sitesfor a possible Mars Rover. And this (the city on Mars) is not one of theareas where I would send what is probably a thirty-billion dollar mission.In fact, if somebody bought us a free one, I'm not sure I'd send it therebecause there are too many other places that are more interesting."Is Masursky a blind idiot, or is he toeing the party line, so to speak?He is probably not an idiot, and considering the startling finds of NASAon the Moon, and their many secret projects and coverups, it is not surprisingthat he would make such statements. Either masursky is on the peripheryof NASA knowledge, and actually believes that there is nothing worth viewingat this "Martian City" (it would be interesting to hear his commentsof UFOs), or he is naturally trying to avert attention from this startlingfind and cover up what may even be a "live city" as opposed toa "dead" one. Interestingly, a book published in 1978 by Avonbooks in the United States, and which originally appeared as a BBC specialin Britain, called "Alternative 3" (by Leslie Watkins, DavidAmbrose and Christopher Miles) was reportedly an investigation into thedisappearance of scientists in Britain and the United States. Accordingto the book, these scientists were being send to Mars(!) by NASA to workin secret cities there, in an effort to create a habitual climate on Mars(which included melting the polar ice caps and building dome-cities onthe planet). The reason, the book stated, was that NASA was doing thisbecause the Earth's atmosphere is becoming super-heated and unbreathable.Life was doomed on earth; therefore, a secret conspiracy, involving mostof the world's governments (including the U.S.S.R.) were working to movea certain portion of mankind to Mars. According to the book, the first manned landing on Mars took place inthe early 1960s, and Mars Bases were begun shortly afterwards. Anti-gravityspaceships were used to shuttle scientists and "brainwashed,"kidnapped, slave-workers to the bases to work. There was a lunar stagingbase in a crater on the moon. While the book made some impact on UFO and conspiracy buffs, and waswritten in a matter-of-fact style and purported to be an investigativebook, it was in fact an April Fool's Day television special done for theBBC that was never aired on April Fool's Day because of a television strikein Britain. When it was finally aired, straight-faced, some months later,most people did not realize that is was an April Fool's joke. It was laterpublished in Britain and the United States in book form as "sciencefact," also on April Fool's Day. An interesting story, it is howeverquite unlikely, considering the difficulty that both the Soviets and theAmericans had in just landing space probes on the moon in the early sixties,much less Mars. Even if NASA possessed anti-gravity vehicles at that time,it seems unlikely that they would have been flying them to Mars while laughinglyflinging Rangers at the Moon. Furthermore, the author, British journalistLeslie Watkins has come right out and said that the whole book was a hoax.Yet still, many UFO buffs believe it as fact. One does wonder, though, if NASA has visited Mars yet in one of itssupposed "Anti-Gravity" craft? It seems unlikely. They are fartoo busy preparing for nuclear war and setting up presumed bases on theMoon. With all the UFOs out there (especially on the Moon, if reports areto be believed), and their occasional interference in the NASA space program,NASA may consider it too dangerous to take a manned flight to Mars. One cannot help but think that there was certainly life on Mars in thepast, if not now. Are some UFOs from Mars? Perhaps they are little greenmen, busy mining our Moon without a permit, exploiting Earth's God-givennatural resources, much as huge multi-national companies and western powershave been doing to underdeveloped nations here on earth. Still more disturbing are the many reports of captured alien craft andeven aliens, by the U.S. Government. In the book, Clear Intent: The GovernmentCoverup of the UFO Experience, by Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood,they catalog a great deal of evidence for what they term a massive coverupof UFO data and even captured UFOs that have either crash landed or beenshot down by the airforce. They relate one interesting story about a "crashed" UFO inthe Pacific that happened in 1973. An unidentified Naval Intelligence officertells how, while stationed at the Great Lakes Naval Base in Chicago, hewas the Officer of the Guard and was asked to take a sealed message tothe Commander inside a highly restricted quonset hut at the northwesternend of the base. He had been told that there was highly top secret materialinside. Normally the OD would come to the door, but was busy that nightso he was allowed inside. This was highly unusual. "As I went to the doorway, where the OD was, I saw a very highlyunusual craft over to my left. The craft was possibly thirty to thirty-fivefeet long, about twelve to fifteen feet at its thickest part; then it taperedoff in the front to a teardrop shape. I only caught it at an angular view.It looked like it did not have any seams to it. It had a bluish tint, butthat was only if you looked at it for a few seconds." As the officerturned to leave, he got another look at it, "At this time I had avery good view about halfway from the craft to the tail section. The wholecraft tapered back to a very high edge. It looked as if it had a razorsharp edge. The bottom went about three quarters the length of the craftand then angled sharply upward." The craft sat on a frame made outof four by four wooden blocks, with crossbeams under it, so that it wassitting one or two feet off the floor. Later, the Intelligence Officer was in San Diego talking to some crewmembers of a destroyer who said that they had tangled with an unidentifiedcraft. The destroyer had show down the craft while heading from San Diegoto Hawaii in 1973 with a surface to air missile, but did not destroy it.It sank in about 350 feet of water. The Glomar Explorer was used to extractthe craft and it was sent by rail to Chicago. When the crew member drewa picture of the unidentified craft, it matched perfectly the craft thatthe Intelligence Officer had seen at the Great Lakes Naval Base. One interesting incident reported in 1981 by many newspapers as wellas OMNI and other magazines, was the case of three Texas school teacherswho saw a "flying saucer" was an Army helicopter, which landedat the crash site. The ladies, all middle-aged, and respectable, reportedtheir sightings to the police. Then, a few days later, all three of thewomen los all the hair on their heads! They had apparently gotten a doseof radiation! This case does not appear to be one of an alien ship, but rather anunsuccessful test of an experimental U.S. military craft. Other tales ofcrashed UFOs appear in many books; the most famous is probably "theRoswell Incident," detailed by Charles Berlitz in the book, "TheRoswell Incident". While many of the stories appear rather fancifulin nature, and most "kidnapping" stories appear to be utter bunk,one can not discount the possibility that the U.S. and other governmentshave captured a UFO =============================================================================ARTICLE #7 San Francisco Chronicle Monday, September 16, 1985 TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF U.S. Contesting Lawsuit Over UFO Radiation. Houston Three people suing the federal government for $20 million say they donot know to this day what it was that hovered far over their heads andzapped them with radiation almost five years ago. They claim it was an unidentified flying object that was escorted awayby military helicopters. They say they suspect it was a secret U.S. militaryexperiment. In any event, they say, the government should have warned residentsthat a UFO was in their area. The military says it had nothing to do with the alleged occurrence Dec.29, 1980, on a rural road northeast of Houston. Even if there were UFOs,a U.S. attorney says, the government has no duty to warn people about thembecause the government does not know whether they are dangerous. With such straightforward arguments, the government is urging U.S. DistrictJudge Ross Sterling to throw out a lawsuit filed year by former Dayton,Texas cafe owner Betty Cash, 56, former waitress Vickie Landrum, 61, andLandrum's grandson, Colby Landrum, 11. The suit claims that about 9 p.m. on Dec. 29, 1980 while headed fortheir homes in Dayton along a two -lane road about 30 miles northeast ofHouston, the three encountered a brightly glowing craft the size of a citywater tower. It hovered at treetop level, had red and orange flames flowingfrom its bottom, and bathed them in intense heat for several minutes beforeit was escorted away by at least 23 helicopters, they assert. Their lawsuit, filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act, claims thatthe government failed to warn them of the UFO and "negligently, carelesslyand recklessly" allowed it "to fly over a publicly used roadand come in contact with the plaintiffs." As a result, all suffered stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, radiationburns, deteriorating eyesight, and the women's hair fell out and grew backwith a different texture, the suit claims. It also says that they becamehighly sensitive to sunlight, suffered blisters and headaches, and thatCash developed breast cancer. Despite the plaintiffs report that there were no markings on the "large,unconventional aerial object" or on the helicopters, the lawsuit hasrecently moved from simply suggesting that the government merely knew aboutthe UFO to saying that the government owned the UFO. The government has offered affidavits from high-ranking officials thatit had nothing to do with the UFO. -Dallas Times Herald =============================================================================ARTICLE #8 TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF The White Sides Defense Committee cordially invites you and all yourfriends to a free- WHITE SIDES CAMP-OUT on public land outside the border of the TOP SECRETGroom Lake Air Base Weekend of Oct 15-17, 1993 from Noon, Sat to"whenever" Sun.

This publication, many months in preparation, was found difficult tocompile for many reasons. One important reason was that none of the officersinvolved were pleased with the duty of bringing to the attention of ourcolleagues the names and activities of some in our nation who have beenin the past (or presently) engaged in what can only be described by lawas treason and/or sedition against their own government. While detailingthe plan of these Internationalists, the main goal of this special policepublication will be to promote an active program that will defend Americafrom those at work forming an oligarchy of Imperialism against this nationof free people. The herein described plan to halt this unAmerican activitycan succeed only with the combined efforts of the People's Protectors (thePolice, Guardsmen and Military) and their countrymen in the private sector. -2- TREASON AND SEDITION DEFINITIONS In defining "treason" and "sedition"we look to the Fifth edition of Black's Law Dictionary, pg. 1345, and pg.1218 TREASON: Thee offense of attempting by covert acts to overthrow thegovernment of the state to which the offender owes allegiance; or of betrayingthe state into the hands of a foreign power. SEDITION: ...knowingly becoming a member of any organization which advocatesthe overthrow or reformation of the existing form of government of thisstate by violence or unlawful means. The facts and information about some of the persons and their actionslisted in this special report is prima facie evidence of their long involvementin activities directly designed to covertly overthrow the lawful, constitutionalgovernment of the United States of America. These individuals thus hopeto deliver the People of the U.S. into the hands of a foreign power knownas the United Nations, which is in actuality an oligarchy of the world'ssuper rich, who have no allegiance to any one nation and who control theU.N. from behind the scenes. As the reader will find, many of these persons are, or have been, membersof various organizations that have as their purpose the destruction ofthis Constitutional Republic. IMPORTANT NOTE: Not all of the people listed in this report are involvedin treason and sedition against the United States. Some of the individualslisted and quoted are presenting evidence of these crimes committed byothers or are listed/quoted for informational purposes only. As patriotic Americans of all races, religions and political beliefs,we claim our right to defend our Republic from all enemies foreign anddomestic. This educational work is one such attempt. -3- THE NEW AGE/NEW WORLD GOVERNMENT PLAN Many of our Nation's INTERNAL PROTECTORS know of the well-laid planwhich will culminate before the year 2000, to usher the United States,along with the rest of the nations of the world, into a "utopian"global community allegedly under the control of a "philanthropic"United Nations. A great many of our fellow Officers and National Guardsmenare taking a stand against this plan because they realize that their fellowAmericans were never allowed to know of this plan nor given the opportunityto vote on such a change in their government. In addition, the officersare concerned patriots and realize that this plan of world domination isinjurious in the extreme, and a total fraud perpetrated against the peopleof the world! This publication outlines the plan of these American Internal Protectorswhich they believe will stop this diabolical agenda. THE NEW ORDER Allegedly this new order is being set up to save THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLDfrom a whole variety of "imminent" life and world-threateningdisasters. Of those sworn protectors of the people that are aware of thisglobal scheme, few realize that the actual behind-the-scenes plan is foran oligarchy of the world's richest families to place 1/2 the masses ofthe earth in servitude under their complete control, administered frombehind the false front of the United Nations. To facilitate managementcapabilities, the plan calls for the elimination of the other 2.5 billionpeople through war, disease, abortion and famine by the year 2000. As wecan plainly see, their plan for "Population Control" (reduction)is well established and under way. WORLD GOVERNMENT PLAN: ALIEN TROOPS TO POLICE U.S.A. Officers who think they will be at home watching their own childrenand spouses are wrong. Once the NWO is set up in the year 2000 (just acouple of years away) you, officer, guardsman, and soldiers, will be inother countries (listed below). Foreign police troops will be guardingand enslaving your spouses and children in U.S.A. Here is the plan- See Picture #1 for map United States troops to be stationed: Region 12. Australia Region 32 Uruguay, Argentina Region 55 Yugoslavia, Greece, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria Region 58 Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia Region 75 India, Nepal, Blutan, Tibet, E. Pakistan Region 85 Kazak SSR, Turkmen, Uzbeg, Tadzhik, Kirghiz SSR This map, adopted in 1952 in London by the World Association of Parliamentariansfor World Government, shows what alien troops would occupy and police thesix regions into which the United States and Canada would be divided. The ruling body or World Parliament would consist only of appointedmembers. It would reflect population strengths: so Asia would dominateit. There would be a World Director. 8 zone directors and 51 regional directors.None of the zone or regional directors would ever serve in their own countries.So an alien would command troops stationed in the U.S. and through themenforce World Government law, and prevent Americans from "shelteringbehind national allegiance." -4- OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000 Our OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000 plan invokes the awakening (education)of our fellow officers to the extreme need for them to take an immediateand active role in assisting their fellow Americans in stopping this planfor world dominion, using every lawful means available. HUMAN PARASITES These elitists and their families have made most of their massive fortunesoff the American people, and have dedicated entire lifetimes to using publicfunds to subjugate the People to the will of their new world ARISTOCRACY. This special police officer publication is a private endeavor, and isdedicated to those sworn Protectors of the People who refuse to play arole in enslaving their countrymen. We are proud of these brave Officerswho are presently assisting other patriotic Americans of all races andcreeds in halting this program for world dominion called the NEW AGE/NEW WORLD ORDER. Some of our Police/National Guardsmen readers suggested names for thisprivate police action plan. Our government, to maintain privacy in itsactivities, has long been in the practice of choosing unusual names forcovert operations, such as "Transylvania & Co.", "GardenPlot", "Operation Zapata", "Thunder Muffin, Inc.","Operation Watch Tower", and "Cable Splicer", to namea few. We Officers, while in the alternative, desiring the greatest amountof publicity about our plan of attack against these anti-American types,likewise have chosen a cute little name for our off-duty, First AmendmentPOLICE ACTION. That name is: OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000! -5- It is felt that this name reflects the actual program in which officersare involved, designed to stop or "kill off" the ongoing, elitist,covert operation which has been installed in the American system with greatstealth and cunning. They, the Globalists, have stated that the date oftermination of the American way of life is the year 2000. Therefore itis fitting that our date to terminate, at the very least; their plan, isalso the year 2000. LET IT BE WELL UNDERSTOOD, WE PROTECTORS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVENOT ASKED FOR THIS BATTLE. IT IS OUR NATION'S ENEMIES WHO HAVE BROUGHTTHIS FIGHT TO THE VERY DOOR OF EVERY GOOD AMERICAN. BE IT RESOLVED: * Our prayer and promise is to do all within our power, as faithfulcountrymen, to overthrow this evil, treasonous plan in a completely non-violent,lawful manner. * Our sworn duty is to protect the people of this nation and its constitutional,republican form of government from any enemy that would come against it. * Our pledge is that WE WILL, BY EVERY MEANS GIVEN TO UNTO US, UPHOLDOUR OATHS AND FULFILL OUR SWORN DUTY TO OUR COUNTRYMEN. PUTTING THE STAKE THROUGH DRACULA'S HEART WHAT CAN WE DO, WHAT SHOULD WE DO? The Globalists' agenda is a diabolicalprogram which, through patient gradualism, is slowly draining the moral,economic and political life blood from the United States and the hard workingAmerican people. We in America, Officers and private citizens alike, are fortunate thatat this moment in our history we can still LAWFULLY EXTERMINATE these parasiticGlobal Blood Suckers by placing numerous "STAKES" made of words,paper, pen, and hard work through their hardened hearts. -6- EVIDENTIARY FOUNDATION Presented here are often-used, famous quotes and statements which willmake for easy reference for those who wish to use them to educate our fellowofficers, National Guardsmen and military, or the private sector. As thereader will see, most of these statements have been around for many decadesand are known by those who study history and the machinations of megalomaniacsknown today as Globalists. Most are not new revelations, but just the opposite;however, few will ever be found in the controlled press. There are literallythousands of such well-worn statements about the coming world government.We have selected some of the very best and well known. INVESTIGATOR'S NOTE: As the investigator will notice not all of thequotes are documented as to date and place of utterance. This will troublesome. If this is a problem to the reader, he should either eliminate thosequotes, or consider, as police investigators do, the great preponderanceof evidence pointing toward any given hypothesis! In addition, as in otherinvestigations, sometimes the investigator must look at the results toaccurately check the validity of the information one is receiving. Thisis to say, that may times we must look to see if what the statement purportedwould occur, ACTUALLY OCCURRED, in order to check and see if the originalinformation received was valid. As the investigator will recognize, thisis the same process used by law enforcement in proving the reliabilityof a Confidential Informant (CI). The reader will readily see that whatthe undocumented statements listed in this publication exposed, or statedwould occur in the future, has either occurred, or is in the process oftaking place today. Therein lies the proof of the validity of the originalstatements and why they were chosen to be included in this publication. FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES FROM THEIR WORKS YOU WILL KNOW THEM. Here are their words and works,and some very important evidence (STAKES) to use and expose and "killoff" the World Government Vampires in our society. In addition tothis are included other pertinent materials (government maps, etc.) allof which revealed other parts of the same treasonous operation. With these facts in hand, our nation's internal protectors, police andNational Guardsmen, will be able to alert even the most hard-headed ofour colleagues to understand that: VERY SOON, IF WE DO NOT STOP THESE WORLDGOVERNMENT PROPONENTS, AND INSTALL IN PLACES OF LEADERSHIP HONORABLE MENAND WOMEN, ALL MILITARY, NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND OFFICERS OF THE LAW WILLBE USED -7- AS THE "ENFORCEMENT ARM" TO GUARANTEE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF"VOLUNTEERS" FOR THESE IMPERIALISTS' "PEACEFUL" SOCIALISTGLOBAL SOCIETY. EXPOSURE IS THE DEATH KNELL OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER Investigating Officers always must demand proof of a crime. No assumptioncan stand alone. Here are the confessions right from the mouths of theseparasites of liberty. Once armed with this information, our PLAN is simplyfor each Officer to take this publication, make copies of it (or ordermore copies) and pass them out ASAP to every Police Officer and NationalGuardsman he knows. All officers, for their own welfare, and in order tobe of assistance, need these facts. Keep in mind that these global governmentBlood Suckers, just like the old movie Vampires, must do their dirty deedsin darkness. The purpose of this publication is to bring that darknessto light! If we do this, the only other activity we "Police Againstthe New World Order" need apply is to UPHOLD OUR OATH OF OFFICE. Inother words, our duty is to protect the people and their rights under theU.S. and State Constitutions. We welcome every Internal Protector that loves liberty and has takenan oath "to protect our U.S> Constitution and the freedoms of theirfellow countrymen", to join us in SAYING "NO" TO THE NEW WORLD ORDER. -8- WHAT "NEW WORLD" ? Man's desire to rule the world is as old as his presence on earth. The"New" World Order is actually the same old plan for world domination.Biblical history itself shows this to be true. The Tower of Babel was onesuch futile attempt by men to set up a ONE WORLD SOCIETY without God. AndGod Himself crushed it. Satan tempted even Jesus, promising Him world dominionas His reward. This same promise has been given to scores of other menover the ages. History tells of many who have accepted the Great Deceiver'sterms. This diabolical quest has continued on through the 19th Centuryand into the 20th, with national and world figures each successively makingplans for world rule. Listed here are but a few of such statements frommany past decades up to the present. HOW SHALL WE KNOW? Some among us ask, "How shall we know when tyranny has come toAmerica's door?" There are very few answers that our Founding Fathersfailed to leave us regarding the proper and improper role of government.Here is the answer to the question of how we shall recognize tyranny: "SINGLE ACTS OF TYRANNY MAY BE ASCRIBED TO THE ACCIDENTAL OPINIONOF A DAY; BUT A SERIES OF OPPRESSIONS, BEGUN AT A DISTINGUISHED PERIOD,AND PURSUED UNALTERABLY THROUGH EVERY CHANGE OF MINISTERS (ADMINISTRATIONS),TOO PLAINLY PROVES A DELIBERATE, SYSTEMATIC PLAN OF REDUCING US TO SLAVERY."- Thomas Jefferson. (Has tyranny come to America?) Another of our Founders said - "WHEN THE GOVERNMENT FEARS THE PEOPLETHERE IS LIBERTY; WHEN THE PEOPLE FEAR THE GOVERNMENT THERE IS TYRANNY".(There is no question at this time in our history that Americans fear theirgovernment.) -9- THE FAMOUS & INFAMOUS-QUOTES Like the legendary Vampire Dracula lays claim to his victims, the Globalistslowly drains the essence of life and liberty from our Land. While it maybe surprising to some, we will begin this overview of U.S. treason anddebauchery with America's current, number one proponent of world conquest,President George Bush: GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH, President of U.S., CFR Director, Trilateralist,"Lip-reader", CIA Director. Bush, one moonlit night in 1948 atYale University, crawled naked into a coffin. With 15 brother "Bonesmen"(as they call one another) encircling him, he told personal tales of debauchery,took an occult oath, was raised ("born-again") as a MAN-GOD,jumped into a pile of mud, thus joining the occult, elitist Skull &Bones Society. He, indeed, is still a "Boner" today. See Picture 2. Bush spoke before Congress on Sept. 11, 1990, delivering a speech whichhe entitled "Toward a New World Order". Addressing the subjectof his Gulf War, he made his first public utterance of his, and his richcronies' plans for a world imperialism in stating that the war againstIraq was "...a rare opportunity to move toward an historic periodof cooperation. Out of these troubled times... a new world order can emerge." -10- Let us take a moment to compare the statements of the "Father ofour Republic" with those of Internationalist George "Boner"Bush: "The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations,is in extending our commercial relations to have as little political connectionas possible." "...Why, by interweaving our destiny with thatof any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils ofEuropean ambition, rivalships, interest, humor, or caprice?" "...Itis our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portionof the foreign world." - George Washington, September 19, 1796. (WhichGeorge should we follow?) Bush has given his New World Order (NWO) pep talks at least 20 timesover the last two years for various groups around the world. Space doesnot allow us to list all of these treasonous discourses; however, severalmore are listed further on in this report. NOTE: DON'T MISTAKE THIS "BUSH BASHING" AS ANTI-REPUBLICANISM! Many of our Officers are deeply involved in either the Socialistic RepublicanParty of the Socialist Democratic Party. Both parties have played a largepart in setting America on the course toward 3rd World Nation status. BillClinton's goals are identical to Bush's - - A New World Order Imperialism.Perot's ideas for government are also pro-Globalism. We can give Bush credit that his recent unabashed utterance of his dreamof a New World Order served to awaken at least a few slumbering Americans.These Americans now understand that, what was long planned and covertlyimplemented, is well on its way to fruition. Some will remember historicalaccounts of other megalomaniacs of the past who acted upon similar globalambitions. Several of the following are relatively recent examples: ADAM WISEHOPHF, professor at Germany 's Ingolstadt University, foundedThe Order of the Illuminati on May 1, 1776. This man designed the veryplan of world domination that is still in use today to enslave the world'smasses. Here, upon establishing his "Order of the Illuminati",he smugly reflects on his "conning" the gullible Christians ofhis day, saying: "The most wonderful thing of all is that the distinguished Lutheranand Calvinist theologians who belong to our order really believe that theysee it in (Illuminati) the true and genuine sense of Christian religion.Oh mortal man, is there anything you cannot be made to believe? -11- Evidently not! And a high percentage of Christians today are still beingconned in the same way. One prime example of this are the millions of Christians,and most church denominations, who have fallen for the NWO plan of a "OneWorld RELIGION", being spearheaded by the United Nations' Nationaland World Counsel of Churches, behind the battle cry of ecumenicalism. Watch the future and we will see only small groups of spiritual Americans,who will resist following the millions of "religious" lambs toslaughter. The Lord of the Bible always warned His people to never followthe MULTITUDE. WORLD & NATIONAL LEADERS POINT THE WAY Let us continue with statements from those who over the last few generationshave recognized the One World conspiracy. BENJAMIN DISRAELI, Prime Minister of England, was attributed with thisstatement in 1844: "The world is governed by very different personagesfrom what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes." WINSTON CHURCHILL, Prime Minister of England, stated to the London pressin 1922: "From the days of Sparticus, Wisehophf, Karl Marx, Trotski,Belacoon, Rosa Luxenberg, and Ema Goldman, this world conspiracy has beensteadily growing. This conspiracy played a definite recognizable role inthe tragedy of the French revolution. It has been the mainspring of everysubversive movement during the 19th century. And now at last this bandof extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great citiesof Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of theirhead and have become the undisputed masters of that enormous empire." JUSTICE FELIX FRANKFURTER, U.S. Supreme Court Justice: "The realrulers in Washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes." JOHN F. HYLAN, Mayor of New York 1918-1925, said "The real menaceof our Republic is the invisible government which like a giant octopussprawls its slimy legs over our cities states and nation." FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, U.S. President, in a letter written Nov. 21,1933 to Colonel E. Mandell House, Roosevelt states: "The real truthof the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the largecenters has owned the government of the U.S. since -12- the days of Andrew Jackson." (History points to the last trulyhonorable and incorruptible American president as Andrew Jackson "OldHickory".) ROWAN GAITHER, President of the Ford Foundation, in 1954 lends proofto what we know to be fact today, namely that many of our Presidents havebeen a knowing part of this World Conquest plot. Mr. Gaither stated toCongressional Reese Commission investigator Norman Dodd: "We operatehere under directives which emulate from the White House...The substanceof the directives under which we operate is that we shall use our grantmaking power to alter life in the United States so that we can comfortablybe merged with the Soviet Union." (Ike was President at that time.) CARROLL QUIGLEY, Professor of History at Georgetown University, memberof the CFR (one of the U.S. organizations dedicated to World Government)stated in his book "Tragedy and Hope": "The Council on ForeignRelations (CFR) is the American Branch of a society which originated inEngland... (and)...believes national boundaries should be obliterated andone-world-rule established." (Professor Quigley, according to hisbook, was totally dedicated to the One World Government program. Hundredsof our City, State and National politicians are members of this and otherNWO groups. Governor Clinton, for example, attended Georgetown U. and statedthat his mentor, Professor Q, taught him so many wonderful things. SinceGov. Clinton and his wife are totally dedicated, International Socialistsand NWO promoters, perhaps Prof. Q. did have a great affect!) BARRY GOLDWATER, U.S. Senator (Arizona) in his book "WITH NO APOLOGIES",stated this about another Globalist group: "The Trilateral Commissionis international (and) is intended to be the vehicle for multinationalconsolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing controlof the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commissionrepresents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidatethe four centers of power- POLITICAL, MONETARY, INTELLECTUAL, AND ECCLESIASTICAL." PETER HOAGLAND, Nebraska State Senator and Humanist, speaking on radioin 1983 with the great American Pastor and Patriot Everett Sileven said:"Fundamental, Bible-believing people do not have the right to indoctrinatetheir children in their religious beliefs because we, the state, are preparingthem for the year 2000, when America will be part of a one-world globalsociety and their children will not fit in." -13- DAVID ROCKEFELLER, Internationalist billionaire, Humanist, CFR kingpin,founder of the Trilateral Commission, World Order Godfather (and in allprobability the High School graduate voted "Most Likely to Be Hangedfor Treason"), voiced his praise of the controlled U.S. media forkeeping their oath not to divulge the Globalist plans to the public. Speakingto his fellow conspirators at a meeting, June 1991 in Baden Baden, Germany,of yet one more infamous World Order group, the Bilderbergers, Mr. Rockerfellersaid: "We are grateful to the Washington Post, The New York Times, TimeMagazine and other great publications whose directors have attended ourmeetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years." He went on to explain: "It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for theworld if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during thoseyears. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towardsa world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual eliteand world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodeterminationpracticed in past centuries". (It is not reported if the attendees kissed his ring - or anything else- after their leader bestowed his blessing on those in attendance). Actually,we could ask Governor Clinton or Dan Quayle, both of whom were there. Bushand Clinton are Bilderbergers, Internationalists, and their goals are exactlythe same for America. Let us repeat... CLINTON'S, BUSH'S, AND PEROT'S, PLANS FOR AMERICA AREVIRTUALLY IDENTICAL. The Republicans and Democrats goals for America arevirtually identical. They both are taking our nation into global government. Globalist Mr. Dan Quayle was there at the June 91 meeting being sizedup as a possible Bilderberger U.S. Presidential contender for 1996. Themajor media's job is to convince Americans that the Republicans and Democratsare on opposite sides and fighting each other. -14- JAMES PAUL WARBURG, Foreign Agent of the Rothchild Dynasty, major playerin the Federal Reserve Act scam: on February 17, 1950, while speaking beforethe United States Senate, this pompous Internationalist boasted confidently,"We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. The onlyquestion is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent." ROBERT KENNEDY, former U.S. Attorney General of the U.S: "All ofus will ultimately be judged on the effort we have contributed to buildinga NEW WORLD ORDER." - 1967. (We can all agree with Robert on one thing:All Traitors who participate in the NWO WILL be judged one day!) -15- THE WORLD MONEY POWERS The Global MONEY Vampires are in control of the finances of most ofthe world. Here are some statements of those who, past and present, havebeen aware of that control: GEORGE W. MALONE, U.S. Senator (Nevada), speaking before Congress in1957, alluded to the families that secretly own the "Federal"Reserve Bank and control the finances of the U.S.. He stated: "I believe that if the people of this nation fully understood whatCongress has done to them over the last 49 years, they would move moveon to Washington; whey would not wait for an election...It adds up to apreconceived plan to destroy the economic and social independence of theUnited States!" THOMAS JEFFERSON, U.S. President: "I believe that banking institutionsare more dangerous to our liberties that standing armies. Already theyhave raised up a moneyed aristocracy that has set the Government at defiance.The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the peopleto whom it properly belongs." JAMES A. GARFIELD, U.S. President: "Whoever controls the volumeof money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce." HENRY FORD, Founder of Ford Motor Company, commented on the privatelyowned "Federal" Reserve System scam: "It is well enoughthat people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system,for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrowmorning." -16- LEWIS MCFADDIN, U.S. Congressman, said this about those same internationalfinancial conspirators, during the very time they were taking over themonetary control of America: "We have in this country one of the mostcorrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal ReserveBoard and the Federal Reserve Banks, hereinafter called the FED. They arenot government institutions. They are private monopolies which pray uponthe people of the United States for the benefit of themselves and theirforeign customers..." AMERICAN MECURY MAGAZINE, December 1957, pg. 92 "The invisibleMoney Power is working to control and enslave mankind. It financed Communism,Fascism, Marxism, Zionism and Socialism. All of these are directed to makingthe United States a member of a World Government..." (With very little study one can easily prove the above is 100% factualand correct!) MAYER AMSHEL BAUER, (Alias Rothschild/Head Bloodsucker) The Godfatherof the Rothschild Banking Cartel of Europe stated, "Give me controlof a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws." (Our Congress gave him and fellow International Bankers complete controlof the U.S. monetary system through passage of the "Federal"Reserve Act, the Income Tax Act, and the 17th Amendment in 1913.) ROTHSCHILD BROTHERS OF LONDON. In a letter discussing their new bankingscheme with fellow conspirators, June 25, 1863, they stated: "The few who understand the system, will either be so interestedin its profits, or so dependent on its favors that there will be no oppositionfrom that class. The great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehendingthe tremendous advantages will bear its burden without complaint". (This was long before their takeover of the U.S. Banking system.) RUSSELL MUNK, Assistant General Counsel, Dept. of the Treasury, in a1977 letter admitted: "Federal Reserve Notes Are Not Dollars." (Then what is that paper stuff in your wallet?) -17- ONE LAST WORD ON THE MONEY VAMPIRES: Do we wonder why so many Americansare being sucked dry and are losing their homes, farms and businesses ofeach Americans are being sucked dry and are losing their homes, farms andbusinesses each week? Is it just "cycliacal (temporary) economic downturn"as the Establishment "Experts" and controlled media tell us?That is a fabrication to the 10th power. If any Officer doubts this afterreading the preceding statements by the money parasites, it would be wiseto consider this secret communique circulated among the leading U.S. Bankersonly, way back in 1934, entitled. "THE BANKER'S MANIFESTO": "Capital must protect itself in every way...Debts must be collectedand loans and mortgages foreclosed as soon as possible. When through aprocess of law the common people have lost their homes, they will be moretractable and more easily governed by the STRONG ARM OF THE LAW (Cops)applied by the central power of leading financiers. People without homeswill not quarrel with their leader. This is well known among our principalmen now engaged in forming an imperialism of capitalism to govern the world.By dividing the people we can get them to expend their energies in fightingover questions of not importance to us except as TEACHERS OF THE COMMONHERD." (Taken from the Civil Servants' Year Book, "The Organizer"Jan. 1934.) Well, fellow "Strong-Arms-of-the-Law", Americans are now losingover 4,000 homes, 2,000 farms, 2,500 businesses per week to the Money Vampireswho made the prior statement. Is it just coincidence? How many homes, businessesand farms have you helped take away from good Americans for the IRS/Banksters?For those Officers who still do not know it, "YES, THE IRS IS AN ESSENTIALPART OF THE WORLD ORDER PLAN TO DIVEST AMERICANS OF THEIR WEALTH, AND MAKETHE PEOPLE THEMSELVES PAY FOR THEIR OWN NATIONAL DESTRUCTION." The above should make every Officer stop and think before assistingthe bankers or "their" IRS government revenue agents. It happens a thousand times a day across this land that our fellow Officersare unknowingly made a party to fraud and theft. And if you are one suchOfficer, then YOU unknowingly become the "executioners" for themen behind this diabolical system. Take heart, Officer. You can learn,as many others have, how to be a VAMPIRE KILLER, uphold your oath to protectthe American People, and at the same time stay within the law. -18- MEDIA BLACKS OUT THE FACTS "BUT SURELY, IF THIS WORLD CONSPIRACY WERE TRUE I WOULD HAVE HEARDABOUT IT IN THE DAILY NEWS!" As in all investigations, it always comes down to, "How can weprove our case?" We personally feel it's hard to top the proof comingfrom the mouths of the very ones involved in this treacherous unAmericanprogram. Here's one terrific example. John Swinton, the former Chief ofStaff for the New York Times, was one of America's best loved newspapermen.Called by his peers "The Dean of his Profession", John was askedin 1953 to give a toast before the New York Press Club, and in so doingmade a monumentally important and revealing statement. He is quoted asfollows: "There is no such thing, at this date of the world's history, inAmerica, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is notone of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, youknow beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly forkeeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Othersof you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you whowould be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streetslooking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in oneissue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone.The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth; to lie outright;to pervert; to vilify; to fawn at the feet of common, and to sell his countryand his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it and what follyis this toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals ofrich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the stringsand we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the -19- property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes." Hard tobelieve? If there is any doubt - read on. RICHARD M. COHAN, Senior Producer of CBS political news said: "Weare going to impose OUR AGENDA on the coverage by dealing with issues andsubjects that WE choose to deal with." RICHARD SALANT, former President of CBS News stated: "Our job isto give people not what they want, but what WE decide they ought to have." And what is their "agenda"? What do they believe we, the americanpeople, - THE COMMON HERD, "...ought to have"? Here is the answer: U.S. COMMUNIST SAYS "LIBERALISM" IS SOCIALISM NORMAN THOMAS, For many years the U.S. Socialist Presidential candidateproclaimed: "The American people will never knowingly adopt Socialism.But under the name of "liberalism" they will adopt every fragmentof the Socialist program, until one day America will be a Socialist nation,without knowing how it happened." (How sadly true his words. He (Thomas) and Gus Hall, the U.S. CommunistParty candidate, both quit Americans politics, agreeing that the Republicanand Democratic parties by 1970 had adopted every plank of the Communist/SocialistParty and they no longer had an alternative party platform on which torun.) Following are some statements made by a few America's top news personalities,but altered just slightly. In honor of Socialist Presidential candidateThomas, following each use of the word "liberal" let's placealso the word "socialist". This may help us gain some insightinto why America, after 70-plus years of continual "liberal"indoctrination on every media, educational, and political front, has drawn"Socialism/Communism" and the New World Order to her bosom. HERMAN DISMORE, foreign editor of the N.Y. Times from 1950 to 1960:"The New York Times is deliberately pitched to the liberal (socialist)point of view." WALTER CRONKITE: "News reporters are certainly liberal (socialist)and left of center." BARBARA WALTERS: "The news media in general are liberals (socialist)." We could go on, but I believe we get their point! -20- WORLD GOVERNMENT UNDER THE U.N. Just what is this most "wonderful" global organization allabout? DR. KURK E. KOCH, Professor, Lectured at 100 Universities in 65 countrieson 5 continents. Subjects of expertise: New World Order, Occultism, ExtremeMovements, Parapsychology. His assessment of the coming NWO under the UnitedNations is that it will reduce everything to one common denominator: "The system will be made up of a single currency single centrallyfinanced government, single tax system, single language, single politicalsystem, single world court of justice, single head (one individual leader),single state religion." He further states: "Each person will have a registered number,without which he will not be allowed to buy or sell; and there will beone universal world church. Anyone who refuses to take part in this universalsystem will have no right to exist." We should ask the following question of those fellow Officers who maydoubt that they will be asked to enforce such a system on the Americanpeople, "Whom do they think will enforce all of this?" Who willmake the masses "fit-in"? Who will "remove" those whodo not fit-in? Will it be the auto mechanics, bankers, school teachers,bakers, or candlestick makers??? Or, is it more likely to be EnforcementOfficers? JOHN E. RANKIN, U.S. Congressman: "The United Nations is the greatestfraud in all History. Its purpose is to destroy the United States." -21- GEORGE BUSH, New York 1991, "My vision of a NEW WORLD ORDER foreseesa United Nations with a revitalized peacekeeping function." And one more classic quote from our traitor President: "It is theSACRED principles enshrined in the UN Charter to which we will henceforthpledge our allegiance." - UN Building, February 1, 1992. UNBELIEVABLE! That ought to FRY THE GRITS OF EVERY LAWMAN AND TRUE AMERICANTHAT READS THIS QUOTE. Brother and sister Officers, how many of you aregoing to take a "sacred" oath of allegiance to the U.N. WorldGovernment? Imagine, there will still be a few of our fellow Officers who will readthis treasonous claptrap and not believe that they will soon be ENFORCERSin a totalitarian world government. There is no question that Bush, Clinton and Perot want Officer to jointhem in swearing allegiance to such as the following: UNITED NATIONS' WORLD CONSTITUTION: "...The age of nations mustend...The governments of the nations have decided to order their separatesovereignties into one government to which they surrender their arms." NEED WE SAY MORE? We must, with great haste, awaken our fellow officers and ask them,"Will you pledge your allegiance to this NEW SLAVE STATE as your traitorPresident of his fellow Internationalists Slick Willie Clinton and H.RossPerot believe you will?? ZBIGNIEW BREZHINSKY, National Security Advisor to Pres. Jimmy Carterand advisor to 4 other presidents, Exec. Dir. of Trilateral Comm., Marxistand proud of it! Here he speaks about what a New World Order will be like:"The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlledsociety. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained bytraditional values." -22- WE MUST MAKE OFFICERS LISTEN! Whom do we think will "dominate"the masses in UN-controlled society of "non-traditional" (unGodly)values? ZBIGNIEW continues: "Soon it will be possible to assert almostcontinuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date completefiles containing even the most personal information about the citizen.These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities."- From Zbig's book, BETWEEN TWO AGES. ADLAI STEVENSON, Council on Foreign Relations member and promoter ofU.N. "Salvation": "The U.S. program (UN program) calls fortotal elimination of national capacity to make international war."(Take comfort in the fact that the U.N. Promises to protect us.) WALT RUSTOW, Council on Foreign Relations member and U.N. spokesmen:"It is in the American interest to put an end to Nationhood."(Sure it is, Walter!) HUMANIST MANIFESTO, Article 12: "We deplore the division of humankindon nationalistic grounds. We have reached a turning point in human historywhere the best option is to transcend the limits of national sovereigntyand to move towards the building of a world community. We look towardsthe development of a system of world law, world order, based upon transnationalgovernment." (Humanists propose that the United Nations care for andcontrol all peoples of the earth.) LT. COL. JAMES "BO" GRITZ (RET), U.S. Presidential Candidate1992, Most decorated Green Beret Commander in American history. Commander,U.S. Army Special Forces, Latin America. Chief, Delta force. This greatAmerican hero explains the conspiracy within the U.S. government as follows:"...A spider web of "patriots for profit," operating fromthe highest positions of special trust and confidence, have successfullycircumvented our constitutional system in pursuit of a New World Order.They have infused America with drugs in order to fund covert operationswhile sealing the fate of our servicemen left in Communist prisons. Hiding behind a mask of official righteousness, this secret combinationseeks to impose its own concept of geopolitical navigation, nullifyingliberty as the hard won birthright of all Americans". -23- THE RELIGION OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER? DAVID SPANGLER, Director of PLANETARY INITIATIVE, (a United NationsWorld government group): "No one will enter the New World Order unlesshe or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer. No one will enter theNew Age unless she will take a Luciferian Initiation." RALPH NADER: "Is there a number or mark planned for the hard orforehead in a new cashless society? YES, and I have seen the machines thatare now ready to put it into operation." (Does this sounds familiar - hand and forehead???) This "marking"may be another job for our U.S. Police Officers/Guardsmen, soon to be U.N.Enforcers, who have taken to U.N. oath of allegiance which "Boner"Bush mentioned earlier.) FRENCH TRAVEL POSTER 1992 French "New World Order" Color Poster: Depicts peopleas robots, constructing a new Tower of Babel inside the old tower thatGod had destroyed. These robotic people are trying to reach their god whois depicted with the sigh of Lucifer (the Goat of Mendez five pointed star)above the newly built tower. The caption reads, "EUROPE: MANY TONGUES,ONE VOICE." As students of the Scriptures know, the building of the Tower of Babelwas man's first attempt to set up a World Order. God himself destroyedthis abomination and punished the people. This poster is most revealing.A copy in the right hands can assist in pointing out to our colleaguesthat many of those who are in leadership in establishing this new orderare -24- truly religious, not atheist, as we are led to believe. But, whom dothey worship? The poster clearly shows their god is Lucifer and they areproud of it. The picture on the poster points out that the New World Orderpromoters know the Scriptures and they are determined to once again defythe One True God. We are presently in the process of trying to get several hundred ofthese French New World Order Posters. It looks like we may be successfuland some of you may wish to have one. If you are interested here is thedeal: The donations/proceeds from the sales of this color poster will beused as a fundraiser to reach and educate more of our colleagues in LawEnforcement. Order through Aid & Abet Police Newsletter for $6 single,$10 for 2, $4 for 3-5. $3 P&H for protective tube container. (If weget them in, it will have to be "first come, first served".) -25- NEW AGE PROFESSORS TEACH OUR CHILDREN'S TEACHERS Turning now to education, let's quote a few of the top U.S. spokesmenand professors in that field, to see the over-all philosophy used to trainour teachers, who then go on to prepare our children for the New WorldOrder. DR. CHESTER PIERCE, Harvard University Professor, Humanist, New WorldOrder Guru. This Professor instructs teachers and those students who aspireto become teachers of our children as follows: "Every child in America who enters a school at the age of fiveis mentally ill, because he comes to school with an allegiance to our institutions,toward the preservation of this form of government that we have. Patriotism,Nationalism, and sovereignty, all that proves that children are sick becausea truly well individual is one who has rejected all of those things, andis truly the international child of the future." DR. PAUL BRANDWEIN, Leading U.S. child psychologist. This man also instructsteachers on how to recognize mental disability in our school children.He states: "Every child who believes in God is mentally ill."(All government schools have a psychologist.) DR. SIDNEY SIMON, Lecturer, Educator who some say specializes in encouragingimmoral and criminal activity in youths. He instructs teachers as follows: "We do not need any more preaching about right and wrong. The old'thou shalt nots' simply are not relevant." Further he says, "Valuesclarification is a method for teachers to change the values of childrenwithout getting caught." -26- HUMANIST CURRICULUM: Along with these "Humanist Wackos" trainingour nation's teachers to be "change agents" for their New WorldOrder, there is the matter of the literature that they have for teachersto use to instruct American children. One such book entitled "Weepfor Our Children", might explain to Police Officers a great deal aboutwhy crime rates in school age children are skyrocketing. Consider thisone passage touting the humanistic "Values Clarification/SituationEthics" program: "It's OK to lie. It's OK to steal. It's OK to have premarital sex.It's OK to cheat or to kill if these things are part of your value system,and you clarified these values for yourself. THe important thing is notwhat values you choose, but that you have chosen them yourself freely andwithout coercion of parents, spouse, priest, friends, ministers or socialpressure of any kind." This type of values/moral code (or lack thereof!) is all to evidentin America's schools today, as many Police Officers know. many officerswrite expressing alarm at seeing this type of unholy "Situation Ethics"instruction so wide-spread in our nation's schools. PSYCHIATRISTS LEAD THE WAY For decades, it has been the job of those within the psychology fieldto introduce to the American public the idea that those who believe inGod are sick and must be "enlightened" or eliminated, and that"immorality" is the only path to the NEW AGE. And indeed it is.The several quotes below will drive home this well planned scenario. BERTRAND RUSSELL, philosopher, educator and atheist: "I think thesubject which will be of most importance politically is Mass Psychology...It'simportance has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methodsof propaganda...ALthough this science will be diligently studied, it willbe rigidly confined to the governing class (Elite). The populace will notbe allowed to know how its convictions were generated." One of the great Psychiatric Gurus of Mental Health speaks: DR G. BROCK CHISHOLM, First head of the World Federation of Mental Health(A NWO group.) "What basic psychological distortion can be found inevery civilization of which we know anything? The only psychological forcecapable of producing these perversions is morality - the concept of rightand wrong. The re-interpretation and eventual -27- eradication of the concept of right and wrong are the belated objectivesof nearly all psychotherapy." "The pretense is made that to do away with right and wrong wouldproduce uncivilized people, immorality, lawlessness, and social chaos.The fact is that most psychiatrists and psychologists and other respectedpeople have escaped from moral chains and are able to think freely."- Taken from the updated book, NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON, by J.A. Stormer. Police Officers have been among the first to notice that such teachingshave produced exactly the results he (the good Doctor) said they wouldnot produce. He lied. There is no greater promoter of change than FEAR,and no greater creator of fear than chaos and lawlessness throughout anation. The enemy of our system knows that immorality breeds chaos andlawlessness. Chaos and lawlessness breeds fear in the people and when fearfulenough the people will accept any solutions. Guess what the solution is? We agree with Dr. Chisholm, that most of these minions of "psycho-babble"have truly "escaped" from any and all moral foundation in theirlives. Anything their patients dream up is perfectly O.K. and encouragedby most such "professionals". This "there is no right orwrong" psycho-babble is what is being drilled into the heads of thoseAmerican school children whose parents have unfortunately placed them inGovernment Indoctrination Centers which we erroneously call our "educational"system. In case any officer reading this publication thinks that this changein the morals of our nation is accidental, he or she must read the book,"THE SOVIET ART OF BRAIN WASHING - A Synthesis of the Russian Textbookon Psychopolitics", written by a Kenneth Goff. In this book, Goff,a one-time dues-paying member of the Communist Party, writes: "Duringmy training I was trained in Psychopolitics. This was the art of capturingthe minds of a nation through brainwashing and fake mental health." Kenneth Goff paid a high price for his efforts to alert the Americanpeople. After attempting to inform America of Marxist-trained Psychologistsbeing placed inside the U.S. to change the morals and beliefs of our nation,he mysteriously died from poisoning in 1943. His farewell in his book says:"This manual of the Communist Party should be in the hands of everyloyal American, that they may be alerted to the fact that it is not alwaysby armies and guns that a nation is conquered." In this book is foundan address by Beria, the Head -28- of the Lenin University School of Psychopolitics. His 1933 address toa group of American/Marxist Psychology students is most revealing. Speaking to this group who would be returning to ply their treacheryin the U.S. he said: "A psychopolitician must work hard to produce the maximum chaosin the fields of 'mental healing.' You must work until every teacher ofpsychology unknowingly or knowingly teachers only Communist doctrine underthe guise of 'psychology.' You must labor until every doctor and psychiatristis either a psycho-politician or an unwitting assistant to our aims. Youmost labor until we have dominion over the minds and bodies of every importantperson in your nation (America). You must work until suicide arising frommental imbalance is common and calls forth no general investigation orremark... You must dominate as respected men the fields of psychiatry andpsychology. You must dominate the hospitals and universities... You cancome and take your instruction as worshipers of Freud...Psychopoliticsis a solemn charge. With it you can erase our enemies as insects. You (psychologists)can change their (leaders) loyalties by psychopolitics. Given a short timewith a psychopolitician you can alter forever the loyalty of a soldierin our hands or a statesman or a leader in his own country, or you candestroy his mind. Use the courts, use the judges, use the Constitution of the country,use its medical societies and its laws to further our ends...By psychopoliticscreate chaos. Leave a nation leaderless. Kill our enemies. And bring toEarth, through Communism, the greatest peace man has ever known. Thankyou." (This is only a short part of Beria's speech to the visiting Americanpsychology students.) NOTE: Everything he asked these students to accomplish when they returnedto practice their "art" in our nation has occurred. And now wecan look forward to that "peace" he promised under the U.N. NewWorld Order. -29- WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED "PEACE" ? JOSEPH STALIN stated that after Communism succeeds, "...then, therewill come a peace across the earth." KARL MARX said, "...the meaning of peace is the absence of oppositionto Socialism." THE LORD GOD said, "...they have seduced my people, saying PEACE;and there was NO PEACE." (Ezekiel 13:10) St. Paul said, "For when they shall say, 'PEACE and SAFETY', thensudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child;and they shall not escape." (1 Thes. 5:3) We should note that the Globalist' main tactic and motivation to enticethe world's people into their United Nations trap is ultimate "PEACEand SAFETY". FOUNDING FATHERS' RECIPE FOR SUCCESSFUL GOVERNMENT This affords a good chance to show the contrast between the kind ofgovernment our great leaders of the past gave us as a nation, and the immoralcesspool that is in place today. Using the memorable quotes that follow,compare and see if you can figure out why today our government, our families,and individuals lives by the millions are falling apart. -30- JAMES MADISON: "We have staked the whole future of American civilization,not upon the power of government, far from it. We have staked the future...uponthe capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to sustain ourselves,according to the Ten Commandments of God." (Question: Do we stillgovern and sustain ourselves by the Ten Commandments today?) JOHN ADAMS: "Our Constitution was made only for a religious andmoral people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other."(Question: Are Americans still a religious and moral people?) BENJAMIN FRANKLIN: "Man will ultimately be governed by GOD or bytyrants." (Question:Which is it that governs us today) GEORGE WASHINGTON: "The people know it is impossible to rightlygovern without GOD and the BIBLE." (Question: Are we sure the Americanpeople still know this today?) ANDREW JACKSON: "The BIBLE is the rock on which our Republic rests." (Two Questions: -1) When is the last time you have heard of a publicofficial honestly and accurately call America a Republic? 2) On the otherhand, can a democracy rest on the BIBLE? DANIEL WEBSTER: "If we abide by the principles taught in the BIBLE,our country will go on prospering." (Question: Why is our nation notprospering?) ALEXIS DE TOQUEVILLE: Upon visiting America in the early 19th century,this French historian observed: "America is great because Americais GOOD. If America ever ceases to be good it will cease to be great." * QUESTION: Based on the above quotes, "Why did America becomethe greatest nation in history?" * QUESTION: Did the Founders place the concept of Separation of CHurchand State in our Constitution? Answer: NO. It is found only in the CommunistConstitution. * QUESTION: If one wanted to destroy a nation like America, would henot look to what the Founders said was the cornerstone (Laws of God) uponwhich our REpublic was built, and then ATTACK THAT VERY FOUNDATION? -31- GOALS OF AMERICA's ENEMIES KARL MARX: "My object in life is to dethrone God and destroy capitalism."(Question: Has he succeeded?) LEV DAVIDOVICH TROTSKY: "Religions are illogical primitive ignorance.There is nothing as ridiculous and tragic as a religious government." ANOTHER QUESTION: Is Trotsky's or Marx's plan any different than theHumanist Movement's plan? Check below. AMERICAN HUMANIST MOVEMENT, Doctrinal statement: "We are humanist...We are not for God...We are for socialism." HUMANIST MAGAZINE, 1983 Jan.-Feb. issue. Humanist John J. Dunphy: "Iam convinced that the battle for humankind's future must be waged and wonin the public school classroom by teachers that correctly perceive theirrole as proselytizers of a new faith which will replace the rotting corpseof Christianity." HAVE THEY REACHED THEIR GOALS? (Check it out below.) COMMUNIST RULES FOR REVOLUTION (Captured at Dusseldorf in May 1919 byAllied Forces) 1. Corrupt the young; get them away from religion. Get them interestedin sex. Make them superficial; destroy their ruggedness. 2. By specious argument cause the breakdown of the old moral virtues:honesty, sobriety, continence, faith in the pledged word, ruggedness. 3. Encourage civil disorders and foster a lenient and soft attitudeon the part of government toward such disorders. (L.A. riots were justa coincidence?! ... Of course!) 4. Divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversialmatters of no importance. (Racial differences?) 5. Get people's minds off their government by focusing their attentionon athletics, sexy books, plays, and other trivialities. -32- 6. Get control of all means of publicity. (Media) 7. Destroy the people's faith in their natural leaders by holding thelatter up to contempt, ridicule and obloquy (disgrace). 8. Cause the registration of all firearms on some pretext, with a viewto confiscation and leaving the population helpless. This is only a partial list. It was secured and stamped with the sealof Florida State Attorney, George A. Broutigam. This material testimonywas taken from someone he terms "a known member of the Communist Party".According to this Communist's testimony this strategy is still part ofthe Communist plan to overthrow free societies such as the United States. (Can the reader find any of these 8 items that has NOT already beeninstalled in the American system?) IN CONTRAST: Thomas Jefferson says, "To compel a man to furnish funds for thepropagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical."(Indeed it is!) Most officers don't realize it but their federal and state governmentsare funding programs that were created by anti-American/New World Orderproponents for the express purpose of lowering America's economic, spiritualand moral standards. (The North American Free Trade Agreement another destructivedevice being foisted on gullible Americans.) PLAN WORKING PERFECTLY So far we have put the spotlight on a good many New World ORder BLOODSUCKERS - obvious spies, seditions, traitors, some of them Americans, someforeign. There is an important, underlying factor in all this that mustnot be missed: The global conspirators, along with thousands of their worldgovernment "comrades" in the U.S. have been deliberately whippingthe American public into a fearful frenzy. With just the "right" manipulations, they have been successfullyconditioning our people to see all our societal systems - governmental,political, educational, penal, ecological, etc. - as completely out ofcontrol. This is not true. -33- Let us not be fooled. All of these areas are completely under theircontrol and have been for decades. They are functioning just as well as the enemy wishes them to function.Remember also what Rowan Gaither, head of the Ford Foundation said (onpage 12 of this publication), the task is to "covertly lower the standardof living, the whole social structure, of America so that we can be MERGEDwith all other nations." FACT: Their Parasitic PLAN to cause this total (controlled) breakdownis "right on course". The American system is collapsing "ontime", and just as programmed. Remember what FDR said, "In politicsnothing happens by accident. If it happened, you can bet it was plannedthat way." The plan of these globalists is that when America, the last "holdout",is brought to its knees, the American "sheep" will beg theirnew god (GOVERNMENT) to save them! The "salvation" they are demandingwill be the merging together of all nations under that great "bastianof peace and freedom", the United Nations. -34- TRAITORS' GRAND FINALES (Martial law the Goal.) PLAN A RACE WARS: We will see the fanning of the flames of their planned RACEWAR program in the months ahead as government, through some of their covertnational organizations, promotes "whites hating people of color"and vice-versa. Aided by their controlled media, and NWO government-paidagitators/"leaders" on both sides, the goal is to frighten Americans,of all colors, into accepting Martial Law. These elitists actually haveno lover for "minorities" or "commoners" of any race.Those who have studied these Imperialists will notice that there is continualintermarriage among these super rich Internationalists' families. NEVERdo they participate in the mixing of blood other than BLUE BLOOD. The race-mixingprogram was created for their "subjects" - i.e. the world's commonpeople of all races. Some of these Internationalists have stated over theyears, "...when all other humans are of one color, (brown), then theywill be more easily managed." KEEP THE RACES FROM JOINING TOGETHER! Racial strife is one of their most important NWO tools and they meanto keep it going. It has worked well for promoting the globalist causein the recent past. HATE must be kept flowing to prevent the various racesin America from finding out the truth. If they find out -35- who is destroying their freedoms and economic future, they might findsome way to work together to overthrow their COMMON ENEMY. WHO ARE THE AGENT-PROVOCATEURS? Our problem is in identifying these NWO lackeys (agent/provocateurs).Incoming intelligence over the years has informed us that these provocateursare of all racial mixes. Yes, whites, blacks, hispanic etc. are involvedin promoting planned racial hate incidents and tensions to assist in causingthe masses to accept Martial Law and serve the NWO gang. Although theseemployee/provocateurs have been promised a position of power in this "utopian"Socialist society, it is a shame that they are not smart enough to knowthat they are to be "eliminated" when their usefulness has runout. (As has been the practice of every Marxist/Socialist conquering armyafter taking power.) There is sound logic in this "execution of your agent/provocateurs",after you're in power. The logic is: "If these agents will spy andturn again their own people, then there is no way you can trust them tonot turn on you." VERY TRUE! The other shame is that no tears willbe shed for these traitors to their own people. PLAN B The globalists, along with their controlled media, are well along inthe promotion of their PLAN B program. Here it is: With the threat of nuclearway supposedly subsiding, the American people "must have" a newBoogie Man! ECOLOGICAL COLLAPSE: This phase involves the fraud of the "imminentecological collapse of the world". this phase is being promoted bythese who were not able to completely destroy America with Marxism. TheseNWO Marxist have therefore started, or taken over, the various GREEN (environmentalist)parties. Many of these environmentalists are rightfully labeled the "WATERMELONSof the world". That is to say, green on the outside, but RED (Marxist)on the inside. Many wonderful, good, well-intentioned Americans are beingduped into assisting with this fraud. Sadly, some are our families andfriends. -36- PLAN C VISITORS FROM AFAR: This phase makes certain that few Americans escapethe NWO program. How? By creating TOTAL PANIC. This is accomplished with3 choices being offered to the gullible. The Globalists have "suddenly"brought to light their long planned and well established "UFO-Little-Devils-from-Outer-Space"CON, to strike utter fear in the hearts of all the people of the earth. * The first choice: The subtle message to us, "the masses",is that, if we don't go willingly and gently into global government, wewill be "eaten", "raped", or become the experimentalguinea pigs of some far-our evil "SPACE CADETS". And of course,you can't ask for assistance and protection from your own country's governmentbecause as we all have been told, "no individual nation could possiblystand a chance in defense against this obviously 'Superior' Race from space."AH, but isn't it wonderful that "salvation" is only a one-world-governmentaway?!? * A second twist to this planned scenario is: These "cute littlespace things" are our BOSOM BUDDIES; they bring us tiding of goodwill, and come "conveniently" to SAVE our world from the brinkof total destruction! "Isn't that precious?!" In other words, this particular plan is to convince gullible Americansthat anyone of anything (but that Jesus Christ "guy"), WILL SAVEOUR WORLD! Quite "coincidentally", these same "funny little fellows"are also here to set up a UTOPIAN GLOBAL SOCIETY! Surprised? * And the newest twist to the CON (to grab religious Americans thatdid not fall for the first two) is that Christ Himself has sent these wonderfullittle "UFO things", in HIS place, to save us. (Suggesting, wesuppose, that Jesus Christ got busy and had to "delegate". Andas soon as these "wonderful" Space "Disciples of Christ"get us all together in a New World Society, He (Christ) will be along totake over. Think of them as God's Secret Service advance team!) Believeit or not. Is there something there?..."OUT THERE"? Absolutely! But,are THEY truly coming from "out-there"? We are not to be told,at this time, the truth about what these entities are, or who has absolutecontrol over them. If we were told the truth we would never fall for theirNew World Order UFO con. -37- It is sad to see coming true what the Scriptures foretold, namely, thatsome of the most spiritual and intelligent people in our world are beingcompletely deceived by our government and "spiritually enlightened"conmen..(and women). As foretold, it's happening before our eyes. SHAME! In all seriousness, for anyone that does not believe that the UFO scareis a contrived fraud, it should be agreed that the wise position to takeis on the side of caution. Consider it possible that those who promotethe NWO plan are presently involved in a "trial run" of all threeof the above-described UFO scenarios. Such plans are being promoted bythe Globalists, among those whom they consider to be the "Wacko","Radical", "Extremist", Nationalist, Pro-American organizations,in order to test which scenario is more acceptable. For example, pick anyone of the three scenarios below: (1) The evil little devils from outer space, who will dissect, destroy,or devious us all. (2) The sweet, funny little COSMIC critters who, like our government,are only "HERE TO HELP YOU" And lastly, for the gullible religious masses: (3) The Space "Disciples of God" bringing salvation to earthlings. Indeed the Globalist care not which we choose. For they all lead totheir NEW WORLD ORDER. Tell our brothers and sisters to just - Think aboutit! (Some of the above information has come from those on the "inside"and some from "outside" of our government. It's nice to haveour own agents inside their anti-American, anti-God cliques. What is thatFrench word - TOUCHE'?) THE GREAT DELUSION - Will you be caught? Called America's greatest female writer, Ellen G. White said it likethis: "The last great delusion is soon to open before us. Antichristis to perform his marvelous works in our sight. So closely will the counterfeitresemble the true that it will be impossible to distinguish between themexcept by Holy Scriptures." (The Great Controversy, 1888). And soit is. -38- LISTEN CAREFULLY! THIS IS NOT A RELIGIOUS PUBLICATION! Some may say that this is not the type of publication that should getinto "religion". We agree, to a point. However, if religion isbeing used by the enemy of America to attack Americans, then like it ornot, we must address it. It is the enemy of our nation that is using "spiritualism"to trick millions of religious fellow Officers and private citizens infofalling for their NEW AGE/NEW WORLD ORDER fraud. One wise tip: Leviticus19:31 says, "Regard not them that have familiar spirits; neither seekafter wizards, to be defied by them; I am the Lord your God." FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT: Other Biblical scriptures to check to see if you are being tricked:Lev. 20:6, 27; Deut. 18:10-12;I Sam. 28:3-9; II Kings 21:6,23:24;I Chron.10:13;II Chron. 10:13; Isa. 8:19,19:3,20:4;Acts 16:16; Rev. 9:21, 18:23;Kings23:24; Jer. 27:9-10; Exodus 22:18. If this is not enough, one of the best sources on the "spiritualism"fraud against the AMerican people is Dr. Cathy Burns' writings on thesesubjects. Write to SHARING - 212 F. 7th. St., MT.

Write to Living Truth Ministries, 8103 Shiloh COurt, Austin,Texas 78745. -39- COMMUNISM GONE? - DON'T TAKE ANY BETS! V.I. LENIN: "It would be the greatest mistake, certainly, to thinkthat concessions mean PEACE. Nothing of the kind. Concessions are nothingbut a new form of war." DIMITRI MANUALISKY, Soviet Diplomat (1947) revealed the Communists'intention to brainwash the American public: "We will offer the Christianworld unheard of peace overtures, and these nations, stupid and decadent,will leap at the chance to be our friends; they will willingly cooperatein their own destruction. Then, when their guard is down, and they havegone to sleep, we will smash them with out clenched fist." Many gullible Americans, and the controlled U.S. media, will gush, "Theabove statement was uttered a long time ago and things have truly changedin the new Commonwealth of "Independent" States (CIS). Is thatso? Read on! MIKHAIL GORBACHEV's speech at the 70th anniversary of the BolshevikRevolution (1987): "...In October 1917, we parted with the old world,rejecting it once and for all. We are moving toward a new world, a world,rejecting it once and for all. We are moving toward a new world, a worldof Communism. We shall never turn off that road." And from his speech to the Soviet Politburo, November 1987: "Gentlemen, comrades, do not be concerned about all you hear aboutGlasnost and Perestroika and democracy in the coming years. These are primarilyfor outward consumption. There will be no significant internal changesin the Soviet Union, other than for cosmetic purposes. Out purpose is todisarm the Americans and let them fall asleep. We want to accomplish threethings: -40- One, we want the Americans to withdraw conventional forces from Europe. Two, we want them to withdraw nuclear forces from Europe. Three, we want the Americans to stop proceeding with Strategic DefenseInitiative." (And alas, this is what has been done!) GENERAL SIR WALTER WALKER, Former NATO Commander-in-chief, followingthe phony Soviet coup, said: "I consider it my duty to tell you ofthe extremely dangerous threats that lie ahead. I KNOW FOR CERTAIN thatwe are now in a period of the greatest strategic deception, perhaps inall history...The Cold War is NOT over, only in the state of remission...TheSoviet Union is not truly 'on the verge of collapse'. Western defense,on the other hand, is." Many of our readers are Intelligence Officers or former IntelligenceOfficers We thanks those readers who are members of the Intelligence communityfor providing the following FACTS which back up Gorbie and Sir Walter Walker'swords: FACT: Russian intelligence agencies are working as hard as ever at espionagein the U.S. Both the DCI Robert Gates and FBI Director WIlliam Sessionshave spoken out on the high level of Russian intelligence collection effortsin recent months, now known by its Russian acronym SVR. Senior FBI counterintelligenceofficial, Wayne Gilbert states the same thing, "There has been noapparent reduction in covert intelligence gathering here by the Russians."In contrast, Chief of the SVR, Yevgeny Primakov, said during a recent visitto Sweden, "I can tell you we no longer have cloak and dagger spiesin the traditional sense, agents who meddle in other countries' internalaffairs." - (Newsletter of the Assoc. of Former Intelligence Officers,Vol. XVII, No. 6, 1992.) FACT: The KGB is still in control. As America's Global Elite purposelythe alleged breakup of the Soviet Union. It is housed under the new RussianMinistry of Security. It has been greatly strengthened by Yelstin and isinvolved in more espionage activities against the West than ever before.As has happened four times in the past, after we (the West) once againrebuild the Communist infrastructure, the same old KGB with a new face,will step from its behind the scenes control of CIS to OUTWARDLY reclaimcontrol of the "New", revitalized, rearmed, and more powerfulSoviet Union. FACT: America and Canada are disarming unilaterally. -41- FACT: Unknown to the masses, each of the nations that have split offfrom the "defunct" Soviet Union is presently covertly led byhard line Communists. FACT: The "defunct" Soviet military is presently buildingmore offensive weapons of all type, than at any time in its history. Productionrate: * 1 Tank division per month. * 700 new fighter aircraft (approx. 58 per months) in 1991 and 1992. * 1 Nuclear Submarine every two months. * Numerous Tactical nuke bomb and mobile launchers (actual number unknown). (This intel update is per U.S. Intelligence sources 6/92.) (As with the last 4 times this CON JOB of a "Communist collapse"was perpetrated, all of this rearming and dramatic increases in espionageis being accomplished while the Communists' economy "CRASHES". We must understand that this military build-up can occur only as longas American tax dollars continue to feed the Commonwealth of "Independent"States people. And that is part of the NWO plan. What is it "BonerBush" and other NWO nations are sending them? - 25 billion to beginwith? Obviously, this has been an unbelievable CON JOB that started in 1917,when fellow Parasites, Jacob Schiff on Kuhn, Loeb and Company, PrescottBush, Max M. Warburg, and a few other traitors sent by Leon Trotsky, withhis 300 New York trained private army of street thugs, to Russia with $20,000,000in gold finance Lenin and the Bolshevik Revolution. These men started Communismfor one reason: to promote the takeover of our nation of free people bySocialists so Americans would not be able to stand in the way of theirNew World Order plans. There was no way they could do this if America remainedfree, strong, and had no real threats to her security. For this reason,they built America an enemy! (There is not space here for a big historylesson regardless of the importance. For more of an honest review of ourhistoric record read THE NEW WORLD ORDER by Eustace Mullins. It can beobtained from Ezra Pound Institute of Civilization, P.O. Box 1105, Staunton,VA. 24401. -42- Police Officers must remember what the renowned H.L. Mencken said, "To die for an idea; it is unquestionably noble. But how much noblerit would be if men died for ideas that were true." Officers are told the reason guns have to be removed from the AmericanPeople is to stop crime and the killing of the innocent. This is a fabrication.Truthfully, the only reason the guns must be removed is to stop any chanceof our countrymen raising up and throwing off the "wonderful"programs that their "philanthropic" government leaders have plannedfor them. It is time to seriously consider what each of us will do when theseGlobal elitists in our government instruct OFFICERS and NATIONAL GUARDSMENto go forth and take the guns away from the armed, good people of yourcity or town..."FOR THEIR OWN GOOD". Most officers know the daywill come when they will have to make that very hard decision on this gunremoval issue. The evidence is all around us that this day is near. Consider the Imperialist NWO position. For the World Elite to trulyenjoy their "utopian" Socialist Society, the subject masses mustnot have a means to protect themselves against more "voluntary compliance".When one grasps this logical position, there is no longer any questionabout it: THE GUNS WILL HAVE TO GO. If there are any Officers who will still doubt this, we are about toprove this planned scenario to you. Keep in mind that the second part ofthe three-part plan of the NWO Regional Government program -43- (which precedes the One World Government) is that Canada, USA, Mexicoand South and Central America are to be combined into one Region. Hence,the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is on a FAST-TRACK withthe backing of our notorious NWO President, NWO Congressmen, Senators andGovernors. The other 2 parts presently in the works are: First part - theuniting of the European Nations (Common Market), and #3 - the uniting ofthe Asian nations. These will make up the "TRI" [3] parts ofthe Tri-lateral One World Government. Understanding this well planned program will make the following "PERSONALPROTECTION" proclamation more clear to any doubting Bobbies. You will find on the next page a recent declaration from the governmentof Australia, which is a member of the British Commonwealth. The Canadians,our soon-to-be northern countrymen, are also a British Commonwealth. Question:Whenwe are merged with the British Commonwealth by the Elitist NWO Parasiteswill we assume these British Socialists' anti-gun laws or will they assumeours? (See Article, page 44.) Realizing that the plan is to merge us Americans, Latin Americans, andthe Canadians, into one Region, you already know whose guns policies weare to adopt. (Mexico has the same very limited gun rights as Canada andAustralia.) DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY, OFFICER! Officers should not worry. There is a "good" plan to get theguns away from your fellow Americans. Should officers be concerned - justbecause this "good" plan calls for them to go get 200,000,000firearms (BATF figures are very low) away from 250,000,000 very "peacefuland cooperative" citizens? What do you think? SOME "AN EASY MARK" Some guns will be easily removed. Many unsuspecting (and very naive)Americans will turn in their "liberty teeth" (means of personalprotection) when told to do so. Every officer knows such people in thecommunity, i.e. those "good" citizens who are too scared to opposeanything their government tells them to do. -44- See Picture 3 (If you can't read it then read the following..) Personal Protection is NO reason to have a gun If you own a gun which you keep to protect yourself, your family oryour property, you must dispose of it legally. Under the latest gun laws, personal and property protection are no longerconsidered acceptable reasons to possess any type of firearm, or to geta license. If you wish to possess any gun, you must have a license and meet thenew requirements for safe storage of the weapon and its ammunition. Whenyour current license expires you must reapply if you want to continue topossess or use a gun. Be warned, making a false or misleading statementon your license application could earn you ten years in prison. Act quickly, if you haven't got a license, now is the time to eitherapply for one, or legally dispose of your gun. One way you can do it isat your local police station. Possession and use of any firearm for personalor property protection is illegal and will attract severe penalties. Noexceptions, no excuses. NSW Police Service Responsible Gun Ownership The New South Wales Government Putting people first by managing better. 96-SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, JUNE 14, 1992. -45- Yes, even if they know it's wrong, they will go along of just keep theirmouths shut. Every captive nation has a large percentage of such people.These are the "production units" (PU's) that will fit very wellinto the New World Order. They are ready-made slaves. As strange as it may seem, many of theses "sheep" still believethat they can trust and believe in our government to SAVE THEM from anarchy.This is amusing to some of our government officials and Police Officers.It amazes them that these people are so unaware of what is happening andcontinue trusting the same government that has planned and promoted theanarchy in the streets in the first place - precisely to scare them intosubmission. (See Aid & Abet Police Newsletter 2-2) L.A. RIOTS - AN ORCHESTRATION. A Prime example was the recent L.A. riots. The beating of King was notpart of the plan, but it offered a grand opportunity to accomplish threeimportant things for the Globalists. 1) Get rid of Chief Gates, who for years has stood in the way of Socialist- NWO gang member, Tom Bradley and others involved in trying to get theL.A. Police Dept. into the coming national police force. (See soon to berelease book, THE CENTRALIZATION OF U.S. POLICE POWERS, available fromU.S. Federal Law Research Center, P.O. Box 8712, Phx. AZ. 85066.) 2) Further convince the People that their only salvation from crimeand evil in society will be found in the "protection" providedby a global government. 3) A grand opportunity for Globalists George, Pete and Tom to practiceFEMA - style Martial Law. It matters little that some among the masseshave to die. Remember, the new government philosophy is the same as thatof the Communist, "THE END DOES INDEED JUSTIFY THE MEANS." Once again, the masses were to think that everything was out of control.It was not (the riots were planned). But it was a good enough reason thatin a matter of hours, 2,000 U.S. Marines were on the streets of an Americancity. This was a very important test. A most severe breach of Constitutionallaw was brought to bear; and more importantly, the People -46- said nothing. The masses complained only that the government shouldhave acted sooner and greater strength. For, when there is anarchy in thestreets the "sheep" do not care who saves them. This plannedMartial Law scenario actually worked out better than the NWO social plannersever expected. DETECTIVE BROWN SPEAKS OUT Los Angeles County Sheriff's Detective Larry Brown speaking in Phoenix,Arizona August 1992 stated that there was more behind the riots than thepublic knows. He revealed that known agitators from the Revolutionary CommunistParty (RCP), Socialist WOrkers Party (SWP), Progressive Labor Party (PLP),Socialist Organizing Network (SON), were there to press for a riot beforeit started and some members of these organizations participated in therioting, looting, and arson. He said that Mayor Bradley gave a very inflammatory statement that wasbroadcast on L.A. T.V. before the riots. He states, what many Police Officersalready know, that Mayor Bradley has strongly supported the Communist PartyUSA since he first ran for mayor. Also, he received support from the ACLU,and the National Lawyers Guild (Both pro-Communist groups.) In his 1969bid to become mayor his political manager was Communist Party functionaryDon Rothenberg. Gus Hall, the Director of the Communist Party U.S.A. cameto L.A> to tell the Communists to help elect Bradley. Some of our fellow Officers in Southern California believe, after evaluationof the evidence and results, that the outcome of the trial was plannedby certain government officials and carried out with precision by the judgeand prosecutor. We believe they are right. How did they manipulate thejury? (Read Aid & Abet Police Newsletter Vol. 1, Num. 10, that addressesthe science of how this is accomplished.) There is no doubt that it wasunderstood what a NOT GUILTY verdict would accomplish. But, that's anotherstory. (See Aid & Abet Vol. 2, Num.1 and Num2., which covers otherparts of this incredible well-laid plan for creating anarchy in the streetsand TERROR in the hearts of U.S. citizens. The goal: To get the citizensto give up their Bill of Rights so that their government can make the streets"safe again" through global government.) BACK TO "GETTING THEM GUNS!" Officers should keep in mind that some of the guns are not going tobe easily removed. For instance, those -47- owned by true patriots - those freedom-loving Americans who know, withouta doubt, what's coming next if they giver up their guns. It should notbe a surprise to Police Officers that many good Americans will not walkmeekly into NEW WORLD ORDER slavery. And there are a few Officers who wouldwant it any other way. So the question each Officer individually must face is a very difficultbut realistic one: "Which way will your own gun face when the ordersare issued?" Will you protect the people you have sworn to protect?Or, will you do what other patriotic officers from other countries havedone to their countrymen, "obediently just follow orders"? Every Police Officer/Military soldier in every enslaved nation on earthhas had to face this same question. Certainly, it's an individual decisionwhether or not to take lethal action against fellow countrymen when orderedto take their weapons (and with them their liberty.) But, each OfficerWILL make that decision. OFFICER, WILL YOU KILL FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHEN ORDERED TO TAKE THEIRWEAPONS? Perhaps it will help that you will be told by superiors, "It'sfor the national good", and/or, "It's for the good of society."(History proves that the nations' Enforcers can expect some such motivationalindoctrination such as this.) Could there be such a police action, taken against the public, if thepolice were told the truth, i.e. "that officers should take the gunsand liberties from the masses so that the Controlling Elite of the nationcan enslave them"? We think not. Why not? Because national Police Enforcers are not mercenaries; theyare always highly patriotic and would not do such a thing as enslavingtheir countrymen, unless in some manner they were totally convinced thatit was the only thing to do to save their country," the "patriotic"thing to do..."FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY" don't you know! "CRIMINALS" EVERY ONE Actually, it may not be a difficultdecision for some Police Officers and National Guardsmen, because beforeit -48- comes time to take the guns, all these terrible, "radical RESISTERSwith those nasty guns" will have been branded as "CRIMINALS OFTHE STATE". And as you and I know, we have been trained that thereis little wrong with killing an armed and resisting "criminal".RIDICULOUS? Have you ever wondered exactly how governments throughout recenthistory have gotten local and state Police Officers in other enslaved nationsto participate in executing their own citizens. This is accomplished bylabeling them "criminals". (Piece of Cake!) It is not a figment of someone's imagination that thousands of unarmedfathers, mothers and children have been shot to death by their own localpolice, while attempting to run or climb to freedom. It is through a processof indoctrination that the very best Officers - highly patriotic Officers- are brought to the point mentally where they can be counted on to dosuch things. Remember, it is always accomplished by convincing the bestofficers: "It is a necessary and patriotic thing to do." PATRIOTIC AMERICANS WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH Police officers would do well not to see the above title as only partof the script out of an old John Wayne movie. We should consider, with utmost seriousness, that if good Americans(including internal protectors) allow this plan of the Globalists to getthis far, it can be expected that casualties among Police Officers, Nationalguardsmen, and armed "criminal" patriotic citizens will be veryhigh before the gun removal process can be successfully completed. (Ifindeed it can be completed.) But, with Police Officers and Guardsmen, andarmed "criminal" patriotic citizens will be very high beforethe gun removal process can be successfully completed. (If indeed it canbe completed.) But, with Police Officers and Guardsmen serving as the "cannonfodder" to enforce the Globalist plan, these deaths will be merely"acceptable loses" to those giving the orders and looking downfrom their safe and secure Ivory Towers. It is therefore entirely relevant that our brothers and sisters decidevery soon which side they will serve in the setting up of this "Utopian"Global Society. They must not be followed by government officials thattell them that all men and women with American blood running through theirveins will walk gently into lifelong servitude. It cannot be contradicted that a great many out there on the other endof those half-billions "Liberty Teeth" (guns) still underscorethe statement of J.J. Rousseau: -49- "I prefer liberty with danger to peace with slavery." INTELLIGENT Americans read and study history. On the other hand, thevast majority of government "leaders", "educators"and media persons apparently don't! Concerning the 2nd Amendment, for example,they try to tell us that the Founding Fathers meant for only the OrganizedMilitia (National Guard) to have weapons. Please read the quotes givenbelow and decide: Could these countrymen have spoken any more plainly? "NO FREE MAN SHALL EVER BE DE-BARRED THE USE OF ARMS. THE STRONGESTREASON FOR THE PEOPLE TO RETAIN THEIR RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS IS ASA LAST RESORT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST TYRANNY IN GOVERNMENT."- THOMAS JEFFERSON "THE SAID CONSTITUTION SHALL NEVER BE CONSTRUED TO AUTHORIZE CONGRESSTO PREVENT THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES WHO ARE PEACEABLE CITIZENS FROMKEEPING THEIR OWN ARMS." - SAM ADAMS "THE GREAT OBJECT IS THAT EVERY MAN BE ARMED. EVERYONE WHO IS ABLEMAY HAVE A GUN." - PATRICK HENRY "AMERICANS NEED NEVER FEAR THEIR GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF THE ADVANTAGEOF BEING ARMED, WHICH THE AMERICANS POSSESS OVER THE PEOPLE OF ALMOST EVERYOTHER NATION." - JAMES MADISON Well now, those statements are really ambiguous aren't they?! Don'tyou wish our Founders would have stated clearly what was on their minds? Why are our school children lied to by Establishment educators aboutthis? You know the answer, don't you? Good NWO slaves will not need guns.And that is exactly what our children will have to look forward to if AmericanPolice Officers and National Guardsmen don't say "NO" TO THENEW WORLD ORDER. Here are several other statements about the importance of guns in thehands of the masses: VLADIMIR I. LENIN: "...one of the basic conditions for the victoryof socialism is the arming of the workers (Communist) and the disarmingof the bourgeoisie (the middle class)." -50- GEORGE KEENAN, 1964: "Popular revolt against a ruthless, experiencedmodern dictatorship, which enjoys a MONOPOLY OVER WEAPONS and COMMUNICATIONS,...issimply not a possibility in the modern age." (U.S. conspirators alreadycontrol the major communication sources, now they have to - GET THE GUNS!) LEO TOLSTOY, 1893: "Governments need armies to protect them againsttheir enslaved and oppressed subjects." And one of our own: PROFESSOR DEAN MORRIS, Government employee, Director of Law EnforcementAssistance Administration (LEAA), in testimony to Congress stated: "Iam one who believes that as a first step the U.S. should move expeditiouslyto disarm the civilian population, other than police and security officers,of all handguns, pistols and revolvers...no one should have a right toanonymous ownership or use of a gun." His government LEAA administration would later publish, "Therecan be no right of privacy in regard to armament...We seek a disarmed populace." Our government now tell us that they "disbanded" LEAA. FACT: They removed the name and address, but every tenant of the LEAAprogram is still in place and the goal and time table is precisely on course.(See book, U.S. Centralization of Police Powers.) Who was it that said these words? "If the opposition (citizen) disarms, well and good. If it refusesto disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves." All those Officers who answered,"Pete WIlson", "George Bush", "Willie Clinton",or "Ross Perot", you are wrong. It was actually JOSEF STALIN.A simple mistake! Perhaps as a last HURRAH in closing this section on U.S. citizens retainingtheir guns, we should heed the cry of a recent victim of anti-gun legislation.In 1990, a female student from Beijing, Red China, described her partner'slast words to her: "Tell the American people never to loose their guns. As long asthey keep their guns in their hands, what happened here will never happenthere." (Amen!) -50- REMEMBER, IT CAN'T WORK WITHOUT YOU Now realize that for any plan, that would subjugate Americans, to haveany chance to succeed, the people's protectors must go against their solemnoath, turn on the people, and assist other seditionists and traitors insuch criminal acts. So we must ask our fellow Officer again, "Willthey be like those who have used pathetic statement such as, "WELL,IT'S THE LAW, SO I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ENFORCE IT."? As many Officers know, that has been the lame excuse offered by thePeople's "Protectors" in all the Marxist nations of the worldduring the last 75 years of totalitarian rule. Fine, dedicated, HIGHLY PATRIOTIC (and brainwashed) police officersby the millions UPHELD THE "LAW" in these other countries, andwent on to round up and execute 170 million of their own countrymen becausethey were told by their leaders that "to save their nation" theymust do these things. HOW COULD THEY DO THAT? Every time a nation's officers have committedsuch acts against their own people it was because of their deep patriotismthat they were easily brainwashed into believing these types of activitieswere in the nation's best interest. (Of course, as mentioned earlier, these170 million people were labeled "CRIMINALS" of the state.) "BUT I WAS ONLY FOLLOWING ORDERS", has always been the mostpopular "last words" of obedient government officers. Least weforget Nuremberg! -52- "BUT, IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE", some will say. Let me tell youthat it is already happening here, and many officers know it. It is nowwell known that Governor Pete Wilson has just declared 500,000 plus goodAmericans to be "felons" - CRIMINALS OF THE STATE- for not obeyinghis unconstitutional gun restrictions by March 30th of 1992. The U.S. Congress,and some other states and cities are in the process of doing the same thing.REMEMBER, we already spoke about how much easier it is to kill armed "criminals"?And so it begins. PEOPLE'S PROTECTORS ARE AWAKENING! Be of good cheer! All over this nation Officers, Guardsmen and militarypersonnel are awakening to this oncoming planned disaster. Many are beginningto take a stand against the NEW WORLD ORDER Bloodsuckers. They now understandthat if they do not side with the people, but allow themselves to be usedto enslave the masses, the will become the ENEMY, KEEPERS, and EXECUTIONERSof their own countrymen. WILL OUR "OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000" PLAN WORK? WHO ARE YOU? by A. Rick Dalton Fellow Officer: Have you ever considered just who you are? Do you realizethat you are the "thin blue line" between civilized society andlawlessness? You have been entrusted with the collective right to self-protectionfor thousands of American citizens who depend on you. You and I are, inour own sphere of operations and influence, among the most important andpowerful people on earth! We have had awesome give to us, and we must never forget that we are,first and foremost, DEFENDERS, not PUNISHERS of the people. We must honorand hold sacred the God-given rights of the people which we defend. Andwe must use our influence, our discretion and sometimes our authority toprotect these inalienable rights. -53- Our plan to shut down the Establishment's NWO Slave State by re-educatingand returning the patriotic People's Servants and Protectors to the sideof the People is working as we speak. Here is a fine example. A PERSONAL TESTIMONY Let this old cop relate one of many recent, memorable meetings I'vehad with fellow patriot Police Officers and Guardsmen. I was a guest speakerat the Seattle, Washington Preparedness Expo in 1991, which drew a crowdof 5,000 plus concerned Americans. At each of my talks there were manyfine federal, state and local police officers and military persons in theaudience. I was privileged to meet a number of these good patriot Officersand to be able to speak with them after my speeches. I recall in particular two Officers who worked as partners for the localpolice department. I can't tell you how impressed I was with their expressionof their love for their fellow Americans and their country. They promisedme that they would go forward from the Expo, study and share their knowledgeand concerns with their police colleagues. As the reader will soon see,they did exactly that. Read below the first published article written bythese two grand American Police Officers, and addressed to their peers. WE HAVE THE POWER Officers A.J. Seitz and Mike Lewis Puyallup Police Department, WA. Mike writes: When A.J. and I first informed people that were going to start writingan article on the U.S. Constitution, we received mixed responses. Someof our fellow officers were sharpening their pencils preparing to writea rebuttal until they saw the piece (no, not A.J.'s HK-91. I'm talkingabout the article.) The article was primarily written as an opening statementjust to get the ball rolling and hopefully make people probe into theirbeliefs and ideals. Several comments were made as to whether we wore whitehoods when we wrote the article. -54- We neither support nor condone the activities of the K.K.K. or any othersimilar organization. What we do believe in is the U.S. Constitution andthe Bill of RIghts. This is something that every officer has sworn to protectand serve. Yet, it's amazing the number of people, officers included, thatreally don't know what the Bill of Rights contain and where it is applicablein the field of Law Enforcement. How many of you can recite the first,second, fourth, fifth, sixth and the eighth amendment if asked by a citizen?These listed are primarily used in our profession. Of course, we all havesome idea that freedom of speech, religion and search and seizure are inthere somewhere, but most are not exactly sure what else is in there. Weall know that the Constitution and Bill of Rights supersedes all otherlaws. It gives the people the right to govern themselves as they see fit.It was our founding fathers' goal to not have a totalitarian state suchas England. How many of us have been dismayed over the passage of a newlaw, with the knowledge that the act would not be practical on the street,or just does not sound quite legal? All we do is bitch or enforce it unquestionably.It goes no further than that. We as a people (especially police officers)have a great amount of power. Let's begin to use it! We want you only tohave an open mind, which for some will be tough, I know. Do something foryourself. LIFE MAGAZINE has a special Fall edition solely based on theBill of Rights. Take one home (Well, pay for it first!) and read it. You'dbe surprised at what you find. Plus it will be great for you kids' futurehistory papers. All we ask is that you search you own soul and questionyourself if you are upholding the people's right, or are you upholdingthe Federal and State Legislative wishes. A.J. writes: As Officer Lewis said above, some people, including officers, fell thatwhen a person uses the Bill of Rights as supportive material to an argumenton a social issue, then that person must be a radical. Perhaps if you arepro-government control, I guess you're right. However, were our foundingfathers radicals against the English government when they were fightingfor our freedom? Since we are discussing the right of the people to governthemselves, fellow officer label us "right wing extremists." This brings us to the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights: "Congressshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibitingthe free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or the press,or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the governmentfor a redress of grievances." This has been said to be the cornerstoneof all other rights, yet this right seems to be constantly under attackby politicians who owe allegiance to special interest groups, as in thepolitical correctness issue. -55- This has obviously irritated the citizens of this country, which canbeen seen by the recent election across the nation, where several specialinterest politicians were voted out of office, and in our own state whereterm limitations nearly passed. One of the reasons that the government is in the this state (excessivetaxation, creating tighter government control, and any of the other topicspeople complain about) is that the people have little knowledge about thehistory of our government. One example is the Sedition law. In 1797, JohnAdams, a Federalist, beat Thomas Jefferson, a Republican, by three votesfor the presidency. In 1978, Jefferson and Madison opposed an imminentwar with France. The Federalists, who had close ties with the Plutocrats(rule by the wealthy) in England, passed the sedition law. Bouviers lawdictionary defines sedition as "a revolt against legitimate authority,the raising of commotions and disturbances in the state or advocacy orsuggestion by word, act, or writing of public disorder or resistance tothe government". The idea behind sedition is that the government hasthe right to protect itself against disgruntled citizens. This sounds greaton the surface until you remember that, as stated in the Declaration ofIndependence, Bill of Rights, and the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Governmentis a government of, for and by the PEOPLE. The first victim of this law was Matthew Lyons, a member of the VermontCongress and reporter of a Vermond newspaper. He accused Adams of settinghimself in a position of king of the people. Lyons soon found himself imprisoned,as did many other politicians, writers, and anyone else who dared suggestthey could govern themselves or speak out against Adams and fellow Federalists.Jefferson labeled the law as the "Alien Friends Act" and persuadedKentucky and Virginia to pass resolutions against the law. As the peopleof the New Nation began to rally against Adams, the Federalists and thesedition law. In 1800, Jefferson won election to the presidency by a landslideand Federalists slowly left, apparently in name only. The citizens nowlived in freedom once again, but only for a short period of time. In the 1940's, a group called the American Firsters began to opposePresident Roosevelt, the New Deal, the government ties with the SovietUnion, and inparticular, going to war with Germany. The FDR administration,with help from a reporter from the Washington Post, entrapped 28 people.Using an alias, the reporter ordered books, pamphlets, etc. and had themsent to Washington D.C.. The 28 defendants were indicted, arrested andtaken to Washington D.C. on sedition charges. After four years Chief JusticeLaws stated, "This is a travesty upon justice,...case dismissed."Although the government did not win the case, they -56- did succeed in running the defendants financially and in scaring anyoneelse who would oppose the current administration. On Feb. 16, 1988 at Fort Smith, Arkansas, the government again indicted14 individuals on sedition charges. After 110 witnesses for the state,1200 pieces of visual evidence, and 8 weeks of trial, all defendants werefound innocent. The other tool the federal government uses is "conspiracy to commitRICCO". The only evidence required is for someone to say that theydiscussed a commission of a crime with another, just like in Orwell's novel,"1984". Interesting! Just think, you can be imprisoned for thoughtcrimes. This is not new. It's been developing since the country started.If certain professional politicians had their way, they would control everything. Another example is the media. We're not saying that we support eitherof these professionals, but look at the difference in standards. Duringthe Louisiana governor's race, established professional politicians, witha lot of help from mass media, succeeded in lambasting David Duke's campaignand yet the same media censored Gary Trudeau's editorial cartoon depictingallegations of Dan Quayle and a DEA file. Nothing obscene or disgusting,but an issue that the people deserve to hear. What happened to unbiasednews? We realize these things are far removed from the issues we deal withon the street, but you have to stop and think. If the federal governmenttries to make these terror tactics and harassment seems like "theend justifies the means", it has to make us justify any tactic wemay use to make an arrest (or dare I say "A STAT)" no matterwhat rights we may bend or break. Remember, we have the power to protect these rights that were givento us all, even to street cops. Those of you who have had I.A.'s shouldknow best. Citizens deserve no less protection of their rights than whatyou got, or at least what you should have gotten. - End (Note: Research material was taken from the documentary videotape, "SeditionUSSA", by Video Truth Network, and the Fall issue of LIFE MAGAZINE.) Editor McLamb continues: You see, since most Cops are highly patriotic, the truth about whatis wrong with America, can spread like wildfire among the ranks. And officerslike A.J. and Mike who are definitely -57- two Police Officers "Against the New World Order", are startingthe fire in the bosom of their fellow officers. I wish to commend and thankboth these wonderful young officers for their patriotism and efforts tosave our nation. As usual, they are taking a bit of heat, but that is theprice of liberty and true leadership today. As my dear friend Col. Bo Gritzsays..." If you're over the target, you are going to take flak." These Officers have since written other articles and are working hardto educate our colleagues in their state. Think of how many of our fellowOfficers they will reach, educate and turn back to serving the People ofour nation. And then how many of the officers A.J. and Mike educate willin turn reach out to touch other Officers and Guardsmen across their state,and other states. And so it goes and grows. We, who call ourselves "POLICEAGAINST THE NEW WORLD ORDER" are growing in number as in geometricprogression. Every patriotic officer whom we can awaken becomes a "forceof one' that can have a great impact on many others, who will then havean impact on others. There are over 4,500 Police and National Guardsmenon our educational, constitutional Air & Abet Police Newsletter. We"ENFORCERS" have the potential of stopping this treasonous GlobalGovernment scam very quickly. Remember, "IF OFFICERS DON'T ENFORCE TREASON, IT WON'T GET ENFORCED"? This editor is humbled by the love and devotion to "We The People"of the many federal, state and local officers and Guardsmen with whom Iam in communication across America. I am fortunate to be able to work andcommunicate daily with our nation's greatest assets - its Patriots. - End. Officer Jack McLamb, (Ret) Editor/Publisher, Aid & Abet Police Newsletter.P.O. Box 8787, Phx. AZ. 85066 -58- VAMPIRE KILLER 2000 IS WORKING More than ever before we, as Police Officers, National Guardsmen andSoldiers, are learning the truth about America's enemies and rememberingwhom it was we swore to protect and serve, the "SYSTEM" or thePEOPLE? It was once said, "MAN CANNOT SERVE TWO MASTERS". Indeed,we cannot! BUT WHICH OATH? This is a confidential letter from a government Officer that does notwant to be identified. Therefore, we must write this message with thisin mind. A federal officer, to whom we have given the code name "G",told us recently that "G" was part of a new federal action teamthat was formed for a very important reason. "G" stated thatthis "action team" is extremely well trained. It is equippedwith the newest technology and can respond to any type of "emergency"over a large area. "G's" concern is that none of these "actionteams" members across the nation has been given an oath of officer.They have not sworn to protect any Constitution, people or government.This Officer wonders if perhaps these groups of highly trained men andwomen are to be used for something UNAMERICAN. Could it be that these men and women are to take another type of oath,possibly this one?: -59- "I solemnly affirm to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and consciencethe functions entrusted to me as a member of the international serviceof the United Nations, to discharge those functions and regulate my conductwith the interest of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek oraccept instructions in respect to the performance of my duties from anygovernment or other authority external to the organization." - UNITEDNATIONS' LOYALTY OATH. Could this be the oath of all U.S. officers will take in the near future?Have some already taken it? Must we reiterate what our illustrious traitor/PresidentBush stated in front of the UN building Feb. 1, 1992,...that we officerswould swear an oath to this "SACRED" organization in the future?? (So we don't appear biased, let us restate that Clinton and Perot areNWO clones, and if given a chance they would do the exact same thing.) The Federal Officer above is not the first person that has informedus that the Oath of Allegiance is being attacked. Several have reportedchanges. Some refer to subtle changes in their State oaths that have beenappearing in recent months. All such attempts must be challenged. PROTECTING "THE SYSTEM" FROM THE MASSES Recapping what we said earlier: In Communist countries the SYSTEM orGROUP is always held in higher regard than the individual citizen. Thealert observer will have noticed that America has now accepted this samepolitical philosophy. In a true free nation the INDIVIDUAL -60- is protected over the group or the system. A Constitutional Republicis a system of government which protects each individual, and thereby protectsthe whole. A Democracy is Mob Rule. It protects the group or mob over theindividual, crushing the individual, if necessary, to protect the group.A Lynch Mob is a prime example of a Democracy...'The Lynchee does not wantto get hung, the Lynchors want to hang the Lynchee, so they have a vote."A perfect Democracy! You see, friends and colleagues, the enemies of our Republic, lurkinginside our government, have a very big problem. They assume that officers,after going through our U.S. socialistic/humanistic government schoolsand government police academies, are now psychologically prepared to doANYTHING they are ordered to do regardless, to protect "the system"from the masses. As mentioned earlier, this is always sold to them as "DOINGTHEIR PATRIOTIC DUTY". This Enemy has for years applied the same programof indoctrination to the Police Officers of other nations, and with greatsuccess. They are now convinced that our fellow Officers, having undergonea similar type of indoctrination, will now make it work here in Americaas well. Many Officers, if asked, would say THEY ARE WRONG! -61- What these One Worlders don't understand is that Americans are differentfrom the "subjects" of collectivist empire nations. The factis, for generations we have tasted the elixir of something called personalINDEPENDENCE and LIBERTY, the likes of which no other people in historyhave ever known. Let us share with you one of our favorite quotes fromour 2nd President, John Adams: "YOUR HAVE RIGHTS ANTECEDENT TO ALL EARTHLY GOVERNMENTS; RIGHTSTHAT CANNOT BE REPEALED OR RESTRAINED BY HUMAN LAWS; RIGHTS DERIVED FROMTHE GREAT LEGISLATOR OF THE UNIVERSE." But of course the international "Elitists" like Bush, Clinton,Perot, Kennedy, Rockefeller, Brezhinsky, Hammer, etc. have a difficulttime relating to this, due to the fact that most have never actually given100% allegiance to any nation. Over the last 100 years these Internationalist have slowly drained some,if not all, of this patriotism and independence out of some of our people.But, let them beware. They are in for a big surprise if they think themajority of our people, inside or outside our government, are now readyfor the harness of servitude under their "beneficent" IMPERIALU.N. RULE. DO YOU HEAR THAT, YOU INTERNATIONALIST BLOOD-SUCKERS? Those whom youthink will do you dastardly biddings without question (Police, NationalGuardsmen and Military) give you good warning: The battle to enslave theAmerican people is not won! Not by a long shot! -62- ENEMY'S WORST NIGHTMARE Pushing hard for their vision of a collectivist, "utopian"New World Order, the behind the scenes controllers of Clinton, Bush andPerot undoubtedly have as their worst nightmare the prospect that you,their ENFORCERS, might awaken and return to the side of the People. Theirplan cannot succeed unless you will act without thinking, not understandinghow they will manipulate and use you to implement their plan for worldconquest. Think about it: Whatever would they do, if you, because of yourstrong patriotism, decide to do nothing more than uphold your oath of serviceand protection to the People of America and JUST SAY "NO"? Whatcould they do? GREAT POWER IN YOUR HANDS Have you ever desired great power? Dear Officer, Guardsmen, Soldier,you already have GREAT POWER!! The secret enemies now in control of Americaknow of your great power, even if you don't. That is why they will do anythingto stop you from learning about your power. They cannot allow you to beawakened, because they know that if you, our nation's INTERNAL PROTECTORS,turn from being Enforcers of the SYSTEM, and return to being -63- PROTECTORS of the PEOPLE, there is no way they can pull off their coup. "MAKE YOURSELVES SHEEP AND THE WOLVES WILL EAT YOU" This admonition is one given by our good brother and RIght HonorableTop Cop, Professor James Jarrett of Phoenix. May it serve to lead us intothe last main point we wish to leave with you - something we hope you willremember above all else. As stated earlier, these treacherous Internationalists absolutely cannotaccomplish their goals without the nation's Enforcers aiding & abettingtheir treasonous, unconstitutional mandates. But, they know also that forthe most part if they can label certain patriotic Americans as "criminals",most of our fellow Police Officers will respond accordingly and treat themas such. This is presently occurring in many areas. IRS Director, DonaldAlexander, admitted to Congress 20 years ago, "We now have so manyregulations that everyone is guilty of some violation." Imagine whatit's like today. Another such attempt, is not only to label as "criminals"those who refuse to relinquish or register weapons of personal defense,but also all those Americans who wish to exercise their Constitutionallyguaranteed right to dissent or speak out. Such as we officers have donein this publication and we do regularly through the AID & ABET PoliceNewsletter. (Note: Aid & Abet Police Newsletter is available to InternalProtectors and private citizens by writing to P.O. Box 8787, Phx. Az. 85066.) There is ample evidence from testimonies of readers/Officers from variousparts of the country, to show that this move is already begun. But, thislabeling of good Americans as "criminals" cannot succeed withoutthe full cooperation of the 1,000,000-plus American Police Officers andNational Guardsmen. Keep in mind the following: THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN LOSE IN THIS STRUGGLE TO SAVE OUR GREAT REPUBLIC,IF WE AMERICAN "INTERNAL PROTECTORS" WILL DO WHAT WE MUST DO,AND THAT IS TO UPHOLD OUR OATH OF OFFICE TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE FROM ALLENEMIES. It does sound simple, does it not? -64- SOMETIMES "DISORDER" IS GOOD As Protectors of the People, let us involve ourselves now and for thefuture in bringing DISorder to the "New World Order" by committingourselves this day along side Thomas Jefferson to this wonderful pledge: "I have sworn upon the altar of Almighty God eternal hostilityagainst every form of tyranny over the mind of man." For those of our brothers and sisters who have children, this very eveningquietly sneak in and look down into the small faces of your posterity andask yourselves this question: Can there be a greater work that to saveour nation for these little ones? Working together with our fellow countrymen,we can place the final stake through the heart of this Parasitic Beastthat has gripped our once vibrant nation by the throat. In so doing, wewill secure for ourselves, our children and grandchildren, a grand andmarvelous future. -65- HOW CAN YOU PLAY A PART IN OUR NATION'S RECOVERY? EACH OFFICER OR NATIONAL GUARDSMAN THAT WISHES TO BECOME A PART OF THERECOVERY OF OUR NATION MUST START WITH EDUCATION. BUT, BECAUSE OF THE LATENESSOF THE HOUR, IT MUST BE DONE QUICKLY. EACH OFFICER MUST KNOW JUST WHATARE THE PROBLEMS AND HOW ONE OFFICER CAN HELP. 1) Start by sharing this publication with every Police Officer, NationalGuardsman and Soldier you know and ask them to do the same. Ordering asubscription to AID & ABET POLICE NEWSLETTER is another must so thatyou can communicate with other likeminded patriot Officers. Also thereare very important seminar tapes that have much vital information. Throughthis exposure you will learn of many other fine publications, persons andgroups that can help you grow. (See order information at back of this publication.)NOTE: Secondary targets for this manual. All Fed..State and local Governmentofficials, school board members, teachers, ministers, neighbors. -66- 2) This next change will be hard for certain colleagues. But, trustus on this one. You must seek out those whom the government says are usingthe Constitution to destroy our nation. We told you this would be a toughone! There are indeed groups that were set up to use the U.S. Constitutionto destroy America, such as the ACLU. We speak only of those Americanswhom the government and media "attack" vehemently. Those whoare presently risking incarceration daily to try to awaken the AmericanPeople to the traitors in our government. This is the group that governmentand the controlled media have labeled as "evil", "crazy","right-wing fanatics", "violence-prone", "unAmerican","hatemongers","radicals", etc., etc. Yes, these greatAMERICAN PATRIOTS are listed as "PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE" byour government. Can you guess why that is? It is because they are the ONLYPEOPLE IN OUR NATION who are fighting the NEW WORLD ORDER. In truth, theyare none of the horrible things our government and the media say they are.Trust your fellow Officers on this until you have met these great Americansyourself. If we are wrong, then you will know it very quickly. Is thatnot so? These wonderful "crazy" Americans meet in small group allacross our nation every week, to non-violently plan and work to save ournation through education from the terrible tragedy of Internationalism/globalismand the likes. These people are not the wealthy. They, like police officers,are the working class. Theirs is the spirit that made America the greatestnation on earth! They have heart and they have love; and all of them loveFreedom. But, make no mistake, they are not "weak". If need by,they will indeed go to war against those who try to enslave them, theirfamilies and their fellow Americans. ATTEND MEETINGS. Go to as many of their meetings as possible and learn.Even though they many at first be suspect of you (as a government officers),get with them, and tell them you truly love America and want to be knowledgeableof what is occurring in your country and want to help. They will teachyou, as they have taught the officers who have put together this publication,and many other American protectors. These patriots know our nation's foundingprinciples, know what went wrong and how to fix America. -67- 3) Officer if you believe in prayer, do pray! Pray that the Lord willlead you as HE is presently leading many of your fellow officers to knowwhat role you can play in the recovery of our nation. Your police colleaguesgive you this guarantee: If you are sincere, you will get an answer. 4) Write to us. We are your brothers and sisters in law enforcementand we love you. We truly do! That may sound strange to you Macho Cops, but we mean it. Those thatknow us know we mean it. Have you ever been in a foxhole with the bulletsflying all around? Or in a commercial building on night shift, doing aburglary check when several big Bad Guys came out of the dark? Did younot love him who protected your backside? Get the point? You know exactlywhat we mean. Honestly, it is past time that we show our brotherly lovefor our countrymen. We're here as your support. You're going to need it if you decide tostand up for your fellow Americans. Write, let us know what is on yourmind and in your heart. Some of us, your colleagues, have been througha living hell in order to keep serving and protecting the People from allenemies. Sharing the truth found in this publication with your fellow officerswill not be popular among some within your agencies. Remember, there islittle you will go through that we have not already experienced. Let ushelp. Together, we are strong! THAT'S ALL FOR NOW! It is indeed just that simple. STUDY but don't take all day about it.Go to those who know. If you can't find a group of involved, knowledgeable,patriotic Americans write to us and we will connect you with some finePatriots in your area. America's government and the freedoms it gives are an acclaimed wonderthroughout the world. Why has our constitution served us so well? The bedrockwas the Christian worldview of those who founded this Country. -68- BATTLE CRY The most important quote in promoting this plan of recovery for ournation is this one by Sir Winston Churchill. In a sense it is the BattleCry of all FREE MEN. It is the battle cry of POLICE AGAINST THE NEW WORLDORDER: "Still, if you will not fight for the right when you can easilywin without bloodshed, if you will not fight when your victory will besure and not so costly, you may come to the moment when you will have tofight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance for survival.There may be a worse case. You may have to fight when there is no chanceof victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves."- Winston Churchill -69- DOCUMENTS AND PLANS The following are a few documents that point out the plans of thosewhose goal it is to destroy America. -70- The Hegelian Principle Revolutionaries in government have created economic chaos, shortagesin food and fuel, confiscatory taxation, a crisis in education, the threatof war, and other diversions to condition Americans for "The New WorldOrder." The technique is as old as politics itself. It is the Hegelian principleof bringing about change in a three-step process: Thesis. Antithesis andSynthesis. The first step (thesis) is to create a problem. The second step (antithesis)is to generate opposition to the problem (fear, panic,hysteria). The thirdstep (synthesis) is to offer the solution to the problem created in stepone, -change which would have been impossible to impose on the people withoutthe proper psychological conditioning achieved in stages one and two. Applying the Hegelian principle, and irresistible financial influence,concealed mattoids seek to dismantle social and political structures bywhich free men govern themselves - ancient landmarks erected at great costin blood and treasure. Their objective is to emasculate sovereign states, merge nation underuniversal government, centralize economic powers, and control the world'speople and resources. -71- See Picture #4a/4b REGIONAL GOVERNMENT UPDATE 1987 The country is partitioned off into 10 "regions". The mostbold black lines delineate the ten section (regions), each having its own"capital". The less bold lines depict the replacement for countries.They are called U.M.J.O.s (Umbrella Multi Jurisdictional Organizations).Every state has been so recast. The finest lines are the present countrystructure that is "planned" to be abolished! -Bernadine Smith President Nixon on 3-27-69 through the Government Reorganization Actdivided the United States into ten Regions. To further implement this RegionalGovernance over the U.S.A., President Nixon signed Executive Order 11649and entered it in the Federal Register Feb. 12,1972. (Vo. 37, No. 30) Through the authority vested in him as President of the U.S., he establisheda Federal Regional Council for each of the ten standard regions. It statedthat, the President shall designate one member of each such Council asChairman of that Council and such chairman shall serve at the pleasureof the President. -72- STATES BEING ABOLISHED Study the constitution of your state. You may find that your state constitutionno longer describes the boundaries of the state-effectively abolishingthe state. At last check, the only states that still lay out their boundariesin their constitutions are Washington, Idaho, Montana, North and SouthDakota, Wyoming, Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas,Arizona, New Mexico and Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and Florida.

MANIFEST Friday, October 2nd, 1992 Chaos has descended in "Carandiru,"the biggest penitentiary complex in South America. Over a hundred inmatesdead and hundreds injured on the massacre. The police arrived with helicoptersand over two hundred armed forces. They took the jailblock called "PavilhaoNove" and opened fire on the inmates in a holocaust method of annihilation.The government of the city of Sao Paulo cannot control the brutality ofits police. Over eighty percent of the inmates were not sentenced yet.The bodies were filled with bullets and bites from the police dogs. Thepolice try to hide the massacre saying there were only eight deaths. Theviolence of Brazilian cops is very well known outside of Brazil, This kindof extermination is a method that they use to get rid of the overpopulationin the jails. The violence of the cops left the whole pavilion destroyedafter the rebellion. "Pavilhao Nove" (Pavilhao 9) ============================================================================= ARTICLE 1 Reprinted from WIRED Issue 1.6 BIG BROTHER WANTS TO LOOK INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT (Any Time It Pleases) The US Government is constructing a system to track all financial transactionsin realtime-ostensibly to catch drug traffickers, terrorists, and financialcriminals. Does that leave you with the warm fuzzies-or scare you out ofyour wits? By Anthony L. Kimery ascii'ed by The P/\NTHER -TRZ/TRSI/UMF- There wasn't much to go on. The Police salvaged the slip of paper thata small time East Coast drug dealer tried to eat before being arrested,but on it they found scribbled only a "John." This frustratedthe police. They had anticipated more incriminating information on theman they believed was the supplier not only to the dealer they'd just busted,but also to dozens of other street corner crack peddlers. With two slim leads, the police weren't technically equipped to do muchmore than antiquated detective work that probably wouldn't yield evidencethey could use to indict John. So they turned to the quasi-secretive, federalFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for the digital sleuthingthey needed. Less than 45 minutes after receiving the official police request forhelp, FinCEN had retrieved enough evidence of criminal wrongdoing fromgovernment databases that the district attorney prosecuting the case wasable to seek indictments against John on charges of money laundering andconspiracy to traffic narcotics. The local police were impressed. Launched with a low-key champagne reception at the Treasury Departmentin April 1990, FinCEN is the US government's (perhaps the world's) mosteffective financial crime investigation unit. Even Russian President BorisYeltsin asked for its help in locating stolen Communist Party funds. Thisstart-of-the-art computer-snooping agency is quietly tucked away underthe auspices of the Treasury Department. Its mission is to map the digitaltrails of dirty money, be it the laundered profits from drug sales , stolenS&L, loot, hidden political slush funds, or the financing conduitsof terrorists. It's the only federal unit devoted solely to the systematiccollation and cross-analysis of law enforcement, intelligence, and publicdatabases. Until August 1993, FinCEN headquarters was an old Social Security Administrationbuilding with a ceiling ravaged by asbestos abatement crews, but that didn'tseem to faze director Brian Bruh (he retired in October). With 25 yearsof experience in law enforcement, Bruh is a seasoned federal cop who hasheaded up criminal investigations at both the IRS and the Pentagon. Priorto overseeing FinCEN, he was the chief investigator for the Tower Commission,President Reagan's blue ribbon probe into the Iran-Contra scandal. FinCENwas his crowning achievement, and he took pride in directing visitors toFinCEN's computer command center as he touted the agency's successes. In private and in testimony to Congress, statistics roll off Bruh'stongue. Last year FinCEN's computer operations center responded to priorityrequests for tactical intelligence on nearly 12,000 individuals and entities,doubling the 1991 workload. The 1995 total will be three times the 1991sum. Longer-term strategic analytical reports have been completed for 715investigations involving 16,000 other individuals and entities. Two of the government's biggest strikes against organized drug-moneylaundering-operation Green Ice (a lengthy DEA operation that resulted inthe arrests of high-ranking Cali and Medellin cartel financial officersand the seizure of US$54 million cash and assets) and Polar Cap V (a spinoffof Green Ice that culminated in April 1990) - owe a great deal to FinCENfor having identified and targeted money laundering activities via computer.In the Polar Cap operation, FinCEN's computer tracking documented morethan US$500 million in financial activity by 47 individuals who have sincebeen indicted on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Inside FinCEN's new digs on the second floor of a gleaming high-riseoffice building down the road from the CIA in Vienna, Virginia (otherwiseknown as "Spook City"), the talents of the IRS, FBI, DEA, SecretService, and other traditional federal cops such as customs agents andpostal inspectors are pooled. According to senior intelligence officers,these investigative units can access the resources of the CIA, the NationalSecurity Agency (which intercepts data on electronic currency movementsinto and out of the United States, some of which make their way into FinCEN'sanalyses), and the Defense Intelligence Agency. Bruh and other FinCEN officials openly acknowledge their associationwith the CIA, but they refuse to discuss further any aspect of FinCEN'sdealings with it or any other intelligence agency. In addition to the CIA,intelligence officials have admitted, off the record, that the NationalSecurity Council and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence andResearch (INR) have also joined FinCEN's impressive intelligence crew.In short, FinCEN is a one-of-a-kind cauldron containing all the availablefinancial intelligence in the United States. "It's the first ever government-wide, multi-source intelligenceand analytical network brought together under one roof to combat financialcrimes," said Peter Djinis, director of the Treasury department'sOffice of Financial Enforcement and one of the few Treasury officials closeto FinCEN activities. "FinCEN is absolutely necessary," said a senior General AccountingOffice (GAO) official involved in an audit of FinCEN required by new anti-money-launderinglaws passed last year. The agency's report wasn't released by press time,but according to the GAO official, no irregularities were uncovered. However,the GAO's scrutiny skirted emerging concerns about privacy, civil rights,and the appropriate role of the intelligence community. FinCEN's mission requires the involvement of the intelligence community,particularly in tracking the financial dealings of terrorists and in conductingfinancial counterintelligence, although few are willing to discuss thetrend openly. Because these activities cross into the world of cloaks anddaggers, some watchdogs are concerned that such endeavors will encroachon -privacy and civil rights. When you look at the power of FinCEN andits proposed offspring, their fears seem justified. HOW TO BUST A JOHN The whiz kids at FinCEN are good. Very good. That's why state and localpolice have come to depend on FinCEN to pull them out of the electronic-sleuthingquicksand. The case of John the drug supplier is a good example of oneof their less-complex assignments, and it illustrates the adeptness withwhich the government can collate existing financial data. Seated at a computer terminal inside FinCEN's former command post, aFinCEN analyst began the hunt. He started by querying a database of businessphone numbers. He scored a hit with the number of a local restaurant. Nexthe entered the Currency and Banking Database (CBDB), an IRS database accessedthrough the Currency and Banking Retrieval System. CBDB contains roughly50 million Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs), which document all financialtransactions of more than $10,000. By law these transactions must be filedby banks, S&Ls, credit unions, securities brokers, casinos, and otherindividuals and businesses engaged in the exchange of large sums of money. The analyst narrowed his quest by searching for CTRs filed for transactionsdeemed "suspicious." Financial institutions must still file aCTR, or IRS Form 4789, if a transaction under US$10,000 is considered suspiciousunder the terms of an extensive federal government list. There was a hit.A series of "suspicious" CTRs existed in the restaurant's ZIPcode. Punching up images of the identified CTRs on his terminal, the FinCENanalyst noted that the transactions were made by a person whose first namewas John. The CTRs were suspicious all right; they were submitted for aseries of transactions each in the amount of US$9,5000, just below theCTR threshold of US$10,000. This was hard evidence that John structuredthe deposits to avoid filing a Form 4789, and that is a federal crime. Selecting one of the CTRs for "an expanded review," the analystgot John's full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address,driver license number, and other vital statistics, including bank accountnumbers. Plunging back into the IRS database, the analyst broadened his searchfor all CTRs filed on behalf of the suspect, including non-suspicious CTRs.Only 20 reports deemed suspicious popped up on the screen, but more than150 CTRs were filed in all. A review of the non-suspicious ones revealedthat on several, John listed his occupation as the owner or manager ofthe restaurant identified by the telephone number on the slip of papertaken from the arrested drug dealer. The connection between the name andthe phone number originally given to FinCEN was secured. The FinCEN analyst then tapped commercial and government databases,and turned up business information on the restaurant showing that Johnhad reported an expected annual revenue for his eatery of substantiallyless than the money he had been depositing, as indicated by the CTRs. Fishingin a database of local tax assessment records, the analyst discovered thatJohn owned other properties and businesses. With the names of these othercompanies, the analyst went back into the CTR database and found that suspicioustransaction reports were filed on several of them as well. As routine as such assignments as this case may be, the chumminess betweenFinCEN and the intelligence community raises serious questions about theprivacy and security for the financial records of citizens John and JaneDoe, considering the intelligence community's historic penchant for illegalspying on non-criminals. Given the vast reach and ease with which the governmentcan now tap into an individual's or business's financial records on a whim,these questions have received far too little scrutiny. WHOSE PRIVACY? "There are legitimate concerns" regarding privacy,a ranking House banking committee staffer conceded in an interview withWired. "Quite frankly, there hasn't been much congressional oversightwith respect to the intelligence community's involvement with FinCEN. Whenyou start trying to look into this, you start running up against all kindsof roadblocks." The GAO official involved in auditing FinCEN agreedthat questions regarding the intelligence community's involvement and attendantprivacy concerns haven't been addressed. If such issues have been the subjectof discussion behind the closed doors of the House and Senate intelligencecommittees, no one is talking openly about it. Meanwhile, the potential for abusive intrusion by government into thefinancial affairs of private citizens and businesses is growing almostunnoticed and unchecked. Two of the latest electronic inroads into the financial records of privatecitizens and businesses are "Operation Gateway," a FinCEN initiative,and the proposed Deposit Tracking System, which other intelligence agencieswould like to see established. Both are inherently prone to abuse and providea disturbing indication of the direction in which the government is moving. Gateway is a pilot program launched in Texas this July that gives stateand local law enforcement officials direct access to the massive federalFinancial Database (FDB) through a designated FinCEN coordinator. The FDBcontains the records that financial institutions have been filing underthe Bank Secrecy Act for the last 23 years - CTRs, suspicious transactionreports, International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instrumentsreports, and Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts reports. In addition.Congress is expected to grant FinCEN authority to tap into the databaseof Forms 8300, which are reports of payments over US$10k000 received ina trade or business. These documents principally contain information ondeposits, withdrawals, and the movement of large sums of currency. It isFinCEN's intent to give all state governments individual access to theFDB. Under the Gateway proposal, results from all queries would be writteninto a master audit file that will constantly be compared against otherrequests and databases to track whether the subject of the inquiry is ofinterest to another agency or has popped up in a record somewhere else. State coordinators designated by FinCEN will do the logging on, as FinCENis uncomfortable with giving 50,000 federal agents and 500,000 police officersdirect electronic access to its database. "This is very sensitiveinformation," concedes Andy Flodin, special assistant to the FinCENdirector . "We'd have to have additional security safeguards beforewe could open it up to every police agency." But while the FDB contains only records on major money movements andthus is not as much of a threat to individual privacy, the Deposit TrackingSystem (DTS) is a potential menace. If implemented, the estimated US$12.5million computer system could be used to penetrate the security of bankaccounts belonging to you, me, and 388 million other bank account holdersin the US. The government argues that such a system is necessary for two reasons;first, to assess adequately the funding needed for federal deposit insuranceand second, to locate the assets of individuals ordered by courts to makerestitution for financial crimes - like the savings and loan crooks. (Itseems the government can't trace most of the money they stole.) The first reason stems from a requirement of the seemingly innocuousFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991- one of Congress'slegislative response to the savings and loan debacle. The Act requiresthe FDIC to study the costs, feasibility, and privacy implications of trackingevery bank deposit in the United States. So far the DTS exists only on paper. The FDIC's completed feasibilitystudy is currently being examined by Congress, but it is unlikely to acton before late next year. For the time being, the US$12.5 million pricetag seems to be the biggest drawback to its implementation. Concerns about he DTS have been widespread, although it has receivedscant attention in the mainstream press. But according to Diane Casey,executive director of the Independent Bankers Association of America, theDTS "would fundamentally change the relationships among banks, consumers,and the government in ways that have implications beyond banking policy.Out open and democratic society would be changed profoundly if any agencyof the government maintained the scope of information on private citizensdescribed in this proposal. It raises questions about our democracy thatwould have to be addressed by the highest policy making levels of government." The American Bankers association (ABA) voiced equally serious concerns.The ABA doubts "whether there are any privacy safeguards that wouldbe adequate to effectively protect this database from use by governmentagencies and, eventually, private parties," an ABA spokesman explains."It is inconceivable to the ABA that such a database could be usedonly by the FDIC in deposit insurance coverage functions. Such a database...wouldprovide a wealth of information for investigations being conducted by theFBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the IRS, to name but a few.Like the baseball diamond in Field of Dreams, build this database and theywill come. Eventually, whether legally or illegally, they will gain accessto this database." The FDIC forcefully argued against the DTS in the 234-page draft reportit submitted to Congress in June 1993, but it may not have the bureaucraticclout necessary to kill the proposal. Wired was told by intelligence analystsand congressional sources dealing with oversight of the intelligence communitythat federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies are privately clamoringfor the system, apparently disregarding both the privacy issues and thesystems's start up cost (which does not include the additional US$20 milliona year the feasibility study said would be required for facilities, forsalaries and benefits, and for routine hardware and software maintenance). Further driving the intelligence agencies's desire for the DTS is themuch-hyped role of economic intelligence gathering, a key focus of theClinton administration's reform of the intelligence community. Agencieslike the CIA view the system as a boon to their ability to monitor foreignfinancial dealings in the US, according to both congressional and intelligencecourses. Adding Intelligence to the Equation. Regardless of the form it takes, the sources said, the DTS and any otherfinancial databases that come down the pike could be easily interfacedto FinCEN's Artificial Intelligence/Massive Parallel Processing (AI/MPP)program, a criminal targeting system that will go online in a few years. Because laundered money is moved undetected along with the millionsof legitimate computerized wire transfers that occur daily, FinCEN's computerinvestigations naturally demand expert systems that can single the dirtymoney out of the crowd. FinCEN's current Artificial Intelligence capabilityallows it to search the Financial Database for suspicious, preprogrammedpatterns of monetary transactions. While not very flexible, the systemidentified previously unknown criminal organizations and activities. But FinCEN has a hush-hush US$2.4 million contract with the US Departmentof Energy's Los Alamo National Laboratory to develop what Bruh and otherFinCEN officials described as a powerful "money flow model."Unlike FinCEN's current system, Los Alamo's AI software will look for unexplained,atypical money flows. Coupled with a massively parallel computer system,the AI/MPP could perform real-time monitoring of the entire US electronicbanking landscape. FinCEN's AI capabilities currently exploit the Financial Database forproactive targeting of criminal activity. The system automatically monitorsthe entire FDB database, constantly identifying suspicious financial activityin supercomputer-aided, rapid-response time. In addition to the FDB, FinCENis applying AI to the Criminal Referral Forms that must be filed with FinCENwhenever banks, examiners, and regulators uncover financial activitiesthey suspect are illegal. In the near future, all of these government databases will be interfacedby way of AI/MPP technology. "MPP is critical to FinCEN's abilityto analyze (banking) data to its full capacity," Bruh insists. The pure power of such a "database of databases" terrifiescritics. Though FinCEN and other authorities discount the potential forabuse, tell that to the CIA. It charter forbids it from engaging in domesticsurveillance; nonetheless, it spied on Americans for seven consecutivepresidential administrations (it says it finally ceased its internal spyingin the mid-1970s). FinCEN's AI operation has been employed legitimately with great success.Perhaps its least-known project was assisting the CIA in identifying andtracking the flow of money between Iran's state-sponsored Islamic fundamentalistterrorist organizations and the men linked to the bombing of the WorldTrade Center. According to a Treasury official and confirmed by Anna Fotias,FinCEN's congressional liaison, FinCEN identified suspicious transactionreports filed by a bank in New Jersey on wire transfers from Germany tothe accounts of two of the men charged with the bombing. With the bankaccount in Germany identified, further AI processing-utilizing intelligencefrom the CIA's DESIST computer system, the world's most extensive databaseon terrorists-identified a company as a front for an Iranian terroristgroup. Coupled with DESIST's data on the two men's terrorist connections,FinCEN was able to identify a number of previously unknown conduits ofterrorist funding in the US and abroad. Similarly, FinCEN was crucial inidentifying Iraqi assets in the US that were frozen in the wake of Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait, according to a Treasury official. Still, given the CIA's less-than-spotless record, privacy advocatesare likely to find it disturbing that there are some within the walls ofCIA headquarters - apparently unbeknownst to anyone at FinCEN - who wantto merge DESIST with FinCEN's eventual AI/MPP ability and with all thedatabases FinCEN routinely surveys. The justification for creating sucha system is compelling: More likely than not it would identify scores ofpreviously unknown financial conduits to terrorists. Advocates of a full-time DESIST/FinCEN system carry their argument onestep further: Hooked into the yet to be authorized Deposit Tracking System,the DESIST/FinCEN system would be able to identify terrorist financialmovements in real time, thus providing early warning of potentially imminentterrorist actions. Some within the intelligence community take it stillanother step: They would have the system tied into the private computersthat hold credit card transactions "so that we could have nearly instanttime-tracking capability," with the CIA's Counterterrorist Center. Conversely, a CIA/FinCEN/DTS endeavor could monitor on a real-time basisthe financial activity of narcotics traffickers, since drug dealing alsois within the purview of the CIA. The agency's Counternarcotics Center,of CNC, already works closely with FinCEN. Before the CIA would be allowed to tap into a system as sensitive asthe proposed Deposit Tracking System, it would have to clear plenty ofcivil liberties hurdles, not the least of which is the prohibition on theCIA from gathering intelligence on US citizens. As long as the DTS itselfwas shielded from direct access by the CIA, proponents could argue thatthe operation was allowable under law. Opponents, on the other hand, fearthat the CIA would find a way to download, copy, or otherwise secretlyaccess the DTS. "The risk of the CIA getting its hands on this is serious-we knowthe kind of unscrupulous people who populate the spook world," saida Washington-area private investigator who conducts many legitimate financialinvestigations for a CIA-linked firm. "This kind of financial data,when coupled with other information like a person's credit history, couldbe used for blackmail, bribery, and extortion," said the investigator,who has a military intelligence background. Bruce Hemmings is a veteran CIA clandestine-services officer who retiredin 1989. Prior to the DTS proposal, he told Wired that the CIA routinelydigs for financial dirt on people from whom the agency wants specific information.Typically they are foreign intelligence officers working in the US undera diplomatic guise, and this financial information is often used as leveragein getting them to talk. In less civilized venues, this is called blackmail. DTS could present an inviting mechanism for quieting unwanted dissentor for defanging an unruly congressional leader bent on exposing some questionableCIA operation. Although still in its embryonic stage and in spite of thelooming privacy obstacle it will inevitably confront, FinCEN is seen bymany in the government as the catalyst for a powerful, all-seeing, all-knowing,global, financial-tracking organization. In fact, FinCEN is already workingclosely with INTERPOL, and Bruh's deputy just resigned to head up INTERPOL'sUS office. As the privacy debate heats up, FinCEN's digital dirty-money trackersgo on about their work, hoping they don't have to choose sides if whatthey do becomes a full-blown privacy invasion problem. As Bruh puts it,"There's tons of crooks out there who are disguising their criminalprofits. FinCEN needs to computerize as much as possible to be able toidentify the really significant criminals and their activities." The question then becomes, at what point does it stop? ============================================================================= ARTICLE 2 AMERICA'S NUCLEAR SECRETS Article reprinted from Newsweek December 27, 1993 by The P/\NTHER/TRSI/UMF Experiments on human guinea pigs, unannounced nuclear tests, a pulsatingwasteland of lethal atomic debris-the legacy of cold-war secrecy and superpowercompetition is just how becoming clear. Scenes from the Nuclear theater of a long cold war. In the 1940s and'50s, when Americans still trusted their doctors and their government,researchers subjected hundreds of ill-informed people to doses of nuclearradiation, in order to study the effect on human beings. Later on, in twoexperiments on the West Coast, 131 prison inmates, many of them black,had their testicles irradiated. From 1963 on, the U.S. government conductedhundreds of unannounced nuclear tests. The Russians weren't fooled, butAmericans were. Washington last secret underground detonation occurredas recently as April 4, 1990. By the 1990s, America was awash in nuclear waste. Tons of plutoniumfrom arms factories and spent fuel from nuclear reactors were stored haphazardlyand unsafely, sometimes threatening plant workers and nearby residents.The public still has not been told the true dimensions of the toxic mess. Bits and pieces of this disturbing story have been leaking out for yearsin press articles, scientific studies and congressional hearings. But onlynow is the extent of America's nuclear secrets coming into focus. It isclear that the U.S. government behaved far more maliciously and recklesslythan most Americans ever suspected. The fact that Moscow's rival nuclearprogram was probably dirtier still, and even less humane, offers scantcomfort. Some things cannot be explained away, even by the imperatives of nationalsecurity. The most conspicuous agent of revelation so far is Energy SecretaryHazel O'Leary. Two weeks ago she blew the whistle on her own departmentand the rest of the government's nuclear establishment, by disclosing that,over a span of 45 years, the United States had set off 204 unannouncednuclear explosions and conducted radiation experiments on about 600 humanguinea pigs. The scientist who conducted those tests so long ago surelyhad rational reasons: the struggle with the Soviet Union, the fear of imminentnuclear war, the urgent need to unlock all the secrets of the atom, forpurposes both military and medical. But in the aftermath of the cold war,and measured against today's more stringent ethical and procedural standards,the science of the early nuclear age can seem almost barbaric. "Isaid, 'Who were these people [conducting experiments] and why did thishappen?" O'Leary said in an interview with NEWSWEEK. "The onlything I could think of was Nazi Germany." To date, O'Leary has told only part of the story, the tiny fractionthat has emerged from a 32 million-page mountain of secret documents waitingto be declassified. Other parts have been dug up recently by local newspapers,notably The Albuquerque Tribune in New Mexico, and Westword, a Denver weekly.The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, weighedin last week with the first conclusive evidence that the U.S. governmenthad conducted radioactive-warfare tests in the atmosphere. But informationis being pried out of the bureaucracy an inch at a time. O'Leary had tofight with the Pentagon through 17 drafts of disclosure documents in orderto declassify the amount of plutonium contained in stockpiles throughoutthe country (33.5 metric tons). She even had to battle her own staff torelease a report two weeks ago on the deteriorating storage facilitiesfor spent nuclear fuel. Many facts have been uncovered by Congress as well including a subcommitteechaired in 1986 by Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts. His report wasentitled "American Nuclear Guinea Pigs." After studying 31 experimentsdating back to 1945, Markey wrote that U.S. citizens "became nuclearcalibration devices for experiments run amok." He also charged: "Toomany of these experiments used human subjects that were captive audiencesor populations ... considered 'expendable': the elderly, prisoners, hospitalpatients, who might not have retained their full faculties for informedconsent." Starting in 1963, 131 inmates at two prisons in Oregon and Washingtonstate were recruited for experiments paid for by the Atomic Energy Commission,a predecessor of today's Department of Energy (DOE). Each volunteer waspaid about $200 and had to sign a consent form. "I hereby agree tosubmit to X-ray radiation of my scrotum and testes," said the formused in Oregon. The inmates were warned about the possibility of sterilityand radiation burns, but the Oregon form said nothing about a risk of testicularcancer. After the experiment the Oregon men were given vasectomies-"toavoid the possibility of contaminating the general population with irradiation-inducedmutants," wrote the late Dr. Carl Heller, who ran the tests. For thatreason, Roman Catholic inmates were not allowed to participate, Markey'sreport noted. The men were given varied doses of radiation as high as 600 roentgen(today the largest recommended dose is six roentgen for an entire year.)Those who received 15 roentgen or more became sterile temporarily. Thereis no evidence that any of them developed cancer as a result of the experiment.But none of the Washington prisoners has been tracked since the early 1970s:the inmates themselves didn't want continued medical scrutiny. In Oregon,where no follow-up tests were done either, some of the prisoners filedsuit in 1976 demanding medical treatment. Eventually the Oregon state Legislatureintervened, granting continued treatment to nine of the men and awardingthem with a cash payment. The nine men split a total of $2,215. Hot shots: Last month The Albuquerque Tribune published a series namingfive of 18 hospital patients who were given "tracer" injectionsof plutonium in a government sponsored study between 1945 and 1947. Manyof the patients were expected to die soon, but some cases didn't work outthat way. Elmer Allen, an impoverished 36-year-old railroad porter fromTexas, got a shot of plutonium in his injured leg. Three days later theleg was amputated above the knee and taken away by researchers. Allen didn'tdie for another 44 years, but long life was no blessing to him. His daughter,Elmerine Whitfield said he had seizures and was severely depressed. Hedrank too much. "I believe my father was aware something had beendone to him." said Whitfield. But she insisted he never gave informedconsent to the experiment. "I know he didn't understand plutonium,"she said. Scientists who worked in the dawn of the nuclear age defend the validityof the plutonium tests. "We should be extremely cautious about criticizingtheir work." says John Simpson, a retired astrophysicist who workedon health and safety issues as a group leader on the Manhattan Project,which developed the first atomic bomb. If research had not been done onhumans, he says, "radioactive dangers would be greater throughoutthe world today." Biophysicist Newell Stanard, an authority on the history of radiologicalresearch, says the plutonium tests were launched because several ManhattanProject workers in Los ALAMO, N.M. had been exposed to the material. Noone knew for sure how much damage the plutonium would do to them or howquickly and thoroughly it would be expelled from their bodies. "Therehad been a lot or work with animals that showed rates of fecal and urineexcretion of the plutonium, how much went to bone marrow and so on,"says Stannard. "But there was this big question: will it be the samein man? The Manhattan Project said we've got to do experiments in terminalpatients and see if the results are the same as in animals." Stannard says that 11 of the 18 tests were done in Rochester, N.Y. bya respected internist, Dr. Sam Bassett; the others were scattered aroundthe country. Were the patients fully informed? "I simply don't know,"says Stannard. "I do know that Sam Bassett was a very straightforward,honest guy. I'm sure he told the patients he was going to do something."But plutonium research was a top-secret subject in those days. "Ihave a feeling Bassett told people they were taking something for the wareffort," says Stannard. Many other tests conducted on humans were benign and were performedquite casually, without a lot of red tape. "The level of acceptableinformed consent has changed," says Dr. Merril Eisenbud, professoremeritus of environmental medicine at New York University Medical Center.He describes some of his own research. "Open-air [nuclear] weaponstesting left iodine in the milk worldwide," he says. "One ofmy experiments was to determine the significance in terms of the dose absorbedby a child's thyroid. We used to get the children to come over from a pediatricclinic with their moms. We'd explain what we were doing, sit each childdown and-using a scintillometer that didn't even touch him-measure radiationin the thyroid. We'd give the child a lollipop, and that was the end ofthat. Today you'd have to fill out so much paperwork that it would discouragepeople from participating in the test." In the 1940s and '50s, many doctors weren't in the habit of explainingthings to their patients. "Doctors weren't questioned," saysDr. Andrew Davis of Chicago, a frequent writer on radiation-health issues."When you combine that with radiation technology, born of secrecyin the name of military security, it becomes easier to understand-if notcondone-these experiments and accidents. Dr. Kildare could do no wrong." Death Spray: In reality, of course, some researchers did numerous wrongs,as they are now defined. According to the GAO report, radiation was deliberatelyreleased into the atmosphere in at least a dozen secret tests in New Mexico,Tennessee and Utah between 1948 and 1952. The tests were part of an effortto develop a radiological weapon-or to defend against one, if the Sovietsdeveloped a death spray. At about the same time, the Hanford Nuclear Facilityin Richland, Wash., was regularly showering its neighbors with radioactivity.A secret internal memo uncovered in 1986 described the infamous Green Runexperiments, in which plant managers deliberately released a huge cloudof radioactive iodine-131, to see how far downwind it could be traced.The could floated over Spokane and drifted all the way to the California-Oregonborder, carrying hundreds (or perhaps thousands) of times more radiationthan that emitted by the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania. Now that nuclear testing has ended, at least in the United States, thegovernment is left with a vast, pulsating landscape of atomic waste dumpsto clean up. The people who developed nuclear reactors and weapons wereno more prescient about future environmental hazards than they were abouthealth risks. The storage of spent fuel and other nuclear materials wasshockingly sloppy. "Every time you turn over a new document, there'sa $5 billion problem," says Dan Reicher, a special assistant to O'Leary. The DOE's nuclear-weapons complex, spread over 4,000 square miles in13 states, appears to be particularly hazardous. Steven Blush, a DOE safetyofficial who was forced out of his job last spring, wrote a lurid reportcharging that the bomb factories averaged three accidents a day in 1991and '92. Most of the mishaps were minor, but a few of them posed potentiallymajor health threats to factory workers and nearby residents, Blush charged. One of the most conspicuous problem plants is the DOE's weapons facilityat Rocky Flats, outside Denver. Starting in 1989, a federal grand jurycollected evidence about alleged violations of environmental law there.Early last year the grand jury tried to indict DOE officials and executivesof Rockwell International, a former operator of the plant, accusing themof participating in "an ongoing criminal enterprise" by ignoringenvironmental laws. The local U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, and instead announceda plea bargain with Rockwell, which agreed to pay a fine of $18.5 million-slightlyless than the annual performance bonus it received for successful stewardshipof the plant. The grand jurors continued to press their case, and whenthe story leaked to Westword, they found themselves under investigationfor violation of secrecy laws. Now the grand jurors are hoping to testifybefore Congress. "It's doubtful that you could find a bigger environmentalcriminal than the Department of Energy," charges their lawyer, JonathanTurley, an expert on environmental law at George Washington University."It hasn't changed with the new administration," he maintains. Morning after: O'Leary would dispute that. The secretary bucked herown bureaucracy by insisting that the DOE release a report on deterioratingstorage sites for spent nuclear fuel. Aides warned that disclosure couldcause liability problems. O'Leary insisted. "I want this done,"she said. But there's a lot more to do. "It's as though you had aparty every night for 45 years, and you never cleaned it up," saysThomas Grumbly, DOE assistant secretary for environmental restoration andwaste management. Grumbly is a worrier. He predicts that the figures currently quotedfor the total cost of the cleanup-from $200 billion to $300 billion-maynot even be close. "It could be a couple of times larger than that,"he says. He frets about the notorious storage tanks at Hanford, where somany different wastes have been dumped that no one knows exactly what kindof witches' brew is in them. "Every time the phone rings after 10o'clock at night, I think 'This is it we've had an event'," says Grumbly.Like his boss, he things the time has come for "throwing open theblinds" to shed some light on the nuclear-waste crisis. The government'scomplete disregard of the byproducts of its cold-war born nuclear obsessionhas left us with "the single largest environmental and health riskin the nation," he says. It may also be the last of America's nuclearsecrets-and perhaps the most dangerous of them all. A HUMAN HORROR STORY Plutonium: What doctors didn't tell Eda Charlton Eda Schultz Charlton was alone and sick when she visited the Universityof Rochester's Strong Memorial Hospital in the fall of 1945. A proteindeficiency had swollen her ankles and covered her body in a serious rash.Doctors also suspected a mild case of hepatitis. The 48 year old seamstresswas newly widowed-her husband had died suddenly a year earlier. Her onlyson was in the service. Physicians put her on a high protein, low saltdiet. They also made Charlton an unwitting subject in a grotesque governmentsponsored medical experiment. On Nov. 27, 1945, according to records unearthedby The Albuquerque Tribune, doctors at Stong working for the ManhattanProject injected her with plutonium-239 to study how quickly the body ridsitself of the radioactive substance. (The hospital never sanctioned theexperiments.) Between 1945 and 1947, she and most of the 17 other patientsin the secret program-11 of them in Rochester-received dosages of about.3 microcurie. That is about 43 times what is now regarded as the safelifetime limit. Charlton wouldn't learn of the official poisoning for another30 years. Family members say they suspected she was monitored during her routinecheckups over the years at Strong. The visits often turned into stays lastingseveral days-even when it was clear she wasn't all that ill. "Theyused to keep her in a section that was like a hotel," says her son,Fred Schultz. Once his mother said that doctors placed her in a sealedroom to check her body for radiation. Efforts to glean any informationwere always rebuffed. In the early 1970s, the family quizzed one doctorwho'd treated Charlton since 1950. "When I asked her about plutonium,she'd say, 'I don't know a thing about it'," recalled her daughter-in-law,Helen Schultz. Hospital officials say they informed Charlton and other living victimsof the experiment on behalf of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1974. TheSchultzes say they learned about it from a doctor at Strong five yearslater. Doctors claim Charlton suffered no health problems from the radiation.She died of a heart attack in 1983. But Fred Schultz, now 73, remains bitter."I was over there fighting the Germans who were conducting these horrificmedical experiments," he said. "At the same time my own countrywas conducting them on my mother." SINS OF A PARANOID AGE Cold War: Desperate times made for desperate-and dangerous-measures In 1949, WHEN MOST AMERICANS wanted nothing more than to "go tothe movies and drink Coke," as W. Averell Harriman once put it, theSoviets exploded a Nuclear bomb. The onset of the cold war came as a cruelsurprise. The United States had just won World War II. Was World War IIIaround the corner? By 1951, when the CIA received an intelligence tip thatseemed to indicate that the Russians were about to corner the world marketin LSD, anxiety about communism had become paranoia. The CIA was particularlyobsessed with mind control. At show trials in the East bloc, innocentswith glazed eyes were confessing to impossible crimes, while American POWsin the Korean War were reportedly being "brainwashed" by theChinese. Had the communists developed some of the new mind-bending drugsthat could be used as a mass weapon against the West? The LSD scare, like many intelligence tips in that era, turned out tobe bogus. But that didn't stop the CIA from taking steps to develop itsown mind-control program, code-named MKUltra. The technique that most intriguedthe agency was LSD, a new psychoactive drug that could induce hallucinations.Unfazed when one of the agency's own researchers jumped out a window afterexperimenting with LSD in 1953, the CIA hired prostitutes in GreenwichVillage, N.Y., and San Francisco to slip LSD doses to unsuspecting johns.CIA researchers dutifully recorded the results from behind two-way mirrors.Dozens of unwitting lowlifes went on wild trips, but the agency never didlearn how to control anyone's mind. The experiment was finally abandonedin 1963. The nuclear experiments that are now coming to light are just come ofthe examples of how far America went in the cause of combating global communism.In another phase of operation MKUltra, the CIA-seeking the perfect assassin-tried to create "guided animals." In one experiment, the agencywired up a cat (its tail was the antenna) that had a habit of wanderingoff the job and was eventually run over by a taxi. For years the Pentagonand the Atomic Energy Commission were conducting all manner of secret tests-fromreleasing clouds of radiation into the atmosphere in a determined attemptto build bigger and better bombs, to irradiating the testicles of prisoninmates in order to find our how much would cause sterility. As it turnedout, almost all the reports of Russian superiority in the cold war werehyped. When the development of the U-2 spy plane allowed overflights inthe mid-to late 1950s, it was discovered that the "bomber gap"and the "missile gap" were phony. The only gap was the otherway around: In 1961, the Pentagon had 98 missiles aimed at the Soviet Union,the Kremlin no more than 35 aimed at the United States. For all its cold-war glamour, the CIA was not a very effective espionageagency in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Though it had reasonable successoverthrowing left-leaning governments in the Third World, the agency utterlyfailed to penetrate the Kremlin (admittedly a difficult task against apolice state). Still, it did not serve top leaders to admit this to thepublic. In order to persuade lawmakers to pay for worthy causes like the MarshallPlan, it was sometimes necessary to make things "clearer than thetruth," said Dean Acheson, President Truman's secretary of state.If that meant scaring people, so be it. Certainly, the people were readyto be scared: families built fallout shelters, while children learned howto duck under their desks. Washington officials lied in part because they could get away with it.The press was cozier with policymakers in the 1950s, and lawmakers didn'treally want to know what the CIA was up to, as long as the cause was battlingthe Red Menace. Hungry for higher budgets, the Pentagon inflated the threatit faced. And over time, even the most cynical politicians began to believetheir own rhetoric. In the 1960 presidential campaign, John F. Kennedywas still warning about the missile gap. When his defense secretary, RobertMcNamara, publicly admitted that none existed, Kennedy privately chastisedhim for telling the truth. McNamara apologized-and promptly ordered a massivebuildup of America's nuclear arsenal. ============================================================================= ARTICLE 3 The Randy Weaver Case...Another Federal Fiasco! Reprinted from American Rifleman November 1993 by The P/\NTHER -TRZ-TRSI-UMF- Seeing his dog, Striker, shot to death by masked intruders clad in camouflage,Sammy Weaver, 14, fired back in fear for his life. The 4 ft, 11"-tallyoungster was hit in the arm, then shot in the back as he turned to runfor home. He died instantly, killed by an agent of the federal government.Cradling her 10 month old daughter in her arms, Vicki Weaver stood in thedoorway of her home, mourning her slain son, unaware that she herself hadonly seconds to live. In an instant a bullet tore into Vicki Weaver's face,blew through her jaw and severed her carotid artery. The bullet was firedfrom 200 yds. away by an agent of the federal government. What had the Weaver family done to bring FBI snipers and submachine-gun-totingU.S. Marshals to the woods around their cabin on Ruby Ridge in northernIdaho? Why did the government act as though the Weavers and forfeited theprotections guaranteed all Americans by the United States Constitution?Who made the decisions that led to their unjustified deaths and also tothe death of deputy U.S. Marshal William Degan? For the six men working near Weaver's plywood cabin on Ruby Ridge, Aug.21 1992, was another day on a job that had been going on more than 16 months.Their employer, the U.S. government, was spending $13,000 a week, and therehad been no end in sight to the work. The cabin-really a shack-was home to 44-year-old former Green BeretRandy Weaver and his family-wife, Vicki; son, Sammy; and daughters, Sara,Rachel and Elisheba. It was also home to their young friend, Kevin Harris.There were subsistence hunters, and tended a garden, putting up vegetables.A generator produced occasional electricity. They had no TV, no radio. This day there were some new men on the job site not far from the cabin-one,42-year-old William Degan, had been brought to northern Idaho on specialorders. He was to help plan a successful conclusion to the job. The men in the woods were dressed in their work clothes-camouflage commandooutfits complete with masks. They carried the tools of their trade-two-wayradios rigged for quiet operation, night vision equipment, semi-automatichandguns, fully automatic military rifles and at least one silenced HKsubmachine gun. One of the men was a medic, prepared to care for any casualties. The Weaver family had dogs. Somebody threw a rock to test their reaction.A golden retriever barked near the cabin and came running their way. Amission somebody in the Marshal Service had dubbed "Operation NorthernExposure" was about to end. The "op" had included use of jet reconnaissance overflightswith aerial photographic analysis by the Defense Mapping Agency, and placementof high-resolution video equipment recording activity by the Weaver familyfrom sites 1 1/2 miles away-160 hours worth of tape used. For nearly a year and a half, federal agents had roamed the area, pickinglocations for surveillance and for snipers. Degan belonged to the SpecialOperations Group, the Marshals' national SWAT team. The six on-site thisday were deputy U.S. Marshals. The target of all of this-and of a Federal law enforcement and prosecutioneffort that would eventually total approximately $3 million-was Randy Weaver.What kind of criminal was he to demand this kind of attention? Was he amajor drug dealer? Serial killer? Was he a terrorist bomber? No. On Oct. 24, 1989, Weaver sold two shotguns whose barrels arguablymeasured 1/4" less than the 18" length determined arbitrarilyby Congress to be legal. The H&R single-barrels 12-ga. and Remingtonpump were sold to a good friend who instructed Weaver to shorten the barrels.The "good friend" was an undercover informant working for theBureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (BATF), who later told reportershe was in it "mainly for the excitement." Eight months after he sold the shotguns, Weaver was approached by twoBATF agent with an offer-spy on the Aryan Nations, a white supremacisthate group headquartered in northern Idaho, or go to jail. Weaver refusedto become a government informer, and-six moths later-he was indicted onthe shotgun charge. On Jan. 17, 1991, as Weaver and his wife were driving to town for supplies,they encountered a pickup truck camper with its hood up, a man and a womanseeming to be in trouble. The Weavers stopped to offer their help. A hordeof federal agents piled out of the camper. A pistol was pressed againstWeaver's neck. Vicki Weaver was thrown to the slushy ground. Weaver was arraigned before a federal magistrate, who later admittedhe cited the wrong law. Out on bond, Weaver went back to his cabin. Accordingto friends who testified in court, he and his wife vowed not to have anymore dealings with the courts of the federal government. They would juststay on their mountain. A hearing was set on the shotgun matter for Federal Court in Moscow,Idaho. The government notified Weaver by letter that he was to appear March20, 1991. The actual hearing was held February 20-one month earlier. Theerror in dates was enough to give rise to a memo within the Marshal Servicesaying the case would be a washout. (Weaver did not show for the wrongdate, either.) U.S. Attorney Ron Howen went to the grand jury anyway, andWeaver was indicted for failure to appear. But why had the BATF picked Randy Weaver to set up as an informer? Hewas a man devoted to his family, a man with no criminal record, a veteranwho served his country with honor. It was Weaver's beliefs that made himan ideal target. His unorthodox religious and political views were faroutside mainstream America. He was a white separatist. And, Randy Weaverwas little, a nobody. Over the next 16 months, the feds painted Weaver as racist, as anti-semitic,as a criminal. But they had to entrap him into his only crime, alteringtwo guns. The media were unquestioning. In print and on TV and radio, Weaver'shome-the plywood shack he built himself-became a "mountain fortress,"and then "a bunker," and "a stronghold protected by a cacheof 15 weapons and ammunition capable of piercing armored personnel carriers." The common shotguns Weaver sold became the chosen "weapon of drugdealers and terrorists" of "gangster weapons" that "haveno sporting use." The media always added the universal out..."agentssaid." But there were no gangsters. There were no terrorist or drugdealers, just Weaver, the gun buyer and the government. It was all a lie. Hate-hype. People believed it, maybe even the agentswho planted the hate-hype began to believe it. It all ceased to matteron August 21, when Striker barked and sniffed out the agents spying onthe cabin-lives changed, lives ended. Nobody, except the people who were there, knows exactly what happenednext. There were several versions of the story. But some facts jibe. RandyWeaver's little boy, Sammy-a kid whose voice hadn't yet changed-and KevinHarris followed Striker. Harris and Weaver later said they thought thedog was chasing a deer. Harris carried a bolt-action hunting rifle. Theboy also had a gun. Without a warning a federal agent fired a burst into Striker, killinghim. (It came out in court later that there had been a plan to take thedog "out of the equation.") The boy, frightened, shot back, andwhen one of the agents fired another burst, Sammy lay dead. Kevin Harris shot deputy William Degan in the chest. He died a few momentslater. The shooting ended relatively quickly. The agents would claim Harrisfired first. Harris claimed he fired after the boy was shot. Agents toldthe media their men had been pinned down for eight hours. It was lie. The dog was dead. The boy was dead. Deputy Degan was dead. Two Americanfamilies had tragically lost loved-ones. During the night hours. RandyWeaver and Kevin Harris brought the little boy's body to a shed near thecabin and washed. Deputy Degan's shooting brought in the FBI. Soon, the Weaver's propertywas ringed by a huge force of FBI, BATF, U.S. Marshals, Idaho state policeand local law enforcement and Idaho National Guard. Among the federal lawenforcement commanders was Richard Rogers, the head of the FBI's hostagerescue team, which includes its snipers. On the flight out, he took anextraordinary step-he decided to alter radically the prescribed rules ofengagement of FBI sharpshooters. Normally, agents can only shoot when they are facing death or grievousharm. But the 11 snipers that were positioned around the Weaver cabin weregiven new orders: "If any adult in the compound is observed with aweapon after the surrender announcement is made, deadly force can and shouldbe employed to neutralize the individual." This meant Randy Weaver'swife would be fair game. It went on: "If any adult male is observedwith a weapon prior to the announcement, deadly force can and should beemployed if the shot can be taken without endangering the children."(Emphasis added.) In words reminiscent of hollow justifications used in Waco, Texas, federalspokesmen kept telling the media of their concern for the children. Infact, Gene Glenn, the agent in charge of the siege, told The New York Timeshe considered the kids to be hostages. Yet they'd already killed one child. The negotiators were not in place, and no effort had been made to contactthe Weavers, when Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris-armed-and 16 year old SaraWeaver left then cabin and moved to the shed where Sam's body lay. As the three reached the shed, an FBI sniper some 200 yds. away aimedat Weaver. He told the court he was aiming for the spine, just below theneck. He missed; shot Weaver in the back of the arm, the bullet exitingthrough the armpit. Sara later told Spokesman Review staff writer Jess Walter in a copyrightedstory: "I ran up to my dad and tried to shield him and pushed himtoward the house. If they were going to shoot someone, I was going to makethem shoot a kid." At the cabin, Vicki Weaver was waiting at the door, holding her infantdaughter, Elisheba. The sniper fired again. His bullet hit Vicki Weaver.She was dead before the baby hit the floor, miraculously unhurt. Harriswas hit by bullet fragments and bone from Vicki's skull. He was bleedingbadly. Randy Weaver, daughters Sara and 10 year old Rachel all saw theviolent death. Later, sniper Lon Horiuchi stated in court that killing Vicki Weaverhad been a mistake; that he was aiming for Kevin Harris. Defense attorneySpence asked him, "You wanted to kill him didn't you?" He answered,"Yes, sir." Sara Weaver recounted the night following her mother's death. Againstfrom reporter Jess Walter's story: "Elisheba cried during the night. She was saying, 'Mama, mama,mama.'...Dadwas crying and saying, 'I know baby. I know baby. Your Mama's gone..'" She told Walter that on Sunday, they tried to yell at federal agentsand get their attention, to tell them that her mother was dead. She saidthey got no response. Instead they would hear FBI negotiators. "They'dcome on real late at night and say, 'Come out and talk to us, Mrs. Weaver.How's the baby, Mrs Weaver,' in a real smart-alecky voice. Or they'd say'Good morning, Randall. How'd you sleep? We're having pancakes. What areyou having?'" The FBI later claimed it had no idea that its sniper had shot VickiWeaver. Yet, a New York Times stringer quoted FBI sources as saying theywere "using a listening device that allowed them to hear conversations,and even the baby's cries in the cabin." Another lie? On Thursday, August 27, radio newsman Paul Harvey used his noon broadcastto reach the Weavers, who he'd learned were regular listeners. Urging RandyWeaver to surrender, Harvey said, prophetically, "Randy, you'll havea much better chance with a jury of understanding homefolks than you couldever have with any kind of shoot-out with 200 frustrated lawmen." As part of their efforts to make contact with the Weavers, the FBI senta robot with a telephone to the cabin. But the robot also had a shotgunpointed at the door, so the Weavers feared that reaching for the phonecould result in death or injury. Somewhere in all of this, the FBI discovered the body of Sammy. Theytold the news media they didn't know he'd been killed. The siege began to unravel six days after Vicki Weaver had been killed.Her body remained in the kitchen of the cabin all that time. Sara crawledaround her to get food and water for her family. It was during this timethat Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris dictated their version of their storyto Sara. In this letter, Weaver accused his government of murdering hiswife. The news media, based on information from the feds, repeatedly reportedthat Vicki had been killed in "an exchange of gunfire" or ina "gun battle." More spin control. The only shots were two-from the government's sniper. Kevin Harris was the first person to come out. Sunday, August 30, badlywounded, he was rushed to a Spokane hospital where he was treated and chargedwith murder. A magistrate told him he was facing the death penalty. The rest of the family came out on the next day. The surrender was negotiatednot by the FBI-but by Bo Gritz, former Green Beret hero. All the lies and federal spin control over the story were about to end.The case was going to court. The 36 day trial took place in the U.S. District Court in Boise, withJudge Edward Lodge presiding. The jury of eight women and four men heardthe government put on 56 witnesses. The defense rested without callinga single witness, confident that the government had destroyed its own case.They were right. The jury deliberated for nearly three weeks, and found Harris not guiltyof murder or any other charges leveled against him. They found Weaver notguilty of eight federal felony counts. The judge had earlier thrown outtwo other counts. Weaver was found guilty of two counts: failing to appear in court andviolating his bail conditions. He was declared not guilty of the gun charge-theseed of all this misery. It was a bizarre trial, full of contradictions, with government witnessescountering each other's stories as to the events of August 21, and counteringthe events leading up to Vicki Weaver's death the next day. The question of who fired first-Harris or the Marshals-was key to thejury deciding on the murder charge against Harris. In the end they believedKevin Harris acted in self-defense. Earlier, the death penalty had beenruled out. The law the prosecution cited had been struck down by the U.S.Supreme Court two decades before. The government spent days going over the Weavers' religious views, tryingto establish they were racist and demonstrated a long-lived conspiracyto violently confront the government. The jury didn't believe it. Marshal Service witnesses told about a series of pre-seige scenariosto root Weaver out of his cabin. But when pressed by the defense, theysaid they never considered simply knocking on the door and arresting him. During the trial, the government admitted that the FBI had tamperedwith the evidence; that the crime scene photos given the defense were phonyreenactments. Physical evidence had been removed and replaced. The prosecutorknew and had failed to tell the defense. The prosecution also withheld documents that might have helped the defense.When ordered by the judge to produce them immediately, the FBI sent thematerial from Washington, D.C., via Fourth Class mail, which took two weeksto cross the country. For prosecutorial misconduct, the judge ordered thegovernment to pay part of the defense attorneys' fees, an action almostunheard of in a criminal case. Prosecutor Howen also was forced to apologizein open court. At the end of the trial, he collapsed in the middle of astatement, telling the judge, "I can't go on." Gerry Spence told the jury, "This is a murder case, but the peoplewho committed the murder have not been charged. The people who committedthe murder are not here in court." After the trial, Spence told the New York Times, "A jury todayhas said that you can't kill somebody just because you wear badges, thencover up those homicides by prosecuting the innocent." "Whatare we going to do now about the deaths of Vicki Weaver, a mother who waskilled with a baby in her arms, and Sammy Weaver, a boy who was shot inthe back?" "Here you had federal agents come into a little countyin northern Idaho, suspend state law and then say they had the right toeliminate anyone with a gun." "The crime he committed was notsawing off a shotgun. The crime he committed was refusing to go undercoverfor the BATF."-Garry Spence Spence has asked the Boundary County, Idaho, prosecutor to bring chargesagainst various federal agents. Should that happen, lingering questionsabout the Weaver case finally may be answered. Should that happen, lingeringquestions about the Weaver case finally may be answered. Should that happenanother jury undoubtedly will serve notice to those who have forgottenthat the United States government is supposed to serve its citizen, notentrap them, not defame them, not falsify evidence against them and absolutelynot kill their children. ============================================================================= ARTICLE 4 FIRE OFFICER'S GUIDE TO DISASTER CONTROL (CHAPTER 13 ONLY) William M.

The Great Los Angeles Air Raid ofFebruary 26, 1942, began at 2:25 A.M. when the U.S. Army announced theapproach of hostile aircraft and the city's air raid warning system wentinto effect for the first time in World War II. "Suddenly the nightwas rent by sirens. Searchlights began to sweep the sky. Minutes latergun crews at Army forts along the coast line began snapping on their lights...The din continued for two hours. Finally the guns fell silent. The enemy,evidently, had been routed. Los Angeles began to taste the exhilarationof its first military victory." WHAT IS WAR? "War is a man-mad disaster. Earthquakes and floods happen to mankind,but man makes war himself." War is a struggle in which two or morelarge groups of people try to destroy or conquer each other. There are"hot" wars and there are "cold" wars. When overt actsof aggression involving force are employed, it is a "hot" war,and there was a time in history when such wars were actually declared,but not in the past half-century. However, the United States in each decadesince World War II has found itself involved in at least limited militaryactions. Since the 1940s there have been the Korean "police"action in the 1950s, the Vietnam conflict in the 1960s and 1970s, the Panamainvasion, and many other incidents arising showing the possibility of theU.S. becoming involved in another "World" war. Guard Against Complacency It is easy for those of us in North America to consider the possibilityof enemy attack as being quite remote. While it is true that this continenthas not been visited with the death and destruction accompanying past wars,we have found in each generation that wars are all to common and couldindeed at some future date involve our country. Certainly many portionsof North America are within easy range of enemy nuclear submarines andwe could at the least expected time be suddenly involved in a conflict. The Persian Gulf War served as an example of how quickly the UnitedStates can find itself in military conflict. Hence, there is always a needto guard against the complacency that has evolved as our country has enjoyedrelative insulation from previous wars. THE UFO THREAT-A FACT In this chapter we will now turn our attention to the very real threatposed by Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), whether they exist or not.The well-documented and highly publicized War of the Worlds radio dramaby Orson Welles shows how even a perceived existence to alien creaturescan cause very real disaster-like conditions and panic among a given populace.In addition, if the apparent visits by alien beings and their space vehiclesshould pose any type of threat, it will as always be the fire service thatis called upon to provide the first line of life-saving defense and disastermitigation. On April 25, 1991, radio station KSHE in St. Louis, Missouri, was fined$25,000 by the Federal Communications Commission for broadcasting a mockwarning of a nuclear attack during the Persian Gulf War. The seriousnesswith which the FCC treated this case is indicative of the very real panicthat can be created from even illusionary or fictional phenomena. Certainlyif these unexplainable events become more prevalent, the possibility ofpanic could be even greater: and again, the fire department will be theagency called upon to handle the situation. (35) Hence, as we near theyear 2000 and move beyond, any comprehensive disaster plan should addressthe potential for panic and other deleterious effects that might befalla populated area when unexplainable phenomena occur. We will see, as wecontinue our discussion in this chapter, that widespread blackouts, communicationdisruptions, and other potentially disastrous conditions have been linkeddirectly to UFO sightings. Hence, fire service leaders who want to ensurethat their disaster planning is complete will not neglect an appendix tooutline those things that could be done in preparation for the occurrenceof such phenomena. Throughout this book, many of the references to actual events are basedon the experiences of both of the authors. However, in this area of UFOsand their potential, we are relying largely on the research and experiencesof Charles Bahme. Chuck has made a considerable study of this subject andis acquiring many publications and VCR tapes to augment his library onthis and related phenomena. His interest in UFOs was greatly heightenedwhen Congress in 1969 adopted a law (14 CFR Ch. V Part 1211 - ExtraterrestrialExposure) which gave the NASA Administrator the arbitrary discretion toquarantine under armed guard any object, person, or other form of lifewhich has been extraterrestrially exposed. The very fact that our congressmenbelieved there was a necessity for such drastic authority made Chuck wonderif they had only our astronauts in mind when they adopted it. Could itbe applied to anyone who has had a UFO encounter? Whether it has or notis not likely to be a topic for public dissemination. UFO Discussion-Why Now? The subject of UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) was not included inprevious editions of this book. The first edition was the Handbook of DisasterControl which Chuck personally published in 1952 following his releasefrom active naval duty in the Korean War. Although his services in theconflict as Security Coordinator for the Chief of Naval Operations involvedthe creation of a worldwide disaster control organization for the protectionof the physical properties of the Navy, it must be admitted that the directivesapproved for this new organization did not reflect any significant concernfor a flying saucer threat to its shore establishment. That was in the1950s. Now that we are in the 1990s it is doubtful that the UFO potentialwould be brushed off so lightly by our military security forces. This changeof attitude was evidenced as far back as December 24, 1959, when the InspectorGeneral of the Air Force issued the following Operations and Training Order:"Unidentified Flying Objects-sometimes treated lightly by the pressand referred to as 'Flying Saucers'-must be rapidly and accurately identifiedas serious Air Force business..." (36) There is no uncertainty about the reality of the war between nationson our planet and the disastrous effects of military actions. The 200 sortiesflown every hour against Iraq in the Persian Gulf provided ample evidenceof global war's destructive power. On the other hand, there are many personswho may believe that a discussion of the theoretical harm that could becaused by a real or imaginary invasion of UFOs would be "far out!"But this is not so for the thousands of witnesses of unexplained aerialphenomena. To them it is also serious business. Chuck's interest in UFOs commenced during the early morning hours ofAugust 26, 1942, while he was roller skating from his house to the nearestfire station a few blocks away: the wail of sirens had signaled his recallto fire duty, and with the stringent blackout orders in effect, drivingwas not wise: besides, it was much more exciting to be out in the openwhere he could see the spectacular aerial "fireworks" that filledthe heavens all around him. Few residents of the U.S. had ever experienceda real or imaginary invasion of UFOs like that which occurred in what hasbecome known as "The Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942." The Armyannounced the approach of hostile aircraft and the city's air raid warningsystem went into effect for the first time in World War II. The defenseto this "attack" is described in dramatic terms in the openingparagraph of this chapter. But what enemy had been routed? No one ever knew. All the fire fighterssaw in the sky were the 15 or 20 moving "things" which seemedto change course at great speed apparently unaffected by the flak frombursting shells all around them. Rumors that one had been shot down werenever verified, nor was the explanation that these zig-zagging invaderswere weather balloons ever taken seriously. In any event, for Chuck, thatunforgettable episode aroused a continuing interest in UFOs, rivaling hisprofessional fields of law and fire protection. The fact that he subsequentlywas a member of a group whose sighting of a flight of UFOs was authenticatedby airport radar helped to sustain that interest. UFO Background Information With no intention of trying to prove or disprove the authenticity ofthe numerous UFO encounters often related by very credible witnesses includingairline and military pilots, astronauts, police officers, fire fighters,members of Congress, and even a U.S. President, the balance of this chapterwill present a brief history and nature of UFOs and their alleged occupants:their propulsion origin, and possible motives for continuing reconnaissance. A quick look at some of the classic accounts of encounters documentedin numerous foreign and U.S. publications might help us judge the magnitudeof their threat, if any, to social stability, and, if deemed desirable,propose a fire service plan for coping with some of the conceivable catastrophiceffects that UFOs could produce on cities and densely populated areas. For readers who already have made up their minds that there is no suchthing as a UFO notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence to the contrary,it should be pointed out that there is circumstantial evidence that disastrouseffects have already been attributed to UFO activity in more than one nation,including the United States. UFOs-What Are They? William Shakespeare put a fitting observation in the mouth of Hamlet,the Prince of Denmark, that went like this: "There are more thingsin heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy."Whether Hamlet was referring to those strange lights or objects that appearin the sky or near the ground and have no known cause, we will never know,but the World Book Encyclopedia defines such things as UFOs. (37) Several theories have been propounded as to what they might be. Somescientists believe that they are of extraterrestrial origin-coming fromother planets. Military officers conjecture that they might be alien aircraft.Some attribute them all to natural causes, such as meteors, comets, sundogs, light reflections, marsh gas, ball lighting, even though they mustadmit that scientists cannot explain all UFO reports in that manner. Stillothers are inclined to believe that they may be forms from other dimensionswhich can materialize and dematerialize at will perhaps by making a wavelengthor frequency transition so as to become invisible to humans. Some believethey are time travelers from the future. UFO Classification System Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Northern University Professor Emeritus of Astronomyand an advisor to the Air Force's Blue Book Project, adopted a very simpleclassification system based solely upon the manner of observation: 1. Nocturnal lights 2. Daylight disks 3. Close encounters (day or night)4. Radar readings. He concluded that this system tells us nothing about the nature of theUFOs, but can suggest a means for gathering data.(38) He found that whilea large number of such reports were readily identifiable by trained investigatorsas misconceptions of known objects or events, a small residue (about 1,000)were not. These came from credible witnesses from such widely separatedplaces as Canada, Australia, South America, and Antarctica. He concludeswith: "Although I know of no hypothesis that adequately covers themountainous evidence, this should not and must not deter us from followingthe advice of Schroedinger: to be curious, capable of being astonished,and eager to find out." (39) Dr. Hynek has an excellence, well-illustratedarticle on UFOs in a 1982 book which gives a detailed history of the UFOsightings, together with the reports of some well-known people who madethem, including President Jimmy Carter while governor of Georgia. (40) Shapes of UFOs Witnesses have described the shapes of UFOs as anything varying froma sphere to a boomerang. Some have resembled flying saucers with a lid:others a glowing tube: some as semi-spherical with colored apertures: somewith reddish-orange glows, or fire-like or sparking discharges. Incrediblespeed and maneuverabilities not attainable by aircraft of any kind arecommonly observed. Many of the books and articles in Appendix H have excellentphotographs of these unexplained visitors-photos that have been checkedby experts for their authenticity. History of UFOs For hundreds of years mysterious objects in the sky and strange movinglights have been reported by many people, including the military pilotsin World War II who called them foo fighters. ("Where there's Foo,there's Fire"). In the middle of the 1900s flying saucers were increasinglyobserved in the United States and other countries. Scientists at the Universityof Colorado hired by the Air Force from 1966 to 1968 to study this typeof aerial phenomena could explain most of the UFO reports as a star (Venus),meteor, planet, balloon, rocket, artificial satellite, etc. Sometimes atmosphericconditions, aircraft exhaust trails, or unusual lighting conditions mayproduce optical illusions that observers thought were UFOs. After investigatingmore than 12,000 reports, the U.S. Air Force was unable to explain wherethe unexplained UFOs come from, but apparently concluded that the nationalsecurity was not threatened by them. (41) The emphasis of the university'steam headed by Edward U. Condon, seemed to be more concerned with the establishmentof the emotional stability or instability of those who reported the sightingsthan with other evidence. Psychiatrists have examined the witnesses who claimed to have encounteredUFOs and even been taken aboard their craft, such as the two shipyard workersin Mississippi, and found that they are not unbalanced people. (42) "They'renot crackpots. There was definitely something here that was not terrestrial."(43) Dr. J. Allen Hynek agreed, and added, "Where they are coming fromand why they are here is a matter of conjecture, but the fact that theywere here on this planet is beyond a reasonable doubt." (44) The Air Force, after 20 years of being deluged with UFO sightings andspending millions of dollars on their investigation, decided to drop theinquiry business and turned the project over to a Kensington, Maryland,group called NICAP (National Investigation Committee on Aerial Administration)with part of the task of trying to run UFO sighting reports, includingmany by its own Apollo and Skylab astronauts. By 1974 over a score of astronautssaw and photographed UFOs during their flights beyond the earth's atmosphere. Early in the Apollo II mission, which culminated in the moon walk, astronautsNeil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins reported sightings ofwhat seemed to be a UFO during the first half of their flight to the lunarsurface. There were many more sightings by U.S. and Soviet Astronauts.On November 11, 1966, Gemini XII Astronauts Jim Lovell and Edwin Aldrinsaid that they saw four UFOs linked together, and on October 12, 1964,three Russian astronauts aboard Voskod reported that they were surroundedby a "formation of fast-moving disc-shaped objects." (45) UFO Organizations In addition to NICAP, some of the other organizations that study UFOphenomena are MUFON (Mutual UFO Networks), CAUS (Citizens Against UFO Secrecy),GSW (Ground Saucer Watch), CUFOS (the Center for UFO Studies), and APRO(Aerial Phenomena Research Organization), an Arizona nonprofit scientificand educational organization, founded in 1952. (46) Why the Secrecy? In their book UFOs Over America, authors Jim and Carol Lorenzo chargethat the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) has been closely involved inthe collection and suppression of UFO information. "Witnesses to thephenomena have been bribed, coerced, and threatened by the CIA, who wantedvaluable evidence given to them alone." (47) One reason given is thatmilitary intelligence may view the UFOs as a tool of either a known orunknown potential enemy. "If these vehicles prove evasive and surreptitious,all the more reason to suspect them...the probability looms large thatthe minds behind these vehicles may well be gathering intelligence of theirown." (48) Another reason for secrecy may lie in the hope of obtaining knowledgerelating to advanced propulsion methods and anti-gravity systems beforeother potential enemies on earth may acquire it. Hence, though many nationsare secretly investigating UFOs, they are reluctant to share their findings.Robert Lofton, in his book Identified Flying Saucers, claims that the AirForce became the "goat" in the effort of the CIA to debunk manysightings by pilots, radar technicians, and reliable civilian observers.He thinks that the suppression of information about how dangerous UFOscan be is wrong. After citing a case where a child was burned over 50 to60 percent of her body by a low flying UFO and then taken to an Air Forcehospital, no one would explain why her clothes were not burned at the sametime. He also describes another burn case in New Mexico and another manwho recently received a sledge-hammer like blow that knocked him unconsciousby the force field of a 100-foot diameter UFO. "The public ought tobe told the danger! . . . Nothing helps rumors and panic more than ignorance."(49) Major Donald Kehoe describes in his book Aliens from Space, The RealStory of Unidentified Flying Objects the difficulties he had in 1957 intrying to get the truth from government agencies after he was directorof NICAP, the world's largest UFO research organization with over 30 subcommitteesin the U.S. and abroad. (50) According to some UFOlogists the attempts at cover-up by the CIA extendto destruction of evidence that it could not confiscate. Apparently someof our nation's important leaders have been denied access to some UFO secretsin the possession of an agency of the United States, the very existenceof which is classified above top secret. (51) Senator Barry Goldwater,a retired Air Force Reserve Brigadier General and pilot with many decadesof flying experience, was quoted as saying "I certainly believe inaliens in space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelingsthat they have advanced beyond our mental capabilities." He said hewas refused permission to check the Air Force files on UFOs and added."I think some highly secret government UFO investigations are goingon that we don't know about-and probably never will unless the Air Forcediscloses them." (52) He said that he put faith in the reports ofthe Air Force, Navy, and commercial pilots who reported instances wherea UFO would fly near them- right off their plane's wing-and then just zoomaway at incredible speeds. "I remember the case in Georgia in the1950s of a National Guard plane going after a UFO and never returning.And I recall the case in Franklin, Kentucky, when four military planesinvestigated a UFO. One of them exploded in midair and no one knows why."(53) Unleashed by the policy of Glasnost (greater openness) the Soviet mediafelt free to include accounts of UFO sightings. A Tass report of October10, 1989, reported a large shiny ball or disk hovering over a Voronezhpark; residents saw the UFO land and three creatures similar to human beingsemerged, accompanied by a robot. (54) Apparently the Russians felt no need to suppress this report which waspoked fun at in Newsweek and Time magazines (55) but not in U.S. News andWorld Report: "A scant few decades ago, both the U.S. government andthe media treated flying objects as no laughing matter-which even Congresslooked into. In 1966 Representative Ford responded to a rash of sightingsin his home state of Michigan by calling for, and getting, a House hearingon UFOs." (56) UFO Missions Many reasons have been advanced for the purpose of the UFOs visits toour planet. Although some of the persons who apparently have been the subjectsof genetic investigation, such as the family of Whitley Streiber may notagree, the majority of those who have studied possible UFO visitors feelthat they are friendly. Mr. Streiber described his experience as terrifying,and believes that these "little figures with eyes that seem to stareinto the deepest core of being are asking for something. Whatever it is,it is more than simple information. The goal does not seem to be a sortof clear and open exchange that we might expect; whatever may be surfacing,it wants far more than that. It seems to me that it seeks the very depthof soul; it seeks communion." (57) From the thousands of reports he has studied, William Spaulding, aerospaceengineer and head of the Arizona-based Ground Saucer Watch, believes thata pattern indicates that UFOs are here on a surveillance mission; the factthat a majority of sightings occur around our military installations, researchand development areas leads to the conclusion that a methodical study isbeing made of the earth and its defensive and offensive capabilities. "Thephenomena is not unlike our own space explorations:scout ship survey: soilsamples: landing." (58) In his book Incident at Exeter. John Fuller discusses the seeminglyaffinity of UFOs for electrical power lines in the northeastern part ofthe United States. In a later section of this chapter dealing with theeffects of UFOs on our terrestrial activities, we will see how this affinitymay have been responsible for causing 36 million people to lose power overan area of 8,000 square miles. (59) Because of our recent adventures into space, there are some who speculatethat UFOs are more concerned with what we will do there, than in settlinghere. In any event, the Air Force's official publication (issued by theGovernment Printing Office 1968) called Flying Objects says that "NoUFO has been determined to represent a threat to our national security."That conclusion, however should not rule out less disastrous consequencesthan the overthrow of our government. ADVERSE POTENTIAL OF UFOS Regardless of its past evaluations, the Air Force could be wrong abouta number of things. "It can't even guess within a couple of billiondollars what one of its planes is going to cost: maybe, despite skepticismof the scientists and other investigators, the UFOs sent from other planetsdo exist and have visited earth." (60) And maybe they have exhibitedsome destructive effects, whether or not intentionally in ever instance,which we need to consider when drafting a plan for coping with an emergencysituation where UFOs are involved. Some of these documented effects areas follows. UFO Hazards The two principal hazards noted with relation to UFOs have been attributedto powerful electrical fields which they can project in a general populaceor individual contacts. Force Field Impact The disruption of air and ground travel has often been reported in thepresence of UFOs. The ignition systems of auto and aircraft engines haveapparently been affected by energized force fields to such an extent asto stop their operation: the headlights and radios have also ceased tofunction. Here are a couple of examples. In Buenos Aires, on March 29,1978, "A strange force shut off their engine and headlights of theirCitroen CG, lifted it 15 feet off the road, then set it down a minute laterand 75 miles to the north." The driver had noticed a yellow and violetlight shining in his rear view mirror while driving the last leg of a longstock car race, and he realized that it was approaching too fast to bea competitor. A month later a Colombian bank manager and a navy officerhad their car headlights go off when buzzed by a UFO, with the navy mansuffering temporary paralysis. Other South American countries in whichsimilar actions were reported around that time included Argentina, Chile,Peru, and Uruguay. (61) These effects have also been noted to influence the controls and instrumentsof aircraft, e.g., the pilot of a Piper PH-24 reported that his controlsbecame inoperable when he was approached by three disk-shaped objects,10 to 12 feet in diameter, over Mexico City on May 3, 1975. (62) Similarcases have been reported by military pilots, illustrated by the classiccase of the near mid-air collision of an army helicopter with a UFO onOctober 18, 1973, over Ohio, where not only did both the UHF and VHF radiowavelengths go dead temporarily, but the downward movement of the helicopterwith its four occupants was levitated upward by a green beam from the UFOin time to prevent its crash into the ground. (63) Communications Disruption In addition to the impedance of radio transmissions and reception, suchas that described in the preceding incident, telephone interference hasoccurred, illustrated by the chagrin of President Lyndon Johnson in havinghis conversation from the Texas White House cut off while talking to assistantsin Washington, D.C. (64) The ability to render inoperable all electronicforms of communications, including those that control the launching ofdefense weapons systems, has been considered within the range of UFO capability.Whether this could extend to the erasing of recorded computer data suchas bank records, personnel data, FBI, CIA, and NSA files, along with criticalinformation of every kind, is not beyond the realm of possibility. Regional Power Blackouts It has long been suspected that UFOs have the capability of blackingout a city, state, or many states by exerting a force field sufficientto overload the circuits of public and private utility installations. "Fewthings are more disturbing than to be plunged into pitch darkness withoutwarning: it is dangerous for masses of people. It paralyzes cities, blockshighways, stops trains, leaves elevators suspended between floors. In generalit simply plays hell with the modern way of life." (65) You wouldthink that the power companies would have achieved sufficient reliabilityin their high tech systems that a mass failure such as that which blackedout New York and New England in 1965 would never happen-but it did. Although,as we have mentioned before, it was known that UFO activity was associatedwith disturbances with compasses, instruments, ignition systems, radios,etc., it was inconceivable that it could also interfere with generationand disturbance of electrical power. Such a connection was also inferredin November 1953, when a glowing red object went over a residential areaof New Haven, Connecticut, causing lights to dim out on both sides of theobject's path and them come on when it went out of sight. Power failures were also reported in association with UFOs in Brazilin 1957 to 1959, Rome, Italy, in 1958: and Mexico in 1965. Likewise, inUberlandia, where the power station operators promptly closed the circuitswhen the UFO apparently caused them to open, it did no good, and they wereunable to restore the power until the UFO departed. "The Granddaddy of all blackouts to date was the stygian blanketthat fell over 30 million people in the northeastern corner of the U.S.during the early evening rush hour period on November 9, 1965." (66)Relay services that were supposed to automatically transfer the load incase of failure in one area to an alternate source malfunctioned. Militarycommunications relying on public power without alternate backup systemsalso failed, but communications were operable to make a quick public announcementthat there was no military emergency. Though it was largely over by thenext morning, the official explanation about a malfunctioning small devicein a Canadian hydroelectric generating plant never accounted for the failureof millions of dollars worth of electronic devices to shift the load whenthe breakdown occurred. Fireballs Over Syracuse-The Blackout Connection Airplane pilots reported that UFOs were being chased across Pennsylvaniaabout 4:30 P.M., and electronics and construction engineers about 5:30P.M., just prior to the Great Blackout. A veteran flight instructor whohad been flying over Syracuse on a training flight say a glowing globeover the power lines leading the Niagara Falls generating plant. Hundredsof others saw the glowing object in the sky on the night of the big powerfailure. That was on November 9th. On December 2nd, about 700,000 persons inTexas, New Mexico, and Mexico also had their power fail. It was said tohave originated in a regular failure in El Paso: then on December 5th,three nights later, 40,000 homes plus military installations in the areaof East Texas were also blacked out-overloaded! Missile grounds (WhiteSands), Fort Bliss, Holloman Air Force Base, and numerous airports wereall blacked out (with no emergency power backup), and this was when PresidentJohnson's telephone call to the White House in Washington D.C. was cutoff. In response to his request for an explanation, President Johnson wastold that his calls were fed into a cable system that went dead when thesurge of power caused by the El Paso regulator blow-up hit it, and thebackup batteries didn't work. Though it may be debatable whether the abovecases of electrical transmission failure were merely coincidences withUFO activity, an incident on April 18, 1962, involving a UFO that had beentracked from New York, through Kansas to Eureka, Utah, was well documented.The Air Force spokesman admitted that the object had landed, and duringthe 42 minutes that it was on the ground near the power station there wasno power, but it was restored when the UFO left. The object was pursuedby jet interceptors summoned from Phoenix and Stead Field in Reno untilit exploded over the Mesquite Range in Nevada in a brilliant glare thatwas visible over five states. (67) UFOs-The Panic Hazard The second major disastrous effect that UFO activity, real or imagined,can have on the populace, is the creation of fear, panic, flight, and allkinds of irrational behavior. We have mentioned already the rather well-documentedcase of hysterical contagion and mass hysteria created by War of the Worlds,the radio drama by Orson Welles about an invasion of Martians. It was broadcaston Halloween of 1938 during the period of the invasions of Germany intoAustria and Japan into China. "The drama, realistically presentedin the form of news bulletins and interviews concerning an alien spaceshiplanding in New Jersey, resulted in many kinds of hysterical actions, includingthousands of panic-stricken phone calls, wildly fleeing automobiles, andimpromptu shot gun brigades." (68) Though most persons reporting UFOs do not interpret them as personalthreats, it is possible that some of the large volume of reports may beattributable to hysterical contagion. In any case, one of the reasons oftencited for the tight secrecy on government UFO research findings is theneed to prevent the possible panic that a revelation of the truth mightarouse. Rumors that people were being abducted, dematerialized, burned,made radioactive, rounded up and impounded, liquidated with ray guns andlasers or shipped off to Mars or Venus might well give rise to fear-fearof the unknown. Hysteria could cause frightened persons to imagine thattheir water was poisoned, the air contaminated with undetectable but lethalaerosols or nerve gases. With hundreds of UFO squadrons zooming acrossthe landscape from California to New York, Toronto to Mexico City, communicationsdisrupted, widespread power failures, airports and railroads paralyzed,highways turned into giant parking lots of immobilized vehicles full ofterrified motorists, the problem of restoring order and sanity would bea tremendous challenge to all of the emergency services, assuming theirpersonnel would remain calm, detached, and able to resist the human impulseto put the safety and well being of their own families ahead of the public's.To make matters worse, some of the more excitable gun owners might be temptedto rush out Rambo fashion, and in utter disregard of the damage that fallingbullets might cause innocent residents below their fallout, start firingat the evasive objects regardless of the range. Personal Hazards-Physiological The force field affects on the physical environment communication, transportation,illumination, and computerized data storage-have already been considered.We might have added that some physical effects have been observed at locationswhere UFOs have landed-circular patterns of crops destroyed by heat orradiation and baking or sterilization of the soil at the site. On a more practical basis there may be grounds for concern that morethan just the environment can be adversely affected by UFO actions. Whilepursuing UFOs, military aircraft have disappeared in mid-air, exploded,and suffered harassment. Persons on the ground have sustained serious burns,paralysis, and "blows" from a force field, radiated emissions,or rays and beams that have been described like that of a "stun-gun"(69) In 1980, three witnesses saw a red ball of light hovering above housesin Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, when suddenly a bolt of blue light shot downand two houses burst into flames. (70) An Indiana man saw a bright lightflash pass his window: the power went off in his house so he went outsideto investigate and found a brilliantly lit object hovering above him: whenhe started to walk toward it his body commenced to tingle and he was unableto move until the object disappeared. A similar tingling sensation sweptover another man in Lynn, Massachusetts, one night when he approached adomed object with a red glowing cone rising from a parking lot. He toowas immobile until the object moved out of sight. Some believe that evenanimals may be at risk by UFOs: in trying to account for the death of 15ponies, the leader of an investigative team believed they were crushedby the anti-gravity field of a flying saucer as it took off.(71) Thus, UFOs may not only have the power to control some of our militaryand industrial establishment's highly technical scientific hardware, theymay also possess the ability to impose pain and control over people whoattempt to attack them, even to the extent of "liquidating" themin one way or another. UFOS-EMERGENCY ACTION In view of the fact that many UFOlogists believe that we are fast approachinga time when overt landings of UFOs will become less remarkable, and inthe absence of our knowing whether their visits are friendly or hostile,it would not be remiss to give some thought to the part that fire departmentsmight play in the event of the unexpected arrival of UFOs in their communities.For example, what would be your course of action as an incident commanderat the scene of a school ground where a UFO has crashed into the boilerroom, rupturing a fuel line, and ignition has occurred in the spillingoil, endangering the occupants of the craft who are trapped in the wreckage?If your rescue attempts are successful, and two of the five small aliencreatures are injured but still alive, how do you dispose of the dead andtreat the survivors? How would the presence of children on the school groundsaffect your actions? What persons and agencies would be notified? The authors have never read any advice on these matters. The followingadmonition was printed on the inside from jacket of Frank Edward's bookon flying saucers: WARNING "Near approaches of UFOs can be harmful to human beings. Do notstand under a UFO that is hovering at low altitude. Do not touch or attemptto touch a UFO that has landed. In either case the safe thing to do isto get away from there very quickly and let the military take over. Thereis a possibility of radiation danger and there are known cases where personshave been burned by rays emanating from UFOs. Don't take chances with UFOs!" In view of the federal law (cited earlier) empowering NASA's administratorto impound, without a hearing, anyone who touches a UFO or its occupants,it would be inadvisable to make personal contact unless you are willingto submit to NASA's quarantine requirements, should the law be invoked. Besides the possible physical effects of approaching a UFO, e.g., burns,radiation, etc., there may be psychological effects produced by force fieldsthat could induce a hypnotic states in the viewer, loss of consciousness,memory relapse, and submission to the occupants. Jacques Valle, authorof The Invisible College cautions that we should consider psychic effects,such as space-time distortions experienced by percipients of craft-likedevices which appear to fade away-dematerialize-and then reappear: of alien,strange voices or thoughts that may effect involuntary changes in the mannerin which witnesses may react in such circumstances. (72) Perhaps the above warning of Edwards and Vallee are a little too cautiousand apprehensive to adopt as a general pattern of conduct in every situation.In the absence of overt acts indicating hostility, there may be no dangerin approaching a landing (or landed) UFO with a positive, solicitous attitudeof wanting to be of service. This nonaggressive mental state may be telepathicallysensed by those aboard or emerging from the craft: a form of non vocalcommunication is a possibility. It goes without saying that any displayof firearms or other weapons on your part could be construed as unfriendlyand likely to thwart your intention of conveying a helpful attitude. In a best case scenario, you may be able to obtain guidance as to theappropriate actions to take, whether of a life-saving nature, e.g., inquelling a fire, abating a spill, and of preservation of property, or evenin the reduction of apprehension on the part of your response team andthe spectators. In a less optimistic scenario, you may have engine trouble upon approachingthe scene, and radio contact could be lost with your dispatcher. If atnight, your headlights could go out, the city could be blacked out, andyour portable generators may malfunction when you attempt to use them forfans and portable lights. It would certainly be an inopportune time foryour comrades to announce that they had decided to take their pensions,effective immediately. In any event, the incident could provide invaluable experience for furthertraining in coping with rare and difficult emergencies. Whatever "inside"information you are able to pass along to your fellow officers and citizensof the world might help to alleviate unreasonable fear, so that there wouldbe less likelihood that we would ever again experience the panic and hysteriathat was created by War of the Worlds a half century ago. Truth is thebest cure for the unknown. A list of some of the available books on UnidentifiedFlying Objects (UFOs) is found in Appendix H. CONCLUSION Some fire chiefs have little confidence in disaster plans, especiallythose dealing with UFOs or enemy attack. If you develop a plan that setsforth your responsibilities, resources, organizations, supplies, information,telephone numbers, and special data that will be useful in obtaining helpand fulfilling your role in disaster control, commit it to an electronicmedium, a computer with a capability for continuous updating through modernword processing. Bring it forth when the need requires. With a good plan,good leadership, and adequate resources, you may save many lives in anydisaster, including attack from possible enemies.

A group of about 100 protested in the 98 degree heat of July 5th andwere led by a relatively new organization called "The Right to Know,"organized for the sole purpose of making the voices of "reason"heard within the halls of Congress. Directed by Ed Komarek of Thomasville,Georgia, the group met directly across the street from the White Housein a neighboring park to listen to speeches from luminaries in the field,including the likes of Fate magazine columnist and UFO Universe ContributingEditor Antonio Huneeus, long time UFO research veteran Larry Bry. UFOsconverged on White House during flap of 1952, though it did nothing toconvince the Pentagon that they should "come clean" on a matterof a massive cover-up. This is an office photo of the radar screen at WashingtonInternational Airport showing the objects as they converge on their target. Bry, who has waged a one-man war against Capital Hill's UFO censorshippolicy, and yours truly, who reminded the eager protesters that this wasnot the first time the subject of flying saucers were of particular attentionto those living in the District of Columbia. I reminded those attendingthe rally that back in 1952 strange objects were seen for several daysin a row coming and going over the White House, were picked up on radar,and were chased by our fastest planes at the time. Even President Trumantook to the airwaves to tell the nation's frightened citizenry not to worry,that the Air Force was doing its job. Truman--like other presidents beforeand since--downplayed the seriousness of the situation and dismissed UFOsas hallucinations and hoaxes. But times have changed. And it looks like Operation Right to Know maybe the first successful group to take to the streets to protest what theysee as a grand cosmic whitewash that has involved the last eight presidents.Those wishing to learn more about the forthcoming activities of the Rightto Know group should contact Ed Komarek at Route 3, Box 1076, Thomasville,GA 31792. And, by the way, donations are welcome to support the cause justlike they would be to any charitable group. If the leadership of the UFO community lacks the courage, assertivenessand spunk needed to end the UFO cover-up quickly then they should stepaside and make way for others that will. If this does not happen, thenthey will be superseded by new organizations and new leaders. This is,in fact, already happening around the country as memberships grow tiredof all the fussing and squabbling and the mutual admiration societies thatexist within the UFO establishment. UFO picketers strut their stuff in front of the White House as theyare led by abductes Minder Gerber and Pat Marcattilio. Why We Marched by Ed Komarek The spectacular success of Operation Right to Know's second annual UFOdemonstration in Washington, DC shows what a few committed people can do.Unfortunately, the demonstration would have been a bigger success if theUFO community had not undermined our efforts in this regard. The UFO establishmenthas become extremely conservative and unwilling to experiment and takerisks. It seems that the leaders of the UFO establishment prefer to siton their laurels content to hold on to what they have accomplished so far.Even worse, they undermine the efforts of others like ORTK who are willingto experiment, take risks and learn from both the successes and failures.It was very irresponsible for the UFO establishment to come down againstdemonstrating when it had never been done before. It seems to me that the leaders of the UFO establishment have failedto learn from their adversaries who know that the media are the eyes andears of the public. The battle for freedom of inquiry by the public iscarried out in the media. It is essential to get the media on our sidein order to get our message to the public. This message is to look at theevidence. If the people will not look at the evidence because of the debunkinggroups and the tabloid press, then what good is the evidence. If the UFOestablishment is really serious about ending the UFO cover-up, they mustrealize that the UFO/ET problem is first and foremost a political problem,and thus deserves a political solution. What good is science if the datais being manipulated because of politics. I suggest that the various UFO groups get together immediately and forma public relations committee to publicize the evidence. First and foremost on this committee's agenda should be to publicizean event like "UFO Awareness Week" by distributing press releasesto every media source in the country about three weeks before the event.Speakers should be lined up to talk to the press and present the evidencefor UFO/ET's and the massive UFO cover-up. Operation Right To Know hastaken the lead and now it is up to the UFO community to follow that leadership.We need aggressive, assertive leadership that stands up to irresponsiblereporting on the UFO/ET situation by the media. Our demonstration in front of the Washington Post protesting their unwillingnessto look at the evidence while attempting to make ORTK out to be a radicalorganization put them in their place. As expected, a competitor paper,the Wall Street Journal, ran an article that forced the Washington Postto admit Surrounded by picket signs, Tim Biweekly addresses the multitudefrom a stage directly across the street from Bill Clinton's home as reporterHal MacKinsey looks on. that the evidence was provocative and they were looking into the UFO/ETmatter. This should be an example to the UFO community not to roll overand play dead when ridiculed in the press. ORTK again has taken a leadershipposition and the UFO community should begin to aggressively deal with irresponsiblereporting by the press. If the leadership of the UFO community lacks the courage, assertivenessand spunk needed to end the UFO cover-up quickly then they should stepaside and make way for others that will. If this does not happen, thenthey will be superseded by new organizations and new leaders. This is,in fact, already happening around the country as memberships grow tiredof all the fussing and squabbling and the mutual admiration societies thatexist within the UFO establishment. ORTK will continue to use all means possible that are legal and non-disruptiveto end the UFO cover-up. We will do this with or without the support ofthe UFO establishment. Obviously we would like the overwhelming supportof the UFO community. ORTK has just begun a long process that is essentiallya civil rights movement. Like the civil rights movement for the freedomof black people that began when a few individuals stood up for their rights,so are we of ORTK doing the same. Both movements have arisen out of a simmeringdiscontent that a few courageous individuals catalyzed into political action. From Truman to Clinton: Presidents and Cosmic Watergate by Dan Pinchas In light of President Clinton's recent inauguration, it is worth reviewingwhat evidence exists concerning our presidents' knowledge of"the cosmicWatergate". Due to the extremely high level of secrecy concerningthe U.S. investigation of UFOs and "IACs" (Identified Alien Crafts),it is difficult to verify some of this information, much of which is anecdotal. This information is culled from a variety of published and unpublishedsources. The following is a brief sketch of presidential involvement inand knowledge of the UFO cover-up. Truman, Eisenhower, and Roswell The documents which, if genuine, prove that President Truman was awareof the recovery of crashed alien spacecraft are at the center of a controversy.The Truman-Forrestal memorandum of September 24, 1947, if legitimate, wouldestablish conclusively that Truman established Operation Majestic-12 toanalyze bodies and wreckage recovered from the Roswell UFO crash. Trumanhad been quoted as expressing the view that UFOs were real and otherworldlyin origin. The alleged Eisenhower MJ-12 Briefing Document of November 18, 1952would indicate that then President-elect Eisenhower was made aware of theRoswell crash and possibly other crashes. Of particular interest are allegations that Eisenhower encountered aliensat Muroc Airfield (Edwards AFB) on Feb The Truman-Forrestal memorandumof September 24,1947, if legitimate, would establish conclusively thatTruman established Operation Majestic-12 to analyze bodies and wreckagerecovered from the Roswell UFO crash. Truman had been quoted as expressingthe view that UFOs were real and other-worldly in origin. A former steward on Air Force One during the Kennedy years has claimedthat he discussed UFOs with Kennedy during a flight in December 1962, andthat Kennedy told him his hands were tied and the whole matter was outof his hands. February 20, 1954 as cited in the Gerald Light letter of April 16, 1954,where Light claims "etherians" and "otherplane aeroforms"presented themselves. A test pilot who claimed to be present told Britain'sBrinsley Le Poet Trench (Lord Clancarty), that Eisenhower witnessed a demonstrationof technology and power that included a craft and aliens dematerializingbefore his eyes, causing Eisenhower great embarrassment. He is allegedto have told the visitors that "the world is not ready for you." Some researchers believe Eisenhower allowed executive power to slipfrom the Presidency to MJ12, but there is no concrete evidence to supportthis. JFK: A Would-be Whistleblower? A former steward on Air Force One during the Kennedy years has claimedthat he discussed UFOs with Kennedy during a flight in December 1962. Kennedytold him his hands were tied, the whole matter was out of his hands. A highly controversial claim has been put forth by an Air Force intelligencesource claiming Kennedy informed former Eisenhower national security advisorand reputed MJ- 12 member Gordon Gray in a taped 1963 meeting that he intendedto publicize the alien presence against MJ-12's wishes. The source deniedthis was a reason that led to Kennedy's assassination in a covert operation. While considerable evidence exists of CIA involvement in the assassination(see Mark Lane, Plausible Denial), there is no concrete evidence supportinga UFO connection. There is also no available evidence indicating that PresidentJohnson evinced any knowledge of the UFO cover-up. It is interesting tonote, however, that the alleged landing of an alien craft at Holloman AFBin April 1964 and conclusion of a government alien agreement would haveoccurred in the first months of Johnson's term. Nixon Knew. Two sources allege President Nixon indicated knowledge ofthe UFO coverup. Robert Emenegger, a film producer, was invited to visitNorton AFB to discuss a documentary on UFOs, which was to incorporate footageof the abovementioned 1964 alien craft landing at Holloman AFB. Emeneggerallegedly was shown a directive signed by Nixon authorizing release ofthe Holoman AFB film, which, needless to say, never was released. Whenhe broached the subject with White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman,Haldeman acknowledged familiarity with the Holloman landing but then quicklychanged the subject. A second source is Beverly McKittrick, comedian Jackie Gleason's secondwife, who said Gleason accompanied his friend Nixon to Homestead AFB in1973, where he was shown alien bodies in storage. According to McKittrick,Gleason was visibly shaken by this experience, but would neither confirmnor deny the report when questioned by others. Ford Disappointment. As a Congressman in 1966, Gerald Ford supported a Congressional committeeinvestigation of the UFO phenomenon. Congressional hearings were held butaccomplished little. Speculation abounded (fanned by leaks from government sources) thatPresident Ford, while holding a summit with French President Valery Giscardd'Estaing in Martinique in December 1974, would issue a statement on theUFO reality, but no statement was released. Ford responded to a recent inquiry regarding his opinion of UFOs thathis "position hasn't changed." Carter Breaks Promise. President Carter acknowledged seeing a UFO while governor of Georgiain 1969. During the 1976 election campaign, Carter said, "If I becomePresident, I'll make every piece of information this country has aboutUFO's available to the public and the scientists." This campaign promisewas not honored. One reason for this might be an alleged UFO briefing document whichintelligence agents allowed researcher Bill Moore to photograph in 1983.This document, dated June 14, 1977, contained transcribed notes allegedlyused to brief Carter on Project Aquarius and the UFO/IAC investigation.A similar document was shown to documentary filmmaker Linda Howe by AFOSISpecial Agent Richard Doty, also in 1983. It is not possible to determine whether the material is genuine, butit is likely some type of briefing was provided to Carter relating to UFOswhich caused him to change his mind about public disclosure. A requestby Las Vegas TV anchor George Knapp to interview A highly controversialclaim has been put forth by an Air Force intelligence source claiming Kennedyinformed former Eisenhower national security advisor and reputed MJ-12member Gordon Gray in a taped 1963 meeting that he intended to publicizethe alien presence against MJ-12's wishes. The source denied this was a reason that led to Kennedy's assassinationin a covert operation. Carter regarding this matter several years ago was declined. Navy physicist Robert Lazar claims to have read briefing documents whileemployed at Area 51/S-4 in Nevada describing a clash at an undergroundbase at Groom Lake between grays and U.S. military personnel in which 22members of security forces units and 44 government scientists were allegedlykilled (along with an unspecified number of gray casualties). If this 1979incident did indeed occur, it transpired during the Carter Administration.There has been no independent verification of the alleged incident. Reagan a Believer President Reagan also saw a UFO in 1974 while Governor of California,a fact he acknowledged in subsequent interviews. Film Producer Steven Spielberghas told friends that during a private screening of the movie E.T. at theWhite House in 1982, Reagan told him that they were among a handful ofpeople who knew how true it was. Of greater significance is Reagan's repetition on five separate occasions,including a 1985 Geneva summit with Soviet President Gorbachev, of thetheme that the nations of the planet would unite if facing an extraterrestrialthreat. When Gorbachev was asked at a summit news conference if he sharedReagan's views, he responded affirmatively. Bush: A UFO Insider? It has been alleged, without evidence, that former Director of CentralIntelligence Bush was Director of MJ-12 in the Reagan Administration. Itis similarly alleged that Vice President Dan Quayle was Director of MJ-12during the Bush Administration. Robert Lazar, who allegedly worked as a physicist on nine recovered(or donated) UFOs at Area 51/S-4, has stated his belief that Bush was familiarwith the project Lazar was working on. Researcher Jorge Martin has reportedthat Bush as Vice President visited the remote Cabo Rojo area in PuertoRico where UFOs are frequently sighted and where abductees have reportedlybeing abducted by grays acting in collusion with U.S. military personnel.It has been alleged that an underground base may exist in the vicinity.with U.S. military personnel. It has been alleged that an underground basemay exist in the vicinity. Russian UFOlogist Marina Popovich was told bysenior advisors to former Soviet President Gorbachev that he and Bush discussedthe disappearance of the unmanned Soviet spacecraft Phobos II in orbitaround Mars at their 1989 summit conference in Malta. Contact was lostwith Phobos II after it sent back pictures of a huge 12.5 mile long ellipticalUFO orbiting around the Mars moon of Phobos. Will Clinton Follow Tradition? Past experience strongly indicates that President Clinton and Vice PresidentGore will receive, or have already received, briefings on the alien presenceon Earth. Precedent also indicates that Clinton is unlikely to make theinformation public unless MJ- 12 (or its equivalent under a different name)is in agreement. Every President since Truman appears to have had knowledge of UFO secretsand yet none has made the information public. If Operation Right to Knowis successful, this pattern of silence and cover-up will be broken forgood. ============================================================================= ARTICLE 6 (This article was previously released under a UMF Bulletin) Excerpts From SILENT WEAPONS FOR QUIET WARS Copy furnished by Mr. Tom Young A fellow Warrior in the cause of Freedom Excerpts printed word for word exactly as discovered (With the added comments of William Cooper) (Emphasis added by WilliamCooper) Converted To ASCii By The Elf-UMF The Illuminati's declaration of War upon the people of America.

I acknowledge that a State of War exists andhas existed between the Citizens of the United States of America and theIlluminati aggressor based upon this recognition. I present to you thatthe peaceful Citizens of this nation are fully justified in taking whateversteps may be necessary, including violence, to identify, counterattack,and destroy the enemy. I base this statement upon the God-given right ofany peaceful people to defend themselves against attack and destruction by any enemy wagingwar against them. I cite the principles outlined in the Declaration ofIndependence, the Constitution of the United States of America, and thefully recognized and acknowledged historical precedents that have servedas the justification for destruction of tyrants. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION Silent weapon technology has evolved from OperationsResearch (O.R.), a strategic and tactical methodology developed under theMILITARY MANAGEMENT (Eisenhower) in England during World War II. the originalpurpose of Operations Research was to study the strategic and tacticalproblems of air and land defense with the objective of effective use oflimited military resources against foreign enemies (i.e.,logistics). Itwas soon recognized by those in positions of power [THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGNRELATIONS] that the same methods might be useful for totally controllinga society. But better tools were necessary. Social engineering (the analysisand automation of a society) requires the correlation of great amountsof constantly changing economic information (data), so a high-speed computerizeddata-processing systems was necessary which could race ahead of the societyand predict when society would arrive for capitulation. Relay computerswere too slow, but the electronic computer, invented in 1946 by J. PresperEckert and John W. Mauchly, filled the bill. The next breakthrough wasthe development of the simplex method of linear programming in 1947 bythe mathematician George B. Dantzig. Then in 1948, the transistor, inventedby J. Bardeen, W.H. Brattain, and W. Shockley, promised great expansionof the computer field by reducing space and power requirements. With thesethree inventions under their direction, those in positions of power stronglysuspected that it was possible for them to control the whole world withthe push of a button. Immediately, the ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION got in onthe ground floor by making a four-year grant to HARVARD COLLEGE, fundingthe HARVARD ECONOMIC RESEARCH PROJECT for the study of the structure ofthe American economy. One year later, in 1949, THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCEjoined in. In 1952 the original grant period terminated, and a high-levelmeeting of the ELITE [Illuminati] was held to determine the next phaseof social operations research. The Harvard project had been very fruitful,as is borne out by the publication of some of its results in 1953 suggestingthe feasibility of economic (social) engineering. (Studies in the Structureof the American Economy--copyright 1953 by Wassily Leontief, InternationalSciences Press Inc., White Plains, New York.) Engineered in the last halfof the decade of the 1940s, the new Quiet War machine stood, so to speak,in sparkling gold-plated hardware on the showroom floor by 1954. With thecreation of the maser in 1954, the promise of unlocking UN LIMITED SOURCESOF FUSION ATOMIC ENERGY FROM THE HEAVY HYDROGEN IN SEA WATER and the consequentavailability of unlimited social power was a possibility only decades away.The combination was irresistible. The QUIET WAR was quietly DECLARED bythe INTERNATIONAL ELITE [THE BILDERBERG GROUP] at a meeting held in 1954.Although the silent weapons system was nearly exposed 13 years later, theevolution of the new weapon-system has never suffered any major setbacks.This volume marks the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the Quiet War.Already this domestic war has had many victories on many fronts throughoutthe world. POLITICAL INTRODUCTION In 1954 it was well recognized by those in positions of authority thatit was only a matter of time, only a few decades, before the general publicwould be able to grasp and upset the cradle of power, for the very elementsof the new silent-weapon technology were as accessible for a public utopiaas they were for providing a private utopia. The ISSUE of PRIMARY CONCERN,that of DOMINANCE, revolved around the subject of the energy sciences. ENERGY Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on earth. Natural scienceis the study of the sources and control of natural energy, and social science,theoretically expressed as economics, is the study of the sources and controlof social energy. Both are bookkeeping systems: mathematics. Therefore,mathematics is the primary energy science. And the book- keeper can beking if the public can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the bookkeeping.All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The endis control. [THE END ALWAYS JUSTIFIES THE MEANS.] Beyond this remains onlyone issue: Who will be the beneficiary? In 1954 this was the issue of concern.Although the so- called "moral issues" were raised, in view ofthe law of natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of peoplewho will not use their intellegence are no better than animals who do nothave intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the tableby choice and consent. CONSEQUENTLY, in the interest of future world order,peace, and tranquility, it was decided to privately wage a quiet war againstthe American public with an ultimate objective of permanently shiftingthe natural and social energy (wealth) of the undisciplined and irresponsiblemany into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible, and worthy few.In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure,and apply new weapons which, as it turned out, were a class of weaponsso subtle and sophisticated in their principle of operation and publicappearance as to earn for themselves the name "silent weapons."In conclusion, the objective of economic research, as conducted by themagnates of capital (banking) and the industries of commodities (goods)and services, is the establishment of an economy which is totally predict-able and manipulatable. In order to achieve a totally predictable economy,the low-class elements of the society must be brought under total control,i.e., must be housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke and long-term socialduties from a very early age, before they have an opportunity to questionthe propriety of the matter. In order to achieve such conformity, the lower-class family unit must be disintegrated by a process of increasing preoccupationof the parents and the establishment of government-operated day-care centersfor the occupationally orphaned children. The quality of education givento the lower class must be of the poorest sort, so the moat of ignoranceisolating the inferior class from the superior class is and remains incomprehensibleto the inferior class. With such an initial handicap, even bright lowerclass individuals have little if any hope of extricating themselves fromtheir assigned lot in life. This form of slavery is essential to maintainingsome measure of social order, peace, and tranquility for the ruling uppercrust. DESCRIPTIVE INTRODUCTION OF THE SILENT WEAPON Everything that is expected from an ordinary weapon is expected froma silent weapon by its creators, but only in its own manner of functioning.It shoots situations, instead of bullets; propelled by data processing, instead of chemical reaction (explosion); originating from bits of data,instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operatedby a computer programmer, instead of a marksman; under the orders of abanking magnate, instead of a military general. It makes no obvious explosivenoises, causes no obvious physical or mental injuries, and does not obviouslyinterfere with anyone's daily social life. Yet it makes an unmistakable"noise," causes unmistakable physical and mental damage, andunmistakably interferes with daily social life, i.e., unmistakable to atrained observer, one who knows what to look for. The public cannot comprehendthis weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are being attackedand subdued by a weapon. The public might instinctively feel that somethingis wrong [ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH?], but because of the technical nature ofthe silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling in a rational way,or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do not know howto cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to defendthemselves against it. When a silent weapon is applied gradually, the publicadjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachmenton their lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomestot great and they crack up. Therefore, the silent weapon is a type ofbiological warfare. It attacks the vitality, options, and mobility of theindividuals of a society by knowing, understanding, manipulating, and attackingtheir sources of natural and social energy, and their physical, mental,and emotional strengths and weaknesses. THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION Give me control over a nation's currency, andI care not who makes its laws. Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812) Today's silent weapons technology is an outgrowth of a simple idea discovered,succinctly expressed, and effectively applied by the quoted Mr. Mayer AmschelRothschild. Mr. Rothschild discovered the missing passive component ofeconomic theory known as economic inductance. He, of course, did not thinkof his discovery in these 20th century terms, and , to be sure, mathematicalanalysis had to wait for the Second Industrial Revolution, the rise ofthe electronic computer before it could be effectively applied in the controlof the world economy. GENERAL ENERGY CONCEPTS In the study of energy systems, there always appear three elementaryconcepts. These are potential energy, kinetic energy, and energy dissipation.And corresponding to these concepts, there are three idealize, essentiallypure physical counterparts called passive components. (1) In the scienceof physical mechanics, the phenomenon of potential energy is associatedwith a physical property called elasticity or stiffness, and can be representedby a stretched spring. In electronic science, potential energy is storedin a capacitor instead of a spring. This property is called capacitanceinstead of elasticity or stiffness. (2)In the science of physical mechanics,the phenomenon of kinetic energy is associated with a physical propertycalled inertia or mass, and can be represented by a mass of a flywheelin motion. In electronic science, kinetic energy is stored in an inductor(in a magnetic field) instead of mass. This property is called inductancein- stead of inertia. (3)In the science of physical mechanics, the phenomenonof energy dissipation is associated with a physical property called friction orresistance, and can be represented by a dashpot or other device which convertssystem energy into heat. In electronic science, dissipation of energy isperformed by an element called either a resistor or a conductor, the term"resistor" being the one generally used to express the conceptof friction, and the term "conductor" being generally used todescribe a more ideal device (e.g., wire) employed to convey electronicenergy efficiently from one location to another. The property of a resistanceor conductor is measured as either resistance or conductance reciprocals.In economics these three energy concepts are associated with: (1)EconomicCapacitance-Capital (money, stock/inventory, investments in buildings anddurables, etc. ) (2)Economic Conductance-Goods (production flow coefficients)(3)Economic Inductance-Services (the influence of the population of industryon output) All of the mathematical theory developed in the study of oneenergy system (e.g., mechanics, electronics, etc.) can be immediately appliedin the study of any other energy system (e.g., economics). MR. ROTHSCHILD'S ENERGY DISCOVERY What Mr. Rothschild had discovered was the basic principle of power,influence, and control over people as applied to economics. That principleis "when you assume the appearance of power, people soon give it toyou." Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency or deposit loanaccounts had the required appearance of power that could be used to INDUCEPEOPLE [WC emphasis] (inductance, with people corresponding to a magneticfield) into surrendering their real wealth in exchange for a promise ofgreater wealth (instead of real compensation). They would put up real collateralin exchange for a loan of promissory notes. Mr. Rothschild found that hecould issue more notes than he had backing for, so long as he had someone'sstock of gold as a persuader to show to his customers. Mr. Rothschild loanedhis promissory notes to individuals and to governments. These would createoverconfidence. Then he would make money scarce, tighten control of thesystem, and collect the collateral through the obligation of contracts.The cycle was then repeated. These pressures could be used to ignite awar. Then he would control the avail- ability of currency to determinewho would win the war. That government which agreed to give him controlof its economic system got his support. Collection of debts was guaranteedby economic aid to the enemy of the debtor. The profit derived from thiseconomic methodology made Mr. Rothschild all the more able to extend hiswealth. He found that the public greed would allow currency to be printedby government order BEYOND THE LIMITS [WC emphasis] (inflation) of backingin precious metal or the production of goods and services (gross nationalproduct, GNP). APPARENT CAPITAL AS "PAPER" INDUCTOR In this structure, credit, presented as a pure element called "currency,"has the appearance of capital, but is, in fact, negative capital. Hence,it has the appearance of service, but is, in fact, indebtedness or debt.It is there- fore an economic inductance instead of an economic capacitance,and if balanced in no other way, will be balanced by the negotiation ofpopulation (war, genocide)> The total goods and services represent realcapital called the gross national product, and currency may be printedup to this level and still represent economic capacitance; but currencyprinted beyond this level is subtractive, represents the introduction ofeconomic inductance, and constitutes notes of indebtedness. War is thereforethe balancing of the system by killing the true creditors (the public whichwe have taught to exchange true value for inflated currency) and falling back on whatever is left of the resourcesof nature and regeneration of those resources. Mr. Rothschild had discoveredthat currency gave him the power to rearrange the economic structure tohis own advantage, to shift economic inductance to those economic positionswhich would encourage the great- est economic instability and oscillation.The final key to economic control had to wait until there was sufficientdata and high-speed computing equipment to keep close watch on the economicoscillations created by price stocking and excess paper energy credits-paper inductance/inflation. BREAKTHROUGH The aviation field provided the greatest evolution in economic engineeringby way of the mathematical theory of shock testing. In this process, aprojectile is fired from an airframe on the ground and the impulse of therecoil is monitored by vibration transducers connected to the airframeand wired to chart recorders. By studying the echoes or reflections ofthe recoil impulse in the airframe, it is possible to discover criticalvibrations in the structure of the airframe which either vibrations ofthe engine or aeolian vibrations of the wings, or a combination of thetwo, might reinforce resulting in a resonant self-destruction of the airframein flight as an aircraft. From the standpoint of engineering, this meansthat the strengths and weaknesses of the structure of the airframe in termsof vibrational energy can be discovered and manipulated. APPLICATION IN ECONOMICS To use this method of airframe shock testing in economic engineering,the prices of commodities are shocked, and the public consumer reactionis monitored. The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpretedtheoretically by computers and the psycho-economic structure of the economyus thus discovered. It is by this process that partial differential anddifference matrices are discovered that define the family household andmake possible its evaluation as an economic industry (dissipative consumerstructure). Then the response of the household to future shocks can bepredicted and manipulated, and society becomes a well-regulated animalwith its reins under the control of a sophisticated computer-regulatedsocial energy bookkeeping system. Eventually every individual element ofthe structure comes under computer control trough a knowledge of personalpreferences, such know- ledge guaranteed by computer association of consumerpreferences (universal product code--UPC-- zebra-stripe pricing codes onpackages) with identified consumers (identified via association with theuse of a credit card and LATER A PERMANENT "TATTOOED" BODY NUMBER[WC emphasis] invisible under normal ambient illumination... THE ECONOMIC MODEL ...The Harvard Economic Research Project (1948-) was an extension ofWorld War II Operations Research. Its purpose was to discover the scienceof controlling an economy: at first the American economy, and then theworld economy. It was felt that with sufficient mathematical foundationand data, it would be nearly as easy to predict and control the trend ofan economy as to predict and control the trajectory of a projectile. Suchhas proven to be the case. Moreover, the economy has been transformed intoa guided missile on target. The immediate aim of the Harvard project wasto discover the economic structure, what forces change that structure,how the behavior of the structure can be predicted, and how it can be manipulated. What wasneeded was a well-organized knowledge of the mathematical structures andinterrelationships of investment, production, distribution, and consumption. To make a short story of it all, it was discovered that an economy obeyedthe same laws as electricity and that all of the mathematical theory andpractical and computer know-how developed for the electronic field couldbe directly applied in the study of economics. This discovery was not openlydeclared, and its more subtle implications were and are kept a closelyguarded secret, for example that in an economic model, human life is measuredin dollars, and that the electric spark generated when opening a switchconnected to an active inductor is mathematically analogous to the initiationof a war. The greatest hurdle which theoretical economists faced was theaccurate description of the household as an industry. This is a challengebecause consumer purchases are a matter of choice which in turn is influencedby income, price, and other economic factors. This hurdle was cleared inan indirect and statistically approximate was by an application of shocktesting to determine the current characteristics, called current technicalcoefficients, of a household industry. Finally, because problems in theoreticaleconomics can be translated very easily into problems in theoretical electronics,and the solution translated back again, it follows that only a book oflanguage translation and concept definition needed to be written for economics.The remainder could be gotten from standard works on mathematics and electronics.This makes the publication of books on advanced economics unnecessary,and greatly simplifies project security. INDUSTRIAL DIAGRAMS An ideal industry is defined as a device which receives value from otherindustries in several forms and converts [it] into one specific productfor sales and distribution to other industries. It has several inputs andone output. What the public normally thinks of as one industry is reallyan industrial complex where several industries under one roof produce oneor more products... THREE INDUSTRIAL CLASSES Industries fall into three categories or classes by type of output:Class #1--Capital (resources) Class #2--Goods (commodities or use-dissipative)Class #3--Services (action of population) Class #1 industries exist atthree levels: (1)Nature-sources of energy and raw materials. (2)Government-printingof currency equal to gross national product (GNP), and extension (inflation)of currency in excess of GNP. (3)Banking-loaning of money for interest,and extension (inflation/ counterfeiting) of economic value through depositloan accounts. Class #2 industries exist as producers of tangible or consumer(disopited) products. This sort of activity is usually recognized and labeledby the public as an "industry." Class #3 industries are thosewhich have service rather than a tangible product as their output. Theseindustries are called (1)households, and (2) governments. Their outputis human activity of a mechanical sort, and their basis is population. AGGREGATION The whole economic system can be represented by a three-industry modelif one allows the names of the outputs to be (1)capital, (2)goods, and(3)services. The problem with this representation is that it would not show the influence of, say, the textile industry on the ferrous metalindustry. This is because both the textile industry and the ferrous metalindustry would be contained within a single classification called the "goodsindustry" and by this process of combining or aggregating these twoindustries under one system block they would lose their economic individuality. THE E-MODEL A national economy consists of simultaneous flows of production, distribution,consumption, and investment. If all of these elements including labor andhuman functions are assigned a numerical value in like units of measure,say, 1939 dollars, then this flow can be further represented by a currentflow in an electronic circuit, and its behavior can be predicted and manipulatedwith useful precision. The three ideal passive energy components of electronics,the capacitor, the resistor, and the inductor correspond to the three idealpassive energy components of economics called the pure industries of capital,goods, and services, respectively. Economic capacitance represents thestorage of capital in one form or another. Economic conductance representsthe level of conductance of materials for the production of goods. Economicinductance represents the inertia of economic value in motion. This isa population phenomenon known as services. ECONOMIC INDUCTANCE An electrical inductor (e.g., a coil of wire) has an electric currentas its primary phenomenon and a magnetic field as its secondary phenomenon(inertia). Corresponding to this, an economic inductor has a flow of economicvalue as its primary phenomenon and a population field as its secondaryphenomenon of inertia. When the flow of economic value (e.g., money) diminishes,the human population field collapses in order to keep the economic value(money) flowing (extreme case--war). This public inertia is a result ofconsumer buying habits, expected standard of living, etc., and is generallya phenomenon of self-preservation. INDUCTIVE FACTORS TO CONSIDER (1)Population (2)Magnitude of the economic activities of the government(3)The method of financing these government activities (See Peter-PaulPrinciple--inflation of the currency.) TRANSLATION (A few examples will be given.) Charge--cous--dollars (1939).Flow/Current--amperes (coulombs per second)--dollars of flow per year.Motivating Force--volts--dollars (output) demand. Conductance--amperesper volt--dollars of flow per year per dollar demand. Capacitance--coulombsper volt--dollars of production inventory/ stock per dollar demand. TIME FLOW RELATIONSHIPS AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE OSCILLATIONS An ideal industry may be symbolized electronically in various ways.The simplest way is to represent a demand by a voltage and a supply bya current. When this is done, the relationship between the two becomeswhat is called an admittance, which can result from three economic factors: (1) hindsight flow, (2) present flow, and (3) foresight flow. Foresightflow is the result of that property of living entities to cause energy(food) to be stored for a period of low energy (e.g.,a winter season).It consists of demands made upon an economic system for that period oflow energy (winter season). In a production industry it takes several forms,one of which is known as production stock or inventory. In electronic symbologythis specific industry demand (a pure capital industry) is representedby capacitance and the stock or resource is represented by a stored charge.Satisfaction of an industry demand suffers a lag because of the loadingeffect of inventory priorities. Present flow ideally involves no delays.It is, so to speak, input today for output today, a "hand to mouth"flow. In electronic symbology, this specific industry demand (a pure useindustry) is represented by a conduchance which is then a simple economicvalve (a dissipative element). Hindsight flow is known as habit or inertia.In electronics this phenomenon is the characteristic of an inductor (economicanalog=a pure service industry) in which a current flow (economic analog=flowof money) creates a magnetic field (economic analog=active human population)which, if the current (money flow) begins to diminish, collapse (war) tomaintain the current (flow of money--energy). Other large alternativesto war as economic inductors or economic flywheels are an open-ended socialwelfare program, or an ENORMOUS (but fruitful) OPEN-ENDED SPACE PROGRAM[WC emphasis]. The problem with stabilizing the economic system is thatthere is too much demand on account of (1) too much greed and (2) too muchpopulation. This creates excessive economic inductance which can only bebalanced with economic capacitance (true resources or value--e.g.,in goodsor services). The social welfare program is nothing more than an open-endedcredit balance system which creates a false capital industry to give nonproductivepeople a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs. This can beuseful, however, because the recipients become state property in returnfor the "gift," a standing army for the elite. For he who paysthe piper picks the tune. Those who get hooked on the economic drug, mustgo to the elite for a fix. In this, the method of introducing large amountsof stabilizing capacitance is by borrowing on the future "credit"of the world. This is a fourth law of motion--onset, and consists of performingan action and leaving the system before the reflected reaction returnsto the point of action--a delayed reaction. The means of surviving thereaction is by changing the system before the reaction can return. By thismeans, politicians become popular in their own time and the public paysfor it later. In fact, the measure of such a politician is the delay time.The same thing is achieved by a government by printing money beyond thelimit of the gross national product, an economic process called inflation.[Note:REMEMBER THAT INFLATION IS ONLY THE ACT OF PRINTING MONEY IN EXCESSOF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT. THEY COULD BLAME IT ON THE PRICE OF WIDGETSOR OIL ONLY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNEW THE REAL CAUSE. THE REAL CAUSE AND THEONLY CAUSE OF INFLATION IS THE PRINTING OF MORE MONEY BEYOND THE GROSSNATIONAL PRODUCT.] This puts a large quantity of money into the hands ofthe public and maintains a balance against their greed, creates a falseself-confidence in them and, for awhile, stays the wolf from the door. They must eventually resort to war to balance the account, because warultimately is merely the act of destroying the creditor, and the politiciansare the publicly hired hit men that justify the act to keep the responsibilityand blood off the public conscience. (See section on consent factors andsocial-economic structuring.) If people really cared about their fellow man, they would control theirappetites (greed, procreation, etc.) so that they would not have to operateon a credit or welfare social system which steals from the worker to satisfythe bum. Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint,there are only two alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of thesystem. (1)Let the populace bludgeon each other to death in war, whichwill only result in a total destruction of the living earth. (2)Take controlof the world by the use of economic "silent weapons" in a formof "quiet warfare" and reduce the economic inductance of theworld to a safe level by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide.The latter option has been taken as the obviously better option. At thispoint it should be crystal clear to the reader why absolute secrecy aboutthe silent weapons is necessary. The general public refuses to improveits own mentality and its faith in its fellow man. It has become a herdof proliferating barbarians, and, so to speak, a blight upon the face ofthe earth. They do not care enough about economic science to learn whythey have not been able to avoid war despite religious morality, and theirreligious or self-gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems rendersthe solution of the earthly problem unreachable by them. It is left tothose few who are truly willing to think and survive as the fittest tosurvive, to solve the problem for themselves as the few who really care.Otherwise, exposure of the silent weapons would destroy our only hope ofpreserving the seed of future true humanity.... THE HOUSEHOLD INDUSTRY The industries of finance (banking), manufacturing, and government,real counterparts of the pure industries of capital, goods, and services,are easily defined because they are generally logically structured. Becauseof this their processes can be described mathematically and their technicalcoefficients can be easily deduced. This, however, is not the case withthe service industry known as the household industry. HOUSEHOLD MODELS ...The problem which a theoretical economist faces is that the consumerpreferences of any household is not easily predictable and the technicalcoefficients of any one household extend to be a nonlinear, very complex,and variable function of income, prices, etc. Computer information derived from the use of the universal product codein conjunction with credit-card purchase as an individual household identifiercould change this state of affairs, but the U.P.C. method is not yet availableon a national or even a significant regional scale. To compensate for thisdata deficiency, an alternate indirect approach of analysis has been adoptedknown as economic shock testing. This method, widely used in the aircraftmanufacturing industry, develops an aggregate statistical sort of data.Applied to economics, this means that all of the households in one regionor in the whole nation are studied as a group or class rather than individually,and the mass behavior rather than individual behavior is used to discoveruseful estimates of the technical coefficients of the household industrydepends upon shocking the prices of a commodity and noting the changesin the sales of all the commodities. ECONOMIC SHOCK TESTING In recent times, the application of Operations Research to the studyof the public economy has been obvious for anyone who understands the principlesof shock testing. In the shock testing of an aircraft airframe, the recoilimpulse of firing a gun mounted on that airframe causes shock waves inthat structure which tell aviation engineers the conditions under which parts of theairplane or the whole airplane or its wings will start to vibrate or flutterlike a guitar string, a flute reed, or a tuning fork, and disintegrateor fall apart in flight. Economic engineers achieve the same result instudying the behavior of the economy and the consumer public by carefullyselecting a staple commodity such as beef, coffee, gasoline, or sugar,and then causing a sudden change or shock in its price or availability,thus kicking every- body's budget and buying habits out of shape. Theythen observe the shock waves which result by monitoring the changes inadvertising, prices, and sales of that and other commodities. The objectiveof such studies is to acquire the know-how to set the public economy intoa predictable state of motion or change, even a con- trolled self-destructivestate of motion which will convince the public that certain "expert"people should take control of the money system and reestablish security(rather than liberty and justice) for all. When the subject citizens arerendered unable to control their financial affairs, they, of course, becometotally enslaved, a source of cheap labor. Not only the prices of commodities,but also the availability of labor can be used as the means of shock testing.Labor strikes deliver excellent tests shocks to an economy, especiallyin the critical service areas of trucking (transportation), communication,public utilities (energy, water, garbage collection), etc. By shock testing,it is found that there is a direct relationship between the availabilityof money flowing in an economy and the psychological outlook and responseof masses of people dependent upon that availability. For example, thereis a measurable quantitative relationship between the price of gasolineand the probability that a person would experience a headache, feel a needto watch a violent movie, smoke a cigarette, or go to a tavern for a mugof beer. It is most interesting that, by observing and measuring the economicmodes by which the public tries to run from their problems and escape fromreality, and by applying the mathematical theory of Operations Re- search,it is possible to program computers to predict the most probable combinationof created events (shocks) which will bring about a complete control andsubjugation of the public through a subversion of the public economy (byshaking the plum tree)... INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMIC AMPLIFIERS Economic amplifiers are the active components of economic engineering.The basic characteristic of any amplifier (mechanical, electrical, or economic)is that is receives an input control signal and delivers energy from anindependent energy source to a specified output terminal in a predictablerelationship to that input control signal. The simplest form of economicamplifier is a device called advertising. If a person is spoken to by aT.V. advertiser as if he were a twelve-year- old, then, due to suggestibility,he will, with a certain probability, respond or react to that suggestionwith the uncritical response of a twelve-year-old and will reach into hiseconomic reservoir and deliver its energy to buy that product on impulsewhen he passes it in the store. An economic amplifier may have severalinputs and outputs. Its response might be instantaneous or delayed. Itscircuit symbol might be a rotary switch if its options are exclusive, qualitative,"go" or "no go," or it might have its parametric input/outputrelationships specified by a matrix with internal energy sources represented.Whatever its form might be, its purpose is to govern the flow of energyfrom a source to an output sink in direct relationship to an input controlsignal. For this reason, it is called an active circuit element or component.Economic Amplifiers fall into classes called strategies, and, in comparisonwith electronic amplifiers, the specific internal functions of an economicamplifier are called logistical instead of electrical. Therefore, economic amplifiers not only deliver power gain but also,in effect, are used to cause changes in the economic circuitry. In thedesign of an economic amplifier we must have some idea of at least fivefunctions, which are: (1) the available input signals, (2) the desired output-control objectives,(3) the strategic objective, (4) the available economic power sources,(5) the logistical options. The process of defining and evaluating these factors and incorporatingthe economic amplifier into an economic system has been popularly calledGAME THEORY [WC emphasis]. The design of an economic amplifier begins witha specification of the power level of the output, which can range frompersonal to national. The second condition is accuracy of response, i.e.,how accurately the output action is a function of the input commands. Highgain combined with strong feedback helps deliver the required precision.Most of the error will be in the input data signal. Personal input datatends to be specific, while national input data tends to be statistical.

[WC: Ultimate objective--New World Order] DIVERSION, THE PRIMARY STRATEGY Experience has proven that the SIMPLEST METHOD of securing a silentweapon and gaining control of the public is to KEEP THE PUBLIC UNDISCIPLINEDAND IGNORANT of basic systems principles on the one hand, WHILE KEEPINGTHEM CONFUSED, DISORGANIZED, AND DISTRACTED with matters of no real importanceon the other hand. [WC all emphases.] This is achieved by: (1) disengagingtheir minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a low-qualityprogram of public education in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics;and discouraging technical creativity. (2) engaging their emotions, increasingtheir self-indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities,by: (a) unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotionalrape) by way of a constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media--especiallythe T.V. and the newspapers. (b) giving them what they desire--in excess--"junkfood for thought"--and depriving them of what they really need. (3)REWRITING HISTORY and LAW and SUBJECTING THE PUBLIC TO THE DEVIANT CREATION,thus being able to SHIFT THEIR THINKING from personal needs to highly fabricatedoutside priorities. [WC all emphases.] These preclude their interest inand discovery of the silent weapons of social automation technology. Thegeneral rule is that there is profit in confusion; the more confusion,the more profit. Therefore, the best approach is to create problems andthen offer the solutions. DIVERSION SUMMARY Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real socialissues, and captivated by matters of no real importance. Schools: Keepthe young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law,and REAL HISTORY [WC emphasis]. Entertainment: Keep the public entertainmentbelow sixth-grade level. Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with notime to think; back on the farm with the other animals. CONSENT, THE PRIMARY VICTORY A silent weapon system operates upon data obtained from a docile publicby legal (but not always lawful) force. Much information is made availableto silent weapon systems programmers through the Internal Revenue Service.(See Studies in the Structure of the American Economy for an I.R.S. sourcelist.) This information consists of the enforced delivery of well-organizeddata contained in federal and state tax forms collected, assembled, andsubmitted by slave labor provided by taxpayers and employers. Furthermore,the number of such forms submitted to the I.R.S. is a useful indicatorof public consent, an important factor in strategic decision making. Otherdata sources are given in the Short List of Inputs. Consent Coefficients--numericalfeedback indicating victory status. Psychological basis: When the governmentis able to collect tax and seize private property without just compensation,it is an indication that the public is ripe for surrender and is consentingto enslavement and legal encroachment. A good and easily quantified indicatorof harvest time is the number of public citizens who pay income tax despitean obvious lack of reciprocal or honest service from the government. AMPLIFICATION ENERGY SOURCES The next step in the process of designing an economic amplifier is discoveringthe energy sources. The energy sources which support any primitive economicsystem are, of course, a supply of raw materials, and the consent of thepeople to labor and consequently assume a certain rank, position, level,or class in the social structure; i.e., to provide labor at various levelsin the pecking order. Each class, in guaranteeing its own level of income,controls the class immediately below it, hence preserves the class structure.This provides stability and security, but also government from the top.As time goes on and communication and education improve, the lower-classelements of the social labor structure become knowledgeable and enviousof the good things that the upper-class members have. They also begin toattain a knowledge of energy systems and the ability to enforce their risethrough the class structure. This threatens the sovereignty of the elite.If this rise of the lower classes can be postponed long enough, the elitecan achieve energy dominance, and LABOR BY CONSENT NO LONGER WILL HOLDA POSITION [WC emphasis] of an essential economic energy source. Untilsuch energy dominance is absolutely established, the consent of peopleto labor and let others handle their affairs must be taken into consideration,since failure to do so could cause the people to interfere in the finaltransfer of energy sources to the control of the elite. It is essentialto recognize that at this time, public consent is still an essential keyto the release of energy in the process of economic amplification. Therefore,consent as an energy release mechanism will now be considered. LOGISTICS The successful application of a strategy requires a careful study ofinputs, outputs, the strategy connecting the input and the outputs, andthe available energy sources to fuel the strategy. This study is calledlogistics. A logistical problem is studied at the elementary level first,and then levels of greater complexity are studied as a synthesis of elementaryfactors. This means that a given system is analyzed, i.e., broken downinto its subsystems, and these in turn are analyzed, until, by this process,one arrives at the logistical "atom," THE INDIVIDUAL [WC emphasis].This is where the process of SYNTHESIS [WC emphasis] properly begins, andat the time of the birth of the individual. THE ARTIFICIAL WOMB From the time a person leaves its mother's womb, its every effort isdirected toward building, maintaining, and withdrawing into artificialwombs, various sorts of substitute protective devices or shells. The objectiveof these artificial wombs is to provide a stable environment for both stableand unstable activity; to provide a shelter for the evolutionary processesof growth and maturity--i.e., survival; to provide security for freedomand to provide defensive protection for offensive activity. This is equallytrue of both the general public and the elite. However, there is a definitedifference in the way each of these classes go about the solution of problems. THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF A NATION-- DEPENDENCY The primary reason why the individual citizens of a country create apolitical structure is a subconscious wish or desire to perpetuate theirown dependency relationship of childhood. Simply put, they want a humangod to eliminate all risk from their life, pat them on the head, kiss theirbruises, put a chicken on every dinner table, clothe their bodies, tuckthem into bed at night, and tell them that everything will be alright [sic]when they wake up in the morning. The public demand is incredible, so the human god, the politician, meetsincredibility with incredibility by promising the world and deliveringnothing. So who is the bigger liar? the public? or the "godfather"?This public behavior is surrender born of fear, laziness, and expediency.It is the basis of the welfare state as a strategic weapon, useful againstdisgusting public. ACTION/OFFENSE Most people want to be able to subdue and/or kill other human beingswhich disturb their daily lives, but they do not want to have to cope withthe moral and religious issues which such an overt act on their part mightraise. Therefore, they assign the dirty work to others (including theirown children) so as to keep the blood off their own hands. They rave aboutthe humane treatment of animals and then sit down to a delicious hamburgerfrom a whitewashed slaughterhouse down the street and out of sight. Buteven more hypocritical, they pay taxes to finance a professional associationof hit men collectively called politicians, and then complain about corruptionin the government. RESPONSIBILITY Again, most people want to be free to do things (to explore, etc.) butthey are afraid to fail. The fear of failure is manifested in irresponsibility,and especially in delegating those personal responsibilities to otherswhere success is uncertain or carries possible or created liabilities (law)which the person is not prepared to accept. They want authority (root word--"author"),but they will not accept responsibility or liability. So they hire politiciansto face reality for them. SUMMARY The people hire the politicians so that the people can: (1) obtain securitywithout managing it. (2) obtain action without thinking about it. (3) inflicttheft, injury, and death upon others without having to con- template eitherlife or death. (4) avoid responsibility for their own intentions. (5) obtainthe benefits of reality and science without exerting themselves in thediscipline of facing or learning either of these things. They give the politicians the power to create and manage a war machineto: (1) provide for the survival of the NATION/WOMB (2) prevent encroachmentof anything upon the NATION/WOMB (3) destroy the enemy who threatens theNATION/WOMB (4) destroy those citizens of their own country who do notconform for the sake of stability of the NATION/WOMB Politicians hold manyquasi-military jobs, the lowest being the police which are soldiers, theattorneys and the C.P.A.s next who are spies and saboteurs (licensed),and the judges who shout the orders and run the closed union military shop for whatever the market will bear. The generalsare industrialists. The "presidential" level of commander-in-chiefis shared by the international bankers. The people know that they havecreated this farce and financed it with their own taxes (consent), butthey would rather knuckle under than be the hypocrite. Thus, a nation becomesdivided into two very distinct parts, a DOCILE SUB-NATION [great silentmajority] and a POLITICAL SUB-NATION. The political sub-nation remainsattached to the docile sub-nation, tolerates it, and leaches its substanceuntil it grows strong enough to detach itself and then devour its parent. SYSTEM ANALYSIS In order to make meaningful computerized economic decisions about war,the primary economic flywheel, it is necessary to assign concrete logisticalvalues to each element of the war structure--personnel and material alike.This process begins with a clear and candid description of the subsystemsof such a structure. THE DRAFT (As military service) Few efforts of human behavior modification are more remarkable or moreeffective than that of the socio-military institution known as the draft.a primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to instill, byintimidation, in the young males of a society the uncritical convictionthat the government is omnipotent. [WC Note: The truth is just the opposite,as government exists only with the consent of the people.] He is soon taughtthat a prayer is slow to reverse what a bullet can do in an instant. Thus,a man trained in a religious environment for eighteen years of his lifecan, by this instrument of the government, be broken down, be purged ofhis fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere months. Once that convictionis instilled, all else becomes easy to instill. EVEN MORE INTERESTING ISTHE PROCESS BY WHICH A YOUNG MAN'S PARENTS, WHO PURPORTEDLY LOVE HIM, CANBE INDUCED TO SEND HIM OFF TO WAR TO HIS DEATH [WC emphasis]. Althoughthe scope of this work will not allow this matter to be expanded in fulldetail, nevertheless, a coarse overview will be possible and can serveto reveal those factors which must be included in some numerical form ina computer analysis of social and war systems. We begin with a tentativedefinition of the draft. THE DRAFT (selective service, etc.) is an institutionof COMPULSORY collective SACRIFICE and SLAVERY, devised by the middle-agedand the elderly for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the publicdirty work. It further serves to make the youth as guilty as the elders,thus making criticism of the elders by the youth less likely (GenerationalStabilizer). It is marketed and sold to the public under the label of "patriotic=national"service. Once a candid economic definition of the draft is achieved, thatdefinition is used to outline the boundaries of a structure called a HumanValue System, which in turn is translated into the terms of game theory.The value of such a slave laborer is given in a Table of Human Values,a table broken down into categories by intellect, experience, post-servicejob demand, etc. Some of these categories are ordinary and can be tentativelyevaluated in terms of the value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists.Some jobs are harder to value because they are unique to the demands ofsocial subversion, for an extreme example: the value of a mother's instructionto her daughter, causing that daughter to put certain behavioral demandsupon a future husband ten or fifteen years hence; thus, by suppressinghis resistance to a perversion of a government, making it easier for abanking cartel to buy the State of New York in, say, twenty years. Such a problem leans heavily upon the observations and data of wartimeespionage and many types of psychological testing. But crude mathematicalmodels (algorithms, etc.) can be devised, if not to predict, at least topredetermine these events with maximum certainty. That does not exist bynatural cooperation is thus enhanced by calculated compulsion. Human beingsare machines, levers which may be grasped and turned, and there is littlereal difference between automating a society and automating a shoe factory.These derived values are variable. (It is necessary to use a current Tableof Human Values for computer analysis.) These values are given in truemeasure rather than U.S. dollars, since the latter is unstable, being presentlyinflated beyond the production of national goods and services so as togive the economy a false kinetic energy ("paper" inductance).The silver value is stable, it being possible to buy the same amount witha gram of silver today as could be bought in 1920. Human value measuredin silver units changes slightly due to changes in production technology. ENFORCEMENT FACTOR I As in every social system approach, stability is achieved onlyby understanding and accounting for human nature (action/reaction pat-terns). A failure to do so can be, and usually is, disastrous. As in otherhuman social schemes, one form or another of intimidation (or incentive)is essential to the success of the draft. Physical principles of actionand reaction must be applied to both internal and external subsystems.To secure the draft, individual brainwashing/programming and both the familyunit and the peer group must be engaged and brought under control. FACTOR II--FATHER The man of the household must be housebroken to ensurethat junior will grow up with the right social training and attitudes.The advertising media, etc., are engaged to see to it that father-to-beis pussy-whipped before or by the time he is married. He is taught thathe either conforms to the social notch cut out for him or his sex lifewill be hobbled and his tender companionship will be zero. He is made tosee that women demand security more than logical, principled, or honorablebehavior. By the time his son must go to war, father (with jelly for abackbone) will slam a gun into junior's hand before father will risk thecensure of his peers, or make a hypocrite of himself by crossing the investmenthe has in his own personal opinion or self-esteem. Junior will go to waror father will be embarrassed. So junior will go to war, the true purposenot withstanding. FACTOR III--MOTHER The female element of human society is ruled by emotionfirst and logic second. In the battle between logic and imagination, imaginationalways wins, fantasy prevails, maternal instinct dominates so that thechild comes first and the future comes second. A woman with a newborn babyis too starry-eyed to see a wealthy man's cannon fodder or a cheap sourceof slave labor. A woman must, however, be conditioned to accept the transitionto "reality" when it comes, or sooner. As the transition becomesmore difficult to manage, the family unit must be carefully disintegrated,and state-controlled public education and state-operated child-care centersmust become more common and legally enforced so as to begin the detachmentof the child from the mother and father at an earlier age. Inoculationof behavioral drugs [Ritalin] can speed the transition for the child (mandatory).CAUTION: A woman's impulsive anger can override her fear. An irate woman'spower must never be FACTOR IV--JUNIOR The emotional pressure for self-preservation duringtime of war and the self-serving attitude of the common herd that havean option to avoid the battlefield--if junior can be persuaded to go--isall of the pressure finally necessary to propel Johnny off to war. Theirquiet blackmailings of him are the threats: "No sacrifice, no friends;no glory, no girlfriends." FACTOR V--SISTER And what about junior's sister? She is given all thegood things of life by her father, and taught to expect the same from herfuture husband regardless of the price. FACTOR VI--CATTLE Those who will not use their brains are no betteroff than those who have no brains, and so this mindless school of jelly-fish,father, mother, son, and daughter, become useful beasts of burden or trainersof the same. [End of excerpt] WC/Author's Note: So now you know. This chapter could only come in thebeginning. Your preconceived ideas had to be shattered in order for youto understand the rest of this book. In this chapter you can see everystep that the elite have taken in their war to control this once greatnation. You can see the steps that will be taken in the future. You canno longer pretend innocence. Your denial of the conspiracy will fall ondeaf ears. This book is part of the education that will give Americansthe weapons needed in the coming months and years of hardship as the NewWorld Order struggles to be born. Many will argue that "Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars" is onlya bogus conglomeration of words for which the writer has never taken creditor responsibility. Those who do so ignore the self-evident truths containedwithin the document. They ignore these truths because they are an indictmentof their own ignorance, which they cannot face. The document, first found in 1969, correctly outlines events which subse-quently came to pass. It cannot be ignored or dismissed. The document isgenuine. Its truths cannot be negated or shrugged away. The message isthis: You must accept that you have been cattle and the ultimate consequenceof being cattle--which is slavery--or you must prepare to fight, and ifnecessary die to preserve your God-given right to Freedom. That last sentence is the real reason why people choose to ignore "SilentWeapons for Quiet Wars." People are not ready to admit that they havebeen cattle. They are not prepared to fight, and if necessary to die, forFreedom. It is an indictment of the citizens of the United States of America.And that is the total confirmation of the truth of the information containedin "Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars." ============================================================================= ARTICLE 7 The Anomalous Events of STS-48 by Vince Johnson The anomalous events during the shuttle Discovery mission STS-48 (launchedSeptember 12, 1991) were originally revealed by space enthusiasts who hadset their VCRs to record NASA Select TV, which at the time was downlinkedlive from each shuttle mission and distributed on cable and satellite TV.To record as much as possible, VCRs were set to record at slow speed (sixhour recordings) which resulted in less than optimal recordings. When therecordings were reviewed, anomalous objects were seen at several pointsin the mission. Although the existence of these recordings have been knownto MUFON and FUFOR since the fall of 1991, surprisingly, they were notmade public until Don Ecker appeared on "HardCopy," and later,"Larry King Live" with a poor copy of what has been termed Event2 in June of this year. After personally reviewing the video of Events1,2,3,4 and 6, some of which were obtained from the official NASA videoarchive, I can only surmise that the events are indeed anomalous and unexplained.The official NASA explanation of ice and debris seems unlikely due to thedifferent directions and speeds the objects appear to be traveling. Thefollowing is a chronology of the anomalous events of STS-48: EVENT 1 (9-13-91/ between 03:49 - 04:10 GMT) The camera shows a beautiful view from theforward cabin looking back through the cargo bay at the tail section withthe Earth filling the top of the screen. One-by-one, a series of five lightstravel radially from behind the tail section, comprising an arc. Then anextremely bright blinking light appears, traveling up from behind the leftengine. This bright light occupies the focus of the arc composed of thefive smaller lights. Then the camera inexplicably pans down into the cargobay, focusing on a piece of equipment there. After a minute, the groundcontroller requests that she be given control of the camera. After a shortpause, the astronaut complies. The camera then pans back up into the tailarea. The lights that were there just moments before are now gone. EVENT2 (9-15-91 / between 20:30 - 20:45 GMT) This scene shows the nightsideEarth filling most of the frame with the horizon extending from the upperleft of screen to the lower right. Black space is seen above the horizonat the screen's upper right. Clouds, bright city lights on the surface,and an intense lightning storm can be seen. The atmosphere is slightlyluminescent at the limb and is clearly discernible. Against this background,several lighted objects can be seen traveling slowly, apparently abovethe atmosphere. One of the larger objects (2A -see Event2a.GIF) appearsand slowly moves across the sky below. Another large object (2F) appearsnear the center of the screen, either traveling up through the atmospherefrom below, or through it at the limb and traveling towards the shuttle.This object travels slowly, parallel to the horizon, from lower right toupper left. Suddenly, a bright flash of light fills the screen. As theflash diminishes, two odd streaks of light emanate from the left. The objecttraveling parallel to the horizon executes an acute (less than 90 degree)turn and shoots off into space, dimming as it recedes. The upper of thetwo streaks would have intercepted the object traveling along the horizonif it had stayed on its course without making its sudden turn. The bottomstreak shoots off towards the right of the screen. Throughout Event 2,other lighted objects move across the field of view at varying speeds andheadings. Note: The official NASA explanation for this event is that icecrystals are being propelled by a shuttle attitude thruster being fired.The fact that the Earth does not appear to shift in the frame indicatesthat the shuttle's attitude is not changed and therefore, no thruster isbeing fired during this event. EVENT 3 (9-16-91 / 08:40 -09:10 GMT) Thisscene shows the sunlit Earth filling the screen. Other than cloud formations,no surface details are discernible. This clip can only be described aschaotic. There are dozens of objects streaking in every direction. Althoughsizes and distances cannot be calculated from the video alone, many ofthese objects appear to be descending into, and flying through the atmosphere.There is a similar streak as in Event 2 that intercepts one of the objects.After about 30- 45 seconds of this, a larger elliptical white object appearsin the extreme upper left corner of the frame. This object is visible foronly 5-6 frames before another camera is switched on showing the side ofthe shuttle with empty black space in the background. Note: Again, thereis no apparent change in the shuttle's orientation during this event, indicatingthat no thruster is being fired. Chronologically, Event 3 occurs afterEvent 4. The numbering system developed before all video was availableto researchers. EVENT 4 (9-15-91 / between 19:00 - 19:10 GMT) While fewdetails of the objects were apparent to me, researcher Vince DiPietro reportsthat a large bell-shaped object appears, and that other objects move fromthe bottom to the top of the screen. His analysis allegedly reveals thatseveral of these objects have an oblong shape, with sections of the objectsappearing to rotate at high speed. EVENT 5 (Video, date and time unavailable)According to Vince DiPietro, a large "tubular shaped" objectmoves from right to left. Also, DiPietro reports that a pulsating lightis seen at the top of the screen Note: HUFON Report has not seen videoof Event 5. According to our source, Ron Madeley, this event has been expungedfrom the official NASA STS-48 video archive, leaving a 14 minute gap inthe video's time code. If this is true, it would be irrefutable evidenceof a NASA cover-up. EVENT 6 (Date and time unavailable) The sunlit Earthfills the screen, with no surface details (other than clouds) discernible.A bright object enters the frame at left center and zips across the screenat high speed. When played in normal mode, the object seems to be a whitelight traveling in a smooth trajectory. When advanced frame-by-frame, theobject changes color from red to green to white. Instead of a smooth trajectory,the object can be seen to travel in short, discrete steps, with the aforementionedcolor changes cycling during each step. The object seems to disappear whileactually moving between each step. As a lifelong supporter of our spaceexploration efforts I have observed many hours of NASA footage. Never haveI seen events such as those recorded by STS-48. Lighted objects could mostcertainly be debris or ice crystals illuminated by the sun, however, Ican conceive of no possible scenario that could explain the objects thatare travelling in opposite directions. Presumably, thruster plumes shouldpropel debris in one direction only. Another potential explanation wouldbe meteor storms or space debris from previous launches. But again, theseexplanations cannot account for the observed trajectories . According toour source, NASA no longer distributes a live downlink from shuttle missions,instead using a delay similar to that used by talk radio stations to censoroffensive remarks. Sanitizing video downlink from shuttle missions, anddeleting sections of the official archives is not in the interest of thetaxpayers who fund NASA. The need for further official scientific inquiryis obvious. In the meantime, the anomalous events recorded by Discoveryastronauts during STS-48 can only be classified as UFOs, in the strictsense of the term. Note: Vince DiPietro's report to FUFOR (the Fund ForUFO Research) provided the descriptions of events for which video was unavailableto HUFON Report. Interestingly, DiPietro, a NASA employee at the GoddardSpace Flight Center now publicly endorses the "ice crystal" explanation.

Brazelwas used to summer thunderstorms, but he was suddenly brought wide awakeby a loud explosion that set the dishes in the kitchen sink dancing. Sonofabitch,he thought to himself before sinking back to sleep, the sheep will be scatteredhalfway between hell and high water come dawn. In the morning, Brazel rode out on horseback, accompanied by seven-year-oldTimothy Proctor, to survey the damage. According to published accounts,Brazel and young Proctor stumbled across something unearthly-a field oftattered debris two to three hundred yards wide stretching some three-quartersof a mile in length. No rocket scientist, Brazel still realized he hadsomething strange on his hands-so strange that he decided to haul severalpieces of it into Roswell, some 75 miles distant, a day or two later. For all its lightness, the debris in Brazel's pickup bed seemed remarkablydurable. Sheriff George Wilcox reportedly took one look at it and calledthe military at Roswell Army Air Field, then home to the world's only atomic-bombwing. Two officers from the base eventually arrived and agreed to accompanyBrazel back to the debris field. As a consequence of their investigation, a press release unique in thehistory of the American military appeared on the front page of RoswellDAily Record for July 8, 1947. Authored by public information officer Lt.Walter Haut and approved by base commander Col. William Blanchard, it admittedthat the many rumors regarding UFOs "became a reality yesterday whenthe intelligence office of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force,Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a discthrough the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff'soffice of Chaves County." Haut's noon press release circled the planet, reprinted in papers asfar abroad as Germany and England, where it was picked up by the prestigiousLondon Times. UFOs were real! Media calls poured in to the Roswell DailyRecord and the local radio station, which had first broken the news, demandingadditional details. Four hours later and some 600 miles to the east in Fort Worth, Texas,Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey, commander of the Eighth Air Force, held a pressconference to answer reporters' questions. Spread on the general's officefloor were lumps of a blackened, rubberlike material and crumpled piecesof what looked like a flimsy tinfoil kite. Ramey posed for pictures, kneelingon his carpet with the material, as did Maj. Jesse Marcel, flown in fromRoswell for the occasion. Alas, allowed the general, the Roswell incidentwas simple case of mistaken identity; in reality, the so-called recoveredflying disc was nothing more than a weather balloon with an attached radarreflector. "Unfortunately, the media bought the Air Force cover-up hook, line,and sinker," asserts Stanton Friedman, a nuclear physicist and coauthorwith aviation writer Don Berliner of Crash at Corona, one of three bookswritten about Roswell. "The weather balloon story went in the nextmorning's papers, the phone calls dropped off dramatically, and any chanceof an immediate follow-up was effectively squelched." Ramey's impromptu press conference marks the beginning of what Friedmanrefers to as a "'Cosmic Watergate,' the ongoing cover-up of the government'sknowledge about extraterrestrial UFOs and their terrestrial activities."By contrast, says Friedman, the original Watergate snafu and cover-up palesin significance. In fact, if Friedman and his cohorts within the UFO communityare correct, military involvement in the recovery of a crashed flying saucerwould rank as the most well-kept and explosive secret in world history. Of course, not all students of the subject see it that way. "Youhave to put Roswell in a certain context," cautions Curtis Peebles,an aerospace historian whose treatment of UFOs as an evolving belief systemin Watch the Skies! was just published by the Smithsonian Institute. "Andthe relevant context is the role of government and its relationship tothe governed. Americans have always been suspicious, if not actively contemptuous,of their government. On the other hand, forget what the government saysand look at what it does. Is there any evidence in the historical recordthat the Air Force or government behaved as if it actually owned a flyingsaucer presumably thousands of years in advance of anything on either theSoviet or U.S. side? If there, I didn't find it." Regardless of its ultimate reality, however, Roswell symbolizes thedifficulties and frustrations Friedman and fellow UFOlogists have encounteredin prying loose what the government does or does not know about UFOs. Memoriesfade, documents get lost or misplaced, witnesses die, and others refuseto speak up, either out of fear of ridicule, or according to Friedman,because of secrecy oaths. Despite a trail that lay cold for more than 30years, UFOlogists still consider Roswell one of the most convincing UFOcases on record. In 1978, for example, Friedman personally interviewedMaj. Jesse Marcel shortly before his death. "He still didn't knowwhat the material was," says Friedman, "except that it was likenothing he had ever seen before and certainly wasn't from any weather balloon."According to what Marcel reportedly told Friedman, in Fact, the featherlightmaterial couldn't be dented by a sledgehammer or burned by a blowtorch. Yet getting the Air Force itself to say anything about Roswell in particularof UFOs in general can be an exercise in futility. Officials are eitherbureaucratically vague or maddeningly abrupt. Maj. David Thurston, a Pentagonspokesperson for the Air Force Office of Public Affairs, could only referinquires to the Air Force Historical Research Center in Montgomery, Alabama,where unit histories are kept on microfilm for public review. But a spokespersonthere said they had no "investigative material" and suggestedchecking the National Archives for files from Project Blue Book, the AirForce's public UFO investigative agency from the late 1940s until its closurein December of 1969. Indeed, the dismissive nature with which U.S. officials treated BlueBook research seemed to indicate they were unimpressed; on that point,believers and skeptics alike agree. But according to Friedman and colleagues,that demeanor, and Blue Book itself, was a ruse. Instead far from the eyesof Blue Book patsies, in top-secret meetings of upper-echelon intelligenceofficers from military and civilian agencies alike, UFOs-including realcrashed saucers and the mangled bodies of aliens-were the subject of endlessstudy and debate. What's more, claims Friedman, proof of this UFO realitycan be found in the classified files of government vaults. With all this documentation, Friedman might have had a field day. Unfortunately,researchers had no mechanism for forcing classified documents to the surfaceuntil 1966, when Congress passed the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).The FOIA was later amended in the last year of the Nixon administration(1974) to include the Privacy Act. Now individuals could view their ownfiles, and some UFOlogists-Friedman included-were surprised to find thattheir personal UFO activities had resulted in government dossiers. Be that as it may, UFOlogists saw the FOIA as a means to an end, andbeginning in the 1970s, their requests and lawsuits started pouring in.Attorneys for the Connecticut based Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS)and other UFO activists eventually unleashed a flood tide of previouslyclassified UFO documents. In many cases, notes Barry Greenwood, director of research for CAUSand coauthor with Lawrence Fawcett of The Government UFO Cover-up, mostagencies at first denied they had any such documents in their files. "Acase in point is the CIA," says Greenwood, "which assured usthat its interest and involvement in UFOs ended in 1953. After a lengthylawsuit, the CIA ultimately released more than ten thousand pages of documentspertaining to UFOs, the overwhelming majority of which were from the CIA,FBI, Air Force, and various other military agencies. It's safe to say thereare probably that many more we haven't seen." As might be expected, the UFO paper trail is a mixed bag. Many of thedocuments released are simply sighting reports logged well after the demiseof Blue Book. Others are more tantalizing. A document released by the NorthAmerican Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) revealed that several sensitivemilitary bases scattered from Maine to Montana were temporarily put onalert status following a series of sightings in October and November of1975. An Air Force Office of Special Intelligence document reported a landedlight seen near Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, on thenight of August 8, 1980. Another warm and still-smoking gun, according to Greenwood, is the socalled Bolender memo, named after its author, Brig. Gen. C. H. Bolender,then Air Force deputy director of development. Dated October 20, 1969,it expressly states that "reports of unidentified flying objects whichcould affect national security. . .are not part of the Blue Book system."Says Greenwood, "I take that to mean that Blue Book was little morethan an exercise in public relations. The really significant reports wentsomewhere else. Where did they go? That's what we would like to know." Of course there are objections to such a literal interpretation. "AsI understand the context in which it was written," says Phillip Klass,a former senior editor with Aviation Week and Space Technology and authorof UFOs: The Public Deceived, "the Bolender memo tried to addressthe problem of what would happen with UFO reports of any sort followingthe closure of Project Blue Book. Bolender was simply saying that otherchannels for such reports, be they incoming Soviet missiles or whatever,already existed." Greenwood counters that the original memo speaks for itself, addingthat "the interesting thing is that sixteen referenced attachmentsare presently reported as missing from Air Force files." Missing files are one problem. Files known to exists but kept underwraps, notes Greenwood, are another. To make his point, he cites a caseinvolving the ultrasecret National Security Agency, or NSA, an acronymoften assumed by insiders to mean "Never Say Anything." Usingcross references found in CIA and other intelligence-agency papers, CAUSattorneys filed for the release of all NSA documents pertaining to theUFO phenomenon. After initial denials, the NSA admitted to the existenceof some 160 such documents but resisted their release on the grounds ofnational security. Federal District Judge Gerhard Gessell upheld the NSA's request forsuppression following a review (judge's chambers only) of the agency'sclassified 21-page In Camera petition. "Two years later," Greenwoodsays, "we finally got a copy of the NSA In Camera affidavit. Of 582lines, 412, or approximately 75 percent, were completely blacked out. Thegovernment can't have it both ways. Either UFOs affect national securityor they don't." The NSA's blockage of the CAUS suit only highlights the shortcomingsof the Freedom of Information Act, according to Friedman. "The Americanpublic operates under the illusion that the FOIA is some sort of magicalkey that will unlock all the the government's secret vaults," he says,"that all you have to do is ask. They also seem to think everythingis in one big computer file somewhere deep in the bowels of the Pentagon,when nothing could be farther from the truth. Secrecy thrives on compartmentalization." In recent years, UFOlogists have found an unusual ally in the personof Steven Aftergood, an electrical engineer who directs the Project onGovernment and Secrecy for the Washington, DC-based Federation of AmericanScientists, where most members wouldn't ordinarily give UFOs the time ofday. "Our problem," says Aftergood, "is with governmentsecrecy on principle, because it widens the gap between citizens and government,making it that much more difficult to participate in the democratic process.It's also antithetical to peer review and cross-fertilization, two naturalprocesses conducive to the growth of both science and technology. Bureaucraticsecrecy is also prohibitively expensive." Aftergood cites some daunting statistics in his favor. Despite campaignpromises by a succession of Democratic and Republican presidential administrationsto make government files more publicly accessible, more than 300 milliondocuments compiled prior to 1960 in the National Archives alone still awaitdeclassification. Aftergood also points to a 1990 Department of Defensestudy, which estimated the cost of protecting industrial-not military-secretsat almost $14 billion a year. "That's a budget about the size of NASA's,"he says, adding that "the numbers were ludicrous enough during theCold War, but now that the Cold War is supposedly over, they're even moreludicrous." Could the Air Force and other government agencies have their own hiddenagenda for maintaining the reputed Cosmic Watergate? Yes, according tosome pundits who say UFOs may be our own advanced super-top-secret aerialplatforms, not extraterrestrial vehicles from on high. Something of thesort could be occurring at the supersecret Groom Lake test facility inNevada, part of the immense Nellis Air Force Base gunnery range north ofLas Vegas. Aviation buffs believe the Groom Lake runway, one of the world'slongest, could be home to the much-rumored Aurora, reputed to be a hypersonicMach-8 spy plane and a replacement for the recently retired SR-71 Blackbird. In fact, the Air Force routinely denies the existence of Aurora. Andwith Blue Book a closed chapter, it no longer has to hold press conferencesto answer reporters' questions about UFOs. From the government's perspective,the current confusion between terrestrial technology and extraterrestrialUFOs could be a marriage of both coincidence and convenience. The Air Forcedoesn't seem to be taking chances. On September 30 of last year, it initiatedprocedures to seize another 3,900 acres adjoining Groom Lake, effectivelysealing off two public viewing sites of a base it refuses to admit exists. By perpetuating such disinformation, if that is, in fact, what's happening,the Air Force might be using a page torn from the Soviet Union's Cold Warplaybook. James Oberg, a senior space engineer and author of Red Star inOrbit, a critical analysis of the Soviet space program, has long arguedthat Soviet officials remained publicly mum about the widely reported RussianUFOs in the 1970s and 1980s because such reports masked military operationsconducted at the supersecret Plesetsk Cosmodrome. "Could a similarscenario occur in this country? It's conceivable," concedes oberg."On the other hand, should our own government take an interest inUFO reports, especially those that may reflect missile or space technologyfrom around the world? Sure. I'd be dismayed if we didn't. But does itfollow that alien-acquired technology recovered as Roswell is driving ourown space technology program? I don't see any outstanding evidence forit." Friedman's counterargument is not so much a technological as a politicalone. "Governments and nations demand allegiance in order to survive,"he says. "They don't want us thinking in global terms, as a citizenof a planet as opposed to a particular political entity, because that wouldthreaten their very existence. The impact on our collective social, economic,and religious structures of admitting that we have been contacted by anotherintelligent life form would be enormous if not literally catastrophic tothe political powers that be." Whatever its reason for holding large numbers of documents and an arrayof information close to the vest, there's no doubt that the U.S. governmenthas been less than forthcoming on the topic of UFOs. Historically, thegovernment's public attitude toward UFOs has run the gamut of human emotions,at times confused and dismissive, at others deliberately covert and coy.On one hand, it claims to have recovered a flying disc; on the other, aweather balloon. One night UFOs constitute a threat to the national security;the next they are merely part of a public hysteria based on religious feelings,fear of technology, mass hypnosis, or whatever the prevailing psychologyof the era will bear. To sort through the layers of confusion spawned bythe governments stance and to reveal informational chasms, whatever thecause, Omni is launching a series of six continuing articles. In the followingmonths, we will take the long view, scanning through the history to examineUFOs under wraps in the decades following Roswell. In the next installment,look for our report on official efforts to squelch UFO mania and keep tabson UFO researchers in the McCarthy-era landscape of the Fifties. *END* **************************************************************************** PART I.a FREEDOM FIGHTERS HANDBOOK: THE OFFICIAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT HOW-TOFOR INVESTIGATING UFOs By Paul McCarthy Many people think the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), passed by Congressin 1966, gives an American citizen automatic access to any government document.Not so. UFO researchers have found that it gives them the right to request,but government agencies retain the right to deny-as they often do. In fact, applicants find, FOIA requests may be stymied by any numberof exemptions. When information if related to criminal investigations,pending policy deliberations, national security considerations, or whenit violates an individual's privacy, the FOIA application is denied. Theapplicant can appeal, of course, and if he or she loses, may take the caseto federal court-but who has the money? On top of that, FOIA requests arenot a priority with the government, so some agencies have backlogs thatwon't be acted upon for years. On other occasions, UFO investigators suspecttheir petitions are acted upon too quickly and end up in the circular file. Yet thousands of pages of UFO documents have been pried loose over thepast 20 years. None clinch the case for a government cover-up of UFO activity,but they, along with the cross-referencing of other documents and insidertips, hold out the intriguing possibility that the government is clingingto hundreds of thousands of pages of files for the diligent or luck tounearth. Hoping to satisfy our readers' fascination for government secretsnew and old, the following handbook details some of the most tantalizingFOIA requests and provides tips on tapping the government for more. YOUR EYES ONLY: OMNI'S TOP TIPS FOR ACCESSING CLASSIFIED MATERIAL ONUFOs ON THE DOCKET UFOlogists list the most dramatic attempts to pry loosedocuments still marked classified. The Big Fish. The most important FOIA UFO case ever, according to UFOresearcher Stanton Friedman, was filed in 1979 against the CIA. CitizensAgainst UFO Secrecy (CAUS), an Alexandria, Virginia, organization headedby Larry Byrant, joined with others, including Friedman, to go after allUFO documents in the possession of the CIA. The CIA responded that it coulddo nothing because the documents it had were issued by other agencies andcould only be released by them. Of those, CAUS went after 18 National SecurityAgency (NSA) documents, but the NSA would not release them, claiming theywould reveal "sources and methods." CAUS filed an admini-strativeappeal with the NSA and lost. It then went to federal court, and the judgeordered NSA to search its files for UFO documents. Surprise: 239 documentsshowed up-79 from other unnamed agencies, 23 from the CIA, and 137 unexpectedNSA bonus documents. Still, the NSA refused to release them, and the judge,after reading the NSA's justification, agreed. Under a later FOIA actions,the CIA released 9 of its 23 documents, mostly unimportant abstracts ofEastern European press stories on UFOs. Adding the original 18 NSA documentsthat CAUS sought to the newly uncovered batch of 137 shows that the NSAheld on to 155 while the CIA retained 11. In addition, 79 documents fromother agencies never saw the light of day-proof, according to Friedman,that the government can keep a secret. Project Moon Dust. Projects Moon Dust and Blue Fly are purportedly effortsaimed at retrieving manmade space objects that reenter the atmosphere andcrash. Clifford Stone, a retired U.S. Army sergeant with an interest inUFOs, has been trying to get the military to admit that it runs these projectsand that it also recovers downed UFOs. Stone claims that the 696th IntelligenceGroup at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, makes these retrievals, andhe has even submitted an FOIA request for the group's UFO files. Records from Roswell. The Roswell case, in which a UFO is said to havecrashed near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947, continues to haunt researchersand to draw numerous FOIA requests. In one of these, Don Schmitt, a researcherfrom the Center for UFO Studies in Illinois and coauthor with Kevin Randleof the 1991 book UFO Crash at Roswell, has filed an FOIA request on behalfof the family of Mac Brazel, the rancher who found the purported UFO wreckage."Specifically, we wanted to see the results of a medical examinationallegedly given to Brazel by the United STates Army after he made his discovery,"Schmitt explains. "The Army denied that it had records on Brazel ofany soft, even though Brazel served in the Army during WWII." Secret Sins. Is there a secrecy oath signed by military personnel involvedwith UFOs? Many UFO investigators, including Don Schmitt, claim to haveactive-duty and retired military witnesses who will talk privately butnot openly about UFOs and the government for fear of losing pensions. Schmittawaits the results of an FOIA request submitted to the Army, Navy, andAir Force on whether or not an oath of secrecy actually exists. X Marks the Spot. Another facet of the Roswell case concerns a UnitedPress International (UPI) reporter who supposedly told Schmitt that inthe early 1960s, a public-information officer (PIO) at Holloman Air ForceBase showed him a map of the Roswell crash site and even drove him outto look at it. Schmitt's FOIA asks for the name of the PIO and seeks tolearn whether he ever worked with a UPI reporter in the early Sixties. Name, Rank, and Serial Number. Schmitt would also like to obtain therecords of an ultimately locate 30 military personnel who allegedly workedat Roswell Air Force Base in 1947. He submitted an FOIA with their namesand serial numbers, asking for access to their complete records. The AirForce responded that it had no records on those individuals. Operation Majestic. The MJ-12 documents-short for Operation Majestic-turnedup in microfilm form in the mailbox of Jaime Shadera, a UFO investigator,back in 1984. Although most UFO researchers now believe the documents arephony, some say they may be evidence of a top-secret briefing given topresident-elect Dwight Eisenhower in November 1952 by Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter,then-director of the CIA. After spending considerable time and money trying to verify these documents,Stanton Friedman put in an FOIA request in 1989. He thought he could studythe authenticity of the controversial MJ-12 documents by comparing themto other CIA briefings of like. Friedman learned the times and dates ofthese additional briefings in archival research and using that specificinformation requested the documents from the CIA. Two years later, theCIA responded that it could not find any such briefing documents. Friedmanappealed but was told he was number 390 on the list. He is still waitingfor a response. FOIA Wannabes. Fred Olsen III would like to submit an FOIA request tothe Air Force that asks for the guncamera photos of UFOs that former militarypilots claim were taken during the 1940s and 1950s. Don Schmitt would liketo submit an FOIA request to the Air Force on the contents and purposeof a mysterious military transport plan said to have departed from RoswellAir Force Base under tight security on July 9, 1947. FOIA TIPS For those sturdy souls who wish to buck the tide, it is sometimes possibleto successfully wield the Freedom of Information Act to dredge up informationburied deep. To help the uninitiated work the system and uncover as muchas possible, FOIA pro Don Schmitt of the Center for UFO Studies providesthree useful tips: * UFOlogists believe petitions may be screened for buzzwords like UFO,which tip officials off to give the request prejudicial treatment, so researcherstry to be creative. "We never refer to Roswell by name," saysSchmitt, "and in the last five years, I have not made an FOIA requestin which I specifically referred to UFOs." * Schmitt and other FOIAexperts often request paragraphs, even sentences, not in classified documentsjust to see whether the agency has any information on the topic at all.The technique also confuses officials, preventing them from pigeonholingthe request as UFO related, thus encouraging them to give it a higher priorityand push it through. * Hoping to stop the government in efforts to pullthe wool over their eyes, UFO researchers often request documents theyknow for a fact exist. "We often try to trip them up," Schmittexplains. "We sent in our request; they deny it. Then we send copiesof specific documents that refer to the documents they claim they don'thave." SIDE-STEPPING THE FOIA The frustrations of filing an FOIA being whatthey are, a number of UFO researchers have now evolved alternative strategiesfor prying documents from government vaults. A couple of the most prominentefforts are detailed below. MOON DUST II. Cliff Stone's requests to the Air Force and Defense IntelligenceAgency for projects Moon Dust and Blue Fly information were unsuccessful,so he's making similar requests through the office of Senator Jeff Bingamanof New Mexico who is working with the Pentagon's Congressional LiaisonOffice on this issue. Remember, you are part of a constituency; your representativecan help. Operation Right to Know. In 1992, Operation Right to Know was formedby three Mutual UFO Network members who felt political action was the onlyway to wrest secrets from the government. They passed out UFO literatureon the ellipse behind the White House in 1992, picketed in front of theWhite House in 1993, and demonstrated outside the United Nations buildingin New York in November 1993. Operation Right to Know now has more than200 members, is growing wit European chapters, and will probably picketfor access to government UFO information in a city near you. *END* **************************************************************************** PART I.b INSIDE THE MILITARY: UFO UNDERGROUND Article by A.J.S. Rayl In 1969,Project Blue Book-the 16-year U.S. Air Force investigation of UFOs-cameto an end, and so did the government's interest in extraterrestrial flyingdiscs. Of so the American public has been told. In recent years, numerousindividuals and documents from various agencies have emerged from behindthe veil of government secrecy to tell a different story. Their spin: thatwhile the government officially abandoned all interest in UFOs, a secretmilitary underground was hot on the trail of suspicious radar blips, saucers,and even the aliens themselves. What follows are the stories of three individuals-twoof whom come with impressive military credentials; they say they have glimpsedwhat seems like evidence of a decades-old cover-up cloaked in the guiseof national security. The third interviewee, a propulsion-system engineer,claims he was hired by an independent military contractor to study theinnards of an extraterrestrial spacecraft being researched and tested onthe Nellis Air Range in central Nevada. Omni cannot endorse the veracity of the stories told below. In fact,we must emphasize that extraordinary tales like these require extraordinarylevels of proof certainly not furnished in our pages, nor, we feel, anywhereelse. That said, we'll get to the fun part. In the pages that follow, you'llfind strange tales of alien intrigue and UFO woe. Decide for yourself:Are these the ravings of demented hoaxers and madmen or revelations oftruth? Their stories, delivered in dossier format, have been edited frominterviews conducted by author A.J.S. Rayl during the past year. NATO Meets E.T. Name: Robert O. Dean, retired Army command sergeant major Claim: Back in the Sixties, NATO issued a classified report statingthat UFOs were real, of extraterrestrial origin, and had visited the earth.This extraordinary report was said to come our of NATO's command center,the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE), located then justoutside of Paris, France. Background: Dean, a highly decorated veteran, served on the front linesin both Korea and Vietnam. In 1963, while assigned to the Supreme HeadquartersOperations Center (SHOC), SHAPE's war room, headed up by then-supreme alliedcommander of Europe, Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer, Dean claims he was able to readthe detailed 12-inch-thick NATO report on UFOs. The Story: "SHAPE was one of those choice assignments. You hadto have a spotless record and pass security background checks. I appliedon a whim and got it. I was very proud and pleased. At SHAPE, I was putthrough more security checks, given a Cosmic Top Secret (yes, this is areal term) clearance, the highest NATO has, and assigned to the SupremeHeadquarters Operations Center, known as SHOC, the NATO war room. In thosedays, the activity would run hot and cold and much of it would depend onhow the Soviets wanted to play it. The most intriguing thing to me wasthat we were continually having a problem with large, metallic, circularobjects that would appear over central Europe; these were reported as visualphenomena by our pilots and appeared on radar as well. Some flew in formation,and most of the time we spotted them coming out of the Soviet Union, overEast Germany, West Germany, France, and then they would often circle somewhereover the English Channel and head north, disappearing from NATO radar overthe Norwegian Sea. These objects were very large, moving very fast, atvery high altitudes-higher than we could reach at the time-and they seemedobviously under intelligent control. "I was told this had been goingon for some time and that in February 1961 there had been quite a scare.Fifty of these objects were spotted on radar and headed in formation fromthe Soviet Union toward Europe, flying at about 100,000 feet. The Sovietshad closed all borders. Everybody went to red alert. All hell broke loose.We really thought 'The War' had started. We scrambled. We knew the Russianswere scrambling. It was the largest number of these objects that had beenseen. Fortunately -and only by the grace of God-we didn't start bombingand neither did the Russians. In nine minutes, they were gone. "I was told that then-Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Europe,Sir Thomas Pike, had been repeatedly requesting information from Londonand Washington about these objects, but nothing would ever come. We foundout later that the Columbine-Topaz spy ring in Paris was intercepting everythingand forwarding it to the KGB, which often got intelligence informationeven before we did. So Pike decided, I was told, to develop an in-housestudy to determine whether these objects were a military threat. "In the meantime, the UFO matter literally brought about the establishmentof direct communication between the East and West in 1962, which I havealways found interesting and ironic. We had pretty well determined by thattime that these were not Russian craft, and the Russians had determinedthey were not ours. So, we came to an understanding, and a direct telephoneline was opened between SHOC and the Warsaw Pact Headquarters Command.Of course, a setup was always a possibility, so we had backup ways of checkingout whether the Russians were being truthful. But since we were both armedto the teeth and World War III was just ticking away, it was a logicalstep in the right direction. That idea developed into the hotline betweenthe president of the United States and the soviet premier, following theCuban Missile Crisis. "Well, by the time I arrived in 1963, everybody had been talkingabout the study, and I had heard the rumors, seen the blips on radar, witnessesthe commotions, and some of us occasionally even talked about the possibilities.But nothing really prepared me for what I started to read in the earlymorning hours one night in January 1964. "It was about 2:00 a.m. and a relatively quiet night when the SHOCcontroller on duty went into the vault and came out with this huge document.'Take a look at this,' he said. The title was simply Assessment: An Evaluationof a Possible Military Threat to Allied Forces in Europe. It was numbered,#3, stamped Cosmic Top Secret, had eight inches worth of appendices, dozensof photographs, and had been signed into the vault by German colonel HeinzBerger, SHOC's head of security: I quickly learned that it was based ontwo and a half years of research, was funded by NATO money, and that only15 copies were published-in English, German, and French. Each one was numbered.All were classified and ordered to be kept under lock and key. "Every time I got the chance, from then until I left, I would reada section or two in it. It was the most intriguing document I'd ever read.It was put together by military representatives of every NATO nation andalso included contributions from some of the greatest scientific minds.These objects were violating all of our known laws of physics, and thestudy team had gone to Cambridge, Oxford, the Sorbonne, MIT, and othermajor universities for input on chemistry, physics, atmospheric physics,biology, history, psychology, and even theology, all of which were separateappendices. "I read about theories on Einstein's sought-after unified-fieldtheory, the high radiation at various landing sites, and UFO reports thatdated back to the Roman era and up to our own F105 pilots' sightings andencounters, and on and on. I had always been a skeptic, but this report,well . . . it concluded that this stuff was not science fiction. "I read about contact encounters. One incident that had just happenedin 1963 involved a landing on a Danish farm. According to the report, thefarmer went aboard with the two little beings and two more human-lookingmen who spoke to him in Danish. The report included parts of his interrogationby government authorities and their conclusions that he was telling thetruth. In another incident, according to the reports, a craft landed onan Italian airfield and offered to take an Italian sergeant for a ride.He wet his pants-that's what it said-and was so scared, he didn't go. "The appendix that really got to me was titled 'Autopsies.' I sawpictures of a 30-meter disc that had crashed in Timmensdorfer, Germany,near the Baltic Sea in 1961. The British Army, according to the report,got there first and put up a perimeter. The craft had landed in very soft,loamy soil near the Russian border and so hadn't destructed, but one-thirdof it was buried in. We and the Russians, who also quickly showed up, hadboth tracked it. "inside, there were 12 small bodies, all dead. There were picturesof the bodies, which looked like the beings known as the 'grays,' beinglaid out and then put on stretchers and loaded into jeeps, and autopsyphotos, too. Some of the little grays appeared to not be a reproductive-capablespecies. The autopsy guys concluded, according to the report, that it lookedas if they had any system for elimination. "The craft itself was cut up like a pie into six pieces, put onlowboys and hauled off. Scuttlebutt was that it was given to the Americansand flown to Wright-Patterson Air Force base in Ohio. I looked at all thesepictures and couldn't believe it. My skin got cold and I thought, My God.I had never really believed we were all alone in the universe, but thiswas hard to swallow. "The major conclusions in the NATO report blew me away. There werefive: 1) The planet and human race had been the subject of a detailed surveyof some kind by several different extraterrestrial civilizations, fourof which they had identified visually. One race looked almost indistinguishablefrom us. Another resembled humans in height, stature, and structure, butwith a very gray, pasty skin tone. The third race is now popularly knownas the grays, and the fourth was described as reptilian, with verticalpupils and lizardlike skin. 2) These alien visitations had been going on for a very long time, atleast 200 years-perhaps longer. 3) The extraterestrials did not appear hostile since if that were theirintent they would have already demonstrated their malevolence. 4) UFO appearances and quick disappearances as well as the flybys weredemonstrations conducted on purpose to show us some of their capabilities. 5) A process or program of some soft seemed to be underway since flybysprogressed to landings and eventually contact. "I wanted so badly to copy this thing. I did take a photographof the cover sheet, which wasn't in and of itself classified. But I didn'twant to wind up in Fort Leavenworth. So instead I would go to the bathroomand take notes-surreptitiously, very carefully. "I have been through an awful lot in my life, but I've never beenable to just walk away from that report. I know that I'm taking a chanceby violating my oaths. But this is the most important issue of our times-sodammed important that I can't think of anything more important, and thepublic has been deceived and completely kept in the dark about all of thisfor all these years. It's the biggest scientific, political scandal ever.Besides, what have I got to lose? I'm 64 years old now. Are they goingto bump me off? I have told the truth. My integrity and credibility stand.When is our government going to tell the truth?" Update: After 27 years of military service, Dean retired and began another14-year career with the Pima County Sheriff's Department Emergency Servicesin Tuscon, Arizona. In 1990, he gave a lecture at the University of Arizonain which he talked about UFOs. The talk garnered local media coverage.Afterward, he was denied a promotion at the Sheriff's Department, because,he alleged, be believed in UFOs. Dean filed suit and won an out-of-courtsettlement in March 1992. Now retired, Dean has become a member of severalUFO organizations and has begun giving occasional lectures. He is workingthrough "any and all legitimate channels" to uncover a copy ofthe NATO document and to gather witnesses for an open Congressional hearingon the subject of UFOs. Official Response: "Our list of classified documents generatedby SHAPE at that time does not include any with titles similar to thatcited by Mr. Dean," says Lt. Col. Rainer Otte, German Force, deputychief, media section of the public-information office at SHAPE. "Fileson military personnel are in all circumstances kept under national control.Information on the security clearance that Mr. Dean held may-if ever-onlybe released by U.S. authorities." The Critics' Corner: "This is a fascinating story, but fantasticclaims like these need more than one man's testimony to be credible,"says Jerome Clark of the Center for UFO Studies. "Unless independentverification comes forth, this remains only an intriguing anecdote, notunlike many others that have circulated since the early UFO era." Project Galileo Name: Bob Lazar, independent contract scientist and businessman Claim: To have worked as a propulsion-system engineer in late 1988 andearly 1989 on one of nine extraterrestrial spacecraft being researchedand tested on the Nellis Air Range in central Nevada. Background: From 1982 to 1984, Lazar claims he worked at Los AlamosNational Laboratory in New Mexico in the Meson Physics lab with a Q-levelsecurity clearance. In 1985, while on vacation in Nevada, he wound up buyinginto a legal Reno brothel; the investment proved so profitable that hedidn't have to return to full-time employment for a while. He moved toNevada in 1986. In 1988, he wanted to get back into scientific work andwas hired, he says, to work on the top-secret Project Galileo. Lazar passeda lie-detector test in 1989, arranged by George Knapp, then an anchormanfor KLAS-TV, the CBS affiliate in Las Vegas, Nevada, for a special locallyaired series, UFOs: The Best Evidence. The Story: "In 1988, I decided to reenter the scientific communityand sent resumes to various people. Finally, I interviewed with a placementfirm to work for the Department of Naval Intelligence in a civilian capacity,and in the fall of 1988, I was hired on an on-call basis to work on a projectinvolving advanced propulsion systems. At that point, that's all I knew. "Not long after, I was flown along with several others out to area51 on the Nellis Air Range. There, we were put on a bus with blacked-outwindows and driven about 15 miles south to the Papoose dry lake bed, borderedby the Papoose Mountains, where there was an installation they called 'S4.' "I was introduced to my supervisor and a co-worker and then givena stack of briefings on various projects, including Project Galileo, whichwas devoted to the study of nine disc-shaped extraterrestrial craft thatwere somehow acquired by the U.S. government. "I was assigned back engineering tasks on the reactor and gravity-propulsionsystem of one of the discs-essentially to help figure out what made itwork. I don't know whether it was a crash retrieval, although I doubt it,because the disc didn't appear damaged in any way. In the briefing reports,there were pictures of several discs along with some of the informationthey had already obtained from back engineering research. "I was stunned and exhilarated at the same time. But there werewell-armed guards everywhere, and this place wasn't exactly the kind ofenvironment where you could just start asking any and every question youhad. Security, in fact, was oppressive. You were escorted everywhere, eventhe bathroom. And if your I.D. badge was just the slightest bit out ofplace, you would be tackled by a guard and held with a gun to your headuntil your supervisor arrived. And the guards lived for that. "At times, the whole thing seemed just surreal. There was a posterof the disc I was working on, which I dubbed the Sport Model, on severalwalls. It read, They're here. "I dealt with only the power sources and propulsion systems onone of the discs, and I did enter that one disc on several occasions. Thedisc was approximately 15 feet tall and about 52 feet in diameter. It hadthe appearance of brushed stainless steel or brushed aluminum. I didn'trun a test on it, so I don't know if it was metal, but I did run my handsdown the side of it getting in, and it felt cold, like metal, and it lookedlike metal. It had no physical seams, no welds or bolts or rivets, andit looked as if it were injection molded. "Inside, there were tiny little seats, much too small to comfortablyhandle an average-sized human. I bumped my head on the ends of the craft,so I concluded that the ceiling curved down to below five feet, 11 inchesinside. There was not a right angle cut anywhere in the craft. Everythinghad a smooth curve to it. "The reactor, which produced anti-matter and then reacted it withmatter in an annihilation reaction, was only about 18 inches in-diameterand 12 inches tall and was located in the center of the disc. It operatedlike a tiny ballet, where everything that happened relied on the effectbefore it. The way it accelerated protons inside of it, the was the heatwas converted to electricity, was totally smooth without any wasted heator latent energy. It was phenomenal, approaching a 100-percent dynamicefficiency. Now that seems impossible when you consider the laws of thermodynamics.All I can say is that this technology is well beyond anything that we nowknow with our twentieth century knowledge. "The reactor is fueled with an element that is not found here onEarth. Part of my contribution to the program was to find out where thiselement plugged into the periodic chart. Well, it didn't plug in anywhere,so we placed it at an atomic number of 115. It has been theorized for sometime that elements around 113, 114, and 115 may become stable and nonradioactive,and this is apparently what we were seeing. Element 115 is a stable element,but one with some interesting properties. It can be used inside the reactoras a fuel, but also as the source of an energy field accessed and amplifiedby the craft's gravity amplifiers. In other words, the craft was both fueledand propelled by virtue of element 115. "There was a storage of silver-dollar-sized discs of element 115from which triangular wedges were cut and put into the reactor. It wasa copper-orange color and extremely heavy. While it was not radioactive,we assumed it was a toxic material and consequently handled it as such. "In all the discs at S4, there were three gravity amplifiers positionedin a triad at the base of the craft. These were the propulsion devices.Essentially, what they did was amplify gravity waves out of phase withthose of the earth. The craft operated in two modes-omicron and delta,which indicated how many gravity amplifiers were in use. In the omnicronconfiguration, only one amplifier was used; the other two were swung outof the way and tucked inside the disc. In omnicron mode, the crafts canessentially rise and hover but do little else. To leave the atmosphere,however, all three gravity amplifiers have to be powered up and focusedon the desired location. Finally, the crafts do not travel in a linearmode. Rather, we determined that the discs produced their own gravitationalfields in order to distort time and space and essentially pull their destinationsto them. "One afternoon, my colleagues and I walked out onto the dry lakebed. The disc on which we had been working, the Sport Model, had alreadybeen moved out of the hangar and was beginning to lift off. Except fora slight hissing, it made no noise. It lifted to about 30 feet off theground. The hissing stopped, and it just hung silently in the air, movingto the left, then right. It was absolutely amazing. "The was information is compartmentalized, that's all the hands-oninformation and experience I was allowed to have access to, though we weregiven the chance on occasion and only for short periods of time to readbriefing reports that detailed other aspects of this project. The reportsI read that dealt with power and propulsion systems were accurate, andI proved that to myself by working on the system. Still, I draw a hardline between what I know to be true and what I read in the other briefingreports. "With that understanding, I did read reports about the origin ofthis disc. According to one of the briefings, it came from the Zeta Reticulistar system. Now obviously I didn't fly in a craft or go to that star system,so I don't really know if it came from there. I didn't speak to any aliensor see any, so I don't know if they exist or not. That report also saidthat contact was made at a certain date; however, all the dates were incode. Also, according to the report, these beings told our officials thatthey had been coming here for 10,000 years, that humans are the productof externally corrected evolution, and that they were integral to the acceleratedevolution of man. "My tolerance for the intensive security rapidly diminished. Becauseof the 24-hour telephone surveillance, they found out I was having maritalproblems and told me the situation had made me a candidate for 'emotionalinstability.' They then took my security clearance and told me I couldreapply in six months. "Well, I knew the test schedule, and I couldn't resist, so onenight I decided to show some friends from a distance what I had been workingon. We all caravaned out into the desert where we watched a test flight.We got away with it that time, so we started coming back again and again. "Anyway, the third time we got caught by the Wackenhut Securityguards out on the Bureau of Land Management land that surrounds the range.They turned me in. Needless to say, officials at Nellis weren't happy.I went through a debriefing and was threatened at that time. I was scaredand felt that I needed to break away from this before I couldn't. "Not only did I believe this technology should be given to thegreater scientific community, but I also believed my only protection wasto get the story out. A friend convinced me to talk to George Knapp atKLAS-TV. I figured if they killed me, then it would simply prove that whatI was saying was true. "There are many scientists who theorize that there simply cannotbe extraterrestrial discs here, that aliens could not possibly have comehere specifically, because the distance traveled is too great and the energyrequired is too awesome, and that there's no relatively quick way to gothat distance even at the speed of light. What I reported is what I experienced,though in some respects I regret going public. If I had it to do over again,I might be more inclined to stay on as one of the boys." Update: In 1990, after Lazar says he was released from Project Galileo,he accepted a freelance job setting up a database and surveillance systemfor an illegal Las Vegas brothel. That gig eventually garnered him sixfelony counts, including aiding and abetting a prostitute, running a houseof prostitution, and living off the earnings of a prostitute. The chargeswere quickly dropped to a single felony count of pandering. The one goodthing that came out of the resulting trial, Lazar says, is that he's notbeing followed anymore-at least not to his knowledge. "I guess theyfigured the pandering conviction discredited me," he comments. Lazar currently earns a living from his two small companies, an independentcontracting firm that repairs nuclear devices, and a photo lab. He alsobuilds and races jetcars. And, every year since 1984, on the weekend beforeJuly 4, he has staged Desert Blast, which he says is the "largestillegal fireworks show in the West." This annual pyrotechnic extravaganzafeatures huge fireworks and assorted gas bombs made by Lazar and friendsas well as jetcar demonstrations and a little semiautomatic weapons venting.Lazar recently sold his movie rights and is working on a new home video. Official Response: "The Air Force comment is that there is no commenton anything that goes on at the Nellis Range," says Air Force MasterSgt. J. C. Marcom of Public Affairs. Meanwhile, according to TechnicalSergeant Henderson of Public Affairs, "The Air Force has no recordthat Lazar ever worked at Nellis Air Force Base, though we have compiledan extensive list of inquiries as to his status." The Critics Corner: "We've pretty well determined that Lazar didwork at Los Alamos, but it's been impossible to verify exactly what hedid," says Mark Rodeghier, scientific director of the Center for UFOStudies. "As for element 115, physicists admit that such an elementis theoretically possible, but we don't know how to manufacture it or whereto get it. So, Lazar's claim to have worked with this element is not necessarilyinsane, but it's completely unverifiable. Finally, he seems to know enoughto have really worked at Area 51 or Dreamland where secret aircraft aretested, but his story remains a murky mystery. The bottom line: It's impossibleto verify. So far, we have not found anyone to corroborate the essentialsof what Lazar says." Baffled at Bentwaters Name: Col. Charles I. Halt, U.S. Air Force, retired Claim: In late December 1980, while serving as deputy base commanderat Brentwaters Air Base in southern Englant, Halt witnessed and investigatedseveral anomalous objects in the skies over the Rendelsham Forest, whichseparates the American installation from its twin Royal Air Force base,Woodbridge. The sightings occurred on two separate nights during the weekafter Christmas. Two, weeks later, Halt sent a report about the strangeencounters to the British Ministry of Defense. Background: A career Air Force officer, Halt served in Vietnam and onvarious bases before arriving at Bentwaters in 1980. He was promoted tobase commander in 1984. Halt later served as base commander at Kunsan AirBase, Korea, and as director of the inspections directorate for the Departmentof Defense inspector general. He retired in 1991. Halt is the first USAFofficer since Project Blue Book ended to have filed a memo on unidentifiedflying objects and gone public with the details. The Story: "Just after Christmas, about 5:30 a.m., December 26,1980, I walked into police headquarters and the desk sergeant started tolaugh. He said a couple of the guys had been out chasing UFOs. Nothing,however, was in the blotter. I told him to put it in. "When our base commander came in, we both chuckled. Neither ofus believed in UFOs, be we did decide to look into it. Before we had thechance, two nights later, the duty flight commander for the security policeunit rushed in to a belated Christmas party white as a sheet. 'The UFOis back,' he said. "I was asked to investigate. I changed into a utility uniform,then headed out in a jeep to the edge of the forest. About a dozen of ourmen were already there. Out light-alls (large gas-powered lights) wouldn'twork, and there was so much static and constant interference on our radiosthat we had to set up a relay. There was increasing commotion. I was determinedto show them this was nonsense. "I took half a dozen of the men and headed into the woods on footto a clearing where the initial incident had supposedly taken place. Wefound three distinct indentations in the ground equidistant apart and pressedwell into the sandy soil. They were supposedly cause by the object seentwo nights before, but I didn't see anything sitting there that night.Neither did anybody else there. "Inside the triangular area formed by the indentations, one ofthe men got slightly higher readings on the Geiger counter than he didoutside. He photographed the area, and I took a soil sample. Meanwhile,I recorded this activity on my microcassette recorder. "We knew the Orford Ness lighthouse beacon beamed from the southeast.All of a sudden, directly to the east, we saw an unusual red, sunlike lightoval shaped, glowing, with a black center-10 to 15 feet off the ground,moving through the trees. Beyond the clearing was a barbed-wire fence,farmer's field, house, and barn. The animals were making a lot of noise. "We ran toward the light up to the fense. It shot over the fieldand then moved in a 20-to 30-degree horizontal arc. Strangely, it appearedto be dripping what looked like molten steel out of a crucible, as if gravitywere somehow pulling it down. Suddenly, it exploded-not a loud bang, justboomph-and broke into five white objects that scattered in the sky. Everythingexcept our radios seemed to return to normal. "We went to the end of the farmer's property to get a differentperspective. In the north, maybe 20 degrees off the horizon, we saw threewhite objects-elliptical, like a quarter moon but a little larger-withblue, greed, and red lights on them, making sharp, angular movements. Theobjects eventually turned from elliptical to round. "I called the command post, asked them to call Easter Radar, responsiblefor air defense of that sector. Twice they reported that they did'nt seeanything. "Suddenly, from the south, a different glowing object moved towardsus at a high rate of speed, came withing several hundred feet, and thenstopped. A pencillike beam, six to eight inches in diameter, shot fromthis thing right down by our feet. Seconds later, the object rose and disappeared. "The objects in the north were still dancing in the sky. Afteran hour or so, I finally made the call to go in. We left those things outthere. "The film turned out to be fogged; nothing came out. But a staffsergeant later made plaster castings of the indentations, and I had thesoil sample. "Around New Year's Eve, I took statements and interviewed the menwho had taken part in the initial incident. The reports were nearly identical. "Basically, they reported this: In the early morning hours of December26, one of the airmen drove to the back gate at Woodbridge on a routinesecurity check. He saw lights in the forest, specifically a red light,and thought maybe an airplane had crashed. He radioed a report, which wascalled into the tower, but the tower reported nobody was flying. "Eventually, a group headed out to the forest. They reported strangenoises-animals, movement, like we heard two nights later. "As they approached the clearing, they reported seeing a largeyellowish white light with a blinking red light on the upper center portionand a steady blue light emanating from underneath. The tower again reportednothing on radar. "A few of the men moved to within 20 or 30 feet. Each said thesame thing independently-a triangular shaped metallic object, about ninefeet across the base, six feet high, appeared to be sitting on a tripod.They split up, walked around the craft. One of the men apparently triedto get on the craft, but, they said, it levitated up. "All three of the guys hit the ground as the craft moved quicklyin a zigzagging manner through the woods towared the field, hitting sometrees on the way. They got up and approached again, but the object roseup, and then it disappeared at gerat speed. "Finally, on January 13, 1981, I wrote a memo to the British Ministryof Defense. Despite my efforts, to my knowledge, no one from any intelligenceor government agency ever came on base to investigate. "I have never sought the limelight, nor have I hidden. I standto receive no financial benifit from this interview but consented becaseit's time the truth came out. I don't know what those objects were. I don'tknow anybody who does. But something as yet unexplained happened out there." Update: In 1983, a copy of Halt's memo to the British MOD was releasedthrough the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Shortly thereafter, a copyof the 18-minute audiotape of the investigation Halt conducted was givento a British UFOlogists by, Halt says, another Air Force Officer. Bothhave made the rounds within the UFO community. As a result, Halt says he has been "harassed" by UFOlogistsand fanatics. While half a dozen men assisted Halt's investigation anddozens of others were near the scene, only a handful of witnesses havecome forward. At leat one of them, Halt says, is spreading disinformation;consquently, media coverage has been inaccurate at best. For instance,he says, "The stories about holographiclike aliens emerging from theircraft are pure fiction." Official Response: "The Air Force stopped investigating UFOs in1969 when Project Blue Book was completed," says Air Force spokesmanMaj. Dave Thurston, based in Washintgon, D.C. The Critics' Corner: "The UFO you hear described on the audiotapewas almost certainly the lighthouse beacon in my opinion, becase the peakinterval between their descriptions of it getting brighter, then dimmer,is the time of rotation of the beacon, which was about ten miles away,"says UFO skeptic Philip Klass. "Even though they said they saw numerouslights in the night sky, one of ever three UFOs reported turns out to bea bright celestial body." "Bentwaters is a case of magical thinking-a situation where a bunchof people got excited about different things they correlated in their mind,"says UFO investigator James McGaha, technical consultant to the Committeefor the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal and a retiredAir Force Pilot, who traveled to England, surveyed the area, and interviewedvarious people. "Consider these facts: On the night of December 25to 26, at 9:10 p.m., Russian satellite Cosmos 746 reentered the atmosphereover England and appeared as a bright object. At 2:50 a.m., a fireballentered the atmosphere over Woodbridge. At 4:11 a.m., a British policecar with a blue strobe light on top and other lights attached to the undercarriageresponded to a telephone report and was driving on the dirt roads throughthe forest. "Halt's memo reports that on the second night, they saw two objectsin the north, one in the south. On that night, three of the brightest starswere visible-vega and Deneb in the north, Sirius in the south. And clearly,the strange red light mentioned on the audio tape is the Orford Ness Lighthousebeacon. Beyond that, the morning after the first night, British officersidentified the indentations as rabbit diggings. The Geiger counter readingswere of background radiation. Nothing appeared on radar that night, either,and no one in either base tower reported anything unusual. Furthermore,no civilians reported seeing or hearing anything." *END* **************************************************************************** PART I.c The Great High-Rise Abduction Whatever spin you put on it, it's definitely the case of the century It was cold and clear, about 3:00 a.m., when the car stalled near theSouth Street seaport in Manhattan. Glimpsing up, the passengers-a majorpolitical figure, who will remain unnamed, and two government agents-spieda glowing oval object hovering over a building a couple of blocks away.As lights on the heavenly vision changed from red-orange to a bright bluish-white,a woman in a nightgown floated off a twelfth story window and hovered midair.The awe-struck witnesses watched as the woman, surrounded by several smallcreatures, ascended effortlessly into the bottom of the craft. The objectzipped over the Brooklyn Bridge and finally plunged into the East River.Or so the story goes. "It's an extraordinary case," says Budd Hopkins, a world-classmodern artist who has recently become known for his books, Missing Timeand Intruders, detailing his 18 years of investigation into claims thatthousands of people have been abducted by UFOs. A trip to Hopkins' studioon Manhattan's West Side reveals the profound influence these so-calledabductions have had on his art. Scattered around the room are colorful,profile-shaped paintings he calls "guardians" that evoke nothingif not the aliens in question. Indeed, as Hopkins describes his work, hisdark, thick eyebrows dance with enthusiasm; these days, it is the bizarretales of UFOs and the nasty creatures who inhabit them, plucking innocentsfrom their homes in the middle of the night, that consume most of his time. If Hopkins seems excited, he explains, it's because he has found a casethat might convince the army of skeptics who have hounded him for years.Unlike the thousands of other abduction cases on record, he explains, thisis the first time independent witnesses have come forward claiming to haveseen the event take place. Even more significant, one of these witnessesis said, in the vernacular, to be a Very Import Person. "The implication,"Hopkins speculates, "is that this was deliberate, a demonstrationof alien power and intent." Hopkins has never had trouble drawing dramatic conclusions about UFOabductions, a phenomenon that emerged, it should be noted, without him.The first bizarre story came to public attention in 1966 and involved thenow-notorious New England couple, Betty and Barney Hill. Under hypnosis,the Hills recalled being snatched from their car and examined by smallcreatures aboard a flying saucer. But it would take another decade, a fewmore headline-grabbing abduction tales, and, finally, the television broadcastof the Hills' own story before tales of alien encounters became embeddedin the popular consciousness at large. The stage was now set for Hopkins to emerge as the leading authorityon abductions. It happened in 1981 with the publication of his book, MissingTime, in which he suggested that the abduction experience was much morewidespread than anyone had imagined. For Hopkins, the plight of the abducteebecame a personal crusade, and before long, he would be lecturing on thesubject across the country, appearing on one talk show after another, andfinally writing Intruders, a 1987 best seller that was turned into a televisionmini series in 1992. Clearly, no one has done more than Hopkins to bringthis strange phenomenon to public awareness. Even more to the point, noone has had greater success in getting scientists and mental-health professionalsto take a serious look at abductions. So it's no surprise that when Hopkins began touting his latest caseas the strongest evidence yet for UFOs, their alien occupants, and theirsystematic abduction of human beings, people listened. But as the piecesof the puzzle were revealed, critics began charging that rather than provehis point, Hopkins had fallen victim to the elaborate fantasy of a boredhousewife or a complex hoax. Indeed, said his detractors, so outrageouswas the tale and so fragile the evidence for it, it had backfired, destroyinghis credibility and bringing down his body of work like a house of cards. The story certainly is a humdinger, with more twists and turns thanCalifornia's Highway 1 and more mystery characters than a Le Carre spythriller. "It's a crazy, endless saga," says Hopkins, includingsuch elements as secret agents, attempted murder, and two high-level politicalfigures, Mikhail Gorbachev one of them. The central character in the case is Linda. She does not want her lastname revealed. She lives in Lower Manhattan, and on the very hot springday I went to meet her, I came to appreciate why the aliens had decidedto grab her through the windows. It certainly beats penetrating a lockedgate and the scrutiny of a guard, then taking an elevator up 12 storiesand winding your way through a corridor to her place. When I knocked onthe door, I was greeted by an attractive, fortyish woman with brown, almond-shapedeyes and long, flowing brown hair. We sat down on her couch, and as herair conditioner blasted arctic air and she smoked a dozen cigarettes, Iwas treated to one mind-boggling tale. It started early in 1988. Linda had just bought Kitty Kelly's biographyof Frank Sinatra and another book, which she took to be a mystery. Theother book was Intruders by Budd Hopkins. By the end of the first chapter,she was stumped: Aliens had left mysterious implants in people's brainsand noses, and that last little bit bothered her. Thirteen years before,she had found a lump on the side of her nose and had gone to a specialistwho said it was built up cartilage left over from a surgical scar. Butshe had never had any such surgery, even as a child, she said. Linda thentook my finger and put it on her nose: Yes, I could feel a very slightbump on her upper right nostril. But there had to be more than this, Ithought. There was. A year later, Linda finally contacted Hopkins, who decided to exploreLinda's past with his favorite tool-hypnosis. "It felt kind of strange,"Linda says. "I'm just a wife and mother. I'm just Linda. UFOs? Naw." Hopkins says he learned otherwise. He regressed Linda to age 8, enablingher to recall an episode in which she thought she glimpsed the cartooncharacter Casper, of Casper the Friendly Ghost fame. But under hypnosis,her memory of Casper turned out to be a large, top shaped object that she'dseen flying above the apartment building across the street from her childhoodhome in Manhattan. Hopkins came to suspect that she had been abducted byaliens and by June of 1989 had invited her to join his support group forabductees. "I remember sitting there bug-eyed listening to these people,"says Linda. "I felt strange the first time, but after that I feltbetter." "Finally, on November 30, 1989, a very agitated Linda called Hopkinsto report she had been abducted again. She had gone to bed quite late,at about ten minuets before 3:00 a.m., because she'd been up doing thelaundry. Towels and blue jeans for four take eons to dry in her small dryer,she explained. Her husband, who normally worked nights, was on jury dutythat week and so was home and asleep in the bedroom. She showered, gotinto bed, and lying on her back, clasped her hands and began reciting "OurFather" to herself, a habit she carried over into adulthood from herRoman Catholic upbringing. Then she felt a presence in the room. "I was awake but had my eyes closed," she recalls. "Iwas afraid. I knew it wasn't my husband; he was snoring away. Then I laythere wondering Did I lock the door? Is it one of the kids?" She calledout the names of her two boys and finally reached out for her husband."Wake up," she said, "there's somebody in the room." He didn't answer, and she began to feel a numbness crawl up from hertoes. After months in the support group exploring her past abductions,she recognized what that meant. It's now or never, she thought and openedher eyes. At the foot of the bed, says Linda, stood a small creature witha large head and huge black eyes. "I screamed and yelled," shesays, "and then threw my pillow. The creature fell back." Afterthat, she has only fragments of conscious memory-a white fabric going overher eyes; little alien hands pounding up and down her back; suddenly fallingback into bed. It was a quarter to 5:00 in the morning when Linda jumped out of bed,ran into the kids' room, and discovered, she says, that "they weren'tbreathing." Hysterical, she retrieved a small mirror from the bathroomand placed it under their noses. Suddenly, a mist formed on the mirror,she says, and she heard her husband snoring in the other room. They wereall alive. Linda, in shock, sat on the floor in the hallway between thetwo bedrooms until dawn. Later she called Hopkins. Under hypnosis, Linda revealed that there had actually been five creaturesin the apartment. They had led her form the bedroom through the livingroom and out a closed window, she declared, where, floating in midair,she saw a bright bluish-white light. She was afraid of falling and embarrassed,thinking her nightgown had gone over her head. She moved up into the craftand then found herself sitting on a table. The creatures around her, shesays, were scraping her arms-"like taking skin samples," shespeculates, and pounding with an instrument up and down her spine-all typicalabduction fare, to say the least. Quite atypical is what allegedly happened 15 months later. In February1991, Hopkins received a typewritten letter from two people claiming tobe police officers. Late in 1989, the letter said, the two had witnesseda "little girl or woman wearing a full white nightgown" floatingout of a twelfth-floor apartment window, escorted by three "ugly butsmall humanlike creatures" into a very large hovering oval that eventuallyturned reddish orange. The object, the letter added, flew over their heads,over the Brooklyn Bridge, and plunged into the East River. They wonderedif the woman was alive, though they wished to remain anonymous to protecttheir careers. They signed the letter with first names only-Richard andDan. Hopkins was astonished. "I realized immediately that the womanthey had seen was Linda," he said. "The account seemed to corroboratethe time, date, and details of her abduction. Here, finally, were independent,seemingly reputable witnesses to an abduction.: When Hopkins first called Linda to tell her, she replied, "Thatcan't be possible." Then she wondered if she and Budd were the victimsof a cruel joke. But all suspicions vanished one evening a few weeks later,she says, when Richard and Dan showed up at her door. "Police," they announced. Linda looked through the peepholeand saw two men in plain clothes flashing a gold badge. "So I letthem in," said Linda, "and they looked at me kind of funny. Whenthey introduced themselves as Dan and Richard, my stomach dropped to thefloor." Both were tall, well-built, attractive men in their forties,she says. Dan sat on the couch, put his head in his hand, and said, "MyGod, it's really her." Richard had tears in his eyes and hugged her,expressing relief that she was alive." "Budd had warned me not to discuss the incident with anyone,"Linda says now, "so all I could do was tell them to talk to Budd." In the year that followed, Linda claims, she had numerous encounterswith the mystery due-at the bus stops, outside her dentist's office, evenat church. Hopkins himself never had the pleasure of meeting the pair,though, he says, he did eventually receive three more letters from Danand four letters and an audiocassette from Richard. In one letter, saysHopkins, Dan explained his need to remain anonymous: He and Richard werenot New York City cops, he said, nor on that fateful November night hadthey been alone. They were, in fact, government security agents and hadbeen escorting an important political figure, who they would not name,to a downtown heliport; suddenly their car's engine died and the headlightswent out. They had seen Linda's abduction unfold after they pushed thecar to safety under the elevated FDR Drive. Dan and Richard just couldn't stay away. One morning, after Linda hadwalked her youngest son to the school bus at 7:15, she claims she was approachedby Richard, who asked her to take a ride in his car. She refused, but Richard'sgrip firmed on her shoulder. "You can go quietly or you can go kickingand screaming," Linda claims Richard told her. As he dragged her tothe open rear door of his black Mercedes, he tickled her, Linda states."That's how he got me in the car." "They drove me around for about three hours," says Linda,"asking me all sorts of questions." Did she work for the government?Was she herself an alien? They even demanded she prove herself human bytaking off her shoes. Aliens, they would claim in a letter to Hopkins,lacked toes. She called Hopkins as soon as they dropped her off at home. "Hopkins told me to call the police," Linda now explains,"but I refused. Who would have believed me?" The notion of surveillanceby Richard and Dan eventually spooked her so much that she quit her secretarialjob and simply stayed home. To ease Linda's isolation, Hopkins found abenefactor who paid for Linda's limited use of a bodyguard so she couldgo out. Unfortunately, the bodyguard was not around for what Linda says washer second major encounter with Richard and Dan. On October 15, 1991, Lindareports, Dan accosted her on the street and pulled her into a red Jaguar.As they drove along, he sometimes put his hand on her knee-"to distractme," Linda suggests, "from following the rout to a three-storybeach house which I assume was on Long Island." Inside, Dan starteda pot of coffee and gave Linda a present: a nightgown, she says, "thekind a woman might wear if she didn't have any children, especially sons."Dan asked her to put it on so he could photograph her in it as she appearedmid-abduction, floating over New York. She refused but finally agreed toput it on over her clothes. As Dan's behavior became increasingly strange,she decided to flee, running out the door and onto the beach. "Dan caught me and picked me up, shaking me like a toy," shesays. There was mud on my face, so he dunked me in the water once, twice,three times. I don't think he was trying to drown me, but he kept me undertoo long." This behavior, which critics of this strange tale havetermed "attempted murder," finally ceased. Instead, Dan pulledoff Linda's wet jeans and she says, pulled her down on his lap in the water,rocking her like a baby. Shortly after, Linda reports, "Richard showedup, apologized for Dan, and drove me home." Linda went straight to Hopkins. "She left sand all over my house,"Hopkins says. "A few weeks later, I received a half dozen photographsof Linda, in the nightgown, running along the beach." That November, the saga became stranger still. While lunching with Linda,a relative who was also a doctor insisted she go to the hospital to x-raythe lump in her nose. The x-ray Linda now presents shows a profile of herhead; clearly visible is a quarter-inch-long cylinder apparently embeddedin her nose. "It was weird," says Hopkins' friend Paul Cooper, professorof neurosurgery at New York University, who has examined the x-ray. "I'venever seen anything like it." But even Cooper admits the x-ray couldhave been faked by taping a little something to the outside of Linda'snose. Moreover, as usually happens in UFO stories, this tantalizing bit ofevidence vanished as quickly as it had appeared. Soon after getting thex-ray, Linda told Hopkins she'd awakened with a bloody nose. Under hypnosis,Hopkins says, Linda revealed that the aliens had again whisked her away.Later, with Cooper's help, Hopkins had further x-rays taken, but the implantwas nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, another alleged witness to Linda's spectacular abductioncame forward. That same month, Hopkins received a large manila envelopefrom a woman living in upstate New York. On the outside, in large letters,appeared the words, Confidential, Re: Brooklyn Bridge. On the evening of November 29, 1989, the woman-Hopkins calls her "JanetKimble"-Had been in Brooklyn at a retirement party for her boss. Whenshe headed home via the Brooklyn Bridge around 3:00 a.m., she told Hopkins,her car came to a dead stop in the middle of the bridge and her headlightsblinked out. The same thing, she states, happened to the cars coming upbehind her. Suddenly, she saw what she thought was "a building onfire" about a quarter of a mile away. The light was so bright thatshe had to shield her eyes, she said. Then she realized what she was seeing:Four "balls" had floated out of an apartment window and, midair,unfolded into three "rickets-stricken" children and a fourth,taller, "normal girl-child" wearing a white gown. "WhileI watched," she wrote, "I could hear the screams of people parkedin their cars behind me." The "children" were then whiskedup into the object, whereupon it flew over the Brooklyn Bridge and disappearedwhen her view was obscured by a walkway. Hopkins says he telephoned "Janet Kimble" immediately andlater had lunch with her. The tale told by this "widow of about sixtywho once worked as a telephone operator" corroborates stories toldby Richard and Linda, he says, ruling out the possibility of a hoax. In fact, if Hopkins is to be believed, another witness to the Lindaabduction was actually the first. That person, he states, is a UFO abducteeas well, a woman in her early thirties who claims to have been abductedfrom her Manhattan bedroom in the middle of the night. She consciouslyremembers being outside at some point, moving along the streets involuntarily,and seeing 15 to 20 other women all moving zombielike toward a UFO on thebanks of the East River. When Hopkins tells me this, I can't help but guffaw. He finds my reactionperfectly understandable. "What can I say?" he says. For Hopkins,who is in the midst of investigating another mass abduction in New YorkCity involving a hundred humans, this woman's story is only "a littlemore bizarre than most." In any event, says Hopkins, this woman at one point looks down the EastRiver and sees two other UFOs in the sky, one a bright orange object atthe southern end of Manhattan, ostensibly the one that abducted Linda. The two cases, if believed and taken in concert, shed an ominous lighton the humorous name that some critics have bestowed on the Linda case:"Manhattan Transfer." Were the aliens out that night abductingManhattanites like Linda in droves? By December of 1991, the end of Linda's saga was nowhere in sight. Shewas now struggling with an obviously disturbed an persistent human namedDan, who, according to Richard had been admitted to a "rest home."At Christmas, she received a card and note from Dan. It was a love letteractually. He told her he planned to leave the "rest home" soonand asked her to pack her toothbrush-he was coming for her. He wanted tolearn her alien ways and her special language. "You'll make a beautifulbride," he teased. Linda, however was not amused. Dan apparently tried to get Linda in February of 1992, but she was rescuedfrom this dragon by Richard, who Linda now regards as a knight in shiningarmor. Linda says that Richard, up on returning from a "mission"abroad, had gone to visit Dan at the rest home, found him missing, andhad come looking for him in New York. When he learned that Dan had prepareda passport for Linda and booked two tickets to England, he immediatelysought out Linda and managed to sweep her away just in time. Linda's last contact with the aliens occurred a few months afterward.On Memorial Day 1992, she, her husband, two sons, and one of their guestsall awakened at about 4:30 in the morning with nosebleeds. Hopkins sayshe has subsequently confirmed, through hypnosis, that the incident wasUFO related. "I really don't try to convince anybody," says Linda,having come to the end of her story. "I don't expect anyone to believethis because, to tell you the truth, if the shoe were on the other foot,I wouldn't believe it either. But it happened. It happened." If it really did, I thought, the independent witnesses would confirmit. The prize witness obviously was the VIP, and the word in the UFO communityis that Hopkins thinks it was Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary-generalof the United Nations from 1982 to 1991. "I will not deny or confirmthat," says Hopkins. "I won't say who he is, but I can say this:All the letters from Richard and Dan refer to the fact that there was athird man in the car. And he's written one letter to me, which was signed,The Third Man. I can't make the things he said public, though clearly he'sletting me know between the lines who he is." Actually, rumor has it that this third party may be central to the Lindacase. According to anonymous sources close to Hopkins, Richard, Dan, andtheir passenger were all abducted on that fateful day of November 30, 1989,right along with Linda. Their delayed recall of this event supposedly wouldexplain why it took them 15 months for them to write to Hopkins, why theywere so interested in Linda, and why they are so reluctant to come forwardnow. But all that is certain about Perez de Cullar is that he was in NewYork City on the days in question. Did he really witness the Linda abduction? Joe Sills, spokesman for the secretary-general at the United Nations,was nice enough to check with the security people but came up empty handed."No one that I spoke to," he says, "was aware of him everbeing in that part of town at that hour of the morning. It's just not inthe kind of schedule he kept." What's more, he added, Perez de Cuellarcould not have been heading for the heliport since he always went to theairport via limousine. U.N. spokesperson Juan Carlos Brandt checked withPerez de Cuellar directly. "He says he never witnessed any incident,"says Brandt. And adding insult to injury, Hopkins can't even prove that the two governmentsecurity agents, Richard and Dan, are real. He has never met or spokento them, and all efforts to identify them have proven fruitless. In Marchof 1991, for instance, Linda looked through six hours of clips of newsprograms showing security agents at events in New York City. The clipsbelong to one of Hopkins' contacts in the government law enforcement. Nearthe end of the six hours Linda spotted a man whom she identified as 'Dan.'Despite the fact that the images were taken from a distance, involved crowdsand the bustling chaos that accompanies visiting dignitaries, she apparentlyhad no trouble making her identification. Those who have viewed the tapeshave seen a man who appears to be taking part in official business, andwho is in no way out of place or unusual. In the months that followed, Hopkins and Linda made the rounds withtheir pictures of "Dan" in hand. They went to United Nationssecurity and the State Department, Secret Service, and Russian delegationoffices in New York. At times, Hopkins and Linda would use a cover storyso as not to arouse suspicion: "Sometimes we said we were husbandand wife and that this was a friend we had met a couple of years ago inCape Cod and he had said to look him up here when we came to New York,"Hopkins explains. But the ploy didn't work. "I've been all over withthese pictures," says Hopkins, "and nobody recognizes him." Then there is the woman on the bridge, "Janet Kimble." Sheis a real person but apparently, after being ridiculed by her own family,wants no part of Hopkins' story. When Hopkins tried to arrange an interviewfor me, she told him, "I can't help you anymore with this." Thefinal independent witness is the woman up the East River who claims tohave participated in the mass abduction of women that very night. But she'sanother abductee and not truly impartial in the matter. With no independent witnesses willing to come forward, the case, notsurprisingly, has come under intense criticism. Curiously, two of thosemost critical of the case initially became involved at Linda's request. By early 1992, Linda was feeling so helpless at the hands of her humankidnappers that she decided to seek additional expert help. At the suggestionof New York journalist and UFO researcher Antonio Huneeus, she contactedRichard Butler, a former law-enforcement and security specialist for theAir Force and a fellow abductee, whom Linda had met at Hopkins' supportgroup. Butler met with Linda on February 1, 1992, and brought with himJoe Stefula, a former special agent for the U.S. Army's Criminal InvestigationsCommand and current head of security for a drug company in New Jersey.During the meeting, Linda asked for safety tips on how to protect herselffrom the dangerous duo, and Butler and Stefula, in order to give usefuladvice, asked Linda a few questions of their own. Several months later, after Hopkins made the case public at the 1992Mutual UFO Network annual meeting in Albuquerque, Stefula, Butler, anda friend of theirs, parapsychologist George Hansen, decided the case neededa thorough investigation and began poking around Linda's neighborhood.They spoke to the security guard and supervisor at Linda's building, wentto the offices of the New York Post nearby, and simply interviewed residentsto see if they remembered anything amiss. No one did. Afterward, Hansen, already the author of a number of stinging critiquesof both psi research and its critics, wrote a lengthy skeptical report.The central issue, say the skeptics, is the lack of large numbers of witnessesto this spectacular event. After all, New York never sleeps; there arepeople out and about even in the middle of the night. Why did none of thetruck drivers at the loading dock of the New York Post just a short distancefrom Linda's apartment see this blindingly bright object? Why haven't allthose other people whose cars were supposedly stalled on the Brooklyn Bridgecome forward? To such questions, Hopkins has a two-fold reply: "The unwillingnessof people to report such fantastic experiences is not new. People do notlike to be ridiculed," he says. Then there's the invisibility issue,"which just seems to be part of the phenomenon. Many people who youthink should have seen these things just don't," Hopkins explains. But Hopkins can't explain everything. For instance, how could "JanetKimble" know that the words Brooklyn Bridge written on the outsideof her envelope would attract Hopkins' attention unless she knew or wasrelated to one of the the people in the Hopkins support group, all of whomhad heard about the case? The answer, replies Hopkins, is ridiculouslysimple: "She saw the abduction from the Brooklyn Bridge and thoughtthat the others who had been stalled on the bridge that night might havecontacted me about it." But Butler says the likelier explanation is that Linda fabricated thewhole story after reading Nighteyes, a science-fiction novel by GarfieldReeves-Stevens published in April of 1989, just months before her allegedabduction. The novel charts the abductions of an FBI team staking out abeach house in California while a mother and daughter undergo a seriesof abductions in and around New York City. It concludes with an apocalypticfinale. Butler claims that Linda was very intrigued when the book was broughtup at the Hopkins support-group meetings. "I guarantee you that'swhere she got the basis for her story," he says. Butler admits the book's storyline is different from Linda's but saysthere are too many parallels to be coincidence. Both Linda and the novel'sSarah were abducted into a UFO hovering over a high-rise apartment buildingin New York City. Linda was kidnapped and thrown into a car by Richardand Dan; one of the novel's central characters, Wendy, was kidnapped andthrown into a van by two mystery men. Dan is supposed to be a securityand intelligence agent, while one of the book's central characters is anFBI agent. Both Dan and an agent in the novel were hospitalized for emotionaltrauma. Both Linda and the novel's Wendy were taken to a "safe house"on the beach. The list of such parallels goes on and on. "But similarity does not prove relationship," replies Hopkins.Without an important political figure witnessing the abduction-the veryessence of the Linda case, he notes-the comparison with the book is meaningless. Hopkins is not alone. Walt Andrus, international director of the MutualUFO Network (MUFON, is "absolutely convinced the case is authentic."And David Jacobs, a history professor at Temple University and anotherresearcher on the abduction scene, says the critics debunking the casehave twisted the facts. "Over the past several years, I have beena confidant of Hopkins' and, at times, of Linda's. I can tell you thatwhen Hopkins' report comes out, the inaccuracy of the critics will be apparentand the case will stand or fall on its own merits." For Hansen, of course, those merits are slim. And, he says, the hoaxinghe believes occurred is the least of it. "For me," he says, "theworst infraction is the reaction of the leadership of UFOlogy. I thinkthis has given us great insight into the mentality-and the gullibility-ofBudd Hopkins, Walt Andrus, and David Jacobs, the people who really controlmuch of what people actually read about UFOs." Hansen is particularly upset that, given charges of kidnapping and attemptedmurder, the leadership did not go to the police. "I recognize thereis government cover-up on UFOs," he says, "but covering up aso-called attempted murder and kidnapping, as these guys apparently saythey've done-that's quite something else." Hoping to right the wrong, Hansen has, in fact, sent a letter to theinspector general's office, Department of the Treasury, requesting thatLinda's claims of kidnapping and attempted murder by federal agents beinvestigated. In February of 1992, the SEcret Service contacted Linda andshe and Hopkins went down to their World Trade Center offices to speakto Special Agent Peggy Fleming and her supervisor. Hopkins and Linda toldFleming the story and explained that they didn't know who Hanson was orwhy he was involved. Linda also objected to what she perceived as Hansen'sinsinuation that she was against the government. She was not, she said:"I'm a Bush Republican." When I called the Secret Service about their investigation, I was referredto Special Agent James Kaiser, media representative in the New York fieldoffice. After reviewing the file on the case, titled "Special AgentAlleged Misconduct, February 10, 1993," Kaiser told me that Linda"was, in fact, interviewed at our office, and it was determined thather allegations regarding U.S. Secret Service agents having any contactwith her whatsoever prior to that day were unfounded and baseless. It neverhappened. She may have been mistaking us for some other agency or organization.Case closed." The case is also closed as far as Hansen, Stefula, and Butler are concerned.They truly believe that Linda is involved in a hoax. "I think shestarted out with a small lie," speculates Hansen, "a tall talethat grew in the three years that followed. She's been a typist and temporarysecretary, so she has had access to a lot of different typewriters undoubtedly.It would not surprise me if there were someone else hoaxing Hopkins aswell." Hopkins flatly rejects the hoax scenario. "An efficient hoax hasa minimum of moving parts," he says. "You don't want to go intotoo many details. This has more moving parts that one could possibly imagine." As for Linda, when asked if she had made up this whole scenario, shereplied simply, "No. How could this be a hoax? There are too manypeople involved. In fact," she added, "I take the suggestionas a compliment. They must think I'm pretty intelligent to pull off sucha thing." Some details of the case frankly do make me suspicious. For one, thedrawings of the abduction that Hopkins received from Richard and the womanon the bridge not only look like they might have been prepared by the sameperson, despite the stylistic and perspective differences, which Hopkinshas duly noted, but more importantly, both were done in crayons and usedthe same colors. What's more, to actually meet Linda and hear her talk is to be transportedto a world where reality is inverted, where all we have ever known is flippedon its head. Strain your ears, and you can almost hear the chords fromTwilight Zone kick in as the underlying chaos of the universe takes control.Fact is, outrageous as I find Linda's story, Linda herself seems sincere.Her emotions-fright, anxiety, and anger-appear genuine. I'm not alone in these impressions. John Mack, a professor of psychiatryat Harvard University MEdical School, whom Hopkins confided in as the storyunfolded and who know knows Linda well, insists that "there is nothingunauthentic or devious" about her. Gibbs Williams, a New York psychoanalytic psychotherapist with a quartercentury of experience, has tested Linda and also dismisses any notion thatLinda might be hoaxing the whole affair. "You would have to have thekind of conspiratorial mentality of Richard Nixon and be able to thinksixty-two moves ahead," Williams says. "Quite frankly, Lindadoesn't appear to have that kind of mind; she does not have that kind ofabstracting capacity." He notes further that her emotive capacity-heranger, crying, and tendency to get carried away-is not consistent withthe psychopathic cool mentality of the hoaxer and liar. "My conclusion,"he says, "is that from her perspective, she is telling her truth." Perhaps Jerome Clark, vice president for the Center for UFO Studies(CUFOS) and editor of the International UFO Reporter, sums up the controversybest: "This is an absolutely extraordinary claim, and the evidencethat you need to marshal to support such a claim simply is not there." Hopkins promises it will be when his book appears. Until then, Lindastands alone, ambivalent about her fame. On the one hand, she seems torevel in the notoriety. She attends national UFO meetings obviously dressedto impress. "To tell you the truth, it wouldn't be that bad if I didn'thave a family," she admits to me. Yet she also feels victimized. "There are a lot of Italian Americansand Chinese in my neighborhood, and many of them even laugh at joggers,"she says. "Imagine if anyone in the area herd that I was abductedby aliens." "Worst of all," she continues, "those critics took awaythe safety of my family by taking my real name and publishing it. We aresitting ducks for any crackpot int he UFO community. They know where Ilive. They know what I look like." She has already taken her nameoff her intercom system, and she fully expects to move when Hopkins' bookon the case comes out. "I don't know what's worse," she saysfinally, "what Richard and Dan did, what these three stooges fromNew Jersey did, or what the aliens did." Or what Hopkins has done,I might add. After all, he promised so much and has delivered so little.Poor Linda. *END* **************************************************************************** PART I.d SOVIET SAUCERS by James Oberg [ The P/\NTHER - This guy is a suspected CIA disinformant and I haveseen him appear in numerous UFO specials/documentaries with different credentialseach time...This is the guy who said the 1991 Space Shuttle UFO footagewas 'SPACE ICE'... Beware!] Day after day, the waves of UFOs returned to southern Russia. Cossackson horseback saw them high in the evening sky. Pilots aboard commercialairliners and military interceptors chased and dodged them. Astronomersat observatories in the Caucasus Mountains noted their crescent shape andtheir fiery companions. It was the fall of 1967, and the Soviet Union was in the grip of itsfirst major UFO flap. The extraordinary tales, described on Soviet television,reported in Soviet newspaper, and analyzed in a private nationwide UFOstudy group soon took on a life of their own. In one detailed account, an airliner crew from Voroshilovgrad to Volgograd,flight 104, insisted that a UFO had hovered and then maneuvered aroundtheir plane. According to Soviet UFO enthusiast Felix Zigel, who compiledsuch accounts, the plane's engines died and did not start up again untilafter the UFO had disappeared, when the aircraft was only a half mile highin the air. These tales and others were repeated in Western UFO books and presentedas important evidence at UFO hearings in the United States Congress andin Britain's House of Lords. Then, as suddenly as it had started, the waveof Russian UFO sightings ceased. Private UFO groups were banned by theSoviet government, and the subject was dropped from the controlled mediaeven as it spread wildly in the samizdat, the underground Russian press. But the phenomenon was not forgotten. Years later, astronomer Lev Gindilisand a team of investigators from the Academy of Sciences in Moscow assessedZigel's UFO files, analyzing statistics from what they said was "therepetitive motion" of the objects Ziegel described. In 1979, the "GindilisReport" was released and distributed around the world. It concludedthat no known natural or manmade stimulus could account for these "anomalousatmospheric phenomena." Something truly extraordinary and truly alienmust have occurred. But it was too good to be true. Like many other official Soviet governmentreports, the Gindilis Report turned out to be counterfeit science. In effect,and probably in intent, it served to cover up one of Moscow's greatestmilitary secrets, an illegal space-to-earth nuclear weapon. What the witnesses really saw back in those exciting days in 1967 werespace vehicles all right, but not from some distant, alien world. Theywere Russian missile warheads, placed in low orbit under false registrationnames and then diverted back toward the planet's surface after one circuitof the globe. As they fireballed down toward a target zone near the lowerVolga River, they seared their way into the imaginations of startled witnessesfor hundreds of miles in all directions. Of course, U.S. intelligence agencies had also been watching the tests,and they weren't fooled by the UFO smokescreen. Pentagon experts soon dubbedthis fearsome new weapon a "fractional orbit bombardment system,"or FOBS. Government spokespeople in Washington denounced it as a firststrike weapon designed to evade defensive radars. Since Moscow had recentlysigned a solemn international treaty forbidding the orbiting of nuclearweapons, the existence of this weapon (whose tests alone did not violatethe treaty) was a glaring advertisement of contempt. So when Russian UFOwitnesses concluded that they had been seeing alien spaceships insteadof treaty-busting weapons tests, Soviet military officials were all toowilling to permit this illusion to prosper. Twenty-five years later, with the FOBS rockets long since scrapped andthe Soviet regime itself on the scrap heap of history, the now-purposelessdeception has maintained a zombielike life of its own. Russian UFO literaturecontinues to issue ever more glorious accounts of the 1967 "crescentspaceships." Mainstream Russian magazines, newspapers, and even museumexhibits contain fanciful drawings of such shapes. Zigel himself is reveredas "the father of Soviet UFOlogy," an icon of reliability andauthenticity. But Zigel's and Gindilis's crescent craft are just one example of theridiculous notions and outrageous fictions Russian UFOlogy has spawned.In 1977, for instance, Tass, the official Russian new agency, carried adispatch from the northwest Russian port city of Petrozavodsk titled "StrangeNatural Phenomenon over Kerelia." Wrote local correspondent NikolayMilov, "On September 20 at about 0400 a huge star suddenly flaredup in the dark sky, impulsively sending shafts of light to the earth. Thisstar moved slowly toward Petrozavodsk and, spreading out over it in theform of a jellyfish, hung there, showering the city with a multitude ofvery fine rays which created an image of pouring rain." The "visitation" unleashed a torrent of rumors. People laterreported being awakened from deep sleep by telepathic messages. Tiny holeswere reportedly seen in windows and paving stones. Cars were said to havestalled and computers to have crashed, and witnesses smelled ozone. Soviet UFO enthusiasts rushed to embrace the case. "As far as Iam concerned," claimed science-fiction author Aleksandr Kazantsev,"it was a spaceship from outer space, carrying out reconnaissance."According to Dr. Vladimir Azhazha, "In my opinion, what was seen overPetrozavodsk was either a UFO, a carrier of high intelligence with crewand passengers, or it was a field of energy created by such a UFO."Zigel, the dean of Soviet UFOlogists, agreed it was a true UFO: "Withouta doubt-it had all the features." Sadly, the cause of all this mindless panic was a routine rocket launchingfrom the supersecret military space center at Plesetsk in northwest Russia.The multiengined booster's contrails, backlit by the dawn sun, seemed tosplit into multiple glowing tentacles. In 1981, a midnight rocket launch from Plesetsk lit up the skies ofMoscow itself and sent the capital city's residents into a blitz of unconstrainedcreativity. UFO expert Sergey Bozhich's notebooks contain reports of numerous"independent" UFO encounters during this ordinary launching."Pilots of six civil aircraft reported either a UFO in flight or aUFO [attacking] their aircraft," he wrote. "At 1:30 a UFO attackeda truck along the Ryazan Avenue in Moscow." One witness even reportedwalking from a deep sleep to see a "scout ship" with a glasscupola and small alien pilot cruising down his street. The pattern is clear. Time and again, secret launchings or Russian rocketshave unleashed avalanches of classic UFO perceptions from the imaginative,excitable witnesses and their careless interviewers. And consistent withits origins, Russian UFO literature is still characterized by fantastictales and an utter lack of research into possible explanations. "Ihave no doubts" is the most common figure of speech in the lexiconof Russian UFOlogists, and they are doubtlessly sincere, if arguably deluded."Are UFOs real?" one was asked not long ago by American documentaryfilmmaker Bryan Gresh. "My colleagues and I don't even think that'sa question," he responded. "Of course they are real!" This sort of quasi-religious fervor just helps to fuel the skepticismof the cautious observer. After all, if Russian UFOlogists cannot or willnot recognize the prosaic stimulus behind these phony crescent UFOs of1967 and the UFO "jellyfish" of 1977, they may be incapable ofsolving any of the other hundreds of ordinary (if rare) causes that accountfor at least 90 percent (if not 100 percent) of all UFO perceptions. Dozensof major stimuli, and hundreds of minor ones, are constantly giving riseto counterfeit UFO perceptions around the world. Filtering out the residueof true UFOs from the pseudo UFOs poses enormous challenges for investigators.Most Russian UFOlogists appear unwilling to face this challenge. And the writings of prominent Russian UFO experts give ample groundfor more anxiety. Vladimir Azhazha, probably the leading Russian UFO expertof the 1990s, is an undeniable enthusiast of UFO miracle stories. Someyears ago, his favorite Western UFO story involved a UFO attack on theApollo 13 space capsule, which he "disclosed" was carrying asecret atomic bomb to create seismic waves on the moon. But it was carrying no such thing. The April 1970 explosion, which disabledthe craft and threatened the lives of the three astronauts, was causedby a hardware malfunction. When challenged recently by UFOlogists AntonioHuneeus, Azhazha made a candid admission: "When I gave the lecture,I was a teenager in UFOlogy and was intoxicated by the E.T. hypothesisand did not recognize anything else. I would retell with pleasure everythingI read." Supposedly reformed, Azhazha then published a new book with a gloriousnew Apollo astronaut UFO story based this time on forged photographs publishedin American tabloid newspapers. The pictures show contrast-enhanced fuzzballs,photographic images that had been sharpened in the photo lab. A fabricated"radio conversation" in which the astronauts exclaim surpriseat seeing alien spaceships in a crater near their landing site later appearedin another tabloid; it was patently bogus, too, based on grossly misusedspace jargon. The story was long ago abandoned by reputable Western UFOlogists,but Azhazha still loves it and presents it as true. At a UFO conference in Albuquerque in 1992, Azhazha told astonishedWestern colleagues that he had proof that 5,000 Russians had been abductedby UFOs and never returned to Earth. When asked to defend this number,he disclosed that he took the reported number of ordinary "missingpersons" in the entire Soviet Union, plotted the regions over whichmajor UFO activity had been reported, and then allocated those populationproportions of "missing" to the UFOs. It was simple, sincere,and senseless, but the embarrassed American hosts (who had paid his travelexpenses) couldn't disagree too publicly lest their waste of money be obvious. Russian UFOlogists claim to be careful. Azhazha himself has written:"NOthing on faith! One must check, check, and eleven times check inorder to find an error!" But he doesn't seem to know how, and neitherdo any of his colleagues. While their sincerity and enthusiasm are notin doubt, their judgement, balance, and accuracy should be. Why are people like Azhazha the best that Russia can offer? Russiansare heirs to a great, creative civilization, but they are also emergingfrom a social era that has had profound effects on their habits of thought.Today's Russians have lived in a reality-deprived and judgement-atrophiedculture for generations. Once they were sufficiently brain be numbed bya repressive communist regime to accept any and all propagandistic idiociesfed to them, they were intellectually defenseless against infections ofother brain bunk as well. UFO enthusiasm prospers in this nurturing environment. And it's notjust UFO sightings that get conjured up by this fuzzy thinking. Historicalfigures, preferably dead ones who cannot disagree, are now constantly beingportrayed as "secret UFO believers." For example, in 1993, a slick new UFO magazine called AURA-Z appearedin Moscow. Continuing the trend of tying now-dead space heroes to UFO studies,the magazine featured two separate interviews with contemporary expertsconcerning the role played by Sergey Korolev, the founder of the Sovietmissile and space programs. It didn't bother the magazine at all that thetwo stories were utterly inconsistent. In one article, rocket expert Valery Burdakov presented a detailed accountof how back in 1947 Stalin had ordered Korolev to assess Soviet intelligencereports on the Roswell, New Mexico, UFO crash. Korolev had reported backthat the UFOs were real but not dangerous, the article "revealed."Yet just seven pages earlier, another expert named Lev Chulkov had written:"As early as the beginning of the 1950s, Stalin ordered Korolev tostudy the phenomenon of UFOs, but Korolev managed to avoid fulfilling thistask." Of course, both claims can't be true. Besides, Burdakov wasa recently rehabilitated political prisoner in 1947 and was thus hardlythe type of trusted expert that Stalin would have consulted. Behind all such distracting noise, the UFO problem remains a fascinatingand elusive puzzle, worthy of serious research. But weeding out true UFOsfrom the overwhelming mass of "IFOs," or identified flying objects,is a difficult, time-consuming task, as Western UFOlogists have learnedin the past half century. Their new Russian colleagues so far show no indicationthat they have even begun. "I haven't seen too much effort at that job," admits AntonioHuneeus, one of the West's most perceptive pro-UFO observers of RussianUFOlogy. "The Russians themselves keep knocking on my door,"Huneeus states. "They want to sell their stuff here." In fact,given today's economic crisis in Russia, thousands of people of all classes,but particularly from the military services, are desperately seeking-ordeliberately creating-anything they can sell to Western buyers with bucks.UFO files are one of the few exportable raw materials with a market inthe West, so there should be no surprise that there are suddenly so manybizarre items now available and so few Russians willing to be cautiousor critical about them. If these Russian UFO delusions only affected their own research, thesilliness would do no worldwide harm. But the intellectual infection hasspread far beyond borders and polluted UFO studies in other countries aswell. These new commercial conspiracies between Russian tall-tale sellersand Western tall-tale tellers in the entertainment and pseudodocumentaryindustry will make it much worse. The more serious Western UFOlogists, for instance, are particularlyembarrassed by their colleagues' naive, unbounded enthusiasm for the 1967"crescents" and the subsequent so-called Gindilis Report, withSoviet thermonuclear weapons tests masquerading as true UFOs. Dr. JamesMcDonald, probably America's top UFO expert of the 1960s, testified thatthe crescents "can not be readily explained in any conventional terms."Dr. J. Allen Hynek, dean of American UFOlogy in the 1970s, reviewed thesightings and crowed, "It becomes very much harder-in fact, from mypersonal viewpoint, impossible-to find a trivial solution for all the UFOreports if one weights and considers the caliber of some of the witnesses."They were scientists, pilots, engineers, and fellow astronomers, and Hynekas absolutely certain they couldn't have been mistaken. Today's successor to McDonald and Hynek is retired space scientist RichardHaines, American director of the joint United States-Commonwealth of independentStates working group on UFOs, the Aerial Anomaly Federation. Concerningthe 1967 sightings, he confidently wrote that "the reports representcurrently unknown phenomena, being completely different in nature fromknown atmospheric optics effects or technical experiments in the atmosphere." Another famous Russian pseudo UFO case, called the "Cape KamennyUFO," has long been foolishly championed by Western UFO experts. TopAmerican UFOlogist Jacques Valle cited this encounter in a 1992 book asone of the best in the world. His casebook coding scheme gave it the highestmarks: "Firsthand personal interview with the witness by a sourceof proven reliability; site visited by a skilled analyst; and no explanationpossible, given the evidence." A graphic account of this UFO was given by American UFOlogist WilliamL. Moore based on casebooks compiled by Zigel. "On December 3, 1967at 3:04p.m.," wrote Moore, several crewmen and passengers of an IL-18aircraft on a test flight for the State Scientific Institute of Civil Aviationsited an intensely bright object approaching them in the night sky."Moore reported that the object "followed" the evasive turns ofthe aircraft. But years later I discovered that the aircraft, passing near Vorkutain the northern Urals, had by chance been crossing the flight path of theKosmos-194 spy satellite during its ascent from Plesetsk. The crew hadunwittingly observed the rocket's plumes and the separation of its strap-onboosters. All other details of maneuvers were added in by their imaginations.Yet this bogus UFO story is highlighted as authentic by nearly every Westernaccount of Russian UFOs in the last 20 years. Of course, not all Russian UFO reports spring from missile and spaceevents. Far from it! But those specific kinds of stimuli are extremelywell documented, unlike other traditional pseudo UFO stimuli such as balloons,experimental aircraft, military and police helicopters, bodice fireballs,and so forth. Thus, they can provide an unmatchable calibration test forthe ability of Russian UFOlogists to find solutions for these pseudo UFOs. The Russian UFOlogists have failed. The ultimate test of the Russians'ability to perform mature, reliable UFO research is how they treat "thesmoking gun" of Russian UFOlogy, the Petrozavodsk "jellyfish"UFO of 1977. The "jellyfish" was a brief wonder in the West beforebeing quickly solved (by me) as the launch of a rocket from Plesetsk. WesternUFOlogists readily accepted the explanation, but now it turns out thatRussian UFO experts never did. They have assembled a vast array of miraclestories associated with the event, including reports of telepathic messagesand physical damage to the earth. But all this proves is that ordinary Russians love to embellish storiesand that Russian UFO researchers haven't a clue on how to filter out suchexaggerations from original perceptions. If they cannot do it for suchobviously bogus UFOs as Petrozavodsk, how can they be expected to do itfor less clearcut ones? If the UFO mystery is to be solved, there is adequate data from therest of the world outside of Russia. Serious UFOlogists will have to quarantinethe obviously hopelessly infected UFO lore from Russia and disregard itall. Some valuable data might be lost, but the crippling effect of unconstrainedcrackpottery would be avoided. Every decade or two, the question can bereconsidered with a simple test: Do leading Russian UFOlogists still insiston the alien nature of the 1967 crescent UFOs and the 1977 "jellyfish"UFO? If so, slam the door on them again. Yet the temptation may be too great, especially for those who are intowhat I call the "fairy tale mode" of modern UFO study-those whobelieve the best cases are ones that happened long ago and far away, andthus are forever immune from prosaic solution. Russian UFO stories haveturned out to be exactly those kinds of fairy tales. And if the purpose of modern UFOlogy is only mystery worship and obfuscation,only mind-boggling tall tales and mind-stretching theorizing, then it willcontinue to feed on the baseless bilge coming out of Russia while beinginsidiously and unavoidable poisoned by it. The reality test, then, isnot of Russian UFOlogy, which has already failed, but of non-Russian UFOlogy,where the issue remains in doubt. *END* **************************************************************************** COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SIX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS PART II Article by Dennis Stacy Editor's note (OMNI Mag.): This is the second of a six-part series ivestigatingUFOs and government secrecy through the years. The decade under scrutinyhere is the 1950s. Shortly before midnight of July 19, 1952, air-traffic controllers atWashington National Airport picked up a group of unidentified flying objectson their radar screens. Over the next three and a half hours, the targetswould disappear and reappear on their scopes. They were visually corroboratedby incoming flight crews. At 3:00 in the morning, the Air Defense Commanddispatched two F-94 jet interceptors, which failed to make contact withthe targets. The following weekend, the same scenario virtually repeated itself.Unknown targets were picked up on radar and verified both by incoming pilotsand ground observers. This time, the hurriedly scrambled jets did manageto make visual contact and establish a brief radar lock-on, and the generalpublic joined in the hoopla as well. According to The UFO Controversy inAmerica, by Temple University historian David Jacobs, "So many callscame into the Pentagon alone that its telephone circuits were completelytied up with UFO inquiries for the next few days." In several majornewspapers, the 1952 UFO flap even bumped the Democratic National Conventionoff the front-page-headlines. The so-called "Washington Wave" also resulted in at leasttwo events that have been debated ever since. On July 29, in an attemptto quell public concern, the military held its largest press conferencesince the end of WWII. Press conference heads Maj. Gen. John Samford, directorof Air Force Intelligence, adn Maj. Gen. Roger Ramey, chief of the AirDefense Command, denied that any interceptors had been scrambled and attributedthe radar returns to temperature inversions. In addition, the Washington sightings led directly to the CIA-sponsoredRobertson Panel, so named after its chairman Dr. Harold P. Robertson, directorof the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group for the secretary of defense. ThePanel's basic mandate was outlined in a document later retrieved underthe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In that crucial document, a 1952 memorandum to the National SecurityCouncil (NSC), CIA director Walter Bedell Smith wrote that "a broader,coordinated effort should be initiated to develop a firm scientific understandingof the several phenomena which are apparently involved in these reports,and to assure outselves that [they] will not hamber our present effortsin the Cold War or confuse our early warning system in case of an attack." In line with this mandate, the panel that finally convened in Washington,DC, in mid January of 1953 consisted of some of the best scientific mindsof the day. Members included a future Nobel Prize laureate in physics,Luis Alvarez, formerly of Berkeley; physicist Samuel Goudsmit of the BrookhavenNational Laboratories; and astronomer Thornton Page of Johns Hopkins University,later with NASA> Yet for all of its scientific expertise, the Panel's major recommendationsfell mainly in the domain of public policy. After a review of the evidence,the Panel concluded that while UFOs themselves did not necessarily "constitutea direct threat to the national security. . . the continued emphasis onthe reporting of these phenomena does [threaten] the orderly functioningof the protective organs of the body politic." Panel members recommended that "national-security agencies takesteps immediately to strip the UFO phenomenon of its special status andeliminate the aura of mystery it has acquired." Perhaps a public-educationprogram with the dual goals of "training and debunking" couldbe implemented? In this context, the Panel suggested that the mass mediamight be brought to bear on the problem, up to and including Walt DisneyProductions! More interestingly, the Panel also recommended that pro-UFO grassrootsorganizations be actively monitored "because of thei r potentiallygreat influence on mass thinking if widespread sightings should occur."Mentioned by name were two organizations that had arisen in the wake ofthe Washington Wave: Civilian Saucer Intelligence of Los Angeles and theAerial Phenomena Research Organization of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, bothnow defunct. Is there evidence that such surveillance was conducted or that the RobertsonPanel recommendations influenced government policies? "The paper trailis sketchy at best," says Dale Goudie, a Seattle advertising agentand information director for the Computerized UFO Network, or CUFON, anelectronic bulletin board specializing in UFO documents retrieved underthe FOIA. "What we know is that some agencies tend to keep some oldUFO files while throwing out or mysteriously losing others. For example,we know the FBI kept a file on George Adamski, a famous UFO 'contactee'of the Fifties, perhaps because they thought he was a communist, and thatthe CIA had communicated with Maj. Donald Keyhoe, later one of the directorsof the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. "When it comes to their own programs, however, the agencies area bit more absent-minded." An example, says Goudie, Project Aquarius."The National Security Agency [NSA] admitted in a letter to SenatorJohn Glenn that apparently there is or was an Air Force Project Aquariusthat dealt with UFOs," Goudie states. "Their own Project Aquarius,they said, did not, but they refused to say what it did deal with. Theydid admit it was classified top secret and that the release of any documentswould damage the national security. The Air Force denies the existenceof their own Project Aquarius, and the NSA now says it was mistaken. Theyought to get their stories straight." "It's almost impossible to confirm that any individual action wasdirectly dictated by the Robertson Panel," agrees physicist and UFOlogistStanton Friedman, co-author of Crash at Corona, "but was the subjectdefused at every available opportunity per its recommendations? You bet!" Friedman points specifically to a press release issued on October 25,1955, by the Department of Defense, chaired by secretary of the Air ForceDonald Quarles. The occasion was the release of Special Report 14, issuedby Project Blue Book, the Air Force agency publicly charged with investigatingUFOs. Quarles said there was no reason to believe that any UFO had everoverflown the United States and that the 3 percent of unknowns reportedthe previous year could probably be identified with more information. As Friedman sees it, however, Special Report 14 was the best UFO studyever conducted. Interpreting the report for Omni, Friedman says it showedthat "over 20 percent of all UFO sightings investigated between 1947and 1952 were unknowns, and the better the quality of the sighting, themore likely it was to be an unknown. The press release failed to mentionany of the 240 charts and tables in the original study," adds Friedman,"nor did it point out that the work had been done by the highly respectedBattelle Memorial Institute under contract to the Department of Air Force.It's a classic case," Friedman says, "of the government havingtwo hands and the left one not knowning what the right one is up to." Whatever the truth about UFOs, however, the government tried mightilyto conceal information suggesting mysterious origins afoot. For a populationalready shaky over nuclear arsenals, cold war, and communists under everbush, officials may have reckoned that the notion of visitors from beyond,even imaginary ones, might just have been too much to bear. ************************************************************************* COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SIX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS PART III Article by DENNIS STACY The third in a six-part series on government suppression of UFO-relatedmaterial, this article examines the 1960s. The Sixties were marked by upheaval: street riots outside the DemocraticNational Convention in Chicago, demonstrations against the war in Vietnam,"free love," and psychedelic drugs. And according to pundits,a "Big Brother" government intent on suppressing the winds ofchange had extended its reach beyond the merely social or political tothe realm of UFOs. The result of this saucer suppression? Angry congressionalhearings and the closure of Project Blue Book, the Air Force agency responsiblefor investigating UFOs. The Sixties' "Saucergate" was triggered on March 20, 1966,when a glowing, football-shaped UFO was reported hovering above a swampyarea near the women's dormitory of a small college in Hillsdale, Michigan.Witnesses included 87 female students and the local civil-defense director.The following night in Dexter, 63 miles away, another UFO was spotted byfive people, including two police officers. The Michigan sightings provoked a national outcry; in short, the publicwanted an explanation. Addressing the largest media gathering in the historyof the Detroit Free Press Club, Project Blue Book spokesman J. Allen Hynek,an astronomer with Ohio State University, finally ventured an opinion.He said the sightings might be due to "swamp gas"-methane gasfrom rotting vegetation that had somehow spontaneously ignited. The explanationdidn't wash, and both Hynek and the Air Force found themselves the bruntof immediate and almost universal ridicule. Newspapers had a field dayas cartoonists, columnists, and editorial writers nationwide lampoonedthe Air Force suggestion. In a letter to the House Armed Services Committee, then-Michagan congressmanand House Republican minority leader (and later president) Gerald R. Fordcalled for congressional hearings on the subject, arguing that "theAmerican Public deserves a better explanation than that thus far givenby the Air Force." The subcommittee subsequently held its hearingon April 5, 1966, but only three individuals, all with Air Force connections,were invited to testify: Hynek, then-Blue Book chief; Hector Quintanilla;and Harold D. Brown, secretary of the Air Force. Brown told the committee,chaired by L. Mendel Rivers, that they had no evidence of an extraterrestrialorigin of UFOs, nor was there any indication that UFOs constituted a threatto national security. Under scrutiny, however, the Air Force eventually agreed to an outsidereview of Blue Book's files. Toward that end, the Air Force awarded $500,000to the University of Colorado at Boulder. The major-domo of this extensivereview was physicist Edward U. Condon, former director of the NationalBureau of STandards. His second in command was the assistant dean of thegraduate school, Robert Low. Initially, critics of the government's UFO policy were happy to seethe matter out of Air Force hands. But it didn't take long for their faithin the Condon effort to fade. If the Air Force had tried to gloss overthe UFO issue, said retired Marine major Donald E. Keyhoe, director ofthe civilian National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP),the Condon Commission was even worse. The day after his appointment, for instance, Condon was quoted in theDenver Rocky Mountain News. He was "no evidence," he said, for"advanced life on other planets." Moreover, he explained, thestudy would give the public a "better understanding of ordinary phenomena,which, if recognized at once, would reduce the number of UFO reports." Low, Condon's chief administrator, seems to have prejudged the realityof UFOs, too. In a telling memo written to University administrators, Lownoted that "the trick would be, I think, to describe the project sothat to the public it would appear a totally objective study but to thescientific community would present the image of a group of non believerstrying their best to be objective but having an almost zero expectationof finding a saucer." Condon soon fired the two senior staffers he blamed for leaking thememo to the press. Two weeks later, Mary Lou Armstrong, his own administrativeassistant resigned, citing low morale within the project as a whole. "Low'sattitude from the beginning," she wrote, "has been one of negativism.[He] showed little interest in keeping current on sightings, either byreading or talking with those who did." At one point, Low left fora month, ostensibly to represent the Condon Committee at the InternationalAStronomical Union in Prague. Staff members suggested he use the opportunityto meet with veteran UFO researchers in England and France. Instead, Lowwent to Loch Ness, claiming that sea monsters and UFOs might share somesimilarities since neither existed. Even so, there is no record that hefiled any written notes on his investigations. The Condon Report was published in August of 1968 as the ScientificStudy of Unidentified Flying Objects. In all, 30 of the 91 cases analyzedremained unidentified. Examining the famous McMinnville, Oregon, UFO photos,for example, project investigators opined that this was "one of thefew UFO reports in which all factors investigated, geometric, psychological,and physical, appear to be consistent with the assertion that an extraordinaryflying object, silvery, metallic, disc shaped, flew within sight of twowitnesses." Of a radar/visual UFO sighting that occurred over Lakenheath,England, in August of 1965, the study concluded that "the probabilitythat at least one genuine UFO was involved appeared to be fairly high." Yet these suggestions that an unidentified phenomenon might indeed beafoot were buried in a bulky 1,500-page report. More readily accessibleto the media was Condon's conclusion, published at the beginning of thestudy rather than at the end, as was standard scientific procedure. Essentially,Condon concluded, "further extensive study of UFOs probably cannotbe justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby." The Air Force seized the opportunity to withdraw from the minefieldof UFOs, and on December 17, 1969, called a press conference to announcethe closing of Project Blue Book. Citing the Condon report, acting secretaryof the Air Force, Robert C. Seamans, Jr., told reporters that Blue Book'scontinuation could no longer "be justified on grounds of nationalsecurity or in the interest of science." Critics contend that Blue Book never mounted a thorough scientific investigationof the UFO phenomenon to begin with, and that during its 22-year involvementwith the issue, it had functioned as little more than a public-relationsprogram. The charge, it turns out, was made by Hynek himself. In his lastinterview, granted this reporter shortly before his death from a braintumor, Hynek avowed that while th Air Force always said it was interestedin the study of UFOs, officials regularly "turned handsprings to keepa good case from getting to the attention of the media. Any case they solved,"Hynek added, "they had no trouble talking about. It was really sad." As the Sixties came to a close, the Air Force finally got what it wanted:It officially washed its hands of UFOs. Condon continued to deny the subjectwas "shrouded in secrecy." Overall, he said, the Air Force haddone a commendable job. Hynek agreed, though for reasons of his own. "The Air Force regardedUFOs as an intelligence matter, and it became increasingly more and moreembarrassing to them," he said. "After all, we paid good taxdollars to have the Air Force guard our skies, and it would have been badpublic relations for them to say, 'Yes there's something up there, butwe're helpless.' They just couldn't do that, so they took the very humanaction of protecting their own interests." *END* *************************************************************************** COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SEX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS PART IV Article by Dennis Stacy This is the fourth in a six-part series on alleged UFO-related governmentcover-ups. This segment covers the 1970s. Todd Zechel knows how David feltthe day he marched out to take on Goliath. Early in 1978, in otherwiseout-of-the-way Prairie due Sac, Wisconsin, Zechel helped found CitizensAgainst UFO Secrecy, or CAUS. The group's mandate: to take on the behemothof the U.S. government, which had kept thousands of documents relevantto UFO researchers under lock and key for years. In the past, getting to those documents had been virtually impossible.For the most part, they were buried within a paper labyrinth of agencieswithin agencies, each employing its own unique form of "bureauspeak"and filing. What was an "unidentified flying object" in one agencymight be an "incident report" or "air space violation"in another. The reports might be in the form of a carbon copy, micro film,or rapidly degrading thermal fax paper, barely legible in the original.Other files were lost or routinely destroyed on a regular basis. Still, one had to start somewhere, and CAUS was determined to trackdown and make public as many of the existing documents as it could. Inits quest for truth, the new group would put out a newsletter called JustCause, and, with the help of UFO researcher Brad Sparks and attorney PeterGersten, tread legal waters no UFO group had entered before. "We werefull of fire," Zechel now recalls. "We had served the governmentnotice; we weren't going to take their stonewalling anymore, and if necessary,we would haul them into court." The euphoria was not misplaced. As the Seventies unfurled, most UFOlogistsfelt that all they needed in the battle against the governmental Goliathwas one good slingshot. Any now that slingshot, in the form of the newlyenacted Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, was here. Signed into law in 1966 by a Democratic Congress under President LyndonJohnson, FOIA (affectionately called "foya") was created so thepublic could access all but the most highly classified government records.Nine categories of information were originally exempted from scrutiny,beginning with those affecting national security and foreign policy andthen trickling down into fairly mundane materials like maps. UFOs, of course,weren't mentioned at all. Then, in the mid Seventies, the Nixon administration gave FOIA moremuscle still. Time limits were imposed on agencies receiving FOIA requests.Affordable fees for the search and reproduction of requested documentswere established, and courts were empowered to decide whether or not specificdocuments fell within the act's guidelines. In the real world outside the halls of Congress, however, the soldiersfor CAUS found land mines strewn across the battlefield. The first CAUScelebre, Zechel states, occurred before the Wisconsin group was officiallyformed. It was 1977, and Zechel, Sparks, and Gersten made their stab atwielding the FOIA through the auspices of the now defunct Ground SaucerWatch, a UFO group based in Phoenix. In 1975, it turns out, the Phoenixgroup's director Bill Spaulding, had written the CIA complaining it hadwithheld a vast quantity of information on UFOs. "It wasn't an official FOIA request as such," Zechel says,"but more like an accusatory letter. Surprisingly, the CIA responded." Specifically, Spaulding had referenced the case of one Ralph Mayher,a marine photographer who claimed to have filmed a UFO over Miami Bay inJuly of 1952. Mayher went on to become a celebrated news cameraman withABC news in Los Angeles. Not surprisingly, under the circumstances, healso signed on as a consultant to one of the more prominent UFO organizationsof the day-the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, orNICAP. Only years later did Mayher learn that, unbeknownst to him, hisoriginal film had been turned over to the CIA for analysis. Looking into the matter, the CIA's response to Spaulding was expected:Its interest in UFOs was virtually nonexistent, the Agency declared, andhad been ever since 1952, when a panel of scientists met in Washingtonto declare the phenomenon a public-relations problem, nothing more. Butmuch to Spaulding's surprise, the spy agency also released two documentsrelating to the Mayher case. "The Agency had blacked our about 70percent of the documents," Zechel states, "and also referredto three other related documents still in their possession." Zechel retained Gersten, who in 1977 filed a suit seeking full releaseof all five documents. The case wound up in federal district court as GSWvs. the CIA under the jurisdiction of Judge John Pratt. After protractedlegal maneuverings, lawyers for both sides finally met with representativesof the attorney general's office in Washington in July of 1978. "At that meeting," according to Zechel, "I had threatenedto have the CIA prosecuted for making false replies under the FOIA. Ultimately,the Agency agreed to search all of its files for UFO records and to stipulatewhich ones it would release and which it wouldn't. As the FOIA was structuredat the time, the CIA was also obligated to account for any deletions onan item-by-item basis." As Zechel recalls, the CIA missed its original 90-day deadline by 88days. "Then they dumped a stack of documents on our desk about twoto three feet thick, heavily blacked out, and with none of the deletionsaccounted for," Zechel states. "We now had 30 days to try toidentify and contest the deletions, which was humanly impossible." Instead, Gersten filed a motion claiming the CIA stood in contempt ofcourt and clearly had not acted in good faith. The motion was filed afterGSW's own 30-day response deadline had expired, however, and Judge Prattsummarily dismissed the suit. "We were one day late," Zechelrecalls, "and that effectively ended the suit." But when all was said and done, the CIA decided to release some 900pages of UFO-related documents. Indeed, like the CIA, many agencies decidedto release documents even when courts did not force their hands. A requestfor UFO files from the FBI, for instance, netted almost 2,000 pages. Byscrutinizing documents obtained from the FBI and CIA, moreover, CAUS researcherswere able to identify witnesses. They could also pinpoint relevant incidentslikely to be described in documents on file with a host of other governmentagencies. Ultimately, CAUS would be responsible for the release of between 7,000and 8,000 UFO-related documents from a who's who of official entities,including the Air Force, Coast Guard, Navy, Defense Intelligence Agency,North American Aerospace Defense Command, Federal Aviation Administration,and others. Among the major tidbits revealed were a series of sightings reportedfrom October through November 1975 by the northern tier of Air Force basesfrom Montana to Maine; several of these sightings involved personnel stationedat Minuteman silos. CAUS also uncovered a September 1976 file on an ImperialIranian Air Force jet that reportedly locked its radar onto a bright UFOonly to have its electronic weapons system fail. CAUS's most celebrated suit, however, was the one it launched againstthe supersecret National Security Agency (NSA) in December 1979. The casewas not fully resolved until March 1982 when the Supreme Court refusedto hear Gersten's appeal. Although the agency admitted to having approximately57 documents pertaining to UFOs in its files, it successfully refused torelease them, citing national-security concerns. Despite the progress, Zechel can't help wishing that CAUS had been ableto do more. "I felt we could inflame the public and marshal tremendouspopular support," Zechel says, "but we never got beyond fouror five hundred members. We were constantly hampered by a serious lackof funds and the usual personality conflicts." As for Gersten, he expresses disappointment that not every known documentwas turned over to SAUS, especially those from the CIA and NSA, but concedesthat "they were probably witheld for legitimate reasons. I suspectthey were protecting their own intelligence sources and technology."Gersten performed all of his work for CAUS pro bono, but estimates thathis fees would have come to nearly $70,000. "And that's in 1970 dollars,"he says. As the decade of the 1970s came to a close, Zechel left CAUS and hassince founded the Associated Investigators Group. CAUS, meanwhile, continuesunder different officers and still puts out its publication, Just CAUSEon a regular basis. "What's changed most is the FOIA itself," says Barry Greenwood,the newsletter's editor and current CAUS director of research. "Theact was essentially gutted by Executive Order number 12356, signed by PresidentRonald Reagan. Among other changes wrought by Reagan's general secrecyorder," according to Greenwood, "is the fact that agencies areno longer required to respond within a reasonable period of time. Searches,when they do them at all now, routinely take between six months and twoyears. The fees have gone up, too," Greenwood complains. "Oneagency cited us the enormous search fee of $250,000. It's very discouraging." Pennsylvania researcher Robert Todd was also involved with CAUS earlyon, but his experiences have left him disillusioned with both David andGoliath. "The UFO community won't be satisfied until the governmentadmits it's behind a vast cover-up," says Todd. "Is there a lotof material still being withheld? Without a doubt. But does that provethe government is engaged in a massive conspiracy, or that it's merelya massive bureaucracy? I can't state this strongly enough: I don't believethere's a cover-up at all." A spokesperson with the CIA's Freedom of Information office in Washington,DC, refused a telephone request to talk to someone regarding the agency'sFreedom of Information Act policy, explaining that all such inquiries wouldfirst have to be submitted in writing to John H. Wright, information andprivacy coordinator. Following agency guidelines, Omni has submitted awritten request for explanation of CIA policy as well as UFO documents,past and present. The request is still pending but remained unansweredat press time. Results of our inquiry will have to wait for a future editionof the magazine. As far as the UFO community is concerned, the work of CAUS, Zechel-style,remains undone. These days, says Todd, "getting any kind of documentout of the government is a lengthy, time consuming process. First, theyconsider the FOIA an annoyance; after all, they're understaffed and saddledwith budget constraints. Second, the nature of any government is to controlthe flow of information." *END* ***************************************************************************** COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SIX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS PART VArticle by Dennis Stacy and Patrick Huyghe This is the fifth piece in a six-part series on government secrecy andUFOs through the decades. Here we look at the 1980s. From their vantage point 22,300 miles above the earth's surface, a fleetof supersecret military satellites monitors our planet for missile launchesand nuclear detonations. On a clear day, these satellites can see forever,so it's no surprise when they also pick up erupting volcanos, oil-wellfires, incoming meteors, sunlight reflections off the ocean, and a hostof other head sources, including those that still remain unexplained. Since 1985, all this data has been beamed down in near real-time tothe U.S. Space Command's Missile Warning Center, operating from withinCheyenne Mountain, near Colorado Springs. The purpose: coordinating satellite-basedearly warning systems for the army, navy, air force, and marines. Whetherharmless or threatening, the information has always been a guarded nationalsecret. But suddenly, in 1993, with the Cold War over, the Defense Departmentagreed to declassify some satellite information not related to intercontinentalballistic missile (ICBM) launches and nuclear events. Since then, scientistsranging from astronomers to geophysicists have rushed to get their handson this motherload of data. Among researchers hoping to glean some truth from the declassified dataare UFOlogists, long frustrated by the critic's classic retort: "IfUFOs are real, why haven't they been detected by our satellites?"Well, some UFO researchers are now saying, they have been. With accessto the most sophisticated space data ever generated, say some UFO researchers,they may finally find the Holy Grail of their profession: bona fide, irrefutable,nuts-and-bolts proof of UFOs. As this series of articles explains, UFO researchers have been searchingfor such evidence in government vaults for years. In the Fifties and Sixties,some UFOlogists claimed, the military kept alien corpses and a ship underwraps. The search for proof was fueled throughout the Seventies by theFreedom of Information Act, which yielded thousands of pages of governmentdocuments, but no hard, technical, incontrovertible evidence of UFOs. Finally,in the 1980s, a supposedly explosive memo revealed the existence of a top-secretgroup, dubbed MJ12, made up of high-level government officials devotedto the secret reality of UFOs. Only problem is, according to most UFO experts,the memo was a hoax. Of course, data from crude detection systems likegun cameras and radar were available. But they merely confirmed the obvious:that military and goverment personnel, like many other sectors of the population,saw and reported mysterious lights in the sky. If they could ever prove their theories, UFOlogists knew, they wouldhave to tap the most sophisticated information-gathering technology available:Department of Defense spy satellites, like the Defense Support Program(DSP) satellites, in geosynchronous orbit above the earth. In face, rumorhad it, heat, light, and infrared sensors at the heart of the satelliteswere routinely picking up moving targets clearly not missiles and tagged"Valid IR Source." Some of these targets were given the mysteriouscode name of "Fast Walker." Unfortunately for UFOlogists, few secrets in this country's vast militaryarsenal have been so closely guarded as the operational parameters of DSPsatellites. Even their exact number is classified. "That shouldn'tsurprise anyone," explains Captain John Kennedy, public affairs officerwith the USAF Space Command Center at Peterson Air Force Base. "It'san early ICBM launch detection system, and we have to protect our own technologyfor obvious reasons. If everyone knew what the system's capabilities were,they would try to take steps to get around it." But in recent years,thanks to a loosening of the reigns, a few tantalizing tidbits of informationhave managed to seep under the satellite secrecy dam, allowing UFOlogistsa small glimpse of some surprising nearspace events. The first issue for UFOlogists to examine, explains Ron Regehr of AerojetGeneral in California, the company that builds the DSP sensor systems,is whether the satellites could detect UFOs even if we wanted them to.According to Regehr, who has worked on the satellite sensors for the last25 years and even wrote its operational software specifications, the answerto that question was revealed in 1990, during Operation Desert Storm. "Aswe know," says Regehr, "the satellites picked up every one ofthe 80 Iraqi Scud launches, and the Scud is a very low-intensity infraredsource compared to the average ICBM." Pursuing the matter further, Regehr turned to an article published inMIJI Quarterly, "Now You See It, Now You Don't," which detaileda September, 1976 UFO encounter near Teheran. The incident nivolved twobrilliantly glowing UFOs first seem by ground observers. One object, orlight source, an estimated 30 feet in diameter, reportedly went from groundlevel to an altitude of 40,000 feet, and was visible at a distance of 70miles. An Imperial Iranian Air Force F-4 jet fighter was sent aloft andmanaged to aim a Sidewinder AIM-19 air-to-air missile at the target beforeits electronic systems failed. "Apart from the visible light factor, there's the indication thatthe UFO gave off enough infrared energy for the Sidewinder's IR sensorto lock on to it," says Regehr. "You can do a few simple calculations,"he adds, "and conclude that teh DSP satellites of the day should easilyhave been able to see the same thing. Of course, I can't say they did,or if they did, whether or not it was recorded in the database." Part of the problem, according to Regehr, is the sheer mountain of datathat the DSP satellites generate. On average, an infrared portrait of theearth's surface and surrounding space is downloaded every ten seconds.All of the data is then stored on larget 14-inch reels of magnetic tape,"the kind," says Regehr, "that you always see spinning aroundin science fiction movies, and which fill up in about 15 minutes."The tapes are eventually erased and reused. Technicians visually monitor the datastream on a near real-time basis,but only follow up a narrow range of events-those that match up with whatthe air force calls "tamplates." Based on known rocket fuel burntimes and color spectra, the templates are used to identify ballistic missilelaunches and nuclear explosions. But the system also picks up other infraredevents ranging from mid-air collisions of planes to oil-well fires andvolcanoes. "I would say that rarely a week goes by that we don't get somekind of infrared source that is avalid, or real, but physicist and consultantto the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California, a nonprofit airforce satellite engineering contractor. "But once we determine itisn't a threat, that's basically the end of our job. We aren't paid tolook at each and every one." Tagliaferri and a handful of colleagues are among the few civilian spacescientists who have thus far been allowed access to the Department of Defensedatabase. Their research, based on spy satellite data declassified in thefall of 1993, is part of a chapter in Hazards Due to Comets and Asteroids,from the University of Arizona Press. "I think the air force finallyagreed that the data had scientific, as well as political and global securityvalue," says Tagliaferri. What Tagliaferri and his collaborators were able to confirm was thatbetween 1975 and 1992, DOD satellites detected 136 upper-atmosphere explosions,a few equivalent in energy to the atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshimaand Nagasaki. Unlike the three-to ten-minute burn periods of an ICBM, thesepreviously unacknowledged "flash events" typically take placein a matter of seconds. They are attributable to meteorites and small asteroids."Most of what we see are objects that are probably 10 to 50 metersin diameter, about the size of a house, and packing 300 times the kineticenergy of dynamite," Tagliaferri says. The ramification, however, is that nervous governments might mistakethese flash events for nuclear bombsaimed in their direction and triggera like response. One of the brightest unknown flash events occurred overindonesia on April 15, 1988, shortly before noon, exploding with the approximatefirepower of 5.000 tons of high explosives. A slightly less powerful detonationshook an uninhabited expance of the Pacific Ocean on October 1, 1990, inthe midst of Operation Deser Shield. "But what if the latter event had exploded a little lower in theatmosphere, and over, say Baghdad?" Tagliaferri warns. "The consequencescould well have been disastrous. Ground observers would have seen a fireballthe brightness of the sun and heard a shock wave rattle windows. Giventhe mindset of the Iraqis, Israelis, and the other combatants in the areaat that time, any of them might have concluded that they were under nuclearattack and responded accordingly." The argument that some UFOs might be capable of triggering a similarfalse alarm ahs been made many times in the past by, among others, theSoviets. An article titled "UFOs and Security," which appearedin the June, 1989 issue of Soviet Military Review, states: "We believethat lack of information on the characteristics an dinfluence of UFOs increasesthe threat of incorrect identification. Then, mass transit of UFOs alongtrajectories close to those of combast missiles could be regarded by computersas an attack." But when asked if some unknowns detected by satellite sensors mightrepresent real UFOs rather than incoming meteorites, Tagliaferri chuckles."Personally, I don't think so," he says. "But who knows?How can you tell? I'm a scientist, a physicist, and to my mind the evidenceof UFOs is just not convicing. On the other hand, I've been wrong before." UFOlogists, meanwhile, think that proof might be lurking in the stacksof printouts from the DSP system computers. But the only material of thissort likely to see the light of day will probably have to come from insideleaks. And that may have already happened. One UFO researcher, using sourceshe won't reveal, has turned up evidence of what he believes mihgt be aUFO tracked by satellite. Last year, aJoe Stefula, formerly a special agentwith the army's Criminal Investigation Command, made public on severalelectronic bulletin boards what purports to be a diagram of an infraredeven detected by a DSP satellite on May 5, 1984. "I haven't been ableto determine that the document's absolutely authentic," says Stefula,"but I have been able to confirm that the DSP printout for that dateshows an event at the same time with the same characteristics." According to Stefula's alleged source, now said to be retired from themilitary, the offical code name for unidentified objects exhibiting ballisticmissile characteristics is Fast Walker. "But what makes this particularFast Walker so peculiar," says Stefula, "is that it comes infrom outer space on a curved trajectory, passes within three kilometersof the satellite platform, and then disappears back into space. Whateverit is, it was tracked for nine minutes. That doesn't sound like a meteoriteto me." Regehr agrees: "It was there too long. It was going too slow. Itdidn't have enough speed for escape velocity." But escape it did. The May, 1984 event allegedly generated a 300-page internal report,only portions of which are classified, though non of it has yet been released."I don't think they would do a 300-page report on everything theydetect," says Stefula, whose efforts to obtain the report have sofar been unsuccessful, "so there must have been something significantabout this that led them to look into it. My source told me that they basicallylooked at every possibility and couldn't explain it by natural or man-mademeans." Nor was this apparently an isolated event. According to the unnamedsource, such Fast Walkers are detected, on the average, "two to threetimes a month." Even longtime arch-UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass, contributing avionicseditor to Aviaton Week and Space Technology, admits that the military'sDSP satellites could detect physical flying saucers from outer space-butwith one very large proviso: "If you assume," says Klass, "thata UFO traveling at, say 80,000 feet leaves a long strong plume liek a spaceshuttle launch. But we know that isn't the way UFOs are usually reported." Part of the problem, according to Klass, who has written a book on militaryspy satellites titled Secret Sentries in Space, is that the DSP systemhas performed better than spec. "It's too good, or too sensitive,if you prefer," he says. "In fact, it was so good that it wassent back to research and development for fine tuning, in order to eliminateas many false alarms as possible. Obviously, we didn't want a fuel storagetank fire next to a Soviet missile silo to set off a launch alarm,"he explains. "Nor did we want the system to track the dozens or hundredsof Russian jet fighters in the air every day." Klass's best guess is that the mysterious May, 1984 Fast Walker evenuncovered by Stefula probably represents nothing more than a classifiedmission flown by our own SR-71 high-altitude Blackbird spyplane. "it'sadmittedly too long a duration to be a meteor fireball," he concedes,"but the Blackbird typically flies at an altitude of 80,000 to 100,000feet, which makes its afterburner trail easily visible to the DSP system." In the same context, says Klass, Fast Walker might be a code name forthe recently retired SR-71 itself, or, conceivably, its Soviet counterpart,assuming the Soviets had one at the time. Either way, Klass concludes,"It's no surprise that the air force would want to keep much of thisinformation secret." Apparently, keep most of it secret they will. Despite the success Tagliaferriand a few others had in getting past the military censors, don't anticipatea flood of similar studies, especially one in search of UFO reports. "Idon't see the air force declassifying a whole lot more of the DSP datato other scientists, not without an incredible amount of cleanup,"says Captain Kennedy. "And it's certainly not accessible to requeststhrough the Freedom of Information Act." Even if some unknowns turn out to be UFOs, the Air Force Space Commandisn't going to hand UFOlogists-or anyone else-that information on a silverplatter. Meanwhile, the dividing line between what might constitute extraterrestrialtechnology and our own twentieth century equivalent grows increasinglynarrow and blurred with every new device sent into space. Somewhere outthere, no doubt, is a sensor system that already knows whether we are beingvisited by UFOs or not, but the owners of those systems aren't talking. *END* ************************************************************************* COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SIX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS PART VI Editor's note (Omni Mag): In the final installment of our six-part serieson alleged government cover-ups and UFOs, we look at the most controversialcase of the 1990s. The sun sinks beyond the jagged Groom Mountains like a bloated red basketball.As temperatures plummet in the thin desert air, we make our way up a narrowarroyo to the base of White Sides, a towering jumble of limestone ledgesoverlooking the super-secret air base below, our hiking boots making crunchingsounds in the growing darkness. We've been whispering and walking side-by-side. Now our guide, a youngmountain goat by the name of Glenn Campbell, takes the lead. "Damn!"he suddenly hisses, "They've erased them again," referring tothe orange arrows spray-painted on the rocks a few days earlier. "They"are the anonymous individuals Campbell refers to as the "cammo dudes."Thought to be civilian employees of the Air Force, they patrol the perimeterof the unacknowledged base in white all-terrain vehicles, monitoring electronicdetectors and, by the way, erasing signposts like those on the rocks. Wheninterlopers cross the military boundaries or haul out their cameras, it'sthe cammo dudes who call in the local constabulary, the Lincoln CountySheriff's Department, to confiscate the film. Campbell assures us that we don't have to worry, though. For one thing,we all agreed to leave our cameras locked in our cars at the bottom ofWhite Sides. For another, we're still on public property, well outsidethe restricted zone which comprises part of the vast Nellis Air Force Rangecomplex and stretches more than halfway from here to Las Vegas, 100 milesaway. "Besides," he says cheerfully, "it'll take the sheriff40 minutes to get here. By that time we'll already be on top, and he'llhave to wait for us to get down." Still, White Sides is no cake walk. Beginning at about 5,000 feet, itrises in altitude for another 1,000 feet. From here, however, you can peerdown on one of the world's longest runways and one of the Cold War's mostisolated inner sanctums. It was here, variously known as Groom Lake, Area51, Dreamland, or simply the Ranch, that sophisticated black-budget (thatis, off-the-record) projects like the U-2, SR-71 Blackbird, and F-117AStealth fighter first earned their wings in secrecy. And it was 15 milessouth of here, at an even more clandestine (and controversial) base ofoperations known as Area S4 at Papoose Lake, that shadowy physicist RobertLazar claimed to have helped study captured flying-saucer technology. Because of its remoteness, spying on alleged Area S4 is out of the question,which leaves Groom Lake as the next best UFO mecca, assuming the many rumorssurrounding these remote outposts are rooted even in half-truths. We breakout our binoculars and sweep the runway, clearly outlined by a string ofsmall red lights. At one end, backed up against the base of the Groom Mountains,squats a collection of radar arrays and giant hangars, feebly illuminatedon this Saturday night by fan-shaped rays of yellow light. "Lookslike they're shut down for the weekend," Campbell whispers. Still, the thrill of visually eavesdropping on this country's most secretair base sends a certain chill up the spine, where it mingles with thegrowing desert chill and the memory of the signs at the bottom of WhiteSides authorizing the use of deadly force. All remains eerily silent, however;not so much as a cricket, cammo dude, sheriff, or UFO disturbs the night.After a few hours of fruitless surveillance, fingers and toes numbed bythe cold, we start back down. Campbell, a retired computer programmer, explains why he left the comfyconfines on his native Boston and moved lock, stock, and Mac Powerbookto Rachel, a hardscrabble community of 100 smack in the middle of the Nevadadesert. "You go where the UFO stories are," he says, "andin the fall of 1992, when I first came here Dreamland was where they were."Campbell had read an article published the year before in the monthly journalof the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) detailing some of the exploits of Lazar,who claimed to have actually been aboard one of nine recovered flying saucerssequestered at Area S4 while helping reverse-engineer their apparent antigravitypropulsion system. In a series of November 1989 interviews with then anchormanGeorge Knapp of KLAS-TV, the Las Vegas CBS affiliate, Lazar went publicwith his claims. Dreamland, at least, was now in the public domain. Though Lazar's credibility has recently taken a nosedive, even withUFO insiders, Knapp, now senior vice president with the Altamira CommunicationsGroup, an independent video production company, notes that "storiesof captured or acquired alien technology have circulated in the area sincethe mid 1950s and the very beginning of the base." His best source,among the 14 he has interviewed to date, is a member of a prominent Nevadafamily who will not allow his name to be used, although he has supposedlyvideotaped a deposition to be given to Knapp upon his death. Accordingto Knapp, his source occupied a position of senior management at GroomLake during the late Fifties and early Sixties, and admitted that at leastone extraordinary craft was being test flown and taken apart. "It'sthe totality of the accounts, not any specific one, that I find convincing,"says Knapp. Spurred by the local lore following his first visit, Campbell returnedto Boston, packed his belongings in a rickety Toyota camper, and in Januaryof 1993 moved to Rachel, setting up shop in the dusty parking lot of theLittle A-Le-Inn, a combination bar and restaurant turned UFO museum, jointjumping-off point, watering-hole headquarters, and sometime conferencecenter for UFOlogists hoping to repeat the earlier Lazar sightings. Campbellbegan his own investigation and was soon desktop publishing the Area 51Viewer's Guide, of which he estimates he has now sold more than 2,000 copies. As reports of UFOs in the area soared, so did Campbell's reputationas de facto onsite guide. In the last year alone, virtually every majormedia outlet in the country, from CNN, NBC, and ABC News to the New YorkTimes, Despite the temptation to turn tabloid, Campbell seems to have kepthis head on straight. "I am still interested in the UFO phenomenon,"he says, "but the evidence has to speak for itself. I've been livinghere night and day for over a year now and still haven't seen anythingthat couldn't be explained." He's also seen satisfied believers comeand go. "But most of what they report," Campbell warns, "isordinary military activity, from Russian MiGs to parachute flares. Youpretty much see what you want to see, depending on what kind of expectationsyou bring to the table." A case in point is so-called Old Faithful. In the wake of Lazar's allegations,observers were soon reporting a brilliant UFO adhering to a rigid scheduleat 4:50 every weekday morning. Campbell, a UFOlogists who readily admitshe likes his sleep, nonetheless routinely roused himself-until he becameconvinced that what he was seeing was nothing more than the landing lightsof a approaching 737. Methodical by nature, Campbell purchased a radioscanner and began monitoring flights outside McCarran Airport in Las Vegas.It turned out that Janet, a private charter airline, routinely flies intoGroom Lake from Las Vegas, transporting workers as Lazar had previouslyalleged. Old Faithful was their early morning flight, and in the next releaseof his Viewer's Guide, Campbell published the airline's complete schedule. But stories of alleged alien involvement at or near Area 51 continue.On the evening of March 16, 1993 William Hamilton, director of investigationsfor MUFON Los Angeles, and a companion were parked alongside Highway 375near the popular Black Mailbox viewing area when a bright light winkedinto view to their right. "I looked at it through binoculars,"Hamilton remembers, "and it seemed to be on or near the Groom Roadand casting a beam [of light] on the ground." As it drew nearer, accordingto Hamilton, "the light appeared to be an object the size of a buswith square light panels lifting off from the ground. The panels appearedto glow amber and blue-white." A bus does travel the dirt road leading into Groom Lake, transportingcivilian workers who gather every morning at nearby Alamo for the 30- to40-mile ride, returning in the afternoon. But this bus was clearly outof the ordinary, says Hamilton. As he watched, "the lights rapidlyresolved into two glowing orbs or discs of brilliant blue-white light,so bright they hurt my eyes." The two baby suns rapidly approachedthe parked car and confusion reigned. When Hamilton looked at his watch,approximately 30 minutes of time were missing. Hypnotically regressed later,both Hamilton and his companion had memories of being abducted aboard aUFO by now-traditional little gray beings with large dark eyes, the leaderof whom in this case referred to himself as Quaylar. Campbell was at the Little A-Le-Inn when the couple returned. "Ican attest they were both visibly shaken," he says, "but neitherhad any memory of an abduction at that time. I don't know what to think.I've spent many a night in Tikaboo Valley, where the sighting occurred,and as far as I know nothing like that has ever happened to me. I've neverseen or experienced anything that I couldn't explain." It may be that the remote desert interface between alleged extraterrestrialtechnology and known or suspected terrestrial technology predisposes orinflames the human imagination to see flying buses where only earthly onesexist. Light can play tricks in the thin air, making determination of distanceand brilliance doubly difficult at best. Or it could be that the latestgeneration of Stealth and other secret platforms being test flown out ofGroom Lake demonstrate such odd performance characteristics that they areeasily misidentified at night as one of Lazar's reputed H=PACs-Human-PilotedAlien Craft. Rumors have long circulated of a hypersonic high-altitudespyplane, code named Aurora, designed to replace the recently retired SR-71Blackbird. Both the Air Force and Aurora's alleged manufacturer, Northrop'ssecret Skunk Works facility at Palmdale, California, deny any knowledgeof such a platform. Another potential candidate is the TR-33A Black Mantra,an electronic warfare platform widely rumored to have flown support forthe F-117 Stealth fighter during Operation Desert Storm. Other advancedairforms could be in research and development, too, their operating expendituresburied in the Pentagon's estimated $14.3 billion per year black-budgetprograms. Even with the Cold War apparently successfully concluded-and the strategicnecessity of much of our black budget presumably obviated-the Air Forcecan't be happy campers at Groom Lake. They certainly don't relish the prospectof a growing number of UFOlogists and media types, increasingly armed withsophisticated video cameras and night-vision equipment, all on the prowlfor H-PACs or UFOs, stumbling across a plane which they've gone to a greatdeal of trouble to keep secret from both Russian and American citizens,presumably in our own best interests. But previous attempts to seal off Groom Lake from public scrutiny havemet with just partial success. In 1984, the Air Force seized (or withdrew,in their vernacular) some 89,000 acres on the northeast quadrant of theNellis Test Range in order to provide a better buffer zone for the base.Due to a surveying error, White Sides and a few other vantage points wereoverlooked. But then, in the wake of the Lazar story, Campbell and otherUFOlogists began making the trek up White Sides, triggering security perimeteralarms and forcing the cammo dudes out of their white vehicles. Subsequently, on October 18, 1993, the Air Force filed a request forFederal Register seeking the withdrawal of an additional 3,7982 acres,presently public property under the control of the Bureau of Land Management.Not surprisingly, White Sides is contained within the new acreage, as isanother lookout point discovered by Campbell and dubbed Freedom Ridge.The additional land was needed, the Air Force claimed, "to ensurethe public safety and the safe and secure operation of activities in theNellis Air Force Range complex." No mention by name was made of GroomLake, the air base that doesn't officially exist. By now, Campbell had become a professional prickly=pear int he Air Force'sexposed side. He formed the White Sides Defense Committee and publicizedthe public hearing the Bureau of Land Management was required by law tohold. The Air Force request is currently on hold, awaiting an environmentalassessment and final approval. In the meantime, Campbell formed SecrecyOVersight Council to market his Viewers Guide and an assortment of Area51 souvenirs, including topographical maps, bumper stickers, and a colorful,self-designed Groom Lake sew-on patch. More recently, he took out an addresson the electronic highway and began publishing a series of regular digitalupdates, "The Desert Rat," including a map detailing the locationof known magnetic sensors. And he tweaked a few local noses with a defiantfashion statement, updating his own apparel to match the desert camouflagesuite of the cammo dudes, shade for shade. Such pranks aside, Campbell insists he's a serious civilian spy. "Thedifference between me and the Air Force is that I don't have any secrets,"he says, "and everything I do is legal." On at least two occasionsCampbell and visiting journalists were buzzed by low-flying helicopterscalled in from Groom Lake, both times while clearly on public propertyoutside the restricted zone. "The rotor wash throws up a tremendousamount of dust and debris," he notes, "endangering us and thehelicopter crew, too." Indeed, the Secrecy Oversight Council trackeddown the appropriate Air Force regulation and found that pilots are restrictedto a minimum of 500 feet altitude except when taking off or landing. But if the Air Force is peeved or perplexed by Campbell's activities,they aren't saying so in public. "We know who Mr Campbell is,"admits Major George Sillia, public affairs officer at Nellis AFB, Las Vegas."He keeps us informed as to what he's up to. Beyond that, what canI say? He's an American citizen, and they have a right to certain activitieson public property." The Air Force is more mum about the existenceof Groom Lake itself. "We can neither confirm nor deny the existenceof a facility at Groom Lake," Sillia adds, "and if we can't confirmits existence, we certainly can't say anything about it." A more vocal Campbell critic is Jim Bilbray, a Democratic congressmanfrom Las Vegas who sits on both the House Armed Services Committee andthe Select House Committee on Intelligence. Without mentioning Campbellby name, Bilbray says that "these people are persistent, and if they'retaking pictures, they're breaking the law. But that really isn't the problem;there's even a Soviet satellite photo of Groom Lake in circulation. Theproblem comes when you have to shut down operations and secure the technology,which is time-consuming and costly, and which they have to do every timesomeone is up on the mountain. And believe me, they make sure they knowwhen you're up there." Bilbray also doesn't subscribe to the argument that now that the ColdWar is apparently over there is a concurrent corollary that reduces theneed for secrecy in general and secret high-tech technology in particular."The Nellis Range is one of the few secure areas in the country whereyou can test these new technologies," he says. "And most peoplein the intelligence community will tell you that the world is a more, notless, dangerous place, now that the old system of checks and balances betweenthe two superpowers has seriously broken down." Still, Bilbray admits that he, the Air Force, and other government agenciesare caught in a classic Catch-22 situation vis-a-vis UFOlogists. "Ican't name them," he says, "but I can tell you that I've beenon virtually every facility in the Nellis Range and that there are no capturedflying saucers or extraterrestrial bodies out there. I've heard all therumors. But the minute I say I've been to one valley, the UFOlogists aregoing to ask, what about the next valley over, or claim that everythinghas been moved. Well, what about the next valley over? We used to testatomic bombs above ground here and some of the valleys are still so hotthat a Geiger counter will start spitting the moment you turn it on. Doesn'tsound like a very good place to test flying saucers or hide alien bodiesto me." But researchers like Campbell say they're in a Catch-22 as well, becausethey know the Air Force routinely denies things that do exist, beginningwith the big secret base on the edge of Groom Lake. If it didn't exist,why would they need more space to keep you from seeing it? And if GroomLake exists, then why not Aurora, the Black Mantra, and possibly even aUFO or two? Nature abhors a vacuum, and where a lack of openness and penchant forsecrecy persists, rumor and rumors of rumors are sure to flourish, evenin the middle of the desert. "You just keep shaking the secrecy tree,"and unperturbed and determined Campbell advises, "and, hopefully,something drops out." That may prove increasingly difficult to do, at least from White Sidesor Freedom Ridge. Bilbray, who supports the latest withdrawal of land aroundGroom Lake, advises that Congress, while it has the opportunity to objectand call for a review, does not have to give approval, and the Bureau ofLand Management will most assuredly approve the Air Force's request, "probablywithin this year." *END* ___________________________________________________________________________ Watch for future editions of the UMF MAG...

In July,and FDA SWAT team invaded teh New York offices of a publishing companyto seize information concerning the use of an unapproved material as acancer treatment. Materials seized from Writers and Research, Inc. of Rochester, NY, includedbooks and booklets on a controversial camphor-based treatment for cancercalled 714X, developed by Gaston Naessens. Also seized was computer equipment,a seizure justified by an agent because it was "used to print informationon a substance that is banned in the US". The drug itself was notthe target of the raid-only information about it, as well as files of peoplewho had expressed interest in it. Writers and Research had contacted the FDA in the process of obtainingapproval to import 714X into the United States. Towards this end, the companyhad constituted an Institutional Review Board to examine the claims madefor 714X, a step necessary to gaining FDA approval. This had been donetwo months prior to the FDA raid. The FDA had not disqualified this board,but had prohibited any reference to its findings before approval. In Short, the FDA raided a company prior to that company achieving itsstated desire of gaining approval for an alternative medicine. They didnot raid to seize medicine. They raided to stop dissemination of informationabout that medicine. (Source: After Hours, July-Sept 1994, Box 5636, Colorado Springs, CO80931, USA) ************************************** BIG BROTHER & CLINTON'S HEALTH SECURITY ACT Clinton's health care plan ensures that everyone has access to medicalcare- and ravages the Bill of Rights in the process. If one reads the 1342page Health Security Act, as Jarret Wollstein did, one wonders what Machiavellianmind devised it. Jarret WOllstein, Director of the International Societyfor Individual Liberty and co-author of Lethal Compassion: WHy NationalHealth Care is the Cure that Kills, explained in an interview publishedby The Financial Privacy Report (May 1994) how Clinton's health care billaffects freedom of choice and medical privacy. FIrst, Clinton's plan states that everyone "must enroll" ina government-run health alliance and "must pay any premium required".The health premium is actually a payroll tax of 7.6% of the pay cheque,which is about equal to the amount removed from employees' cheques forSocial Security. Imagine trying to survive on a minimum wage with another7.6% taken out. Where is the incentive to work if the pay cheque at theend of the month can't begin to pay for food and housing? The amount ofthis "premium" is set by the local health alliance and a politicallyappointed National Health Board at their discretion. No ceiling amoundhas been set. Self-employed people who refuse to pay or can't afford topay are fined three times the amount of premium, or US$5,000, whicheveris higher. If they don't pay, the government has the right to seize theirassets. In other words, we hav eno choice but to pay for this plan, whetherwe want it or not. We don't even get to vote on it. But all of us will get the health care we want or need under this plan,right? Wrong. As Wollstein points out, approximately 37 million more peoplewill have access to clinics and doctors. To regulate the increased flow,government "gatekeepers" no patients, not doctors-willdecidewho gets in to see a doctor or into a hospital. Anyone who tries to bypassthe health plan and use his or her own money to pay for covered medicalservices faces 15 years imprisonment and fines up to US$50,000-that is,if you can find a doctor willing to risk the same penalties. Under the Health Security Act, the Department of Justice also has theright to confiscate anything you own if you are accused, not necessarilyconvicted, of threatening the health of anyone or having a "significantdetrimental impact on the health care system". Curiously, no monieshave been budgeted to fund this new policing bureau. In its own self-interest,the bureau will have to be zealous in its confiscation of property. Finally, Clinton's Health Security Bill forbids doctors from withholdinginformation about their patients from the government; medical privacy willno longer be honored. Doctors can be fined up to US$10,000 per violation,without trial. This information, according to the health act, can be usedfor any "lawful purpose", and the National Health Board is authorizedto get other information about individuals from any other government agency,including the ISR. Why does a health board need such powers? The abridgement of freedom and righst in this Health Security Act istoo high a price to pay for universal health care. Congress apparentlyagrees. Senate Bill 1227 exempts members of Congress and all federal employeesfrom any national health care plan. If they don't want it, why should we?

Not many people realise that the technology exists to track a person'swhereabouts from their mobile phone handset via certain types of satellites. The next step in our technological 'evolution' from the consumer's pointof view is that virtually everyone will have their own personal mobilephone, with their own personal mobile phone ID number. Each of these mobilephone handsets emits a virtually continous signal which is picked up bysatellite or ground tower and relayed on. It is rumoured that most handsetsemit this signal even when the power is turned off. It is any Big Brother'sdream come true in terms of knowing where everyone is at any time. It was announced in UK newspapers recently that by 1988, mobile phoneswill go global. Your handset will give you access to a satellite basedsystem that will allow calls to be made pracctically anywhere on Earth. "Iridium, a consortium of 17 major companies led by Motorola, proposesto launch 66 satellites in orbits corssing both poles, ensuring a satellitewill fly over every spot on Earth at least once every nine minutes. Anyany one time at least three satellites will be in view, enabling the handset'sprecise position to be located."

Canada's government-appointed intelligence watchdog group is investigatingallegations that the Canadian Secret Intelligence Service (CSIS), the counterpartof Britain's MI5, founded and steered Canada's main neo-Nazi organization,Heritage Front. These allegations are also made in a book, titled The Ugly Truth aboutthe ADL, which uncovers most neo-Nazi provocateurs as a completely controlledinternational product of British intelligence operations in North Americaand elsewhere, with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) playing a specialstarring role. According to the Toronto Sun, one Grant Bristow organised the HeritageFront whiilst in receipt of $50,000 per year from the CSIS, and then "threwhimself into running a small unit of the front that specialised in dirty-trickscampaigns against anti-racists" by infiltrating such groups and settingthem up against each other. The tactics of creating an imaginary enemy to justify funding are notrare. Take the recent case of US mayoral hopeful, Donald Mintz. He producedand distrubited disgusting anti-Jewish leaflets and then appealed to theJewish community for campaign funds to fight the racists. In this casea local reporter caught him in the act and dashed all hopes of being elected.

But no matterwhere they are or what they are called, they all have an agenda to restrictpublic access to "unauthorised" health care treatments. The British medical bureaucracy, like its counterpart in Australia andthe US has decided that the increasing number of success stories emergingfrom the use of oxygen therapies has to stop. In June of last year the Ministry of Health 'visited' the offices ofEcho UK, a non-profit oxygen therapies information centre involved onlyin the dissemination of public domain literature. They had a warrant signedby no less than the Minister of Health, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, givingthem authority to inspect all files and literature. Echo UK was informed(incorrectly) that they were breaking the law by distributing some of theinformation in their possession. Pressure from the MCA and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of GreatBritain was also applied to Echo UK, all in an attempt to stop them fromdistributing already publicly available information. I suppose, though, the British should consider themselves lucky. I mean,they only get polite gentlemen bearing a warrant to inspect files and literature,while in the USA they send in an armed SWAT team with fully-loaded automaticweapons and wearing flak jackets, who kick the door down, steal everythingand then trash the place while holding staff and patients at gunpoint againstthe wall.

When presidents Mikhail Gorbachev and George Bush signed an agreementin 1991 to take all Soviet and US nuclear bombers off alert and put thewarheads into storage, it was celebrated as a breakthrough. But according to an item in the London Sunday Times, the two presidentswere merely formalising a secret 'arrangement' that had existed for decades. The truth emerged when the deputy head of Russia's Strategic Air Force,Major General Anatoli Solovyov, revealed that for safety reasons, "wenever flew within nuclear weapons, inly with imitations". Similarly, the US Strategic Bomber Fleet was largely grounded aftera couple of accidents in the 1960s. (Four nuclear weapons fell from a B-52bomber off Palomares, Spain, in 1966; and in 1968, a B-52 crashed nearthe Thule Air Force Base in Greenland with four nuclear bombs on board.)After 1967, all the bombers in the US Strategic Fleet were grounded untilthe end of the Cold War.

Australians are beginning to wake up to the fact that the Federal Governmenthas been very busy making Australia a co-signatory to literally thousandsof international treaties. United Nations treates, with irresistible namessuch as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),are usually signed without as much as a whisper to the public for debate. When Governor-General Bill Hayden signed the abovementioned ICCPR on25th December 1991, he hadn't counted on the public uproar that would ensue.Tens of thousands of people phoned and wrote to politicians complainingthat the bill was a defacto Bill of Rights being imposed upon all Australiansby an unelected faceless UN committee in another country. The following December, the Governor General was asked to ratify a treaty(ILO158) only hours before the dissolution of Parliament. No media releasewas issued. There was no public debate. The latest example of the effects of UN treateis upon Australian citizens'rights is of course the homosexual rights issue in Tasmania. Here we havean island state in a democracy where many of the people seem to want thelaw to stay the way it is. However, it says in one of the several thousandtreaties we have signed that this law is not acceptable. It is a pity thatthe Federal Government did not tell the people of Tasmania this when theysigned the treaty in the first place-or was that the general idea? The following extract is worth reading in light of the above: 'The remarkablegrowth of international laws had led countries including Australia to surrenderparts of their sovereignty to the world community, the former Governor-Generalof Australia, Sir Ninian Stephen, said last night. Sir Ninian, chairman of the foundation examining Australia's Constitution,said that international justice and peace would only come by adherenceto such laws, of which there are now over 50,000. His views, expressed at the opening of the International Bar Associationconverence in Melbourne, echoed those of former Prime Minister, Mr GougWhitlam. Mr Whitlam said recently that it was crucial for Canberra to introduceworld standards such as United Nations and International Labour Organisationand not be deterred by State's rights. The 50,000 new international instuments, treaties and conventions formedover the past few decades are administered by more than 2,000 new internationalagencies and instrmentalities, said Sir Ninian. "The result has been in every country a plethora of new laws appearingon the statute book, giving local effect ot newly assumed internationalobligations," he said. Countries have voluntarily surrendered parts of their sovereignty inthe cause of interdependence and cooperation. "It will surely only be by the extension of international law throughoutthe nations and its universal observance that they (countries) will cometo live together at peace and in justice as one world communitiy."

Written By The P/\NTHER -UMF/TRSi- This country is just one step away from total disarmament and a One-Worldpolice-controlled Economic Government! The Civil War, WW I, WW II, the Korean Conflict, VietNam, Desert Storm,the Randy Weaver incident, the Waco situation, Somalia, Bosnia, etc. werepurposely imposed on the peoples of the world to condition them to be controlledby a few self-appointed rulers. In 1913, the U.S. Congress relinquished its responsibility regardingour money system by allowing the "private" Federal Reserve Systemto be established and controlled by the Illuminati (the hidden governmentconsisting of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commissionand the Bilderbergers, which are headed up by the Rockefellers in the UnitedStates and by the Rothschilds of Europe) and its "stockholders."(Trilateralism is international economic regionalism dealing with INTERdependence,and not a final goal. It is a precursor to the one-world government beingplanned for humanity by the international cartelists vain enough to thinkthey are destined to rule over a slave humanity, despite the wishes andrights of mankind.) Also, in 1913, the Congress allowed the Internal Revenue Service (Title26) to operate under the "color of law." Title 26 has never beenenacted into law by Congress. In 1921, the CFR saw its birth, to be joined soon thereafter by theTC - both Rockefeller institutions and headquartered in New York as isthe United Nations. In 1945, the United States, through constant promoting from the U.S.State Department, signed the United Nations Charter, overriding our U.S.Constitution and Bill of Rights. In 1961, the former President Nixon signed Executive Order 11647 (precursortowards acceptance of NAFTA a Treaty). This E.O. divided the U.S. intoten federal regions to be run by "Federal Regional Councils"(over 18 states have since rejected Regionalism, but who is listening?).(School children are being groomed to accept Regional Government - lookat the back of the small KIX Cereal box at your local grocery stores.) The lines drawn for these federal regions cross State lines, thus obliteratingthe sovereignty of the States. Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitutiondeclares: "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Uniona republican form of government..." A republican form of government is defined in Webster's New CollegiateDictionary as one in which "the sovereign power resides in a certainbody of the people--the electorate--and is exercised by representativeselected by, and responsible to, them." Under the Federal Regional Councils proclaimed by President Nixon, governmentin the ten federal regions would be administered by federal-appointed bureaucratsaccountable only to Washington, D.C. Nixon's actions are a clear violationof the U.S. Constitution, Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1, which stipulates: "New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; butno new STate shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of anyother State, nor any State be formed by the junction of two or more States,or parts of States, without the consent of the Legislatures of the Statesconcerned as well as of the Congress." Nixon did not obtain the consent of all the State Legislatures concerned,nor of Congress. At the time of signing E.O. 11647, Nixon included theLaw Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA). The LEAA is becomingincreasingly involved in dishing out taxpayers' dollars to finance programsof merger, consolidation and regionalization of local police forces. (Whena national police force becomes a recognized, accepted, operating reality,it will no longer be ineffective and permissive; it will be ruthlesslyefficient and repressive.) Establishment of LEAA is a crucial first step to a national police force.President Clinton recently announced he is making $22 billion availableto upgrade all states' police forces (with a few more prisons thrown infor good measure); there are strings attached to it - any time the federalgovernment has an input, it controls. The "hidden" government (CFR/TC/Bilderbergers, etc) to whichnearly all State Department officials belong, as well as many other appointedand elected positions of our government (to include Congressmen and Senators),is using the Communist technique of discrediting the local police in theeyes of the people. A national police force with unlimited powers is oneof the most important characteristics of a totalitarian dictatorship. Theplot against local control of the police has been in the making for sometime. A national police force would take from the States the responsibilityof enforcing laws that should remain in their jurisdiction. Law-abidingcitizens and local officials should vigorously oppose concerted attacksagainst local law enforcement and the devious moves to negate local authorityand replace it with federal police power. There are many SUPPORT YOUR LOCALPOLICE COMMITTEES operating throughout the country. With the passing ofthe Brady Gun Bill, another step towards total disarmament and eliminationof the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.If the American people permit a national police force to be established,no citizen will be permitted to have a gun in his possession to defendhimself and his family against this planned tyranny. The Brady Gun Billbecomes "law" 90 days after its signing - so come March 1994,or even before, more stringent gun control bills will either be signedinto law or on the drawing board. Those communities know to encourage atleast one gun ownership per household have far less crime. Statistics provegun control increases crime - criminals become more arrogant, they knowour present justice system is "soft" on them; it is the law-abidingcitizen who is prosecuted/persecuted. In between all the above actions to dissolve America, the presidentshave instituted Executive Orders which give one man, the president, totalcontrol over all our lives in these United States of America! In 1984, former President Reagan conditionally agreed to Total Disarmamentof the United States of America which would automatically include TotalGun Confiscation - private citizens especially ! In 1989, 400 Congressmen signed into law P.L. 101-216, which reinforcesP.L. 87-297 and State Department Document #7277. (Approximately 33 CaliforniaCongressmen signed this P.L. - those still holding public office include:Paneta, Boxer, Dellums, Beilenson, Berman, Dornan, Dreier, Thomas, Fazio,Lantos, Lehman, Matsui, McCandless, Mineta, Moorhead, Packard, Pelosi,J. Lewis, Stark, Rohrabacher, Torres, Waxman and others - and former Cong.Dannemeyer who hopes to unseat Senator Feinstein in 1994.) In 1994 the Crime Control Act was passed (which will further removemany of our freedoms and inalienable rights under the U.S. Constitutionand Bill of Rights), the National Health Care Act (Socialized Medicine,which will impose additional restrictions on the people), Goals 200 (totalcontrol of our children, through Federal Government schools), etc. Allof these "programs" will impose additional taxes on the generalpublic. The National Education Association (NEA) is listed as a participatingorganization in the National Coalition to Ban Handguns. The NEA's chiefcommitment is to promote a planned society which will train children todisregard the traditional values of their parents, preparing them to adjustto, and support, growing collectivism. The NEA is a tax-exempt organization-- meaning that you help pay for its programs, to include your own disarmament. Emerging throughout our nation is the Fully Informed Jury ASsociationwhose doctrine is to insure "fully informed jurists" in our courtrooms 0 many judges prohibit proper indoctrination of juries. Every step the U.S. takes toward political and economic entanglementswith the rest of the world is a step toward realization of the end objectof the CFR, the TC, the Bilderbergers, etc., which is to create a one-worldsocialist, political and economic system in which we (the U.S.) will beone of the subjugated provinces. So, now we have the illegally passed NAFTA;read Article II, Sec. 2, Para. 2 of the U.S. Constitution. World government would seriously impair if not totally destroy the nationalsovereignty of the United States of America. Loss of a national sovereigntymeans not only the loss of the power to control the destiny of a nation,it also means the loss of the rights of the individual citizens in thatnation. One of the direct links between the CFR and the "big business"community is the Committee for Economic Development (CED). The CFR is gearedto control our foreign policy (which it has been doing since its inceptionin 1921, regardless of what party represents the White House); the CEDconcerns itself with domestic policy of this country. It is the #1 priorityof the CFR and CED to nullify the power of the individual States, leavingthem at the mercy of the all-powerful federal government, a governmentcontrolled by men belonging to the CFR and the CED (as well as the TrilateralCommission and the Bilderberger Group). The Rockefellers have been working for five decades to control the Americangovernment so they can dominate our economy... The Rockefeller game plan is to consolidate control over the world'seconomies by merging all the nations of the world under a single Rockefeller/Rothschild-controlledtent. Such a government would have to be a dictatorship, ruled by Rockefellerand Rothschild puppets or by the Communist-Third World bloc. It was Rockefellermoney (9$ million) that paid for the ground on which the United Nationsstands. It is Rockefeller money and the money of the many (over 1600) tax-exemptFoundations (to include Ford and Carnegie) that bankroll this nation'sdash into One-Worldly/Feudalism. It looks like it could be too late to fight such an awesome networkof power. But then again Information is the weapon THEY are afraid of. "Keep your eyes & ears open & your mouth shut & you'lllearn something." -------------------------------------------------------------------------- - 3 - MOONGATE : Chapter 10 Evidence of Extraterrestrial interference in the space program. The UFO subject has been abused by many writers who produce books aboutUFOs with seemingly little thought or hard analysis. Hopefully, informationcontained in the remainder of this book will help explain certain aspectsof the UFO enigma in a more logical manner. This requires a better understandingof how the universe functions and man's position in it. Every phenomenonmust have a rational basis, regardless of how bizarre it may seem to be.In every case, the law of cause and effect must hold. If NASA fabricatedinformation, it will show up as a fabrication when it contradicts othervalid occurrences. The sum total of all phenomena must boil down to thereal picture of what happened. Logic dictates that if UFOs occupied by intelligent beings are closeby, they must have a purpose in being here. If these beings are around,actions taken by Earth people will probably be closely monitored by them.The human beings who live on the outer surface of the Earth have an extremelybad reputation for being killers. Historians can rationalize the wars basedon this or that reason; however, from the standponit of advanced civilizationswhich are not part of the outer Earth world, the Earth's history wouldbe appalling. How could UFO occupants trust Earth nations to be benevolentwhen these nations have such war-filled histories and are developing weaponswhich are more and more powerful? A great deal of information exists about Earth people who claim to havebeen contacted by "space" people. Many of these contactees haveallegedly been told that the Earth is being carefully monitored. The primaryreason given for the monitoring is so that they will be able to quicklycurtail a nuclear war should it begin. If this is true, then missiles andspacecraft would be closely observed to ensure that they carried no nuclearwarheads and did no damage to the EArth or Moon. Therefore, if UFO encountersor sightings were made byt he astronauts, it should come as no surprise.This would be especially true during the Apollo missions if these peopleare stationed on the Moon. The present discussion will focus on the evidenceof extraterrestrials inadvertently supplied by NASA and other lunar observers.Contactee encounters will be discussed in the next chapter. Centuries ago, lunar observers noted transient phenomena which couldnot be easily attributed to natural causes. For example, small dome-likeupswellings have appeared and disappeared on the Moon. In 1788, the astronomerSchroeter attributed these domes to the industrial activities of the Selenite(Moon) people. (1) Naturally, he was not taken seriously. However, over200 of these white, circular domes have been observed and catalogued incurrent times. (2) These hemispheres have varied in diameter between aneighth and a quarter of a mile, with an average of one-quarter; and between20 and 30 of them of similar size were seen clustered on the floor of TychoCrater. (3) These particular domes can not be attributed solely to roundedhills or volcanic upswellings. Their unpredictable appearance and disappearanceindicates that they are intelligently created and movable structures. Schroeter saw a shadow in the lunar Alps in 1788. (4) At first he sawa light, but after the region had been illuminated, a round shadow appearedwhere the light had been. Since the shadow was round, the object whichproduced it was detached and above the lunar surface. After 15 minutes,is supposedly disappeared. It is possible that Schroeter saw a large aerialobject which provided the illumination to create its own shadow. Many bright,round spots have also been sighted inside craters such as Plato and theSea of Crisis. They frequently appear dome-like and change their brightnessfrom night to night. (5) George Leonard supplied photographic evidence that the Moon is beingworked with massive machines in his book, Somebody Else Is on the Moon.He suggested that damage done to the Moon's surface at one time is slowlybeing repaired. He claims to have photographic evidence which shows cratersbeing worked on and perhaps mined. It is now known that the Moon is richin valuable elements which could be used for many purposes. The evidence of extraterrestrial monitoring of the space program apparentlybegan with the Mercury missions and continued through Apollo 17. DuringCooper's fourth orbit over Hawaii in 1963, he heard a weird voice transmissionin an unintelligible language. The tapes were later analyzed and it wasdetermined that the sounds were not those of any known foreign languageon the Earth. (6) On the final orbit near Australia, he sighted a UFO fromthe space capsule. (7) It was also allegedly seen by over 200 people atthe tracking station. (8) Supposedly one or more UFOs were seen on each of the 12 Gemini missions.After the 1966 Gemini 9 mission was scrubbed due to interference with theradio hookup, NASA released a statement on television that UFOs or unknownshad been seen by astronauts on several occasions. (9) White and McDivitt saw and photographed an eggshaped, glowing, silveryobject which moved above and below them. Five frames with a movie camerawere taken as it flew by, and the film shows an egg-shaped object witha fan-like glow and a long tail of light. The Mission Control report statedthat Command Pilot Jim McDivitt reported seeing another object in spacewhich appeared to have big arms sticking out. The report also indicatedthat he took some motion pictures of the object, but had difficulty becauseof the Sun. (10) It is significant that Gemini 7 encountered a UFO and many little particlestraveling by the space capsule. The silvery UFO was not the rocket boosterbecause it was seen in addition to the UFO. (11) NASA commonly attributedthe particles observed in other missions to urine droplets or paint fragmentspeeling off the spacecraft. John Glen was the first astronaut to discover the "fireflies"which were observed quite frequently throughout the space program. Afterhe had moved out of the night side of his first orbit, he glanced backthrough the window and thought that the spacecraft had tumbled becausehe saw "stars." Glenn soon realized that the spacecraft had nottumbled and that he was surrounded by yellowish-green, luminous particleswhich looked like "fireflies." They appeared to vary in sizebetween a pinhead and three-eights of an inch and were eight to ten feetapart, evely distributed through the space around the capsule. Each timethe Sun came up, he observed these particles for about four minutes. Glennstated the following about them: "During the third sunrise I turned the spacecraft around and facedforward to see if I could determine where the particles were coming from.Facing forwards I could see only about ten percent as many particles asI had when my back was to the sun. Still, they seemed to be coming towardme from some distance so that they appeared not to be coming from the spacecraft.Just what these particles are is stil subject to debate and awaits furtherclarification." (12) In spite of Glenn's clear statement that these particles did not comefrom the spacecraft, orthodox authorities atributed them to flakes of materialcoming off the capsule. Although more UFO sightings could be reference involving the Geminimissions, the most valuable information came from the Apollo flights. Ingoing around the Moon, Apollo 8 astronauts supposedly sighted a "disc-shaped"object, experienced a "blinding light", and herd "intolerablyhigh-frequency noises" from their radio. (13) Later, they sightedthe object again with more of the brilliant light and experienced "awave of internal heat within the space capsule." (14) The spacecraftsupposedly began to "pitch and yaw" before control was regained.(15) It is also significant that when the astronauts came around theeasternedge of the Moon, all the water in a radiator in the spacecraft's coolingsystem had evaporated and had to be replenished! (16) According to official accounts, Apollo 10 had a close call when Cernanand Stafford descended to within 50,000 feet of the lunar surface to inspectthe APollo 11 landing site. It seems that after the descent stage was jettisoned,the upper stage went into a wild spin, pitching up and down. Somethingcaused the gyro-guidance system to go out of control, and to steady theship, Stafford took over the hand controls. Supposedly, a control switchhad beee left in the wrong position by technicians and was not spottedby Stafford. However, official accounts do not mention that a UFO rosevertically from below and that it was photographed. (17) The first Apollo 11 UFO encounter occurred one day into the flight.The astronauts sighted an unknown which appeared between them and the Moonwhich might have been the booster rocket. In the debriefing, Aldrin statedthat they recalled having trouble with the high gain at about the sametime as the sighting. Coolins mentioned that they felt a bump and Armstrongindicated that Collins thought the MESA (Modularized Equipment StowageAssembly) had come off. Aldrin then recalled seeing all sorts of littleobjects going by prior to seeing the brighter object which had an L-shapeto it. Armstrong compared it to two connected rings, but Aldrin disagreedand described it as a hollow cylinder. Collins re-entered the conversationand asserted that it looked like a hollow cylinder which was tumbling,but would change to an open-book shape. (18) There are some significant items of information in the above conversation.First of all, Aldrin stated that they wer having a problem with the highgain about the time of the sighting. Collins mentioned that they felt abump, but then decided against this idea after Armstrong commented on theMESA package. As the dialogue progresed, the astronauts began talking aboutthe shape of the object. It seems that these three, trained observers couldnot or would not agree on what they saw. Each man seemed to have a pictureof what it was, yet after Collins explicitly described it as a cylinder,Aldrin stated that it was not a cylinder. Armstrong said that it lookedlike two connected rings. When Apollo 11 was near the Moon, weird radio noises were heard whichsounded like fire engines, sirens, buxx-saws, and train whistles. MissionControl supposedly asked if someone else was up there with them. Thesesignals or noises came from outside the spacecraft and also allegedly persistedintermittently throughout the first few days of the flight. (19) According to one undisclosed source, after Armstrong and Aldrin landedon the Moon, immense UFOs lined up on the far side of the crater and monitoredthe astronauts. (20) Another reference to this event appeared in the NationalEnquirer, September 11, 1979. (21) In the story, a formber consultant toNASA claims that the event occurred but was covered up. According to thearticle, the encounter was common knowledge in NASA. The reader is reminded that some of this information is limited andperhaps questionable concerning the subject matter of NASA UFO sightings.If the accounts were evaluated solely on their own, the case would notbe totally proven by any means. However, in conjunction with all of theevidence which remains, and all that has been presented prior to this,the incidents are more believable. Apollo 12 nearly experienced a complete electrical shutdown shortlyafter take-off. The ship appeared to be hit by bolts of lighting 36 1/2and 52 seconds after launch; but since there was no thunderstorm in teharea, the event had to be explained from another standpoint. Some peoplespeculated that the rocket created an electrical conductor to ground fromthe ionized exhaust and that lighting discharged through the ship. However,one source claims that observatories in Europe reported two unknown objectsin the craft's vicinity as it headed toward the Moon. (22) One object appearedto be following Apollo 12 and the other was ahead of it. Both were blinkingon and off rapidly. The following day the astronauts reported two UFOsor bogeys about 132,000 miles out, and during their conversations withMission Control, one of the objects flew off at high speed. (23) As allegedlyreceived by Ground Control which did not come from the space capsule butfrom elsewhere. The noise was also supposedly heard by the atronauts andwas described as static, whistles, and a constant beeping sound. (24) The subject of fireflies has been mentioned several times. When theApollo 16 astronauts were coasting towards the Moon, they entered a regionof space swarming with these particles. However, NASA insists that theywere flakes of paint which was applied to keep the craft from overheatingin the Sun. But again, accompanying this occurrence, Mattingly reportedthat problems had arisen with the guidance and navigation systems. Therewas no attitude indication and the gimbal platform had locked. A manualrealighment became necessary and the "snowflakes" traveling withthe ship interfered with the star sightings. Typically, no one determinedwhat happened; they merely suggested that another "electronic glitch"had occurrec. Somehow, electrical transients were created in the electricalcircuitry which created temporary malfunctions which later disappeared.Before the Apollo 16 descent, another bad circuit in the steering systemcontrolling the main rocket engine occurred. This caused the engine bellto oscillate sideways. (25) It appears that electronic glitches, UFO sightings, and luminous particlesmay be related phenomena. An examination of this relationship providesa great deal of information about what may have really happened to theastronauts. John Glenn saw luminous particles for about four minutes duringevery orbit when coming into the Sun. He clearly stated that they cametoward the capsule from a distance. Glenn may have been observing the disintegrationof certain particles which are emited continuously by the Sun. Accumulatedevidence indicates that they fill the space between planets and galazies,and that their constituent particles probably consist of photons of light.When these particles disintegrate, photons are released. The nature ofthese particles may be intimately connected with the energies used to propelthe UFOs which were allegedly seen by some of the astronauts. When UFOscame in close proximity to the NASA spacecraft, the concentration of these"firefly" particles may have increased tremendously. The particlesseem to carry and electrical charge and penetrate readily through the materialof a spacecraft. If they disintegrate when interacting with matter andother particles in space, the astronauts would see them inside and outsidetheir ships. The effect of these particles on the spacecraft would be tocause overloading of electrical systems and electronic noise in the radiocommunication circuits. Since they may be emitted in high concentrationsby UFOs, objects in the vicinity would be bathed in them sufficiently tocause the overloads and short-circuiting. For example, Apollo 10's guidancesystem could have been short-circuited by these particles from an approachingUFO. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- - 4 - The McAlvany Intelligence Advisor (A Case Study In Police State Tactics In America) On Monday, April 18, 1993 the U.S. government, in an act of mass murderunrivaled in U.S. history (intended to send a warning to gun owners andso-called "religious nuts" across the country), burned 86 people,including 24 children to death in the Branch Davidian compound in Waco,Texas - climaxing a 51 day seige launched by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,and Firearms, (BATF) on February 28, 1993. As editorialist Charley Reeserecently wrote: "When you start with an "allegation" thata gun control law has been violated, and you end up with nearly 100 people,including 25 children, killed, and millions of taxpayers dollars down thedrain, that's bad law enforcement no matter how you slice it." Koresh and his followers held no hostages, had committed no violentcrimes, were not threatening to kill or harm anyone. They were mindingtheir own business on their own property. Everyone in the compound wasthere of their own free will. Texas social workers had been in the compoundand found no indication that any outsider who visited the compound wouldbe in any danger. One of the children living in the compound told her father,according to him, that "it was a joy to live there." A massive coverup by the Clintonistas, the FBI, the BATF, and the Establishment-controlledmedia has pacified the great majority of the American public in spite ofthe worst massacre of men, women and children by our government in U.S.history. President Clinton and the Establishment's message in the aftermathwas clear: Let this be a warning to religious misfits, dissidents, gunregulations violators, Constitutionalists., and traditionalists: Get inour way, oppose us, or thumb your nose at us and we will destroy you -by fire if necessary. What a horror to watch men, women and children burned to death for noother crime than resisting the omnipotent state. It is a chilling exampleof the police state that is emerging in American with ominous parallelsto Nazi Germany, which "coincidentally" massacred hundreds ofJews in the Warsaw ghetto exactly 50 years earlier on April 19, 1943. Guncontrol, people control, persecution of religious minorities, and incredibleruthlessness and wickedness were all part of the Third Reich in Germanyand are part of the Fourth Reich emerging in America today. The Branch Davidians were not the first (nor will they be the last)group the BATF has attacked for "alleged" gun control violations.Last year alone, the BATF raided over 2,000 homes or businesses with anumber of innocent victims killed, and tens of millions in assets seizedand hundreds of Americans jailed, in their quest for the Holy Grail calledgun control. And it should be realized that this gestapo-like organization did notjust arrive with Bill Clinton. It came on stream in 1968 with the Gun ControlAct of 1968 and has been growing in power and in its attacks on the Americanpeople ever since. As syndicated columnist Paul Craig Roberts noted: "the tragedynear Waco happened precisely because of federal laws regulating gun ownership.T he Branch Davidians hadn't assaulted anyone. They lived peacefully inthe community. Except for federal gun laws they would all still be alive.It is the liberal premise that gun ownership is evil, should be illegalor at least heavily regulated, and that has created an atmoshpere in whichthe BATF like an unthinking bully, can run roughshod over Americans' constitutionalrights, due process, and freedom." [ED NOTE: And as the gun controllegislation described above passes, BATF attacks on honest law-abidinggun owners are likely to grow 10-fold!] It is obvious that the government (and the BATF) wanted a highly publicized"victory" over gun owners and "religious nuts," andthanks to the whitewashing and coverup by the Administration and the media,the American people have by-and-large slept through the most unspeakableslaughter of innocents in U.S. history. In spite of all the mess-ups, thegovernment has its victory, gun owners and religious groups across Americanow live in fear of similar treatment at the hands of Clinton's Gestapo,and the momentum toward gun control, toward persecution of Christians andother minority religious groups, traditionalists, and Constitutionalists,and towards a socialist America and the New World Order continues to accelerate. If the inhabitants of Mt. Carmel had been dangerous terrorists, drugdealers, or enemies on the battlefield, the government attack could nothave been more brutal. After the initial attack (02/28/93) Former McClennon County Texas DistrictAttorney Vic Feazell blamed the BATF for the deadly confrontation, accusingthem of "a vulgar display of power". In 1987, Feazell helped lead an investigation of the Davidians and theirfirearms, in which they wer completely exonerated from any illegal activity."We treated them like human beings rather than stormtrooping the place." Likewise, Jack Harwell, the McClennon County SHeriff, called Koreshon the telephone and informed him of the charges, and asked him to turnhimself in, along with six others and surrender their weapons. When deputiesarrived at the Church grounds, Koresh and the other Davidian members peacefullycomplied. Feazell said of the Davidians, "They're protective of what'stheirs. They're protective of their land. They view their land as Muslimsto Mecca and Jews view Jerusalem...if they'd (the BATF) called and talkedto them, the Davidians would've given them what they wanted." Feazell's view of the BATF blundering has been seconded by anti-terroristsexpert Col. Charlie Beckwith, the founder of the U.S. Army's Dellta ForceCommando unit. He has told reporters the BATF raid was an "embarrassment"Beckwith faulted the plan implemented by the VATF, saying the intelligencebehind it was responsible for the disaster. Subsequent to the first BATF attack Feazell predicted that the governmentwould kill all the Davidians, and after the massacre (the second attack)he said that they intended to kill these people from the beginning to coverthe tracks of their own crimes they committed by raiding the compound tobegin with. After the original public relations disaster on 2/28, the governmentstrategy seems to have evolved over the next 51 days as follows: First, through a massive media discrediting of the Davidians throughthe "party line" press over several weeks. Second, by slowly preparing the public to believe that all of the peopleremaining in the compound were under the total control of an unpredictablepsychopath, and to expect a mass suicide, yet saying that there was noreason for them to believe that Koresh would carry out a mass suicide. Third, to cloak their act in righteousness (as tyranny always does)by saying their efforst on Monday were to force the people out by usingnon-lethal CS gas "for the sake of the children." USING CS GAS ON CHILDREN-President Clinton, Janet Reno, and their FBI/BATFemployees have described CS gas as "a harmless tear has, an irritant,designed to cause the mothers to grab their children and run out of thebuilding." No one in the police or military who has ever used CS gasbelieves this. CS gas (O-chlorobenzylidene malonitrate) has been bannedas a chemical warfare battlefield agent by the Chemical Weapons COnventionsigned in Paris in January by the U.S. and over 130 other nations. Usedduring the Nietnam War to flush Vietcong from hidden tunnels, the gas causesdizziness, disorientation, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea,burning of the sking, intense tearing, temporary blindness, coughing, andvomiting-in short it is designed to blind and disable (very different from"relatively harmless"). CS gas is a battlefield incapacitatinggas. On March 10, The Houston Chronicle reported that former Houston policeSWAT commander Lt. Jim Gunn said that "CS gas can get into a child'slungs and cause congestion and kill them." Benjamin C. Garrett, executivedirector of teh Chemical and Biological Arms Control Institute in Alexandria,VA said in the Washington Times (4/23/93) that: "the CS would havemost harshly affected the children in the compound. The reaction wouldhave intensified for the children since the smaller you are, the sooneryou would feel response." It is important to note that the childrendid not have gas masks (they were too small to wear them). Beth Stephens, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, apublic interest law firm based in New York, said "tests have documentedat least 80 deaths caused by exposure to CS gas. Tests have found thatCS is a toxic substance which is highly dangerous to people who inhaleits fumes, particularly when in confined areas." CS was pumped intothe Mt. Carmel compound (an enclosed area) for six hours before the facilitycaught fire and burned to the ground. The Washington Times (4/22/93) wrote: "'The powerful chemical tehFBI used at the Branch Davidian compound would have turned the cult children'slast moments into a final hell,' chemical experts said yesterday. 'It wouldhave panicked the children whose eyes would have involuntarily shut. Theirthroats and lungs would have been blurning. They would have been coughingwildly,' said Benjamin Garrett. ' Eventually they would have been vomitingin a final hell'" [ED NOTE: THis is the gas CLinton, Reno, and theirunderlings described as a "harmless irritant."] This writer has talked to a half dozen special forces, military, andpolice personnel who all agree that CS is a highly toxic battlefield immobilizationgas. "Bo" Gritz told this writer that: "CS gas is not justan irritant; it is designed to knock you down and makes you incapable ofany practicle functions." That our government would use it on womenand children (thereby immobilizing them and preventing them from runningfrom the building) is creul, inhuman, and unspeakable evil and is the kindof thing the Nazis and Communists would have relished in.. THE GOVERNMENT COVERUP: OPERATION DAMAGE CONTROL (OR WHITE WASH) TheU.S. government has refined the art of political coverup to a science.They have had practice: 1) The POW/MIA Coverup after World War II, Korea,and Vietnam whereby thousands of American POWs and servicement were leftin the hands of the communists; 2) The Kennedy Assassinations (John andBobby) Coverup which is now in its 31st year; 3) The Watergate Coverupwhich ultimately backfired on Nixon and Company; 4) The AIDS Coverup presentlybeing perpetrated by the government (and particularly the CDC) to hidethe extent and magnitude of the AIDS crisis; and, now, 5) The Waco MassacreCoverup. a) BURNING AND BULLDOZING THE EVIDENCE: The BATF (and other governmentagencies) love to burn, bulldoze or cremate the evidence. In the Weavercase, the government tried to burn out the Weaver cabin by dumping fuelon the cabin via helicopter and only an alert reporter waving a camerain the air saved the surviving Weavers from the same fate as the BranchDavidians. Shortly after Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris and the three Weavergirls came out of the cabin, the BATF and FBI grabbed the bodies of Vickiand Sam Weaver and had them cremated. Therefore, no trial evidence fromautopsies. (Sam Weaver, age 14, was shot several times in the back by themarshals, Vicki in the head by an FBI sniper). In Waco, on April 19, crucial physical evidence and key witnesses wereconsumed by fire. Then on May 12, FBI officials, citing the fear that someonemight fall in the bunker (though the entire site was fenced and guarded),and a need to fill holes and cover trash and raw sewage for safety andhealth reasons, rolled bulldozers across the burned out compound completelyobliterating any remaining evidence. b) SILENCING BATF AND FBI AGENTS - Shortly after the original BATF attack,two agents came forward on TV in New York (though their faces were notshown) and said they were afraid of a coverup. All BATF agents have alreadybeen threatened by the Washington office of BATF with the possiblity ofbeing punished, dismissed, or prosecuted for speaking publicaly about theraid. The agency is struggling to keep these agents silent. Four of theircomrades died because of bungling, malfeasance, and mendacity at the topof the BATF. c) THE SO CALLED "INDEPENDENT" ARSON TEAM HAD CLOSE TIES WITHTHE BATF The Clintonistas, immediately after the fire, suggested an "independent"investigation to investigate the burned out Branch Davidian compound siteand confirm the "truth." That "independent" investigator,who claimed the fire had been set by the Davidians (based, he said, oninfrared photos taken from a helicopter) was employee (who had been ona joint BATF task force for 10 years) and long time contractor for theFBI, whose wife is personal secretary to the head of the Houston BATF -where the whole raid was planned. The FBI controlled the crime scene forthree weeks following the holocaust, letting no Texas Rangers, local policeor truly independent arson investigators in, and then bulldozed the entiresite on May 12. (So, now, no one else can investigate the burnt out compound.) d) THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT INVESTIGATE THE DECISIONS FOR THEFINAL ASSAULT - Although Bill Clinton promised a "vigorous and through"investigation of the handling of the entire Waco affair, on May 15 theJustice Department said it would not investigate the decision making processassociated with the final assault. (This is like saying in a murder casewe will not investigate who pulled the trigger or who gave the order topull the ttrigger, or in Watergate, not investigating who gave the orderfor the Watergate breakin). As the New York Times (5/16/93) said: "Clintonofficials said that since Ms. Reno has been widely supported in Congress,and since polls show that the majority of Americans supported her decisionto use tear gas, and blame the cult members themselves for the final deadlyfire, department officials concluded that nothing could be gained by lookingmore closely at her order to carry out the assault." e) LIES THE GOVERNMENT TOLD DURING AND AFTER OPERATION WACO - "Governmentsare constituted to lie to the greatest number of people the greater partof the time." Machiavelli, in The Prince. BATF, FBI, and Clinton Administrationofficials have consistently lied and contradicted themselves since thesiege of Mt. Carmel began. Just a few of a growing list of the lies include: 1. The media was told the day before the raid (2/27) to get ready fora big blowout and to get their TV cameras in place. The BATF originallydenied it told the media, but later admitted that it had.. 2. The BATF said that Koresh had to be arrested at the compound becausehe had not left it for several months. Numerous people in the area saidthat was a lie and that they had frequently seen him out jogging, at thestore, and in town until shortly before the attack. The BATF finally admittedthey knew nothing about Koresh's movement because they NEVER even put himunder surveillance, let alone did they try to arrest him. 3. The BATF originally said that they had an arrest warrant for Koreshand a search warrant for the compound. Later it was shown that they onlyhad a search warrant and no arrest warrant. 4. The BATF said that the element of surprise was the key to successand that they wouldn't have attacked if they had known that the BranchDavidians were expecting them. This was a lie. Everyone in town, includingthe Branch Davidians, knew about hte coming attack. They moved a wholearmy of men and equipment up to the compound. Later BATF director Higginsadmitted that they knew they had lost the element of surprise and wentahead with the attack anyway. That decision caused the death of four BATFagents. 5. The BATF told the Texas National Guard (in order to obtain use oftheir helicopters), that there was an illegal drug lab at the compound.There was no evidence of this before, during, or after the raid accordingto the WACO Tribune-Herald (03/28/93). 6. On March 6, FBI officers denied that they had any plans to use psychologicalwarfare techniques against the Branch Davidians (i.e., such as loud rockmusic, bright lights, weird sounds[animals being slaughtered]). The FBIused them constantly throughout the seige. 7. In his press conference the evening of the fire, Bill Clinton saidJanet Reno had acted "because of the children" who were "beingabused." Later, officials admitted that there was no evidence of childabuse. 8. On March 2, the FBI's Bob Ricks told reporters that when the FBIapproached Koresh, he was going to go outside with grenades (in front ofthe TV cameras), pull the pin, commit suicide and take as many agents withhim as he could. On 4/20 on MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour FBI Director WilliamSessions said that all fo the FBI analysis of Koresh indicated that hewould NEVER commit suicide. 9. On April 28, FBI Deputy Director Floyd Clarke told the House JudiciaryCommittee that the "Branch Davidians had used their own children ashuman shields by holding them up in front of the windows." The truthis, the Branch Davidians hoisted their children up to the windows to seethe M1-A1 Abrams battle tanks sitting in their front yard, as FBI spokesmanRichard Swensen later admitted. 10. BATF Director Stephen Higgins testified before a Senate subcommittee(04/02/93) that the BATF mission failed only "because the Branch Davidiansambushed the BATF." This is a lie. The BATF attacked the Branch Davidiansand not the other way arround. (Video Footage Clearly Shows this). 11. The FBI and Janet Reno stated repeatedly that the reason they attackedthe compound on April 19 was "concern for the safety and well beingof the children" This was a lie! You don't ram into buildings withmilitary tanks and pump CS gas ( a gas so deadly and debilitating thatit has been banned by international treaty for use in warfare) into a buildingfilled with women and children." 12. CS gas was described by Clinton, Reno and FBI officials as a harmless(irritant) tear gas. This is a lie. It is 80 times stronger than tear gas,immobilizes its victims and throws them into violent coughing and convulsions(i.e. the "perfect" weapon for a police state to use againstyoung women & children). 13. Clinton said on 04/20/93 that CS was a "tear gas which hadbeen tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or children."That is a lie. (See Above) 14. The government said they had exhausted all avenues to resolve thestandoff. This is a lie. They refused to let any of the family membersspeak with the Branch Davidians even though this has helped to resolvemany such former standoffs. They refused to let "Bo" Gritz andJack McLamb, who negotiated Randy Weaver and his family out last August,assist, although they volunteered numerous times. 15. The BATF said after the February 28 fiasco that "we were outgunned.."Another lie. They had helicopter gunships, armored vehicles, and fullyautomatic weapons to use against the Branch Davidians, not to mention stungrenades and the military's most high tech equipment. 16. George Stephanopoulos said: "The children were being abused,even to instruction on how to clamp down on cyanide pills." Thoughthis makes for chilling headlines, the FBI has denied that this was true. 17. On April 19, FBI spokesman Bob Rocks quoted Branch Davidian survivorRenos Avraam as saying: "The fire's been lit. The fire's been lit."But when questioned on camera by reporters, Avraam said: "One of thetanks knocked over a gas lantern, and it started a fire under some balesof hay that were laying around. The fire wasn't started by us." PRESIDENT CLINTON'S PRESS CONFERENCE AND DAMAGE CONTROL - PresidentClinton gave a Rose Garden press conference on 04/20/93 in which he defendedand sought to justify Reno's, The FBI's and BATF's actions in Waco. Thelies and distortions which Clinton told in that press conference were incredible: 1. "The Branch Davidians had illegally stockpiled weapons and ammunition."[ED. NOTE: That was only suspected, but never proven. Shouldn't the governmenthave proven that before they killed almost 100 people? Is it now lawfulto kill people during investigations of wrongdoing? Lawful or not, it isnow commonplace in America!] 2. Koresh "placed innocent children at risk." [ED NOTE: Therewas no risk until the government attacked the compound. Wasn't it Reno,the BATF, and FBI that put the innocent children at risk?] 3. "The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because theindividual with whom they were dealing David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational,and probably insane." [ED NOTE: None of the townspeople who knew Koreshobserved this, nor did the former Distric Attorney of McClennon County,nor the sheriff's deputies who knew him. He did have strange religiousviews, but most of the townspeople who knew him liked him.] 4. Clinton said the April 19 FBI attack on the Branch Davidians was"an effort to protect the young hostages. " [ED NOTE: The governmentdidn't protect them, they killed them. And, the children were not hostages.They were hthere of their own free will. The Waco seige was never a hostagecrisis.] 5. Clinton said: "The [FBI] plan included a decision to withholdthe use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead use tear gasthat would not cause permanent damage." [ED. NOTE: No one knows whofired at who during the final seige, because the press were kept two milesaway, unless one wants to accept Clinton's word, and the government didnot use tear gas - it was highly lethal, flammable CS gas (as discussedabove).] 6. Clinton said: "Mr. Koresh's response to the demand for his surrenterby federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who werehis captives...He killed those he controlled." [ED NOTE: There isno evidence that Koresh murdered any children; it is open to question whetherat the last moment he shot himself; and the chidlren (according to localtownspeople, Branch Davidian survivors, and Texas social workers, wereNOT captives.] 7. Clinton said: "I hope very much that others who will be temptedto join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh willbe deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks."[ED NOTE: Is this a not so veiled threat that if you belong to an unpopular,misfit, non-mainstream religious group, the same thing could happen toyou? The intimidation value from the Waco inferno for the government againstsmall religious grounps, conservative, patriotic, pro-life, or non-mainstreamgroups is incredible. Conform or we'll destroy you!] 8. When asked by a reporter, "Why now," Clinton replied: "Therewas a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with theirlimited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.They might be needed in other parts of the country." [ED NOTE: Limitedresources? This is the government which is giving billions of dollars toRussia in aid and requesting billions more for 1001 boondoggles. And asfar as spreading the "experts" too thin, there were only a fewhundred troops and agents there. The government has tens of thousands offederal agents and allegedly over a million military personnel.] 9. Clinton said: "The danger of them [the Branch Davidians] doingsomething to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease,with the passage of time." [ED NOTE: Quite to the contrary, as timewent by, the likelyhood that they wwould come out increased, accordingto experts who have dealt with many of these types of crises.] 10. Clinton said: "They [the FBI] had reason to believe that thechildren inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well asbeing forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions." [ED NOTE:There was no evidence of child abuse according to several Texas socialworkers who had visited the compound. However, the gassing (with CS gas)and burning of the children by the Clintonistas does seem to this writerto qualify as child abuse. And if the conditions were unsanitary and unsafein the compound it was because the government had turned off the water,head and electricity 50 days earlier. Government gunfire into the buildingmight also qualify as "an unsafe condition."] -------------------------------------------------------------------------- - 5 - FLYING SAUCERS: THE REAL STORY Popular Science Feb '95 From the hopeless tangle of claims and counterclaims emerges the documentedfact that secret military research HAS explored flying saucer flight. Exposed and utterly alone beneath the incandescent starts of the Nevadadesert, I dropped my pack and squirmed the last few yards to the summetof White Sides Mountain. Carrying only a pair of binoculars, a tape recorderand a radio scanner, I groped over the rocks, knowing that carelessnessnow would waste all my care in getting here: the long, 4-wheel-drive detourto avoid road sensors that alert base security, the zigzag hike throughthe sage brush, the pains taken to stay off ridgelines where I might beprofiled against the sky. Pulling myself up to peer over the last jagged parapet, I was sure forthe first time in hours that I was in the right place. Across 12 milesof darkened scrub, just beneath the far horizon glimmered Dreamland, asplash of gemlike lights tossed into a hollow in the hills. Also knownas Area 51, it's a terrestrial black hole into which it's estimated millionsof tax dollars disappear each day while hardly a word of explanation escapes. A complex of hangars, giant parabolic antennas and one of the longestrunways on Earth, Area 51 spreads the length of Nevada's remote Groom Lakedry lake bed. For four decades-through the top-secret U-2 spyplane programof the '50s, the SR-71 spyplane of the '60s, the F-117A stealth fighterof the '80s-Groom Lake has been where our government has come when it wantsto be alone. Now, five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the lights of GroomLake still burn throughout the night with wartime urgency. And whateversecrets lie there are guarded with undiminished vigilance. Armed, unidentifiedmen stalk the sagebrush in camouflage fatigues. Unmarked Black Hawk helicopterssweep the hills. Electronic sensors hidden along the approaching roadsreport the presence of vehicular traffic. Keep in mind that you're subjectto all of this on public land, before you make it to the border markedwith signs reading "use of deadly force authorized." UFO capital It was not until this past summer; amid mounting publicity, that theAir Force gave up denying the undeniable. "We do have facilities withinthe complex near the dry lake bed of Groom Lake," says its latestofficial statement. The Air Force adds that the Nellis Range Complex-ofwhich Groom Lake is a part-is "used for testing and training technologies,operations and systems critical to the effectiveness of U.S. military forces.Specific activities conducted at Nellis cannot be discussed any furtherthan that." But that, of course, is only the beginning of the discussion. With somuch unexplained, speculation naturally ranges from the merely exotic tothe otherworldly. Glenn Campbell, a former computer programmer who hasstudied and written about the base fulltime since moving to the tiny nearbytown of Rachel a year and a half ago, fondly refers to his adopted neighborhoodas "the UFO capital," and "America's most popular secretairbase." Articles and TV specials have theorized endlessly about Groom Lake.Aerospace technology enthusiasts point to the likelihood that Lockheedwould be testing a hypersonic spyplane there, just as it earlier testedthe SR-71. But what has really established Groom Lake as a place of pilgrimagefor UFO watchers is the lure of the flying saucer. It was this same fascination-one that has gripped America since theterm first came into common parlance 47 years ago-that brought me to GroomLake this past fall. It stands to reason that if our military has flyingsaucers, this is where they'd be. But as it turned out, Groom Lake was only the beginning of the story.Sure, it is possible that there are flying saucers somewhere in the NellisRange Complex. Given the level of secrecy almost anything is possible,and there are in face a number of intriguing claims to this effect. Butmore fascinating is the verifiable fact that these would not be the firstflying saucers our government has hidden from us. First Sighting Think back to 1947, to a world sick of war and an America racing tobuild its nuclear deterrent against the looming Soviet threat. In Juneof that year, while flying his private plane near Washington's Mount Rainier,Kenneth Arnold said he spotted "a chain of nine peculiar-looking aircraft"that "flew like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water."By timing their passage between tow peaks, he later estimated their groundspeed to be about 1700 mph. Arnold, a deputy federal marshal and successful businessman, was a difficultwitness to dismiss. His sighting was widely reported and thoroughly investigated,eventually by the Army Air Force (AAF), which feared he might have seensome new Soviet secret weapon. But first another possibility had to be ruled out: Was it one of ours?Accordingly to Curtis Peebles' Watch The Skies!, a history of the flyingsaucer phenomenon recently published by the Smithsonian, an early suspectwas a formerly secret Navy fighter program. "Are you positive theNavy junked the XF5U-1 project?" asked one 1947 AAF memo. America's first saucer Built by Chance Vought of Stratford, Connecticut, the XF5U-1 "FlyingFlapjack" was the closest thing anybody knew of to a flying saucer.Although capable of nothing like the 1700 mph reported by Arnold, its bizarrecircular plan-form nonetheless promised performance unlike anything thathad come before. The program traces back to the 1930s, when National Advisory Committeeon Aeronautics engineer Charles Zimmerman flew a series of unmanned modelsthat led him to the Flapjack shape. The extraordinary virtue of the designwas that it defied what had seemed a fundamental aerodynamic tradeoff.The Flapjack managed both the high top speeds desirable for combat andthe low stalling speeds needed to operate out of small airfields, or offthe decks of ships. In face, with enough engine power, it could hang byits props, and take off vertically, without any airstrip at all. The saucer shape's high-speed performance came from the fact that itwas essentially a very low aspect ratio wing - a wing with a low ratioof length to width-like that on a modern fighter jet. Although stubby wingscan be shaped to produce relatively little drag at high speeds, they sufferbadly at low speeds. The cause is partly that large amounts of air spillup from under the wingtips and swirl into tornado-like vortices that trailbehind the aircraft. Zimmerman limited this induced drag by placing theFlashback's propellers at its edges and gearing them so that they counteractedthe vortices. This simple idea proved out remarkably well in more than 100 flightsby a manned test craft called the V-173. In late 1942, the NAVY okayedconstruction of two full-scale prototypes. Powered by a pair of 1600-horsepowerPratt & Whitney Twin Wasp radials, the XF5U-1 was expected to fly atup to 425 miles per hour and yet alight daintily at as little as 40 mph.Based on his experience with the V-173, Zimmerman predicted that a turbine-poweredFlapjack would eventually reach 550 mph, while takeoff and landing speedswould dwindle to zero. We'll never know if he was right. The XF5U-1 prototypes were ready by1947, but never flew. The Navy by this time decided to throw its full weightbehind more orthodox jet fighters and ordered the XF5U-1 destroyed. Noplane did what the Flapjack promised to do until the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel-aprecursor to today's Harrier vertical-takeoff attack fighter-began flyingin the 1960s. As 1947 drew to a close, the Arnold sighting and a number of othersremained unresolved. The XF5U-1 wasn't behind them. Nor did they seem tobe anything within the reach of Soviet technology. An exhaustive reviewof Nazi wartime research hadn't turned up any explanations either. Thenewly instituted U.S. Air Force took very seriously the possibility thatsomething we didn't understand was roaming our airspace. It secretly launchedProject Sign, the first of a series of UFO investigations that were tostretch on for more than 20 years. Shape of the future As the Air Force pondered reports of unbelievable high-performance flyingdiscs, engineers grew more and more intrigued by the aerodynamic and structuralproperties of such a shape. A lengthy and detailed patent applied for bythe Lockheed Aircraft Corp. in 1953 describes an "aircraft of circularplan-form a nd of bi-convex vertical cross section" - basically, agiant lentil. As with the Flying Flapjack, the benefits foreseen includeda combination of high forward speeds (better than Mach 4 in this case)and vertical takeoff and landing capability. The patent enumerates several properties that suit a saucer to thosegoals. The shape, it claims, provides excellent structural rigidity, aerodynamicstability in vertical ascent and descent, and room inside for large amountsof payload and fuel. Furthermore, its smooth profile and unbroken leadingand trailing edges were though to lend it inherent aerodynamic efficiency. There's no record of Lockheed's radical craft ever getting off the drawingboard, but it seems somehow fitting that there should be an early linkbetween Lockheed and a saucer. As creator of the U2, SR-71 and F-117A,Lockheed's name intertwines with Groom Lake's from the beginning. And saucers,of course, are what people come here to see. Weapon System 606A Around the time Lockheed applied for its patent, Britain's Avro Aircraft,builder of some of World War II's most successful bombers, began work ona more practical saucer at its plant near Toronto, Canada. Under a Canadiangovernment contract, Avro sketched out a vehicle that harnesses a newlydiscovered benefit of the circular wing. Jetted down from the wing's perimeter,a circular curtain of thrust created a "bubble" of high pressureair that resulted in very efficient vertical lift, much like a hovercraftbut without the flexible skirt. Avro designed this effect into a GETOL (Ground Effect Takeoff and Landing)craft that used it to get airborne, then gradually directed thrust aftuntil lift on the circular wing took over. Canada soon decided it couldn'tafford to pursue the idea, but the U.S. Air Force saw it as a way out ofa troubling Cold War vulnerability. Fearing that Soviet strikes on European airfields could all too easilytake out planes out of a fight, the Air Force picked up funding for Avro'sGETOL work in 1954. Under a highly classified program designated WeaponSystem 606A, it developed a concept plane with a top speed of 1000 mph. Considering it would be years before a fighter without GETOL capabilitieswent that fast, this was a radical proposition. To lower the stakes, theAir Force joined the Army in funding construction of a slower, simplertest craft. The result was one of the strangest machines in the annalsof military aviation. The VZ-9V Avrocar bristled with untried ideas. Buried at the centerof its 18-ft-dia. circular wing was a 5-ft. fan, surrounded by three turbojetslying on their sides in a triangle. Jet exhaust spun the fan by blowingover turbine blades that ringed its edge, and the resulting thrust wasducted out to nozzles at the wing's periphery. Lacking conventional tail surfaces, the Avrocar was expected from theoutset to be unstable. The designers devised an ingenious but complex mechanismto automatically feed corrections back into the control system, using thecentral fan as a gyroscopic reference. In essence, it strove to mimic theperformance of a modern computerized fly-by-wire system by purely mechanicalmeans. But instability still proved to be the Avrocar's undoing. In test flights,it hovered reasonably well close to the ground, but at 5 or 6ft. it developeda violent "hubcapping" wobble and had to be tethered for itsown protection. Wind tunnel tests showed the control system couldn't holdit steady in forward flight either, and speeds greater than 35 mph werenever attempted. In December of 1961, with $10 million spent, the projectwas abandoned. "It was a very ingenious idea, but it was just way too early,"says Dan Murray, who managed the program for the Air Force. Murray nowbelieves that helicopters and other specialized craft have taken over theroles for which the Avrocar was planned. "I'm sure you could builda flying saucer today," he says. "The question is, why?" Saucers today Yet the saucer lives on. Sikorsky Aircraft has been testing a 6-ft.-dia.discshaped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) called the Cypher since 1988.In many respects, it is the robotic heir to the Avrocar, with maneuverabilitythat lets it lurk around terrain features as its carriers out reconnaissance.Then there's a series of saucers build by Moller International, whose founder,Paul Moller, drew lessons from the Avrocar. His latest, the one man, 8engine M200X, flew stably and demonstrated technologies for a proposedflying car. In the lighter-that-air arena, the Russians looked to a shapestrikingly reminiscent of Lockheed's 1953 patent to make their huge Thermoplanecargo blimps stable at low speeds and efficient at high speeds. But what about high-performance saucers, saucers like those the AirForce feared 47 years ago? Was Weapon System 606A and the failed Avrocarreally the end of large-scale military saucer research? Tantalizing leads suggest not. William Blake, an engineer at the AirForce's Wright Laboratory, told us of a huge nuclear powered craft designedby Convair in the early '60s under a Navy contract for a transoceanic transport.He found a brief article dated June 1960, which shows a general arrangementdrawing, and describes the vehicle as 400ft. in diameter and capable ofcarrying a million-pound payload. Known as the ground-effect machine, orGEM, the concept relied on a curtain jet like ht Avrocar for lift nearthe ground, but had no provision for flight at higher altitudes. More recent but also more dubious is the well-publicized story of RobertLazar, who says he worked at a Nellis Range base even more secret thanArea 51. He says the base, called S4, consists of nine underground hangarscontaining extraterrestrial saucers that the government is trying to reproduce.But when we ran his explanation of the spacecrafts' workings by a respectedphysicist, we were told it contained obvious errors. Nor does Lazar's claimededucational background check out. A more mundane scenario might warrant consideration, however. Recentyears have seen the maturation of the electronic flight controls neededto stabilize a saucer, while stealth has brought a whole new set of parametersto aircraft design. Although the techniques for foiling radar are complexand largely classified, a key principle is to minimize the surfaces thatmight intersect a radar beam at a right angle. What, one has to wonderwould do this better than a flying disc? This question ran through my mind as I trained my telescope on Area51. The night before, Glenn Campbell and I had been spotted by securityas we watched from another hill, and we immediately heard "We justwent into condition watchdog...we have visitors on the hill" overthe control-tower-frequency. Something was told not to land. Somethingthey didn't want us to see even from 12 miles away. So tonight atop White Sides, I'm determined to lay low. The tower opensat 4 am and with the words "no condition in effect" confirmsI'm undetected. At 4:30 am, a Black Hawk flying with no lights makes alow pass, but I'm hidden in a rocky ravine. Dawn breaks. Activity at thebase picks up. In the crisp morning air, cars, trucks, even people arevisible moving among the hangars. An F117-A takes to the runway, but no saucers. Still, there's a strangeexhilaration at my solitary view into this secret world. There's somethingout there. And as long as they won't tell us what it is, our dreams offlying saucers will have this place to roost. *END* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- - 6 - MEDICAL DOCTOR PUTS HIS LIFE ON THE LINE TO PROVE THE HIV VIRUS DOESNOT CAUSE AIDS. If you or someone you know has tested positive for the HIV virus thereis now good news. The chances you will get ill or die from AIDS are no greater that ifthe test came out negative. The London Times reports a major research group has recently proventhe test for the HIV virus (which is claimed to cause AIDS) is completelyinvalid and "riddled with false positives". Malnutrition, multiple infections, malaria, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis,having once had the "flu" or measles even the bodies own naturalresponse to anal semen all result in positive HIV/AIDS tests. Now the truth is finally revealed. When a completely normal and healthperson tests positive for HIV, is then put on the deadly drug AZT - theydie. Death results from the destruction of the immune system caused bythe deadly drug AZT and not by HIV. I interviewed Dr. Robert E. Willner, a medical doctor who has practicedand lectured on medicine worldwide for over 35 years. He recently stunnedSpain by inoculating himself with the blood of Pedro Tocino, an HIV positivehemophiliac. Dr. Willner is the author of the just published blockbusterbook "Deadly Deception: The Proof That Sex And HIV Absolutely Do NotCause AIDS." Q. Dr. Willner, you say in your book AIDS is the greatest fraud in medicalhistory. That the perpetrators of this crime are raking in billions whileinnocent people are being murdered with the deadly drug AZT. Is AIDS ascam? A. No, people are indeed dying of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromeor AIDS. The scam is that AIDS is not caused by HIV and AIDS is not transmittedsexually or by any other means. The real causes of AIDS have been knownfor centuries and have been listed in medical textbooks for over 60 years.We have all been lied to and sold a bill of goods by a handful of unscrupulous,immoral scientists that care more for money and power than for the truthand human life itself. Most of the medically supervised AIDS deaths were either caused or contributedto by the deadly drug AZT. In many cases it was given to perfectly normaland health individuals who were terrorized by fear from the AIDS mediablitz into taking the phony HIV test. When a percentage got positive testresults they were then given lethal doses of AZT, a drug that was shelvedover 20 years ago because it was found to be too toxic to give terminallyill cancer patients. Q. We have been told all along that all AIDS patients have the HIV virusand that is what causes AIDS! A. That is an absolute lie! The HIV/AIDS hypothesis was based on thefact that only 40% of AIDS cases were confirmed by the Center for DiseaseControl to have the antibodies to HIV and not the virus itself. In NewYork and San Francisco only 7% of the AIDS victims were HIV positive. Thismeans that 60 to 93% of all AIDS patients that were used to create theAIDS hypothesis were HIV negative. The entire AIDS hypothesis is based upon a total lie. We were all liedto when we were lead to believe that 100% of AIDS victims were HIV positive. Q. But how could this happen? A. To answer that question we must examine just exactly who createdthis great lie. It was none other than Dr. Robert Gallo who was investigated and foundguilty of "scientific misconduct". The very same Dr. Robert Gallowho just a few years prior to AIDS discovered what he called the HTLV retrovirus.He claimed that HTLV caused human leukemia but failed to gain scientificacceptance because he could not prove it. Gallo likewise claimed that HTLV was sexually transmitted and had alatent period of 40 years. That theory was rejected and failed to gain Dr. Gallo acceptance intothe National Academy of Sciences. His theories on AIDS are just as fallaciousand one cannot help but see the similarities in the scenario. However, this time instead of trying to prove his insane theories aboutAIDS to his peers, without scientific proof, he by-passed them and wentpublic. Then, with the help of Margaret Heckler, former head of Health and HumanServices, who was under great political pressure to come up with an answerto AIDS, the infamous world press announcement of the discovery of theso-called AIDS virus came about. This great fraud is now responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousandsof individuals world wide. It was no accident that Gallo just happenedto patent the test for HIV the day after the announcement to the worldwas made. It likewise is no accident that Gallo is now a multimillionairebecause of AIDS and his fraudulent AIDS test. Q. Are you saying that Dr. Gallo created AIDS? A. In a manner of speaking, yes he did. By taking a number of diseasesthat were killing a select group of individuals and claiming that theyall had one thing in common - the innocent retrovirus he now called HIV;which he also claimed was sexually transmitted. The truth is that these individuals were indeed dying of a variety ofdiseases and they all did have one thing in common but it had nothing todo with their sexual preference or with Gallo's harmless so called "mysterious"HIV retrovirus. They were all dying from specific causes that I go into great detailexplaining in my book. The information is completely documented and basedon cold, hard scientific facts-not on the phony, unproven guesswork orthe fraud-laced hypothesis that is the very foundation of Gallo's ridiculousAIDS theory. Q. How do you answer proponents of the HIV/AIDS connection when theyargue that "everyone knows HIV causes AIDS"? A. Once "everyone knew" the earth was flat and the sun revolvedaround it. It has been more than twelve years since the so-called "discovery"of AIDS. Yet, there is still not one single reference paper that existsin the world that proves HIV causes AIDS. In other words, no experimentalproof whatsoever has been offered to establish that the harmless retrovirus,which cannot even be found in 50% of the individuals with AIDS, has anythingto do with it. Q. Isn't it true that any disease capable of destroying a human bodyis always found in vast numbers in the infected person? A. Yes, of course. Yet, even the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction(PCR) invented by Dr. Kary Mulli, Nobel Prize Laureate, which literallymakes it impossible for viruses to hide, can't find Gallo's HIV virus insufficient quantities to give someone the flu let alone kill them. HIV is rarely found in T-cells (1 virus per 10,000 to 1,000,000 cells)and when it is found it is doing absolutely nothing. In cases of full blownAIDS, even in those just hours from death, the virus is extremely difficultto find; and in 50% of the cases it cannot be found at all. Whenever itis found, even in active cases of AIDS, HIV is inactive, not reproducingand it is certainly not killing T-cells as Gallo claims. Q. Then what exactly is HIV? A. HIV is simply a harmless piece of dead tissue, not unlike numerousother retroviruses that exist in our body at any given time. It is onethousandth the size of a regular cell is harmless and is simply incapableof doing anything that Gallo claims of it. Q. Does Dr. Mullis share your contention about HIV and AIDS? A. Yes he does. Dr. Mullis says: "Scientists don't believe, theyhave evidence...There is no such body of knowledge" (with referenceto HIV as the cause of AIDS). Dr. Peter Duesberg, Professor of Molecular Biology University of CA.,Berkely and member of the National Academy of Sciences, puts it even moredistinctly. He writes "HIV does not cause AIDS...The point that everyoneis missing is that all of those original papers, Gallo wrote on HIV havebeen found fraudulent..>The HIV hypothesis was based on those papers." Q. Are there other who also support your position? A. Nearly 500 of the world's top scientists are now challenging Gallo'shypothesis that HIV causes AIDS and the list is growing daily. Every statistic,every valid scientific observation and even the test of time now provesGallo wrong. It was only a matter of time until thinking scientists raisedtheir heads out of the sand, saw the truth and started questioning thelies that simply did not stand up to the scrutiny of impartial scientificreasoning and experimentation. Project AIDS International charges that "the dogmatic AIDS hypothesisbased on the findings of a person convicted of science fraud, is directlyor indirectly responsible for the premature deaths of hundreds of thousandsof people worldwide." PAI further goes on to say: "If actionis not taken immediately against those who are directly or indirectly responsiblefor these crimes against humanity through the practice of profit over life,the drug induced AIDS deaths will most certainly reach proportions unparalleledby any natural catastrophe in human history." Q. What about Dr. Gallo's contention that HIV is a slow "mysterious"and "intelligent" virus. A. Dr. Duesberg renowned as one, if not the world's foremost retroviologist,answers that question by saying that: "Slow" or "lente"viruses do not exist! It is another hypothetical invention designed toexplain what is obviously nonsense. It has no basis in fact, no precedentin science, and is contradictory to 20 years of research findings (andI might add billions of dollars in funding). Retroviruses can only be replicatedby the host cell, and are dependent on the life-cycle of that cell. Therefore,the virus must duplicate within hours or days in order to survive. Forover 20 years, an exhaustive investigation of retroviruses reveals thatthere is no such thing as a "slow virus". There is nothing biochemicallyor genetically different about HIV that would give it the power to actany differently than any other retrovirus. As Dr. Duesberg so aptly putsit, "there are no slow viruses, only slow virologists." Q. Did you always know HIV was not the true cause of AIDS? A. NO. I have to admit that in the beginning I too believed Gallo'sbig lie. But the more I learned about retroviruses the more the AIDS hypothesisdidn't make sense. Q. Surely there were a few independent scientists who tried to exposethis fraud? A. There were and as an example of how their dissension was squelchedI'll quote Dr. Joesph Sonnabend, Founder, of the AIDS Medical Foundation.His is typical of how opposition to the AIDS hypothesis was dealt with.Dr. Sonnabend writes: "...I tried to show that HTLV-1 (HIV) was notinvolved in AIDS, all the journals refused to publish it." After twentyone years of intensive research, not one clinically-relevant retrovirushas ever been discovered, and by scientific standards HIV is no exception.You also have to understand that when Maragaret Heckler, head of Healthand Humane Services, adopted HIV as the cause of AIDS, basically all institutionswhich rely on federal government funding or grands had to go along andcooperate or face extinction. HHS is the paymaster for all health departmentsand agencies. This includes the National Institutes of Health. Q. What about Kimberly Bergails, and Magic Johnson? A. Kimberly Bergalis would still be alive today is she were not givenAZT. Magic Johnson is probably as healthy today as he ever was and willcontinue to live a long and happy life so long as he does not take AZTor any other deadly drug. Q. Why did you inoculate yourself with the blood of an HIV positivehemophiliac? A. Because I can no longer stand by and watch the profession I love,be deceitfully used to commit murder by following the Gallo HIV/AIDS' deathbanner. I have vowed that if its is necessary I will repeat the processof sticking myself with the blood of an HIV positive person on televisionin every city in the world until this genocide stops. Q. Dr. Willner in "Deadly Deception" you say AZT is one ofthe chief causes of AIDS, can you elaborate further for our readers? A. Yes, and again I will begin by quoting Dr. Peter Duesberg: "AZTis A Random Killer Of Infected And Non Infected Cells. AZT cannot discriminateamong them. It kills T-cells; B-cells; red cells, it kills all cells. AZTis a chain terminator of DNA synthesis of all cells-no exceptions. It wipesout everything. In the long run it can only lead to death of the organism-andthe cemetery. AZT is a certain killer! Who will be responsible for thedeath of patients (some 200,000 now being treated with AZT and countlessthousands who have already died from it in the past decade) that resultsfrom AZT therapy - pharmacological homicide?" The makers of AZT claim that "it increases the quality of life."Yet, all one needs do is read the package insert that comes along withAZT and you will learn the truth. The side effects of AZT as listed on its own package inserts are: Cancer(lymphomas), Hepatitis, Dementia, Mania (madness, frenzy), Seizures (epileptic),Anxiety, Anemia, Leukopenia, (standard laboratory evidence of immune suppression),Impotence, Severe Nausea, Chest Pain, Insomnia, Ataxia (loss of balance),Depression, Muscle Atrophy (wasting) and this is only half of the deathsentence list of side effects that AZT causes. Does this sound like AZTadds to the quality of life to you or does it sound like what it reallyis-AIDS! Q. Are there other causes of AIDS? A. Yes, there are and I explain each and every known cause of AIDS ingreat detail in my book, and may I add, not one of them is sexually transmittedor HIV related. Q. What can a person suffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency do? A. There are actually many things a person with AIDS can do if thereis enough time and in most cases there is. The first and most importantthing is to get off any type of immune suppressive drug whether it be recreational,prescription or over the counter immediately. Secondly, don't be connedinto taking AZT or any other last minuet, last chance at life. Thirdly,stop believing the lie that you are going to die. Finally get and reada copy of my book "Deadly Deception" as soon as possible. Itcontains the information you need to strengthen your immune system. Followwhat it tells you and you will probably be OK. This concluded my interview with Dr. WIllner. I must admit that beforeI read "Deadly Deception": The Proof That Sex And HIV AbsolutelyDo Not Cause AIDS, I too was skeptical. I believed what everyone else believedthat HIV caused AIDS, that HIV is sexually transmitted, that if you haveHIV you will eventually die of AIDS. In "Deadly Deception" Dr. Willner proves the AIDS hypothesisis totally fraudulent. Its perpetrators are guilty of criminal fraud andmurder. The HIV virus does not and could not possible cause AIDS or any seriousdisease for that matter. AIDS is not transmitted sexually nor is it contagious by any method! Backed by scientific and factual proof you will learn the truth: What the real causes of AIDS are and how to totally avoid them. How the HIV test can be positive because of having a simple "Flu"vaccination, the measles or many other common infections! Why AIDS is not an epidemic but a total myth based on false projectionsdisproved by time and the statistics. In the United States, more people die each year overdosing on sleepingpills than die from AIDS! Why the homosexual community erroneously became identified as AIDS carriers. Why AIDS is a syndrome transmittable disease. Why 25 to 30 diseases were, for the first time in recorded history,lumped together under a new name (AIDS) to give the appearance of an epidemic! Acquired Immune Deficiency is not new; its cause have been known andwritten about in medical books for almost seventy years. On October 3, 1993, the London Times headline read, "African Aids'a myth'". Inside, across two pages, the headline screamed, "ThePlague That Never Was", yet this story which exposes the AIDS mythin Africa has not even been mentioned in the mainstream U.S. press...Why? More than 500 of the world's leading scientists have challenged theAIDS hypothesis - they are being silenced, slandered and ignored...Why? The Answers are all in "Deadly Deception", the nearly 300page hard cover book! "Deadly Deception" blows the lid off the entire AIDS fraud.It names those responsible. It takes every argument you have ever heardabout the relationship between HIV, sex and AIDS and tears them to shredsby exposing the lies to the bright light of truth. Dr. Willner writes in clear, easy to understand language that is bothentertaining and enlightening. You won't be able to put this book down.After you read it you will never fear AIDS again, your eyes however, willforever be opened to how easy it is for us all to be duped by half truths,lies, prejudice, fear and by unscrupulous, power and money hungry peoplewho think they can literally get away with murder in the name of science. As a closing note; two AIDS researchers in Europe have already beenfound guilty of fraud. An independent study has proven AZT to be 1000 times more toxic to humancells than was originally claimed. There is currently a class action suite in England against the makersof AZT by the families of its victims. I URGE each and everyone of you to get a copy of Dr. Willner's new book:"Deadly Deception":The Proof That Sex And HIV Absolutely Do NOtCause AIDS. You can order it now.

Where self-training neural net and artificialintelligence data search systems scan for undesirable lifestyles and targetyou for automatic monitoring. Personal privacy was once considered the most sacred of our constitutionalrights; agencies were severely limited by law. All that's about to changedrastically thanks to a deadly combination of extremely sophisticated surveillancetechnology, ubiquitous digital information collection, and centralizedinteragency data exchange. Until recently the "supersecret" National Reconnaissance Organizationdid not exist-even though it has the largest budget of any intelligenceagency. They are responsible for the design, development and procurementof all US reconnaissance satellites and their continued management oncein orbit. Recently photos have surfaced in the press of its huge new complexbeing completed in Chantilly, Virginia. (Senator John Warner-Liz Taylor'sex-has described the one million square foot complex as a "Taj Mahal.")The NRO is eagerly implementing such technologies as ultra-high storagecapacity holographic films (allowing huge amounts of personal informationto be present on your ID card) and self-training artificial intelligencesoftware that tracks your personal data without human intervention. A newera of ubiquitous surveillance is dawning. A struggling military-industrial complex searching for new markets fortheir technologies has merged forces with a government obsessed with evertighter control over the activities of the general public. CongresswomanBarbara Jordan has proposed a "National Employment Verification Card"that will be required for all employment in the U.S. The card will, ofcourse, have a magnetic data strip, and altering or counterfeiting thecard will be a federal felony offense. There is a dedicated and aggressive effort underway to chart variousgenetic features as part of one's personal information set. The fed's goalis to have the ability to screen individuals for everything from behavioralcharacteristics to sexual orientation, based on genetic information embeddedin your personal (and required) National ID card. Biometric signature technologies have been developing apace. There iseven a technique available to translate human DNA into bar codes for efficientdigital transmission between agencies. Are these science fiction story lines or the ravings of a paranoid lunatic?I wish they were. As a former research engineer at Lawrence Livermore Labsand other government labs, I watched some of these mad schemes being hatched.This technology is on the street today or about to leave the labs and believeme, it goes way beyond Orwell's worst nightmares. Listen up and hunkerdown. A fundamental shift in the legal definition of personal privacy is occurringright now. A court-issued warant used to be a universal requirement forpersonal surveillance, such as phone tapping, observing physical papers,and probing financial or medical records. Now, in this new age of AI-drivenmonitoring and data tracking systems, there are no pesky people in theloop. A computer doesn't need to seek a court warrant to monitor every aspectof your private life. A self-training automated surveillance system doesn'tneed permission to observe your movements or communications. Total data tracking is already commonplace for financial institutionsand private security operations. Tomorrow, it will be commonplace for allof us. The technical elements of a massive surveillance engine are in place.It's just a matter of turning the key to fire it up. Let's examine theseelements and why you should be concerned. Universal Encryption Chip It sounds logical. The feds want to preserve privacy, so their storygoes, so they've announced that an encryption chip will go into all phonesand computers that they buy. But what do they really want in the long run? How about a government-issue encryption chip in all personal computersand communication devices? That way, the feds can deal with drug smugglers,terrorists, kiddie porn merchants, and other miscreants who use encodedmessages. Of course, they'd have to prevent tampering with the chip. In fact,the technology to do just that has already been developed at Sandia NationalLaboratory. Scientists there have developed an optical sensor that usesa powdered silicon optical absorption layer in an optical waveguide embeddedin a chip. A micro photodetector detects even the slightest intrusion intothe chip package by measuring a slight change in the photonic conductionthrough the waveguide. It can then send an alert via modem to a centralmonitoring system to notify an interested party that the device has beentampered with. Sandia is also developing a microchemical intrusion detectorthat would be sensitive to the chemical signature of human fingertips. Is this all part of some master plan, or what? In fact, in the near future, all encryption hardware and software willbe subject to federal registration/authorization. Possession of unauthorizedencryption/decryption capability will be punishable as a federal felony.In other words, if it doesn't have a handy back door for NSA snoops, itain't legal. We can further speculate that the feds will embed chips in all equipmentsold for use in data transmission, digital phone calls and all other frequencies.Note: all new phone systems wired and wireless will be digital in the nextthree years. Intelligent Video Nor would you know what's watching you. Security cameras are becomingstandard in corporate and government facilities. They may soon even berequired. Why? Ostensibly because they want to recover loses in case oftheft, keep insurance premiums down, monitor petulant employees and keepintruders out. But the new genre of video cameras now coming out of the labs do a lotmore than that. They're intelligent. They can recognize faces, motion,and other interesting characteristics. In fact, they behave a lot likea human eye, with intelligent preprocessor abilities. Intelligent cameras are needed because a security guard or cop can'tmonitor the dozens or hundreds of video cameras in a large facility (ordozens of satellite video surveillance channels). Intelligent cameras useartificial intelligence-based object and motion recognition. They scanfor what a trained security guard looks for: certain motions, clothing,faces; the presence of people in off-limits places. Instead of watching100 cameras, only a few at any time send pictures. A single guard or acomputer can deal with that. In face, a steady data stream from multiple intelligent cameras canbe uploaded to computerized monitoring facilities anywhere, coupled withother automated observation systems. The next big thing in intelligent cameras will be "contentaddressable"imagery. That means they'll automatically detect the content of sophisticatedpatterns, like a specific person's face by matching it against a digital"wanted" poster, say. New software that can even run on chappersonal computers makes that possible. MatchMaker from Iterated Systems(Norcross, GA), for example, uses a fractal algorithm that converts imagedata into mathematical form, automatically recognizing and categorizingrealtime "targets" untouched by human hands and tied into a centralizedmonitoring facility! A related technology called focal plane array sensors (FPA) discriminatesobjects at just about any distance. FPA makes it possible to use neuromorphicsensors, modeled biologically on the human eye, which are built into acamera to recognize a person or object by "associative cognition." CArver Mead at Cal Tech has designed a broad-spectrum "human-eye"sensor using FPAs and 3D artificial neural network processors. To provethe viability of such concepts, Raytheon, under contract with the GuidedInterceptor Branch of the Air Force at Elgin AFB, has developed "smarteyes" using FPAs for recognizing objects in flight, thus relievingthe pilot of visual target recognition tasks while in a high-pressure combatsituation. This technology is inexpensive, easily reproducible, and will be partof standard equipment for fully automated, on-site visual and infraredsurveillance in the near future. Langley Research Center (Hampton, VA) in conjunction with TeleroboticsInternational (Knoxville, TN) is taking a step further. They're developingan advanced surveillance camera system that's even more intelligent: ituses self aiming and analyzes motion or other parameters. A fisheye sphericallens views a very wide field of vision while a self-contained image processingsubsystem tracks several moving targets at once in real time. Video forsuspect targets can be transmitted in real time to a security center. These smart cameras are also getting incredibly tiny and low cost. TheImputer from VLSI Vision Ltd. (Edinburgh, Scotland) is a credit card-sizeddevice that fits in the palm of your hand. It consists of a complete CCDvideo camera mounted on a circuit board plus an on-board DSP (digital signalprocessing) coprocessor for realtime image enhancement, feature detection,correlation and convolution (for fast analysis on the fly), and even anoptional library of pre-stored feature data so that the camera can independentlyrecognize a specific face or other security-oriented data. It can alsodownload its captured visual data via telephone line to a data collectionand processing facility. With everything on a few chips, intelligent cameras can now be mass-manufacturedlike pocket radios. No need for security personnel-they can be linked toa computer surveillance monitoring and data base system. This is where it gets really insidious. When the technology becomesso cheap, tiny, and powerful, and no guards are needed, they can sprinklethese things around like corn chips...secretly putting them on every streetcorner, in every waiting room, office, wherever. Keep smiling, because you'll never know when you're on candid camera.And hey, relax, they've just captured your surfaces. BIOMETRICS Where it really starts to get hairy is when we enter the brave new worldof Biometrics. Biometrics is the process of gathering biological informationand converting it into data that can be uploaded into automated systemsfor identifying you. They can use your fingerprint (via automated fingerprint identificationsystems), retinal scan, voice or other personal signatures. Miros of Wellesley,MA has recently introduced a system called Face-to-Face, using neural nets,that is particularly insidious. Unlike fingerprint or palm recognition,it identifies your face "non-intrusively" (that's technospeakfor surreptitiously) with 99% recognition. It can even identify your facewhen you add glasses or change your hairstyle. There are biometric service bureaus like TRW that provide immediateaccess to personal dossier information to prisons, banks, military bases,research facilities, pharmaceutical companies, etc. The client simply installsa retinal scanner or other device and transmits your image to a servicebureau, which sends back your complete dossier. This is big business forthese service bureaus. We're talking billions in government and corporatecontracts. What's next? We can expect intelligent scanning systems will be installedin supermarket checkout lines, lobbies, airports, stores, ATM sites, andso on in the near future. Known shoplifters will be tracked from the timethey walk into the store. There'll be a cordon sanitaire around playgroundsand day care centers. What happens when the FBI ties its fingerprint verification system atits National Criminal Information Center, with its library of over 250,000fingerprints, into the national health care card system, employment IDcard, IRS, and just about everything else? If the FBI has you listed as a radical or some other species of undesirable,will they be automatically notified whenever you appear at a doctor's office?Every time you use an ATM? What about when you buy a naughty magazine orsubscribe to a "politically incorrect" publication? Where doesthis stuff stop? Satellite Surveillance It doesn't. You image may be up for sale right now. Ten-meter resolutionsatellite images of those strange weeds in your back yard are availableto any buyer from the French company SPOT Image of Reston, Virginia. Even sharper images are available. Spy satellite images at two metersresolution are now available from World Map. About 30 other countries-particularlyGermany, Israel, and China-are planning to launch satellite surveillancesystems. Producers of satellite and surveillance equipment and large databaseprocessing services like TRW have huge financial stakes in this $8 billionmarket. They've put massive pressure on the CIA and DoD to loosen up controlof satellite surveillance technology. Three of them-Lockheed, Orbital Sciences(whichis launching Eyeglass), and World View-are launching satellites with resolutionsfrom one to three meters by 1997. Another recently-formed U.S. company, Teledesic, is planning a vast$9 billion global communication system using 840 geosynchronous orbit satellites,scheduled for 2001. There would be no single area on the planet that couldnot be "seen" on demand, and more importantly, virtually alldigital communications could be linked through this universal transpondersystem. Suddenly we're just one step from a universal monitoring system. Thesatellites could conceivably serve as platforms for multi-spectra, on-demand,visual and IR surveillance of any coordinate on the planetary surface.Note: both founders of Teledesic, Bill Gates and Craig McCaw, declinedto be interviewed by MONDO on this topic. ROBOT SPIES Unmanned robotic devices (airborne and land-based) are now here thatcan observe an individual or dwelling day or night from a distance. Theycan also monitor communications (using RF signatures) over a broad spectrumof frequencies. They can be activated from a distant control center thousandsof miles away from the target; and surveillance data can be collected andexamined in real time via satellite link. For example, there's the SR2 Security Robot System from CybermotionInc. of Roanoke, Virginia. Designed to "replace human security personnel,"the SR2 patrols a region of up 15 square miles for 12 hour shifts (betweencharges), using ultrasonic, optical, and infrared sensors plus onboard"fuzzy logic" to navigate around complex obstacles and interpretdata. An operator at a remote site controls and interacts with a groupof these robots via bidirectional RF data links. There's also NASA's High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) unmanned aircraft.HALE can stay airborne for days at a time, carrying CCD optical and infraredcamera systems. These lightweight stealth aircraft are flown by remotecontrol, using satellite data links to an operational command center thatcan be thousands of miles away. Perfect for kamikaze-style strikes. And the U.S. Navy is soliciting proposals to develop a robotic, flyableplatform for optical and infrared surveillance, designed for "riotcontrol, border surveillance, and personnel detection." A fuzzy logic based RF communications signal/signature analysis systemhas been solicited by the U.S. Navy. It will be able to recognize the contentof any transmitted signal from anywhere, regardless of spread spectrum,encryption, or other electronic signal countermeasures. Commercial applicationscited in the solicitation are "law enforcement, surveillance, druginterdiction, illegal immigrant control, etc." Real time monitoring by these robotic devices can be remotely activatedfrom anywhere. No search warrants, no court authorizations. MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTERS AND OPTICAL STORAGE All these surveillance systems generate massive amounts of information.Until recently this would have been impractical for millions of people. Currently, massive optical data storage technologies coupled with extremelypowerful, massively parallel processing computers are capable of very high-volumedata storage and very high-speed data analysis. The Department of Commerce is financing a joint project with TamarackStorage Devices to develop a photorefractive holographic data storage systemcapable of handling hundreds of terabytes (that's 10^12thpower bytes) ofdata for extremely large database processing operations. This is exactlythe type of information storage/processing capability required for a nationwidepopulation monitoring system. Thinking Machines Inc., of Cambridge, MAhas recently announced a massively parallel processing supercomputer, theCM-5, specifically designed for extremely huge data base processing applications.It can access an astonishing 3.2 terabytes of data with a bandwidth ofup to 4.2 gigabytes per second, distributed over a network of 16,000 processingnodes that can be located anywhere. A handful of these systems can maintain an up-to-date population monitoring/dataprocessing system for the entire country. What do you think is going to be in that secret $350 million NationalReconnaissance Organization (NRO) building in CHantilly, VA? Hint: They'renot watching Russia any more. NEURAL NETS AND AI Of course, all these operations normally require huge staffs of trainedexperts. That's where neural nets and artificial intelligence come in.Neural net processing systems can search for "behavioral tendencies"within a database and automatically flag certain individuals for surveillanceand "attention" from interested enforcement agencies, employers,political researchers, etc. This is a rung up from knowbots and gobots. A good example is the ominous Origin system (the U.S. base is Tampa,FL), a worldwide realtime, intelligent vision processing and networkingdatabase system designed for "intelligent security database monitoringand observation" for law enforcement and government agencies. It usedIterated Systems' Matchmaker software running on a global computer network.A surveillance camera or biometric sensor anywhere can feed signals intothe network and get back a name of the person in seconds. HNC's (San Diego, CA) DataBase Mining Workstation is a dedicated neuralnetwork processing engine designed to look for "interesting"data sets on its own. The user "trains" the system for topicsor features of interest. Once effectively trained, the system automaticallytracks anything (or anyone) that gets its attention and draws its own conclusions. HNC also sells the Falcon neural net credit card "fraud and abuse"detection system. It automatically "learns" about unusual spendinghabits and related behavioral feature sets. Clients for this system includeAT&T, Colonial National Bank, Eurocard Netherlands, First USA Bank,Household Credit Services, and Wells Fargo Bank. HNC is also working oncredit risk evaluation, bankruptcy potential, and other forms of financialactivity pattern recognition. Again, no need for pesky humans who can be held accountable for violationof privacy. "The machine did it!" Once this becomes routine,current legally-defined barriers to privacy disappear totally. AUTOMATED VOICE RECOGNITION In the good old days, they had to attach electronic clips to your phoneand get court authorization. Not so today. Let's say you're on a list somewhere based on your politics, reading,or drug, or sexual habits. Zap: you're suddenly on a priority list forsurveillance. You make a call and your voice matches the profile. The systemstarts to listen in to your vocal communications in real time. The voicedata can then be digitized, stored, and added to your surveillance dossierby the computer. If you've seen the movie Clear and Present Danger, you know how easilyintelligence agencies monitor cellular phone calls, satellite phone calls,and anything else that's broadcast. (It's actually easy for anyone to monitorcellular calls with a scanner covering 870 to 896 MHz or a UHF TV receivertuned to channels 80 to 83 and a good UHF antenna.) Then they digitizespeech signals and convert them into text data, which can then be processedto search for specific words or phrases. All this will be a lot easier when the telephone companies introduceAsynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) communications in a few years. Virtuallyall communications, including data transmission and business and personalphone calls will be routed through the same universal communication channel,making the job of listening in much easier. Dialogic Corp. (Parsippany, NJ) is developing "second generation"modular telephone call-processing and automated speech recognition systemhardware and software. Uses include online automatic keyword and phraserecognition. That is, any word or word combination that may be "interesting"to an automated listening system can cue automated storage of an entireconversation for further analysis. The Sprint voice-activated phone card is already in use. But severalcorporations including TRW have already taken it a step further. They cananalyze and store voice signatures for every telephone caller in the countryfor a much larger market: voice recognition for phone credit card verificationand voice-triggered ID security systems. Essentially, you'll be forcedto use voice ID or no credit or access. It's a simple matter to adapt thiskind of technology for a national tracking system. The U.S. Navy wants to take it a step further. As evidenced by its recentFY 94 "Global Surveillance and Communications" technology solicitations(as per the SBIR development funding program), they are developing a "robustsignal processing of speech" capability with "voice communicationscountermeasures and counter-countermeasures" as part of a comprehensive,speech recognition and processing system. Sun Microsystems workstations include a microphone and speech recognitionchip. A recent security alert from the Computer Emergency Response Teamat Carnegie Mellon University disclosed that the workstations had beenpre-programmed with a "world readable" status feature. That meansany of these networked workstations could in fact serve as a remotely-monitoredmicrophone. A back door has already been built into this workstation. Thatmeans anyone can activate the microphone to listen in remotely from anywherein the world. DESKTOP NSA But all this massive power is not limited to giant computer centers.Even desktop computers are now becoming powerful enough to handle massiveamounts of intelligence information. Adaptive Solutions Inc. (Beaverton, OR) sells a $7000 CNAPS/PC boardthat converts a 486 or Pentium computer into a massively parallel processingengine. The boards, each of which contains 128 processors, perform 2.56billion multiply/accumulate operations per second. This means a 1000 timesperformance improvement in pattern recognition. Companies are turning these powerful new surveillance tools on theirown people too. For example, Microsoft has a secret project to monitorall keystrokes of its personnel to "improve efficiency" usingneural net and artificial intelligence software. And Edify Corp. (SantaClara, CA) is supplying "intelligent agent" software to BellSouthCommunications Systems (Roanoke, VA). It will be built into BellSouth'sElectronic Workforce software. Its customers will use it for interactivevoice response and recognition, personnel and client workforce screening,efficiency monitoring, and workflow automation. PROBATION NATION This is NOT another paranoid "1984" scenario based on somefuturistic fantasy. For the first time in history, the technology is availableto design and implement such a ubiquitous surveillance/monitoring system.This crisis climate created by the media-particularly television "newsmagazines"-is being used to mandate this horror. The political will to do this is here and it is being touted as an acceptablesolution to such problems as crime and illegal immigrants. The generalpublic is not even remotely familiar with the technical details of howsuch a repressive system could be implemented and won't wake up until they'revirtual prisoners in a totally automated Surveillance Society.

The Total Surveillance State taking shape under his leadership appearsto have three broad components: * Automatic spying on all public and private communications networks. * Automatic "profiling" of all citizens by computer: gatherall available details-health, consumer habits, political activites, etc. * Digital identity and social control mechanisms, in particular, SmartCards featuring ultra-dense integrated circuitry and trackable Clipper-chipencryption. A Smart Card is literally a computer on a credit card, complete withlarge amounts of digital storage, and even potential wireless communicationscapabilities. Once Smart Cards and digital cash come into wide use, thereis no doubt that this system can be designed to function with ruthlesseffectiveness. The information sciences-and the touted "Information Superhighway"-arebeing perveted into a Total Surveillance State. This year, for example,numerous federal agencies suddenly announced virtually complete plans torestrict access to their services to Smart Cards only. CLIPPER: THE "SNITCH CHIP" Everybody needs papers in a police state. Ironically, the automatedGestapo no longer needs to issue them. Instead computer-controlled cardsand high-speed computers will monitor special "snitch-chips"built into household appliances like telephones and cable boxes. Ja Wohl!The Automatic Gestapo. Recently some press reports contended that the Clipper chip is "dead."I'll let Janet Reno answer that one (7/22/94): "We are working withindustry to develop the same capability [Clipper-style surveillance] fordata networks that Clipper provides for voice networks." I would hardlycall that "backing away." Clipper chips and Clipper-like software snooping schemes are definitelynot dead. On the contrary, they are the very lynchpin of the automatedGestapo-for both surveillance and personal identification. President Clinton carefully avoided mentioning Clipper's planned identificationcapabilities when he personally announced the chip at a splashy Rose Gardenpress conference within weeks of assuming office. He claimed that the chipwas created by "government scientists" to "ensure personalprivacy" for telephone conversations. Beyond the smarmy assurances, there was another tipoff that somethingwas peculiar with Clipper: the chip processes information with blazingspeed. It has a bandwidth of 12 megabits per second. That's fast enoughto encrypt a video signal from a small slow-scan camera-perhaps in a videophone,or perhaps in other household appliances with high-speed communicationslinks. Your cable box, for instance. Ever since he announced it, Clinton has deftly moved the Clipper projectaround, from the NSA to the Justice Department, to the National Instituteof Science and Technology (NIST) and the Treasury Department. He is dodgingthe serious questions-and growing outrage-over the suspicious secret chip.So what did you expect of someone who didn't inhale? PROJECT TESSEREA: CLIPPER SLAVE BRACELETS Tesserea, classic fans, means "a piece of mosaic." In ancientRome, tessereae were also identity tags, which were given to soldiers andslaves. Slaves caught without them usually came to grief. Today, tesserea still means the same thing at the NSA and the out-of-the-limelightDefense Messaging Agency (DMA). For the past few years, these two secret-governmentbastions have collaborated to create Tesserea devices. These are computerizedSmart Cards with large amounts of flash memory capacity, somtimes prototypewireless communications devices-and an on-board "Capstone" chip. Capstone is Clipper's smart brother, sometimes called "Clipper2." It is the brains of Smart Cards. Each Capstone chip has a unique"digital signature" that identifies it (and its owner) to thescanning computers of the automatic Gestapo on the communications networks.In other words, whether you use your Tesserea card to claim disabilitybenefits or buy golf balls, every transaction will be duly recorded. There are some interesting angles to these latter-day slave bracelets.First of all, Tesserea cards were being tested at the DMA years ago-longbefore president Clinton's Clipper announcement. Another interesting factis the overall code name of the Tesserea project. The project is called"Mosaic." Someone has a classical education, it seems. Capstone Tesserea cards are being pushed hard by practically every agencyand department of Clinton's government. The pretexts seem almost endless.They range from tracking "childhood immunizations" by Donna Shalala'sDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to recommend "workpermits" and a "digital passport" created at the Immigration& Naturalization Service (INS). Other pretexts include "federal benefits delivery systems"proposed for the Social Security Administration and Veterans Administration,as well as planned nationwide authorities for distributing military pensions,food stamps, and other forms of public assistance. Then there's the infamous"Health Security Card" touted as part of the biggest cat's pawof all-"Health Care Reform." And lastly ther's the Postal Service's "U.S. Card," proposedas a no-bones-about-it universal identity card. A postal spokesman actuallyhyped the U.S. Card as a device to replace the "twenty million 'LittleBrothers'" waiting in the wings, from every federal agency under Clinton'scontrol. Each of these initiative comes complete with an oh-so-vaguely describednational distributed database. The sole exception is the U.S. Card, whichwill serve as a universal identifier requried for all integrated governmentdatabases. TROUBLE ON THE LINE: THE DIGITAL TELEPHONY ACT Want to start a police state? Control the telephone network. Build telephonebugs into all new buildings. Design it so you can turn them on wheneveryou like. "Every carrier must ensure that it's equipment allows for interceptionof a communication concurrent with the transmission and provide call identifyinginformation to a remote government facility. Manufactures and support serviceproviders mustl also assist by developing equipment and software with thesecapabilities. Providers have four years...to comply." -from the FBI'sproposed "Digital Telephony and Privacy Improvement Act of 1994." Read it and weep. In the tradition of Hoover, the FBI has been flacking in Congress forapproval of its "Digital Telephony and Privacy Improvement Act"of 1994. This proposed law would legalize a computerized universal surveillancesystem on the digital telephone network. That's right: The automatic Gestapo. From the rarified heights of the Jane Edgar Hoover Headquarters Building,FBI Director Freeh and Janet Reno are even offering to sweeten the deal.They'll pay telephone companies $500 Million (in tax payers dollars) tobuild the automatic Gestapo into their equipment. As if they had a choice. Then telephone subscribers will get stuck with the monthly bill formaintaining and expanding the system. And what a system. The FBI's prototype systems-"Smart Boxes" developed by BellSouth-are secret, unaccountable and virtually undetectable. They work byremote control and can automatically bug your house through the microphonesin your telephones. According to the specifications for Bell South's Smart Boxes, just oneof these wonderful gadgets can snoop on an entire residential neighborhood.The box offers America's secret police several different levels of surveillance,depending on the amount of interest in the subject. At the basic level the device is programmed to record all the phonenumbers the victim calls, and the phone numbers of everyone who calls thevictim. 64 kilobytes of storage is provided to store the compressed telephonedata. Every day, the box automatically sends this compressed log of phonenumbers to its master computer for storage and profiling. For industrial-strength surveillance, Smart Boxes can be programmedto record everything that passes over the digital phone line. Conversations,faxes, data calls and video. The box has its own high-speed line for sendingthese interceptions to its master computer-possibly thousands of milesaway. Another program option lets the automatic Gestapo give especially interestingvictims the full Congressional treatment: continuous, 24-hour monitoringof every room with a telephone. WITH ENOUGH SHOEBOXES... The technical lynchpin of this leviathan is the new generation of blindinglypowerful computers. These feature parallel procesor architectures and utilizeself-teaching AI software. They're already being deployed on the nation'sbusiness and financial networks. These systems can automatically snoopon financial transactions, create "profiles" of the people whomake the transactions, and store the information for later analysis. In particular, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), partof the Treasury Department headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, has createda system with enough computing power to scan all of the nation's interbanknetworks and profile money movements, cash transactions, and credit cardpurchases. FinCEN's scanning and profiling operation uses high-powered mainframe-typecomputers and works in near-real-time. It is also reported to rely on pattern-matchingAI software to identify neighborhoods-or people-with large amounts of cashor other tangible assets. Pretty impressive. Not long after Hitler gained power in Germany, his government startedgathering information on "undesirables." The Nazis were so bendon finding undesirables that they didn't stop at their own borders. Theyrecruited collaborators in other countries who contributed their undesirablesto the cause. Within 10 yeras, these undesirables were being rounded up througoutEurope. In France, Holland, Poland, Hungary, Aurtria-wherever the Naziswent, they were prepared with the names of their soon-to-be-victims. They arrested at least 15 million people. And they did it all with shoeboxesfull of notecards. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- - 9 - FLESH EATER KILLER BACTERIA'S GRISLY BODY COUNT Could This Disease Be Worse Than AIDS? Taken from HIGH SOCIETY (DEC 1994) by Gary Burdick When James Richter cut kis knee cleaning his garage on a Sunday morning,he noticed a rash forming around the bandage. After all, he was a healthy27-year-old man, an ex-Marine who'd never been sick a day in his life. But the thing kept spreading. Soon, his leg was throbbing and coveredwith ugly red blisters. When the skin started turning black, he let hiswife drive him to the hospital. While he was waiting in the Emergency Room,he began feeling nauseous and dizzy. Interns at the souther Californiahospital cut away the dead skin and disinfected the wound. By evening, Richter was running a high fever and vomiting. Even morphinecouldn't revieve the excruciating pain. At midnight, his leg was amputatedand he was pumped full of penicillin in a desperate attempt to stop theinfection. Nothing worked. While his family and physicians looked on helplessly,the disease tunneled beneath his skin, devouring his groin and bladder.By morning, his left kidney had shut down and there was nothing left ofhis stomach. He died at 10 a.m, less than a day after he'd cut himselfon the knee. "It was right out of a science-fiction movie," saidhis brother-in-law, Jim Dentoni, "like some creature from outer spaceate him alive." John Richter succumbed to a disease that destroys flesh like high poweredacid-and can kill within hours. In recent months, the deadly germ has sweptacross the globe, leaving behind a trail of death, causing more terrorthan any scourage since the Black Plague. And there are more reports of this disease striking every day. Couldthis plague become the next AIDS? There are more than 80 different strainsof invasive Grade A beta streptococcus, the group of bacteria that causethe disease. One hundred million of these tiny invaders can fit on thehead of a pin. They live in the throat, nasal passages, and skind of about10 to 20 percent o fthe population, and are passed from one person to anotherduring a kiss or when someone sneezes or coughs. But the bacterium causelittle or no symptoms in most of us. "Exposed to the same strep germ,one kid in a family may get off lightly with strep throat, while anotherchild in the same house may have a severe complication," explainedDr. Stan Kondraki of the New York State Department of Health. Group A strep played a starring role in the repeated outbreaks of rheumaticfever that killed thousands of children each year in the first half ofthis century. In recent years, less overcrowded conditions and the useof antibiotics have ketp the disease at bay. Some physicians even calledthe waning plague of rheumatic fever a "vanishing disease in suburbia." However, in the mid-1980s, doctors began seeing new and more lethalkinds of strep A infections. One variety of the disease, known as toxicshock-like syndrome (TSLS), starts as a simple cold and quickly blossomsintoa deadly form of pneumonia. TSLS made headlines around the world severalyears ago when it reportedly claimed Sesame Street Muppeteer Jim Henson. The infection becomes even nastier when it invades the bloodstream.The bacterium produce toxins that gobble up human tissue at the rate ofan inch an hour. One condition, known as necrotizing fasciitis, eats awayat flesh, while another pyomyositis, consumes muscle. Both forms causehigh fever, severe pain, low blood pressure, vomiting, and diarrhea. Patientsusually die of heart of respiratory failure when what's left of their organsshut down. Those luck enough to survive the diesase are often horriblydisfigured and may need years of cosmetic surgery and psychiatric counseling. "This is much worse than syphilis ever was," insists becterialpathogenesis expert Alice Prince of Columbia. Presbyterian Medical Center."Even before penicillin, syphilis ate through the tissue really slowly.It took a long time to kill you. But necrotizing fasciitis grows rightbefore your eyes." Chicago Registered Nurse Lois Shane calls the gangrene-likecondition "the most frightening thing I've seen in over 30 years ofnursing." Despite the seriousness of the disease, it escaped public attentionuntil last spring, when the British press began reporting a number of peoplewho'd been infected by a "mysterious flesh-eating bug." JamesAnderson, 57, of Andover, Hampshire, died within hours of being admittedto a hospital as the bacterium chewed up his shoulder and upper arms. GillianWilkinson, a 48-year-old school teacher, developed necrotizing fasciitisafter an ankle infection suddenly ulcerated. "We thought she had theflu-she was shaking and had a temperature," said her husband, Frank."Then the flesh on her ankle went black and died. It was so rapidit wasn't true." By cutting away large areas of dead flesh from herstomach and groin, surgeons managed to save Roseann Millar, 41, a nursewho became infected after undergoing a hysterctomy. She had to have fiveoperations and extensive plastic surgery in order to hide the scars. "Ihave lived through everyone's worst nightmare," she told reporters,"watching something eat my body." At first, it was believed the disease only struck those patients who'drecently had surgery, or some type of skin wound, or suffered from an immunedisorder. Doctors were baffled by the case of Terry Bowden, a healthy 34-year-oldmanual laborer. Short after cooking breakfast for his family, Bowden beganto experience flu-like symptoms. A few hours later, he developed pyomyositis,which began gnawing at the muscles in his leg. "He said the pain waslike something was going to explode in his leg," recalled his wife,Christine. Despite emergency surgery, the father of four died the nextday. "He was strong as an ox, never ill," said his widow. "Onemoment he was fine, and then I'd lost him." Brian Bounds, a young plumber from Wales, was taken to the hospitalcomplaining of leg pains, believing he had strained a leg muscle. He toodied suddenly of the infection, although he had no wound or previous illness.Siad Lorraine Black, his sister, "It was terrible. Brian was therewith us one day and just gone the next. The speed of this is just horrifying."Even doctors are helpless against the diesase. Dr. David Somervell, a retiredGP, had his leg amputated after a two-month life-and-death battle withthe infection. "He became seriously ill too quickly to diagnose whatwas causing it," explained his wife, Margaret. "How he got itis a mystery. It just started in his leg and began spreading." In the past year, the bizarre disease has also survaced in Scandinavia,Australia, East Germany, Canada, and New Zealand, as well as in the UnitedStates. The bacterium left a Maryland woman with out a face, and consumedevery bit of skin and muscle covering the abdominal wall of a kindergarten-ageboy from New York. Thirty infants in a California hospital were infectedwith toxic strep through smallpox lesions on their skin. Three of the childrenlater died of necrotizing fasciitis. Meanwhile, doctors in Norwalk, Connecticut, were forced to amputatethe arm of a 30-year-old man who was stricken with the disease after cuttinghis elbow. In Pompano Beach, Florida, 37-year-old Steven Hillman awokein the middle of the night in such pain that "it felt like a hot brandingiorn was put on my butt." Within hours, a small pimple on his buttocksgrew into a nasty boil and then mushroomed into a huge, blistering infection."If I hadn't come to the hospital when I did, my doctors told me thatfive hours later my wife might have found a corpse in our bed," agrateful Hillman recalled. Florence Torburg, a Long Island woman whose husband developed a monstrousrash on his back, compared his wound to something out of Jaws. "Itlooks like a shark took a great bigt bite out of him." An elderlyGreenwich Village woman died in agony last May soon after being admittedto a New York hospital. "One day she was battling what seemed to bea bad cold," said a close relative. "Later that week she wasin the hospital fighting for her life. She was in so much pain. Every timethey thought they had licked it, it appeared somewhere else." A recentstudy in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that 20 patientsin one hospital caught the horrifying disease after being infected by surgeonsand nurses who carried Strep A bacteria in their noses and other body cavities. As reports of new cases continued to mount, terrified people on bothsides of the Atlantic rushed to emergency rooms. "We must have seena hundred people last week who thought they were dying of necrotizing fasciitis,"remarked Dr. Miles Jenkins, a resident at one of Miami's largest publichospitals. "Most of them had insect bites, or were having bad hairdays." Meanwhile, medical experts tried to reassure the public. "Thisis a very rare manifestation of strepococcus A, and people should knowthat it is highly unlikely that a healthy individual will get sick fromthis," explained microbiologist Dr. Henery Isenberg. "It's nota highly infectious disease running rampant through the United States,"insisted strep researcher Vincent Fischetti. The U.S. Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention announced that the number of cases of necrotizingfasciitis reported during 1993, approximately 2,000, was well within normallimits. "You have twice as good a chance of dying in a car accident,"said a spokesman for the agency. However, Dr. Leslie Speyer, a bacteriologist who has studied necrotizingfasciitis, says the condition is definately on the rise and becoming morelethal. This respected health care professional believes the medical communityis understating the danger in order to prevent public panic. "Howcan the Centers for Disease Control tell us there is no apparent increasein the number of cases when Strep A is not even reportable?" Speyerasks. Dr. Speyer says the widespread use of antibiotics has created a newstrain of streptococcus Type A bacteria that produced a far more deadlytoxin. "It's constantly change, learning new tricks." Speyer's colleagues agree. "There's definately an increase in seriousstrep A infections," reports Dr. Alice Prince. Rosemary Roberts, M.D,an offical of the Food and Drug Administration, says, "We're seeingmore invasive strains of Group A strep that are making people much sickermore quickly." Dr. Arthur Yee, of Norwalk HOspital in Connecticut,warns that the Strep A strain "could be mutating" and that manymore patients might die from the debilitating disease in the near future. Bowing to public pressure, the Centers for Disease Control announcedlast May that it will begin tracking the infection for the first time.The World Health Organization, an agency of the United Nations, is planningto establish a network of surveillance centers that would provide specialistsaround the globe with advice on how to recognize and treat the disease.Researchers have come up with a new test using silicon chips that enablesdoctors to tell within minutes whether a patient is carrying group A streptococcusgerms. But it may already be too late to stop the spread of the murderous disease.French doctors studying an outbreak of necrotizing fasciitis in the Brusselsare recently discovered a strain of toxic strep that seem to be immuneto all forms of antibiotics. There is even more to this story. Most frighteningly, Strep A isn'tthe only type of bacteria that can devous flesh and msucle. "Thereare a number of different viruses that can cause the condition. Unfortunatelywe dcon't know much about them yet," explains a worried Dr. Speyer."You hate to sound like an alarmists. But unless we start taking thisdisease seriously, we're going to end up with a world wide scourge that'sgoing to make the AIDS epidemic look like the common cold." WATCH THAT ITCH Here are a few facts about this very deadly disease. Pay attention ifyou want to be around to read the next issue of UMF MAG: * The elderly, and those who have recently had operations seem to bethe most likely to become infected. Also, those who already have otherillnesses, like diabetes, high blood pressure, poor circulation, or someimmune disorder, are vulnerable. However, virtually everyone is at risk.Keep all cuts and wounds, no matter how small, clean and bandaged. Watchfor any sudden change in the size or shape of a rash or blister. Remember,there's no way to completely guard against this kind of disease. It cancome out of nowhere. "It's like being struck by lighting. There'slittle you can do to avoid it," warns Dr. John Flaherty of the Universityof Chicago Medical Center. * The first signs of the killer bacteria include reddened and inflamedskin, possibly with blistering, fever, severe pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.If you have any of these symptoms, don't be macho. Hey, we're talking aboutsomething that can chomp on your flesh here. Get to a hospital fast! Physicianshave found that nutritional support helps combat the disease. So whileyou're on your way, try to eat foods high in protein and calories. * When you get to the hospital, don't be shy. The interns at most emergencyrooms don't have enough experience to recognize the disease immediately.They're not likely to admit someone with a rash and a sore throat aheadof a stabbing victim or someone with a gunshot wound. If you think you'vebeen infected by flesh-eating bacteria, let the medical staff know aboutit. "There's nothing wrong with a patient suggesting a diagnosis,"explains Dr. Alice Prince.

G. Gordon Liddy: BATF's Worst Nightmare taken from GUN NEWS Digest / Spring 1995 supplied by The P/\NTHER/UMF The meteoric rise of the "G. Gordon Liddy Show" is one ofnetwork radio's most amazing success stories. But it's also the Bureauof Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' worst nightmare. Hardly a weekday goes by that Liddy doesn't blast the BATF as a bunchof incompetent boobs, would-be Navy SEALS who wage war on the Americanpeople. He has labeled the killings of the Branch Davidians at Waco, TX,as simple murder and made no secret of his disdain for BATF agents. What makes these remarks all the more telling is that Liddy was in chargeof trying to clean up some of BATF's messes back in the Nixon Administration. Liddy's involvement in the Watergate affair made his name a householdword-and landed him five years in prison for steadfastly refusing to implicateothers. Much of that time was spend in maximum security with 106 days insolitary confinement. President Carter finally pardoned him "in theinterests of justice." Since then you may have seen Liddy as an actor in the movies and ontelevision. He likes to kid that his wife says he usually plays the "badguy" because that way it really doesn't require any acting. He alsohas authored three best selling books and numerous magazine articles andis editor-in-chief of The Liddy Letter, a monthly newsletter. But it is the practically overnight huge success of his radio talk showthat has propelled Liddy's name into the headlines in a way that it hasnot been since Nixon was in the White House. Liddy's program began on one radio station - WJFK in Washington, DC- in February 1992 and immediately shot to the top of the Washington ratings.In April 1993 the "G. Gordon Liddy Show" was launched as a nationallysyndicated radio program and awed the industry as the fastest talk showlaunch in history, picking up 100 affiliates in as many days. That numberhas hit more than 220 stations by now and is still rising. The reason for his success is obvious. He approached the hot topicsaddressed on his program in a frank, outspoken manner; gives callers whodisagree a chance to voice their opinions without ridicule; and displaysa keen sense of humor-such as referring to The Washington Post as The WashingtonBleep, as if its real name is too obscene to say on radio. In short, Liddycomes across as more in love with life and ideas than himself. One thing he clearly is not in love with is the BATF. When I noted thathis dislike of BATF clearly predates the Waco incident, Liddy replied,"That's because when I arrived in Washington in '69 as a special assistantto the Secretary of the Treasury, I had duties in the area of gun control. "I was actually under the assistant secretary (for enforcement)Gene Rossides, at the time. Gene didn't know which end of the tube a roundcame out of. He was a city boy from New York. I took care of all that forhim. "The first thing I knew we were terribly embarrassed by the Bureauof Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. There was the Ken Bellew incident (theshooting of an innocent gunowner), and it just went downhill from there. "BATF had made this motion picture on the Gun Control Act of 1968that was the most ridiculous thing that I had ever seen. We tried to roundup every copy of that thing that we could and destroy it because it wasa distortion of the law. It also was quite anti-gun." "Then there was the famous incident after I was the primary authorof the Explosives Control Act," Liddy added. "That was givento the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to administer. "They said, 'All right, we're going to have a big press do.' "They had gotten a brand new scientific van-sort of a mobile laboratory.They said, 'You go down there where they are going to blow up an outhouseor something. Life magazine and everybody is going to be down there. They'regoing to film it.' "And I said, 'Why do I have to go down there?' "They said, 'Well, they might have some question on the law. Youwrote the law, so you should down there and just field those questions.' "So I went down there, and I was just hanging out by the van becauseI didn't want any part of blowing up the outhouse. I figured this crewwould probably blow me up-and themselves by mistake. "They came to get the van and said, 'We're going to take the van.' "I said, 'Where do you think you are going to go with that?' "They said, 'We're going to go down there with the press and they'regoing to film the thing.' "I said, 'No you're not.' "They said,'Why not?' "I said, 'Well, look at the side of it.' "They had just put their big logo on there -Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms; and they had misspelled 'firearms.' And I didn'twant to embarrass the Treasury further." When asked if he had caught any flak for urging people not to obey gunlaws that violate their Second Amendment rights, Liddy responded, "Anoccasional person will disagree with me. But that's it. Whatever flak couldI catch?" "It's a free country. They can't come and take my guns away. Idon't have any. (As a convicted felon, he is not allowed to own any firearms.) "I don't have any guns, don't have any licenses. "And I goto gun shows, but I carefully don't buy anything. I just look." As any listener to his program knows, Liddy is equally critical of PresidentClinton. He says he knows why Clinton has shown such fervor in his driveto ban assault weapons. "Because Clinton - having proved a coward when it was his turnto serve - is unfamiliar with these weapons," Liddy said. "Hereally doesn't know what an assault weapon is." "The weapons look military. Anything that even looks military scaresa guy like Billy Boy Clinton. And so they demonize them because of theirmilitary appearance. "You and I know how you can get a good bolt-action high poweredrifle and you can go through a heck of a lot more than you can with a medium-powered,so called assault weapon. "And if you really want to do some damage, get yourself a cylinderbore 12-guage shotgun with 00 buck. But they wouldn't think of banningthat. "Oh, no. They're going to ban this other thing because it's gota bayonet lug, and we've got to stop all those drive-by bayonetings thatare happening." Liddy said he does expect the Republican controlled Congress to attemptto remove at least some of the anti-gun measures from the Crime Bill. But he added, "You've got to remember that Clinton - at least forthe next two years - is still the President of the United Sates. He canveto. "So I think the tactic probably will be to take out some of themore absurd stuff-like magazine capacity. At least, this would be my suggestion. "When they come across a bill that Clinton desperately needs andwants, just put that magazine capacity thing on it and say, 'Take it orleave it.'" There's no doubt in Liddy's mind that the Second Amendment guaranteesan individual right to keep and bear arms, despite the claims of groupslike the American Bar Association (ABA). "The American Bar Association on this-as on so many issues-is fullof beans. It is quite clear and the courts have held that it's an individualright... "The thing I like about the Founding Fathers is that they weremaster craftsmen with the English language. The reason they said 'shallnot be infringed' is that they were recognizing that as a free human being,one of the rights you are endowed with by your creator is to be armed."And they simply said we-in forming the government and having thisConstitution-will not infringe that. Period. It's not to be infringed.ANy anything that contravenes that contravenes the Constitution. "So I just tell people it's unconstitutional. You no more shouldobey that law than you should obey a law that says if you're black, goto the back of the bus." As a former Army artillery officer, special agent of the FBI, internationallawyer and a prosecutor, Liddy has more than a passing interest in firearms.He loves to shoot. And what does he shoot? "It's more a matter of what I don't shoot," Liddy said. "Ilike handguns the most. All the handguns I shoot are owned by Mrs. Liddy.I don't own any. I cannot legally do so in as much as I have felony convictionson my record. "But occasionally I'll go out to the range with Mrs. Liddy andwith other friends-private ranges usually, over in Virginia. We all shootand we interchange the various firearms that are owned by the people whoare attending the shoot. We all share and share alike. "I've fired everything. My favorite for target is the .38 wadcutter,mid-range, which I fire out of a Smith & Wesson Combat Masterpiecewith a target trigger and a target hammer spur-broad-hammer spur. It'sgot a ramp-front sight and adjustable rear sights. "Similarly with .357 Magnums. "A .45 Model 1911. That's the straight back that was carried inthe First World War by my grandfather, which is now owned by Mrs. Liddy. "A 9mm parabellum P-35 Browning Highpower, Mrs. Liddy has thatalso. "Similar pieces owned by friends, all the way up to fully automaticweapons legally owned by friends. "We fire high power rifles. "And shotguns. I like trap over skeet, but I've shot both. I haven'tdone this new sporting clays stuff. It's very popular. I keep hearing aboutit, but I have yet to shoot it. "I've fired-owned by various members of my family-AR-15's, H-Bars,the M-1A (which is the semi-automatic version of the M-14) and the Garand,which was the piece that I was trained with. When I went into the service,that was the standard issue. "I guess you would call it the main battle rifle now to try todistinguish it from an assault weapon. Of course, I understand a true assaultweapon is one capable of fully automatic fire with the flip of a selectorswitch. "You name it, and I've probably fired it." But will future generations of Americans be able to enjoy this samesport? Will Americans have a right to keep and bear arms 50 years fromnow? "Yes!" Liddy declares emphatically. "There's the Constitution.The only way you can take that away from us is to amend the Constitution. "What the American people have to do is keep control of Congress-especiallythe Senate, keep control of the White House, get the right Supreme Courtjustices in there and be as damm sure on this, as people are on other touchstoneissues. "If worse comes to worse, what you can do is you can restrict thejurisdiction on this issue of the Supreme Court. Congress has the rightto limit the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court." Liddy said the recent elections encourage his belief that Americansare waking up to the threat to their Second Amendment rights. "The gun issue was a big, big issue in these elections," Liddysaid, "They (the anti-gunners) have gone too far. "And, of course, you've had all this horrible stuff: the out-of-controlFBI hostage rescue team and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearmsmaking war on the American people. "I'd like to see a big push to investigate and find out how muchassistance those people were given by the armed forces. That's a violationof the Posse Comitatus Act. "I'd like to stop all armed forces participation with law enforcement.That shouldn't be happening." The French newspaper Le Monde once labeled Liddy "a man of extraordinaryintellect and complexity," an appropriate description for a man who,at age 29, became the youngest Bureau supervisor at FBI national headquarters. William F. Buckley Jr. described Liddy as possessing "superhumancharacter," while historian William H. White labeled him "themost dangerous man in America." Liberal television talk show host Larry King said of Liddy, "He'stotally himself, totally honest...He has passion, flair. He's just extraordinary.A man's man." But whatever else this bright extremely successful, strong willed personis, G. Gordon Liddy clearly is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms'worst nightmare. *END* -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= ii. Down to Earth UFO Abduction Research An Interview with Budd Hopkins by Kerri Parry from the Wole Life Times April 1995 supplied by The P/\NTHER Picture this: You're minding your own business, driving down the streettowards home when up above, you see a silver aircraft hovering-definitelynot a helicopter or anything you've ever seen before-with flicking, coloredlights. You stop and turn down your radio to see if it makes any noise. The next thing you remember, it's dark out and you're driving down thestreet again. You look at your watch: it's 9pm. You should have been homehours ago. What happened? According to Budd Hopkins, you may have been abductedby UFOs. Called "Ufology's most visible figure since the death ofJ. Allen Hynek, "this abduction researcher described such scenariosin his 1981 book Missing Time and went on to explore the subject of alien/humanhybirds in the 1987 book Intruders (the subject of a CBS television miniseriesin 1992), books that were devoted to findings from his painstaking researchinto UFO abductions. With help from a fellow UFO researcher and psychologist,Hopkins performed countless interviews and hypnosis sessions on UFO abducteesto form case studies. What they found was not pleasant: involuntary humansubjects were subjected to implants and sperm and ova sampling, among otherthings. Mothers were shown their half-human, half-alien children. Also a New York City painter and sculptor, Hopkins has founded the IntrudersFoundation, a non-profit organization devoted to research and public educationabout the UFO abduction phenomenon. Whole Life Times spoke with Hopkinsabout his work. * BEGIN INTERVIEW * [Your last book, Intruders, came out in 1987. What has been the focusof your research since then?] Essentially what the focus was before-studying the abduction phenomenonand looking for patterns that were unknown before. There have been a numberof these new patterns, and they have certainly occupied a lot of my thinkingsince then. These might be called "subsets" because they're notall that common, but there are some 12 cases where people have been abductedas children and taken into another place, another situation with anotherchild. They are simply left alone to play and form relationships, and they'reabducted again and again. They may live in different cities; in one casethey lived on different continents. They are brought together and, it wouldseem, the aliens are interested in watching how a relationship forms, between,in most cases, members of the opposite sex. What happens eventually in the cases I'm dealing with is the peoplehave actually run into their counterpart in the real world and thought,"My god, how do I know you?" When you look into these cases,it turns out they've been abducted and studied as a pair. So as a sortof extension of the UFO occupants' interest in reproduction and this programof mixing hybirds of them and us, they seem to be interested in how humanbeings experience certain types of emotions. That's never been writtenabout in any length, but it's something I've run into a number of times. [Why do you think certain individuals are chosen as abductees? Is itrandom?] People seem to be chosen across certain blood lines and families. Ifa woman is an abductee and has two children, it is likely that one or moreof her children will also be abductees. I have cases which go across fourgenerations. So it would seem there is this interest in following a particularset of genes and its various permutations. We don't really know, but that'sa good guess. If people are abducted when they are tiny children-I haveone case where a baby was taken from the hospital when it was one day old-ifthese things happen from childhood on, then obviously whatever they'reinterested in is already present in that child to start with. [What are some of the symptoms by which one might recognize a personalabduction experience?] The most obvious sympton is having a very clear, conscious memory ofabduction. Now to go to the much more subtle: childhood sleep difficulties,recurring nightmares which have a UFO component to them, fears of certainplaces, certain kinds of phobias which don't make much sense. One man wasafraid to go out at night and walk into any kind of open field becausehe was afraid he would "fall up." Another person might say he's absolutely terrified of cockroaches, andI'll say, "Well, they're certainly not pleasant; you're afraid they'llget into your food," and then try to lead away, not using anythingUFO-like. Then he'll say, "No, their huge staring eyes, and the waythey stare at you," which is not the way we thing about cockroaches! If you look at this as a medical metaphor, like a high fever or an itchon the kneecap, you name it, any symptom alone could be anything. But inconjunction with, say, six other symptoms, you have to take it seriouslyas perhaps being representative of a certain pathology. [Then how do you determine if it's the bona fide thing?] Well, I would then examine a person's collection of his phobias andfears, and try to find out if a person has had any missing time experiencesthat are unexplained. An example might be a trip in the car that is supposedto take an hour and it takes three hours and he can't remember anything,but he feels real funny! Then I make inquiries into his dream life. People very often have thisunbelievable fear of going to a doctor, gynecological exam, or the dentist-fearsthat are in excess of what they could understand as being logical. Soemof what one does ina n interview is inquire into many different areas ofa person's expericnce and see what kinds of symptomns recur. I've done a lot of work with children who were abductees, and when you'reworking with children, I ask a different set of questions. One man rememberedthat as a little boy, when his mother pointed out a praying mantis, hestarted talking to it. His mother said, "Bugs don't talk." Hesaid, "No, this kind of bug talks!" Another little boy made somedrawings of aliens and put a huge ear, just one ear, on the side of eachhead. He said, "They don't really have ears, but they can hear everythingyou're saying." [Do the abductions seem to happen only by "grey" aliens?] There are other types that are described. Some seem to have a more insect-likeappearance; some people use the analogy of a praying mantis. Essentially,you see the gray figures in 85% of the reports. There's a number of reportsof what seem to be normal humans and also people who seem to be hybirds:part human, part alien. But they all seem, together, to be doing the samething. [They all want to observe you, or put in an implant...] Yes, implants, or alleged implants, have been found. A number of themhave been studied, and they are quite unusual, but they are not somethingall science would agree could not have been produced on earth. The problemis that all the elements on Earth are the elements of the Universe, andhow would we recognize an object that could not possibly have originatedon Earth? An implant could be made of earthly materials, so how do we recognizeit? It's not as easy an issue as one would imagine. [In Intruders you surmised that the abduction phenomenon could eitherbe reality or a soft of universal psychological phenomenon. Have you comeany further in deciding which it is?] I don't have any doubt that it's physically real. Somebody asked meonce, "Is this really happening in the real world?" I said, "Ino longer have the luxury of disbelief about it." We're stuck withit. It's not very pleasant to deal with. One thing I want to say that'simportant is that though we know it's going on, and we know that they'redoing, at least an awful lot of them, we don't know any of the answersto any of the big questions-like what's it going to be like 100 years fromnow, where do they come from, what do they ultimately intend for us? Wedon't have any of those answers. When somebody once said, "This islike a cult," I said, "Well, it's the exact opposite of a cult,if you think of a cult as the Rev. Moon or something like that. Mooniesare all beliefs and no miracles. We're all miracles and no beliefs." And, I must say, I'm not given a lot of speculation. For me, it's alot of wheel-spinning. So when people start talking, "Oh, I hink they'retime travelers, "No, I think they're inter-dimensionals," I justsort of throw up my hands and say, "I don't know." [Besides abductees and researchers such as yourself, is anyone elseshowing concern over this phenomenon?] Mental health professionals, as a group, have had a larger percentagetaking this issue very seriously than any other group that I'm aware of.I've spoken to maybe 1,000 mental health professionals over the years andapart from the fact that I've so far had seven psychiatrists come to meabout their own abduction experiences-and a number of psychologists andtherapists that are abductees-it seems to be, as a group, that many ofthem share a great interest in this subject. I think it's because they'revery aware of the anomalies of human behavior. If you have people who areshowing signs of, say, childhood sexual abuse, and there's absolutely nosexual abuse that can be located in anyone in the family, and the childremembers certain things that blend with memories that have to do withthe realm of huge black eyes and finding oneself outside and a whole groupof things, the mental health people are aware that maybe there is an unusualphenomena at work here that's outside of their normal range of trainingand expertise. But we certainly hear more from them that we do from, say,physicists or astronomers who are the first to say you can't get here fromthere, or "These people's experiences can't be!" [What about the government?] Well, we know there's a cover-up on this. I don't think ther's any doubt,because the government was investigating UFOs through the Air Force officiallyup until 1969, and then they announced they were getting out of lookinginto the subject at all. But when the Freedom of Information Act was passedand we requested documents, we received many documents from all the branchesof government, at least the investigative ones, dealing with UFO investigatinocarried out after 1969. You can't say you're stopping it, and then haveall this evidence that you're not stopping it without saying that is, ipsofacto, a kind of cover-up. [Tell us about the organizatino you founded, the Intruders Foundation.] There are three different things we do. One is working with abducteesand referring them to other investigators and therapists around the country,and a few in foreign countries. I'm still getting about two new potentialcases a day, and the first thing we do is get these people some help, becausethey want to find out what happened to them. If hypnosis or therapy iscalled for, we try to get some help. The second thing is research, tryingto put together the accounts of what's happening and determining the patterns,what keeps happening again and again. The third thing is public education. [In terms of popular culture, it seems like UFOs are coming more intothe mainstream. We're seeing more movies, more television shows and soforth, devoted to the topic. Any thoughts on this?] I think the reason is that the media is out to make a buck. There'spublic interest in it, which means money, and therefore they're cateringto that. It's an interesting thing: when sweeps week comes along, everybodycalls me up and wants to do UFO this, UFO that. That lets you know thatthere's an audience in it. *END* -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= iii. The X-FILES EXPOSED supplied by The P/\NTHER/UMF "Since the show started, people have sought me out. I was warnedabout nutcases but these are regular folks. A banker will tell about hisexperience with aliens. Pilots and flight attendants come up to me andclaim to have seen UFOs. One friend told me, 'You don't know how accurateyou are.' He broke down, telling me about his visitations. I've known thisperson for two years. I have no reason not to believe him."-ChrisCarter, creator and executive producer, The X-Files. Standing in the middle of his living room, FBI special agent Fox Mulderis deep in conversation with a woman he believes is his long-lost sisterSamannnntha, abducted years ago by aliens. But. Mulder turns away fromher, struding past a Panavision camera into a hallway at a studio in Vancouver.He slumps in a canvas chair and grabs a reporter's notebook. He startsdrawing something on the page. "You won't admit that you're reallygoing to be writing what amounts to fiction," he says. "It'sgoing to have your slant on it-not the truth. You're just trying to geta handle on something, a handle on me." The notebook is retrieved.The drawing is a bag with a handle on it. Next to the handle he has drawnan arrow pointing to his real name: David Duchovny. So when it comes to investigating the most provocative series on TV,Fox's sleeper sci-fi hit, The X-Files, Duchovny seems to be echoing theshow's credo: The truth is out there-but it's not likely to be in here,in the pages of a magazine. Or is it? Since it's first sighting in 1993, The X-Files has defied skeptics whorefused to believe that a show about two deadpan FBI agents, played byDuchovny, 34, and Gillian Anderson, 26, investigating paranormal activitiescould succeed. But succeed it has. By skillfully blending post-Cold War,antigovernment paranoia; old-fashioned conspiracy theory; sly humor; andstories drawn from today's headlines (not to mention little green men andbeast-women), The X-Files beat out favorites like NYPD Blue and ER forbest drama series at the recent Golden Globes. Ratings have nearly doubledsince its debut, culminating in its first-ever-time-slow victory in householdswith the conclusion of a recent two parter about the supposed return ofMulder's sister, a story suggested in part by Duchovny> "I hadno idea this could happen," says the Hollywood-handsome Carter, 38,a former surfing-magazine writer whose favorite should as a kid was Kolchak:The Night Stalker. "I wrote this in my office in my surf trunks, playingwith my dog. It never occurred to me that someday there'd be X-Files keychains." True, the show is beset by at least on Dark Force. Many X-Files episodesare left unresolved, making them a hard sell in syndication. So Cartertoo must battle strange life forms-the kind who wear Armani suits and dineat Mortons. "We have long, tedious arguments about the network's desirefor 'closure'," sighs Carter. "But it's hard to put handcuffson aliens every week and throw them in the slammer." Nevertheless, all signs point to a possible Star Trek-like franchise.The first X-Files convention will be held soon, probably in L.A.; a seriesof official X-Files novels is hitting bookstores; Topps Comics is puttingout a monthly X-Files comic book; and Fox will release an X-Files CD laterthis year. The phenom has also infiltrated cyberspace. Thousands of fans-theycall themselves "X-Philes" - have logged onto X-Files newsgroupson the Internet and online services; America Online even lets subscribersrole-play in a game based on the series. "My dorm when I was studying in Munich was an old SS barracks thatwas supposedly haunted. One night we were sitting around, making fun ofthe spirits. At some point I went back to my room. There was a big brasscandlabra on the dresser. I knelt down to get into the closet and the candlabracame crashing down and just missed my head. It was on a totally flat surface.Nothing could have knocked it over. It was very weird. I apologized tothe spirits immediately." - Mitch Pileggi,a.k.a. X-Files FBI assistantdirector Walter Skinner Marooned for 10 months of the year in Vancouver, where they work undersuch tight deadlines that some scripts have been written in less than 72hours, Team X-Files find the show's exploding popularity a little, well,suspicious. "I'm fascinated by what they read into it," saysdirector-producer Rob Bowman, 34, who surfs on those often arcane X-Filesforums in cyberspace where viewers dig for signs and symbols in nearlyevery scene. "We don't have time to put in everything they think theysee." Die-hard fans analyze and critique the show, expecially the sinisterfringe characters, such as Deep Throat, Mr. X, Cigarette Smoking Man, orCrew Cut Man, like Talmudic scholars. A typical America Online postingafter a recent episode read: "Did any other Douglas Adams [Hitchkiker'sGuide to the Galaxy] fans out there notice that Mulder's apartment numberis 42? It's the answer to the question of Life, the Universe and Everything." Another hot topic is the soulful but platonic relationship between FoxMulder and Dana Scully. X-Philes swoon over the sexual tension, but Carterswears his two stars will never have a close encounter of the sensual kind."If they ever got too romantic," he says, "you can imaginethem ignoring the aliens and genetic mutants and just staring into eachother's eyes." The X-Files sometimes twist its more obsessive viewers. In one episode,the three greasy-haired conspiracy theorist losers known as the Lone Gunmeninvite Mulder for an uproarious Saturday night "netpicking" onthe Internet. "No thanks," the agent responds dryly in one ofhis trademark Mulderisms, "I have to do my laundry." Of course, when it comes to the X-Files, one should remember the immortalwords of Mulder's mysterious ally (or is it enemy?) Deep Throat, who died(or did he?) at the end of last season: "Nothing is as it seems." "My mother was raised by her uncle and they were very close. Oneday, after she was grown up, her uncle died. That very day she'd writtenhim a letter and mailed it to him. [After learning that he'd died] shewent back to his house and went through his private papers. She found herletter had been opened. And there was no one else who could have been thereto open it."-Tom Braidwood, a.k.a. one of the Lone Gunmen. Both Duchovny, who has Mulder's dry wit and sardonic delivery, and Anderson,who can be as eerily serene as her X-Files character, Dana Scully, workup to 16 hours a day. Duchovny is a veteren of films like Kalifornia andplayed the transvetite on Twin Peaks. Anderson, however, only had a fewstage and TV credits when the show began. They rarely socialize togetheronly "because we see more of each other working than we do of anyoneelse," says Anderson. Duchovny, alternately charming and brusque,spends his free time in his spartan trailer with his dog, Blue. Andersondashes back to her trailer in between takes to be with her 5-month-old-daughter;Piper. On the show, Duchovny's character is the true believer: Mulder's questto find his sister, who he believes was abducted by aliens at age 8, drivesthe show. (Carter says the sister will finally be found whenever the showends its run.) In real life, however, Duchovny is more of a doubter-attimes. "I'm a skeptic of specifics, like the six-foot intestinal worm[inthe episode 'The Host']," he says. Anderson, by contrast, who plays the pragmatic, scientific, ever-skepticalScully, says she's "always had a basic belief in the paranormal."Not long after arriving in Vancouver, she had even more reason to believe. "After my husband and I moved into our new house, I feld therewere spirits there with us. It was really creepy. It felt like there wassomeone attached to me. We were told by a Native American that we livednear an Indian burial ground. He said there had been a plague years agothat wiped many of them out. There were a lot of souls in unrest. He cameto the house and performed this ritual called smudging in which herbs areburned so as to purify the space. It was amazing. Afterward, it was likethe house got lighter. Whatever we felt had been there was gone."-GillianAnderson Sounding very much like Scully describing Mulder, Anderson admits, "Wehave our ups and downs. At times it's difficult. We both tend to be quitemoody, but underneath I think we care about each other." They areboth coy about whether they ever considered dating, but Anderson will allowthat Duchovny is "like catnip" to women. When told this later,Duchovny, soon to be featured in a Playgirl interview, notes. "Justcall me David Ducatnip," he says. "I wish I had the life peoplethink I have." Unlike Mulder and Scully, who seem to have virtually no personal lives,Duchovny and Anderson found mates soon after the show's debut. Duchovny'sL.A.-based girlfriend, actress Perrey Reeves, played a beautiful vampirewho spends the night with Mulder int he episode titled "3". Andersonmarried Errol Clyde Klotz, 33, a freelance art director on the show, fourmonths after meeting him and gave birth in September. "It was intense,everyone was mad at me," says Anderson of her pregnancy. "Itwas pretty ballsy of me, after getting such a big break. I was afraid theywere going to recast." Instead, Anderson's abscence from the show led to one of its most compellingstoreis-last year's two-parter in which it seems that Scully is abductedby aliens. Anderson returned to work 10 days after giving birth by cesareansection. "It was tough," she says, "but now I have a beautifulbaby daughter." "I was in Ocean City, Maryland, in 1987. I looked up and saw somethingthat looked like a plane. I looked away for a second and it was gone. Itwas low and big. I couldn't believe my eyes. I just glanced away for asecond and when I looked back it was gone."-David Duchovny Duchovny, having morphed back into Mulder, is again in front of thecameras. His "sister" (soon to be revealed as an impostor withfour clones) is warning him about an alien bounty hunter. Just a few feetaway, behind the set's fake backwall, a member of the production team speaksin low, confidential tones. This person, who does not want to be identified, talks guardedly aboutwhat she says was her own abduction by aliens late last year: "Theytook us up in their ship," she says. "It's hazy, it's hard toremember, like a dream. They spoke, but it seemed like everything happenedtelepathically. I do remember they had three fingers." Duchovny, between scenes, pops out again and listens to the conversationskeptically. "On the other side of the wall, the sign above Mulder'sdesk reads, "I want to believe." You do too. But then you rememberthe rule: Trust no one. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= iv. H.A.A.R.P. Supplied by The Netweaver/UMF From: asljl@orion.alaska.edu (Lady-Rhavyn) Newsgroups: alt.alien.visitors,alt.conspiracy,alt.magick,alt.paganSubject: Government and Psi Part 11 Date: 1 Dec 94 19:23:16 AST Organization:University of Alaska ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Monster in the Wilderness by C. Zickuhr The HAARP project being constructed near Gakona, Alaska will createthe largest-of-its-kind ionospheric heater using computer controlled radiofrequency transmitters. HAARP, which stands for High Frequency Active AuroralResearch Project, is a joint effort of the Air Force and the Navy. HAARPprogram manager, John Heckscher, claims that it is a research project withboth military and civilian benefits yet only military experiments can befound in the documentation for the project. The acronym implies somethingto do with the aurora, but none of the project papers mention that aspect.What sounds like an engineering feat deserving of public accolade, hasremained suspiciously low profile, almost unknown to most Alaskans as wellas the rest of the country. Documents acquired from the Office of Naval Research via the FreedomOf Information Act reveal a more ominous purpose for HAARP. According tothese documents, the U.S. military believes the former Soviet Union hassimilar heaters with which they claim to have achieved higher levels ofionospheric reaction than possible so far in the "West". Althoughsmaller in size than the HAARP project, there are many other ground basedtransmitting heaters in operation around the world; Tromso, Norway andArecibo, Puerto Rico among them. Can these heaters already be changingthe weather, and have they somehow contributed to the recent climate-basedcatastrophes in the U.S? Might migratory species traveling through the"rays" have already experienced irreversible damage? How manyhumans have contracted cancers that might have remained dormant if not"excited" by these transmissions? When Russia's Zhirinovsky speaksof secret weapons, is he referring to their version of HAARP? HAARP first came to my attention in the spring of 1993, when a neighborand airline pilot brought me materials on the project. The FAA had briefedcommercial pilots in Alaska on changes needed to avoid interference fromfuture HAARP transmissions. As a ham radio operator, my neighbor assumedthat I had some knowledge of the "giant transmitter" and itseffect on other communications. After making inquiries to other hams, afew recalled seeing announcements for public meetings in Glenallen andAnderson, Alaska. Several then attended these Draft Environmental Impactmeetings and gathered information. FAA personnel, pilots, communications engineers and others raised seriousquestions during the HAARP Draft Environmental Impact Statement process.According to official statements, these questions were all properly addressedin the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). Closer examinationreveals a different story. Local FAA engineers, aware of the heavy safetydependency of airplane communications, voiced strong objections. The nationalFAA, however, overrode these objections and gave HAARP the green lightafter "assurances" that lower level concerns would be accommodated.The FEIS admits that all forms of radio communication are subject to interference,yet completely ignores the concerns expressed in many of the comments.Individuals, organizations and agencies that use radio for their day-to-daylivelihood were left with a "let us know and we'll try to mitigateit" promise. It is important to remember the definition of mitigationis "to reduce", not "to eliminate". What recourse doesthe Alaskan Bush communicator have when their radio transmissions are rendereduseless by HAARP? That is their only form of communication. The FEIS and other Department of Defense documents indicate that interferenceproblems would be too great to allow it to be located near other militaryfacilities in Alaska. What kind of monster is it that they can't even locateit near existing military bases? Even the National Telecommunications andInformation Administration (NTIA) has reservations about HAARP transmissions.They would only permit one of the test sites (Mineral Wells, Texas) tooperate and so far have declined to extend all the requested frequency/powerprivileges necessary for the Alaska site. The enormous lobbying power ofthe military may overwhelm reason and force the NTIA to go along with theHAARP request. After all, Gakona is a "virtually uninhabited"area of the world. Electromagnetic radiation has drawn increasing interest in the formof health impact studies and research worldwide. The HAARP project willgenerate massive amounts of intentional and some unintentional radiation.The HAARP environmental impact statements deny possible biological effectson humans, citing obsolete IEEE standards that basically say if the radiationisn't causing you to feel heat, it does not harm you. The preponderanceof current studies indicate there can by promotion of cancer growth, disorientation,and other negative physical effects from low level, non-heating electromagneticradiation. Why have our government agencies given their affirmation tosomething so clearly controversial? After searching for answers to HAARP questions for the past year anda half, what has surfaced are very few answers and many more questions.How dangerous is HAARP (some physicists fear severe planetary consequences)?Commenting on HAARP in the April, 1994 issue of Physics and Society, C.L. Herzenberg says "...this technology does present issues that needto be publicly addressed by the technical community". Can HAARP changethe ionosphere and weather patterns?? Can HAARP disrupt worldwide communications??Can HAARP damage or destroy wildlife?? Will HAARP radiation change themigration habits of animals that come near it?? Can HAARP cause cancer??Can the ionospheric effects of HAARP be controlled?? Why has the projectbeen kept low profile and secretive, by the sponsors and the contractor(an ARCO subsidiary)? UPDATE: JUNE 1994 - ARCO sold their subsidiary to E-Systems, the 41stlargest U.S. defense contractor noted for their counter surveillance work.Why have Alaska's public officials avoided providing serious answers tothe public's questions?? Anything that can generate these questions deservesthe MONSTER title and our serious attention. Additional pieces to the puzzle that have shown themselves only serveto heighten speculation that we are not getting clear and concise answers.There is a connection to the recently installed Cray supercomputer at UAFand to the Geophysical Institute there. There is an obvious power requirementthat might be met by a proposed coal power plant at Healy, connected bya proposed power distribution intertie. Some of the experiments will require"seeding" the ionosphere with chemicals that could be deliveredby rockets from the Poker Flats rocket range near Fairbanks. Patents heldby the ARCO subsidiary building HAARP describe a similar ionospheric heaterand claim abilities to stop missiles, change weather, and disrupt globalcommunications. The inventor, Bernard Eastlund, claims he was hired byARCO to find a use for their Alaska North Slope gas deposits; hence, hisinventions described in the patents. Microwave News May/June, 1994 reportedEastlund said "The HAARP project obviously looks a lot like the firststep toward this." The Gakona location is interesting as it was once destined to becomean over-the-horizon radar facility. The Cold War ended before it couldbe completely built. This left the military with a remote location withbuildings and generating equipment partially completed, and a choice -either restore it to its original natural condition or find another use.HAARP conveniently fits the site. Is the choice of this remote site forthese monster transmitters more a factor of fewer people to complain? Doesit reduce the number of humans exposed to HAARP transmissions thereby reducingthe liability? What about the wildlife in the area, what exposures willthey be subjected to? One need only remember experiments of another erathat generated nuclear fall-out killing and crippling humans and animalsin its path. It only took forty to fifty years to get the agencies involvedto admit liability. In order to get an idea of just how large the HAARP transmitters are,imagine all the ham radio operators in the United States (there are over500,000) transmitting at their maximum allowed power from one giant antenna.That still would not be as powerful as HAARP's multi-gigawatt (giga = billion)radiation capability. The average Alaskan ham can communicate across thestate with less power than will be in the unintentional harmonics and side-lobesradiated by HAARP. What exactly will HAARP do? According to HAARP project documents itwill "perturb" the ionosphere with extremely powerful beams ofenergy. Using polarized, pulsating radio frequency transmissions to performexperiments which include devising methods to destroy the communicationscapabilities of others (presumably an adversary) while preserving theirown communications. Experiments with mirroring and reflecting abilitiesof the ionosphere (abilities we currently depend on for all forms of communication)will be carried out to see what military purposes may be served by theresulting changes. An apt analogy that springs to mind is that of an inquisitiveyoungster poking a sleeping bear with a stick, to see what might happen!What will we do once the monster is unleashed? The Alaska location was partially picked for its alignment with theearth's magnetic force lines. Military experiments with the magnetospherealso appear to be planned. And again the scientists warn of possible direconsequences, including setting the earth into some unexpected vibrationor oscillation, similar to an axis wobble. Many scientists such as RichardWilliams writing in Physics and Society in April, 1988 have denounced thiskind of testing as irresponsible and downright dangerous, fearing longterm negative ionospheric effects. Also, like any magnet, the force lineswill react at their opposite pole, near Australia and New Zealand. Australiansare concerned enough to consider sending a team to Alaska to document andinvestigate HAARP. Shouldn't Alaskans be interested too? A group of NO HAARP activists is seeking to formalize their oppositionby incorporating as a non-profit organization or affiliating with an existinggroup. Their prime purposes will be to promote awareness, file legal actionsand other activities focused specifically on HAARP, something no groupis currently doing. In fact, probably due to the remoteness of the Gakonalocation, it has been difficult to get outsiders interested. We are quiteaware that the promoters of HAARP fully realize that they have the upperorganizational hand and the money to outlast our grassroots opposition.Those of us in NO HAARP are committed to doing what we can to stop theproject before it comes on-line with full power in 1997. Considering theproject has been underway since the mid-1980's, this will be a difficulttask. Luckily it was not completely funded as of a year ago. There is hopethat legislative alternatives to stop it may exist as well. John Heckscherwas quoted by Microwave News in the May/June, 1994 issue saying that "moneyfor completion of the demonstration project is in place . . . but the largerfacility would require additional funding from Congress". Unfortunately,this additional funding is likely to be buried deep in the DOD budget. What can you do? Of course you can try to "write your congressperson". The Alaska delegation to congress is noted for their alignmentwith the military so don't expect too much action from them. Send contributionsfor the NO HAARP effort to Jim Roderick, P.O.

The OKLAHOMA BOMBING? - The GODFATHER/UMF - The Albert Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City collapsed into apile of rubble and torn bodies after explosions rippled its supports fromthe foundation at approximately 9:02 am, Wednesday, April 19, 1995, thesecond anniversary of the Waco massacre. Timothy McVeigh, a Gulf War veteranhas been arrested and charged with the crime. James and Terry Nichols,brothers, have been arrested and charged with conspiracy to build explosivedevices at James' farm in Michigan. McVeigh and Terry Nichols were armybuddies. Casualties as of May 5th stand at 164 dead. Fifteen of them children.Seventeen remain unidentified. The total number of injured is in excessof 400. There are still 2 adults unaccounted for and it is feared thatthey will never be found. Assistant Firechief Hansen has announced thatthe clean- up of the bombsite is officially over. Rescuers wept silentlyat the announcement. The reason for the bombing is still unknown. Use ofthe term "heartland" to describe Oklahoma is right on the mark.Oklahomans are American to the core. They are deeply religious, avid gunowners, believe in a strict moral code, and have provided more than theirfair share of cannon fodder for the nation's wars. They are, for the mostpart, honest and hard- working people from pioneer stock. Many live onland their grandparents staked out in the great Oklahoma land rush. Thesepeople are extremely loyal to their state and to their country. Oklahomansknew all along where we were headed, and true to form, they tried to stopthe march toward globalism. these traits may have sealed Oklahoma's fateon March 28, 1994 when the Oklahoma State Legislature passed a resolutionwhich struck out at Clinton's socialist world government agenda. They werethe first and maybe the only state to pass such legislation. *ResolutionNo. 1047, 'A Resolution relating to United States military forces and theUnited Nations; memorializing Congress to cease certain activities concerningthe United Nations; and directing distribution' *WHEREAS, the constitutional role of the United States military is toprotect the life, liberty and property of United States citizens and todefend our nation against insurrection or foreign invasion; and *WHEREAS, there is no popular support for the establishment of a "newworld order" or world sovernty of any kind either under the UnitedNations or under any world body in any form of global government; and *WHEREAS, global government would mean the destruction of our Constitutionand corruption of the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, our freedom,and our way of life. *NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE2ND SESSION OF THE 44TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE: *THAT the United States Congress is hereby memorialized to: 1. Ceasethe appropriation of United States funds for any military activity notauthorized by congress; 2. Cease engagement in any military activity under the authority ofthe United Nations or any world body; 3. Cease the rendering of aid to any activity or engagement under thejurisdiction of the United Nations or any world body; and 4. Cease any support for the establishment of a "new world order"or to any form of global government. *THAT the United States congress is hereby memorialized to refrain fromtaking any further steps toward the economic or political merger of theUnited States into a world body or any form of world government. *That copies of this resolution be distributed to the Clerk of the UnitedStates House of Representatives, the Secretary of the United States Senate,and to each member of the Oklahoma Congressional Delegation. *Adopted by the House of Representatives the 28th day of March, 1994 The resolution passed by the Oklahoma State had the support of all thecitizens of Oklahoma. It was a slap in the face to the Clinton administrationand all those who promote the Socialist Internationale. Those murderedat Ruby Creek and Waco cried out for justice. Americans echoed those cries.Everyone knew that something was terribly wrong. A police state was emergingbefore our eyes. Militias were forming. The Democrats suffered the worstdefeat in their history at the polls in November. The hidden agenda ofthe communist/socialist Internationale was being exposed to the publicthrough talk radio and a thriving underground autobahn of information.This story really began on February 26, 1993 when the World Trade Centerwas bombed in New York City. William Cooper (author of 'Behold a Pale Horse')predicted terrorists would detonate a bomb in New York City since 1989.It is on record, on video, tape, and in his book. He predicted that itwould be blamed on Islamic fundamentalists but the real perpetrators wouldbe the U.S. Intelligence Community and specifically the Central IntelligenceAgency. He did not venture to guess the target. Those arrested were linkeddirectly to the CIA and the FBI WAS implicated in the bombing. The perpetratorsused TWO megabombs carried in a YELLOW RYDER RENTAL VAN. The bombs explodedin the parking garage of the World Trade Center, prematurely, before beingproperly placed. The result was substantial damage. Five people were killedand over 1,000 were wounded. If the bombs had been placed in position nextto the main structural supports the result would have been exactly whatwe see in Oklahoma City only much worse. Fragments of the yellow van wereQUICKLY found in the rubble. A paper trail traced the vehicle to an outletin New Jersey where it was rented four days before the explosion. "Alucky breakthrough" led federal agents to arrest a suspect, 26 yearold Mohammed Salameh, at the Jersey City rental agency at which he attemptedto reclaim a $400 dollar deposit on the van. In a surprise revelation TonyLang, a staff columnist for 'The Cincinnati Enquirer' (Gannett Chain) inCincinnati, Ohio, has uncovered court documents to support the direct involvementof the FBI in the World Trade Center bombing. The papers, filed in May,disclose that a government informer, an employee of the FBI, accompaniedthe accused bomber, Mohammed Salameh, to a New Jersey apartment they usedas a bomb factory...and proceeded to INSTRUCT Salameh in how to drive thefamous van two days before the explosion! In another surprise development,reported by Louis Beam in the 'Jubilee', tapes made secretly by an FBIinformant of conversations between him and his agency handlers linked thenation's largest law enforcement agency directly to "the most destructiveterrorist act in U.S. history". Unfortunately that title now restswith Oklahoma City. Emid Ali Salem, an FBI informant used hidden microphonesgiven to him by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to record his conversationswith agents of the bureau. A Los Angeles Times article on October 28, 1993revealed to shocked readers details of FBI involvement in the terroristact. FBI spokesmen in Washington refuse comment. The tapes became publicknowledge when they were ordered released by a federal judge presidingover the case of the indicted suspects. The Justice Department fought hardto prevent their release. The tapes which have been published by the NewYork Times reveal that Salem warned his FBI bosses that the World TradeCenter was soon to be bombed and urged them to prevent it. Speculationis now rampant in political circles that certain factions within the governmentmay have desired the bombing in order to speed passage of new "anti-crimelegislation." This suspicion was further fueled by the startling revelationthat the FBI denied Salem's request to use phoney explosives in the bombhe was helping to build under FBI supervision - the bomb ultimately usedin the World Trade Center explosion. Former Watergate associate prosecutorRichard Ben-Veniste warned that these tapes pose "an absolute nightmarefor federal prosecutors." One high ranking law enforcement officerwho insisted on secrecy said that in less than a years time the FBI hasbeen linked to criminal abuse of power and the mishandling of cases inthree different instances. "First we had Weaver, where an HRT membershot a mother with a baby in her arms, then Waco, where mishandling ledto the deaths of a hundred people, and now the World Trade Center, whereit appears the bombing could not have happened unless the agency let it."All of this comes on the heels of an Internal affairs report by the JusticeDepartment's Office of Professional Responsibility, linking FBI agentsto everything from drug abuse to shoplifting. OPR's annual report providedfurther startling proof that the agency formally most respected for it'slaw enforcement skills - "has gone bad." This contention is backedup by J.B. Campbell of the 'National Educator'. If the bombs had been placedproperly, it could have toppled one tower into the other and brought themboth down along with the 50,000 people inside. The New York Times now reportsthat the FBI could have thwarted the bombing by simply calling it off,or by building the bomb with harmless powder. One of the FBI conspirators,a former Egyptian army officer, secretly taped his meetings with his FBIhandlers. Emad Ali Salem recalls in the tape recorded meeting that theFBI had planned on building the bomb with a phoney powder and grabbingthe people who had been trapped in the plot. But the informer, who is heardlecturing his FBI handlers, said the powder scheme was called off and "wedidn't do that." We remember the FBI crowing about its investigativeprowess after its remarkably swift nabbing of the suspects, based on debrisfound in the bomb's crater. This was never true, for later we were to learnthat the FBI's informant, Emad Ali Salem, had to teach the suspects HOWTO MAKE A PROPER BOMB. Not only did the FBI know the suspects all along,but it GAVE THEM A BOMB. The FBI could have ordered Salem to make a harmlessbomb but, for some reason, it decided to provide a real bomb which hadthe power to kill 50,000 people and to let the suspects go ahead and explodeit. My conclusion is that Cooper's prediction was 100% right on the mark.It gets worse...The San Francisco Chronicle reported on September 25, 1993that observers from 11 counties watched as the U.S. Department of Energyperformed what it called the largest detonation of non-nuclear explosivesever conducted. The blast beneath the Nevada desert resulted from the ignitionof ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel, which produced a force equivalentto a one-kiloton nuclear bomb. The test was designed to allow scientiststo distinguish between nuclear and non-nuclear blasts should a permanentworldwide ban on nuclear testing be established. Gee, all these years andthey still don't know the difference. Rumors began circulating in Januaryof this year that meetings were being held among federal law enforcementagencies for the purpose of planing a move against the militia in April.Most ignored these rumors. On February 18th Cooper spoke at a ConstitutionParty rally in Ferndale, Michigan. A federal agent in the audience heldhis badge and identification up to the crowd stating clearly that the federalgovernment had held meetings among several agencies for the purpose ofmaking an all out assault against patriots and the militias in April. Hisstatement was video taped and in on record. Cooper verified his credentials.Such an attack would be political suicide unless some great tragedy turnedthe public against the militias. It was shortly after Michigan that Cooperobtained a copy of the 'Omnibus Counter Terrorism Act of 1995' introducedon February 10th by Joe Biden in the Senate (S-390) and Charles Shumerin the House (HR-896). Cooper remembers the random shooting that alwaysoccurred before anti-gun legislation came up for a vote. He predicted awave of terrorism directed against the United States would begin in thenear future. He had already made this prediction in his book 'Behold aPale Horse' and during many lectures. It is all recorded. He knew thiswould happen if all other attempts to destroy patriotism and disarm theAmerican people failed. He stated this in the book that all patriots wouldbe labeled as terrorists. A warning was contained in a memo issued by theU.S. Marshals Service on May 15th. The memo expressed fear that "theterrorist attacks would be designed to attract worldwide press attentionto an Islamic Religious vendetta through the mass murder of innocent victims."The warning stated that Middle Eastern terrorists were planning to launchsuicide attacks against federal facilities nationwide. Authorities reviewedthe security at Oklahoma city's Alfred P. Murrah building, nothing waschanged, and one guard was left to patrol a four building complex. RepresentativeJames Saxton (R), a senior member of the House Task force on Terrorism,said his group had alerted law enforcement and intelligence personnel onFebruary 27th that there was an increased threat of terrorism. Anotherrumor flew through the grapevine. This one alleged that the federal governmentwould make an all out attack upon patriots and the militias on March 24thand 25th. The rumor came from many sources and was published in 'StrategicInvestment' lending credibility to the story. ***************************Strategic investment/March 22, 1995, behind the lines, by Jack Wheeler- The slaughter of dozens of women and children in Waco by government stormtroopersunder the command of Field Marshall Reno may pale in comparison to whathas been planned for late March: a nationwide BATF/FBI assault on privatemilitias as the prelude to a possible declaration of martial law throughoutthe United States. All leaves and vacations have been canceled for BATF/FBIpersonnel, and for various State Police and national Guard's such as California's.The Amry's infamous Joint Task Force Six (which did the training for Waco)has been training BATF jackbooters with Bradley Assault Vehicles at Ft.Bliss, Texas. Government agent provocateurs are set to plant fully automaticand heavy weapons like rocket launchers, on the property of militia leaders.Every militia in the country - and there are dozens, many of which arewell-armed and well-led by former or even active duty officers - is ona state of Red Alert. Should Reno be stupid enough to actually attack themmilitarily, there is going to be a lot of blood. The establishment mediais programmed to immediately thereafter thunderously bellow for nationwidegun confiscation and even martial law. The Senate Armed Forces Committeehas been alerted and it questioning key Defense and Justice people behindclosed doors. Hopefully, Reno's Waco 2 can be stopped in time. But thatit was plotted in the first place should be a sobering lesson as to whata horrifying extent liberalism, the political philosophy of the administrationand the Democratic Party, has been converted into a close relative of fascism. Three Congressmen believed these stories to be true and wrote lettersto Janet Reno asking for an explanation. They cited federal law enforcementsources. No answer was forthcoming. Nothing could happen unless somethingwere to occur that would turn the public against the militia. William Cooperput out feelers through his people across the nation and the answer cameback the same. He could not identify any patriot or militia organizationthat would do anything of the nature that would be required to justifyan all out assault upon patriots and the militia. He knew only that theMarch dates were bogus. April approached. He had no hard evidence thatanything would occur, only reports from many credible sources, and fearingthat this could be an attempt to discredit the Intelligence Service, the'Hour of the Time' and 'Veritas', he maintained silence. Ordo Ab Chao....On Monday, April 17th the Orange County Register reported that the FBIwill open an international police training academy in Budapest. In an incredibleadmission of the Socialist agenda Clinton announced that American law-enforcementagencies are rapidly expanding over seas, deploying agents to dozens ofcountries in scores of joint investigations. This followed on the heelsof the recent announcement that the FBI had opened an office in Moscowand what used to be the KBG had opened an office in the United States.These facts herald the formation of a nucleus for a world police/investigativebody. David Johnson of the New York Times reported, "Last year, Freehopened an FBI office in Moscow, one of an overseas network of 24 such offices,forward command posts for an increasingly global detective agency. He hasalso been a driving force behind the Budapest training academy. Our worstfears became reality on Wednesday morning, April 19, 1995. A bomb had goneoff at the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. It became obvious withinhours that what had happened and what was being reported by the media weretwo, completely different, events. The event reported be the news networksmust have taken place in China because it sure didn't happen here. Thetruth is: 1. Witnesses reported hearing two distinct explosions, seconds apart,then the ominous rumbling of the building falling in itself. 2. Survivors, who were in the building near the front wall reportedbeing hurled out of the front of the federal building through cinder blockwalls into the street. 3. The front of the federal building was thrown out, away from the federalbuilding, and into the building across the street. 4. The front of the federal building was blown into the street immediatelyin front and slightly to the left of center when facing what had been thefront of the federal building. 5. The first video tape of the disaster shows two large columns of blacksmoke, one rising from the crater area in the street, and the other risingfrom the center of the federal building. 6. Undetonated plastic explosives were found on the scene by the firstrescue workers. A rocket launcher was also found. This was reported thenlater denied. Witnesses stick to their original story. 7. Officials reported that a second bomb had been found and police beganan immediate evacuation of the entire downtown area. Radio buffs and Intelligenceservice agents monitoring scanners confirmed that radio traffic indicatedthat a second bomb had been found. Explosives experts were called in alongwith a bomb disposal truck. This was seen on television and those monitoringscanners confirmed the disarming of the bomb was in progress. The followingwas intercepted by 3 different people. I did not hear it and I have notbeen able to obtain a copy of the tape. the speakers are unknown. Exceptfor minor differences all three people reported exactly the same conversation.First voice - "Boy, you're not going to believe this!" Secondvoice - "Believe what?" First voice - "I can't believe it... this is a military bomb!" After several hours the bomb disposaltruck left and the report of a second bomb was denied. 8. Two people identifying themselves as firemen, but refusing to givetheir names, reported that the second bomb was in fact several bombs, olivedrab colored cans of fulminate of mercury, clearly labeled as such, withMilSpec numbers, which were found intact on separate floors next to theelevator shaft. Officials denied these allegations. The following day anelderly gentleman who identified himself as the father of one of the firemencalled to confirm that his son had reported the same findings to him. Herefused to give his name. 9. Initial examination of the bomb scene revealed that a minimum oftwo bombs were needed to inflict the damage that presented. The steel reinforcedconcrete pillars that held up the building were sheered off at ground levelclear back to the third pillar throughout the building. Explosives expertshave confirmed that this is impossible with the one bomb scenario beingpresented by the government and the media. The reports of the survivorswho were blown out of the front of the building into the street and thefront of the building blown outward across the street support their findings.A retired General who had spent over 25 years in explosives research andultimately commanded the explosives research facility for a branch of themilitary informed us that the pillars could only be taken down at groundlevel by satchel charges or shaped charges placed upon each pillar. Hismathematics are impressive. I do not have the expertise to understand whathe is talking about, but with his credentials someone had better listen. After the brief and painful accusations against the Islamic communityand the arrest of several people of mid-eastern descent, including onetraveler at London's Heathrow Airport, the accusations swung right aroundas Cooper predicted to patriots and militias. The most incredible hatecampaign in the history of the world was directed toward Islamics, Christians,whites, males, patriots, militias, anyone using diesel fuel, anyone usingfertilizer, anyone from the state of Michigan, all who support the constitutionfor the United States of America, and the people who live in Arizona, especiallytalk radio hosts. The standard Ryder truck rental reared its ugly headand within hours the FBI not only had enough parts to identify the typeof truck but had already traced it back to the rental agency. (Incredible)The FBI quickly produced what appeared to be drawings of near photographquality of two suspects. Later, after McVeigh was captured, the FBI releaseda new drawing of John Doe #2 which looked more like a drawing. The manwho is accused of bombing the federal building was caught speeding in acar, his own, without license plates. He was arrested, without resistance,for carrying a concealed weapon and jailed. (How convenient) A CBS feedon the KU satellite band reported that the Initial report that the concealedweapon was a gun was in error. The commentator (a woman) reported thatthe concealed weapon for which McVeigh was jailed was a knife. This reportwas never aired to our knowledge. The FBI and the media reported that McVeighlived in Kingman, Arizona at Canyon West Trailer Park. He was describedas having lived in trailer #19, under the name of his girlfriend. Theyreported that he was evicted after a stormy nine months in which the manplayed loud music, left piles of beer cans and a wrecked car by the trailerand belligerently refused to obey camp rules. When interested people actuallycontacted these same people they stated that McVeigh had lived in trailer#11 from June 1993 until early September 1993. They described Tim McVeighas a nice man, quiet and neat. "He was a nice guy, a model tenant."The pawn shop owner, William Stumpp, killed in Texarkana by Richard WayneSnell was not a Jew and the press knew this all the time they reportedthat he was a Jew. Stumpp was an Episcopalian not Jewish. Alacia AdamsEsquivios has signed an affidavit stating that she saw John Doe #2 on April19th in a white government van traveling south on highway 44 at 5:15 pm.She called the FBI on the morning of the 21st and reported what she saw.She was told an agent would contact her for an interview. No one showed.She called again on Monday the 24th. The person who answered the phonesaid an agent would come out and interview her. She is still waiting. Membersof the St. Lucie-based second regiment of the Florida State Militia reportthat Timothy McVeigh attended a local militia rally last year as a bodyguardfor Mark Koernke. Koernke denies any knowledge of McVeigh. The seismographreport from Oklahoma University, according to Dr. Luza of the Universityof Oklahoma-Norman, shows two unmistakable "events" that happenedin the Oklahoma City area, the first at 9:02 am followed by a second 10seconds later. Both are surface events similar in signature to a quarryblast, both of approximately the same duration and magnitude. no otherdisturbance occurred the morning of the 19th of April in the Oklahoma Cityarea. The seismograph confirms witness reports of two explosions. In aninterview Dr. Luza said the second event could not have been an echo orbounce back because the seismograph would have shown a distinctly separatepattern if it had been either of those two things, and geologists are easilyable to recognize the secondary pattern when such an echo or bouncebackoccurs. When asked if the second event could have been caused by the crashingof the building as it collapsed, Dr. Luza said no, and explained that hadthe seismograph recorded the collapse of the building, the second markingswould have been of a much lesser magnitude, and it did not take the buildingten seconds after the explosion to begin to collapse. In his closing remarks,Dr. Luza stated that the two events were of identical magnitude, as ifthe same bomb had gone off twice, and that if the second event had beencaused by an echo or anything else, the seismographic record would nothave shown such perfect consistency between the two events. His conclusionwas that there were definitely two separate explosions in the Oklahomacity area separated by only 10 seconds. The official interpretation ofthe seismograph record from the Oklahoma Geological Survey SeismographStation in Norman, Oklahoma is that they recorded a large surface-wave"train" at 9:02:13 a.m. (140213 UTC) shortly after the explosionat the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The seismometeris located approximately four miles north of Norman and sixteen miles fromdowntown Oklahoma City. A second large surface-wave was recorded at 9:02:23a.m. (140223 UTC). The location and source of the second surface-wave recordingis unknown. The record is read from top to bottom and from left to right.The small vertical offsets of the horizontal lines are minute marks. Hourmarks are twice as long as the minute marks. I've seen a second seismographicreading from the Oklahoma City Omniplex. The station is very close to thefederal building and the seismograph reflects the fact. The two explosionsare registered on this graph as blank spaces where the needle literallyjumped off the sheet. The events are separated by 10 seconds of ink. Noexperts exist at the Omniplex station. The employee who gave me a copysaid it was miraculous that the Omniplex had any records at all becausethe seismograph had not been working up until 40 minutes prior to the explosions.The Omniplex is located at the Kirkpatrick Center, at 50th and Martin LutherKing Blvd. The FBI seized the original seismographic record. My copy isa copy made before the seizure by an employee One of the federal agentswho died in the blast was the former head of President Clinton's SecretService team of bodyguards. How many does that make? Oklahoma GovernorFrank Keating is an ex-FBI agent. Anti-terrorism bill is now on the fasttrack. In a "Bullet Poll" conducted by KTBS-TV Channel 3, Shreveport,Louisiana and reported on April 20th the following question was asked ..."Would you be willing to give up some of your freedom for a littlesecurity?" 74% reportedly fell into the category bracketed by "some-most-all".On April 28th the tape of James Nichols hearing was released by court orderand it was blank. Nothing whatsoever could be heard on the tape. It wasthe only record of the proceedings. Office workers state that almost allof the FBI and BATF agents and an unbelievable number of supervisory personneldid not arrive at work at their usual time on Wednesday, April 19, 1995and were not in the building when the bomb went off. A card was sent tothe hospital for the survivors by a third grade boy. It reads: "Hello,I hope you feel better from the explosion in Oklahoma. I wish it neverhad happened. I felt bad for the people who died and the people who gothurt. That's only the beginning of what's going to happen to America. Hopeyou feel better, Jonathan Roden" -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= vi. Dope, Incorporated Extracted from Dope, Inc.-The Book That Drove Henry Kissinger Crazy supplied by The P/\NTHER Seventeen years ago, the first edition of Dope, Inc. was released. Commissionedby anti-drug American statesman Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr, it was the firstbook to reveal that the illegal drug cartel was becoming the world's biggestbusiness; to name the causes of the war 'Dope, Inc.' has waged againstevery nation in the world; and to reveal the names of the 'untouchable'figures who protect it, including the European monarchs, whom our Hollywoodmedia have sold to the public as veritable deities. Even before the first copies of the first edition of Dope, Inc.-Britain'sOpium War Against the United States, rolled off the press in December 1978,leaders of the narcotics enterprise were busy trying to stop LaRouche.Beginning in summer 1978, the Anti Defamation League (ADL) launched a multimillion-dollarcampaign to label LaRouche and his political associates as "anti-Semites"for daring to expose the involvement of gangsters like Merey Lansky andZionist lobby leaders like Edgar Bronfman and Max Fisher in the dope business.LaRouche also identified the powerful British Crown bankers as partnersin the dope trade, along with the Jewish crime syndicate. The ADL's 'anti-Semitic' smear against LaRouche was pure 'big lie' terrorismin the tradition of Nazi propagandist Joesph Goebbels. Everyone who botheredto look into the matter knew that LaRouche's political career had beenbuilt around his discoveries in physical economy, and that by 1978 he hadwritten hundreds of articles and several books exposing the fascist economicausterity policies behind the Nazi holocaust which killed millions of Jewsand other victims. The ADL's bizarre slanders prompted EIR's investigatorsto scrutinize the history of the supposed 'Jewish civil rights' organization. The probe turned up a 70-year legacy of intimate ADL ties with Jewishgangsters, from Meyer Lansky and his 'Our Crowd' sponsor Arnold Rothstein,to more contemporary Dope, Inc. figures such as Max Fisher, Edgar Bronfman,Edmond Safra, Meshulam Riklis, the ADL's own national chairman, KennethBialkin, and the lawyer for the Medellin Cartel's 'American connection',Robert Vesco. We also discovered that much of the ADL's financial backingcomes from leading families of the Anglo-American establishment, whosefortunes trace back to the British banks and trading companies that ranthe opium clipper ships in and out of China in the last century. To this day, the ADL holds the key to the corruption of the Americanpolitical and judicial system, a corruption that was bought and paid forby the proceeds of the international dope trade. Lyndon LaRouche was railroadedto prison on a train built by drug money and stoked by government officialsand private agencies on the pad of Dope, Inc. By the summer of 1982, the ADL was joined in its 'Get LaRouche' effortsby Henry A. Kissinger, former Secretary of State and recipient of the ADL'sMan of the Year award. Kissinger launched a vendetta to get the federalgovernment to shut down the LaRouche movement. The case of LaRouche associate, Lewis du Pont Smitch, illustrates thedesperation of the efforts by Kissinger and the 'Get LaRouche' task forceto stop the LaRouche movement's organizing of a national war on drugs.An heir to the du Pont family industrial fortune, Smitch contributed US$212,000to the LaRouche movement in 1985, the bulk of it for the publication ofthe second edition of this book. Within months, Smith's parents-advisedby none other than Kissinger-had secured a judgment in the Chester Country,Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, depriving their son of control of hisinheritance and suspending his basic human rights-such as the right tosign contracts and be married-on the grounds that Smith was "mentallyincompetent". Smith's is the first case in American history in whichan individual has been declared incompetent by the courts on the basisof political affiliation. Kissinger: A British Agent of Influence Although Kissinger has been historically a close ally of the most rabidfactions inside Israel and within the Zionist establishment in the UnitedStates, his primary allegiance throughout his political career has beento the British Crown and its intelligence and financial tentacles. On 10 May 1982, addressing a celebration at the Royal Institute forInternational Affairs at Chatham House in London, Kissinger boasted thatthroughout his career in the Nixon and Ford administrations, he had alwaysbeen closer to the British Foreign Office than to his American colleagues,and had taken all his major policy leads from London. Kissinger set upthe international 'consulting firm' Kissinger Associates, in partnershipwith Britain's Peter Lord Carrington, shortly after he delivered that ChathamHouse lecture. Chatham House is a successor to the old British East India Company,and serves as the think-tank and foreign intelligence arm of the BritishCrown. The roots of Chatham House are to be found in Britain's nineteenth-centuryOpium War policy. Kissinger is no stranger to the world of international dope trafficking.The 1978 edition of Dope, Inc. told how Kissinger played a pivotal rolein covering up the involvement of the People's Republic of China in theSouth East Asian Golden Triangle heroin trade in the early 1970s when hewas shuttling between Washington and Beijing playing the 'China card'.Tens of thousands of American GIs who became addicted to drugs in SouthEast Asia during the Vietnam War should hold Kissinger at least partiallyresponsible for their habits. Later, during the 1980s, through KissingerAssociates, Henry became a business partner of some of the same Chineseopium lords he protected from American drug enforcement for over a decade. Kissinger was furious that LaRouche and his associates widely circulatedthe official text of his Chatham House speech to document that Kissingerwas a loyal asset of the British Crown. He went head-to-head with LaRoucheover Reagan administration policy. By 1982, a major battle had broken outwithin the administration over the emerging Ibero-American debt crisis,a crisis of which LaRouche had been warning senior White House officialsfor months. A confrontation evolved between LaRouch and Kissinger overwhether Washington would negotiate an equitable solution to the debt crisis,on a government-to-government basis, or back International Monetary Fundpolicies aimed at further looting our hemispheric neighbors. Kissinger's own efforts, aided by the ADL's so-called Civil Rights Division,were augmented in January 1983 by a Kissinger solicited intervention onthe part of several members of President Ronald Reagan's Foreign IntelligenceAdvisory Board, led by Edward Bettett Williams, David Abshire and Leo Cherne.The PFIAB members demanded that the FBI launch an international investigationof Lyndon LaRouche, in effect claiming that LaRouche's expose of Kissinger'srecord of selling out the United States to British, Soviet and Dope, Inc.interests was somehow "subversive". Government documents catalog the role of Kissinger's PFIAB cronies.A memorandum from Webster to his chief deputy, Oliver Revell, dated 12January 1983, stated in part: "At the PFIAB meeting today, [name reacted]raised the subject of the activities of the US Labor Party and Lyndon LaRouche.He noted that he and a number of other Americans in public life had beenthe subject of repeated harassment by LaRouche and wondered whether theFBI had a basis for investigating these activities under the guidelinesor otherwise. A number of members present, including Edward Bennett Williams,raised the question of the sources for these US Labor Party activities.In view of the large amounts obviously being expended worldwide, the questionwas raised whether the US Labor Party might be funded by hostile intelligenceagencies." (Emphasis added.) The PFIAB inquiry led in early 1983 to the opening of a formal FBI investigationinto Lyndon LaRouche and his associates. That inquiry provided the legalcover for an all-out offensive to drive LaRouche and his associates outof business and into prison. The "guidelines" under which theunconstitutional 'Get LaRouche' campaign was conducted, were containedin a little-known White House document, Executive Order 12333, signed byPresident Reagan in December 1981. EO 12333 gave the FBI and US intelligenceagencies a broad mandate to spy on and conduct covert actions against Americancitizens deemed to be opponents of the incumbent administration. EO 12333also allowed these agencies to use private citizens as their agents incarrying out these operations. At this point, the ADL became an integralcomponent of the government's 'Get LaRouche' task force. The ADL and Kissinger found their most willing collaborators insidethe Reagan-Bush administration among the spooks and White House staffersinvolved in the illegal, secret Iran-Contra program. Once again, the pawprintsof Dope, Inc. were everywhere. LaRouche Objects to Contra Policy In the first years of the Reagan administration, LaRouche had collaboratedwith several senior administration officials in the development of theStrategic Defense Initiative and other national security policies. Duringthe 1982-83 period, LaRouche and his colleagues had been quietly approachedand asked to also cooperate with the administration's effort to supportthe Contra guerrillas fighting to overthrow the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.LaRouche warned the Reagan administration that the Contras were a whollyowned asset of international gun and drug trafficking organizations andthat the entire anti-Sandinista program-and the Reagan administration'swidely publicized anti-drug efforts along with it-were doomed to disasterif the administration went ahead with its Contra support program. As analternative plan of action, LaRouche proposed that the administration focusits Central American efforts on an all out war on drugs which would, amongother things, expose Soviet, Cuban and Sandinista involvement in the dopetrade. By this time, with pressure from Wall Street and the Zionist lobby,Henry Kissinger had been named to head up the Reagan administration's BlueRibbon Commission on Central American Policy. A one-time paid employeeof the ADL, Carl Gershman, had been named as the chief of the administration'sNational Endowment for Democracy (NED), a covert operations funding agencyhoused in the State Department's US Information Agency. The NED was atthe center of the secret support for the Contras. For Kissinger and theADL-led NED, dealing with cocaine traffickers was no problem. But LaRouche'spublic expose of leading drug traffickers on the government payroll wasa problem. A May 1986 memo from White House Iran-Contra operator Gen. Richard Secordto National Security Council staffer Oliver North confirms that the Contrasupport apparatus-what Sen. David Boren (D-Oklahoma) labelled the "secret,parallel government"-was gathering "information against LaRouche". By the spring of 1986, following dramatic electoral victories in thestatewide Illinois Democratic Party primary by two LaRouche backed candidatesfor lieutenant governor and secretary of state, the "Get LaRouche"forces inside the government had built up momentum, especially inside thedeeply corrupted Department of Justice and the FBI. Two of the most zealous of the Justice Department 'Get LaRouche' activistswere William Weld and Arnold Burns. Weld was the US attorney in Bostonwho led the federal government's pioneering strike-force against LaRouche.He became head of the Department of Justice Criminal Division in September1986, the number-two position at the DOJ. Now Governor of Massachusetts,Weld is the scion of a prominent blue-blood family that made its fortunein the China opium trade. Arnold Burns, the Deputy Attorney General, was a director of the ADL'sSterling National Bank, an outfit founded by mob cronies of Meyer Lanskyand implicated in hot-money dealings in the United States, Italy and Israel.Burns himself was nearly indicted in a money-laundering scheme run by Israel'ssecret service, the Mossad. It would later emerge that Burns' partnersin that scheme were part of the Jonathan Jay Pollard Israeli-Soviet espionagering. In October 1986, an army of over 400 federal and state police, accompaniedby helicopters, fixed-wing planes and an armored personnel carrier, conducteda raid against the offices of several LaRouche-associated publicationsin Leesburg, Virginia. This was the largest domestic paramilitary actionby the federal government since the urban and student riots of the late1960s and early 1970s. The purpose was simply to execute two search warrantsand make four arrests of people who had no criminal records! Over the next several years, LaRouche and dozens of associates werearrested and put on trial. A prosecution of LaRouche and a dozen co-defendantsin a Boston federal court ended in a mistrial on 4 May 1988. The Bostonjury had heard 92 days of testimony from government witnesses. The defensenever got to present its case. However, the jurors, according to pressaccounts, were so angry at the government's behavior that when they polledthemselves after they had been dismissed by the judge, they voted LaRoucheand the others "not guilty" on all 125 counts. One juror toldthe Boston Herald on 5 May 1988 that he and his colleagues were convincedthe government had committed crimes against LaRouche. LaRouche told thepress that he had been defrauded of a verdict of "innocent". Six months later, the Justice Department re-indicted LaRouche in anAlexandria, Virginia federal district court on nearly identical charges.The judge and they jury were rigged. The jury foreman, a Department ofAgriculture official named Buster HOrton, had been a member of a secretgovernment task force that also included Oliver North. The judge, AlbertV. Bryan, Jr. had been a business partner of the CIA's biggest secret armsdealer, Sam Cummings. In that federal trial and at subsequent state trialsin Virginia, leading officials of the ADL operated as de facto membersof the government's prosecution team. In one telling incident, the ADLwas caught attempting to bribe a Commonwealth of Virginia trial judge witha promise of a state Supreme Court post in return for throwing the bookat the LaRouche defendants. On 27 January 1989, just days after George Bush was inaugurated as President,LaRouche was deprived of bail, pending appeal, and thrown in federal prison,along with six colleagues. LaRouche was sentenced to 15 years in prison-alife sentence for a man already in his mid-60's. Bush added his imprimaturto the jailing by refusing to release thousands of pages of exculpatoryevidence under the control of the White House. Of all his political adversariesand critics, Lyndon LaRouche was the one man whom George Bush desperatelywanted out of the way. But the jailing of LaRouche and some of his closest colleagues was notenough to satisfy the Dope, Inc. crowd. Two LaRouche-linked publications,New Solidarity, a twice-weekly newspaper with over 100,000 subscribers,and Fusion a science magazine with over 114,000 subscribers were seizedby the government on 21 April 1987 and shut down in an action that federalcourts after the fact declared to have been illegal. Federal BankruptcyCourt Judge Martin V. B. Bostetter wrote in his 25 October 1989 decision,which was upheld on appeal, that the government action had been in "badfaith" and that the government had committed a "constructivefraud upon the court". When Lyndon LaRouche first warned senior Reagan administration officialsabout the drug cartel links of the Nicaraguan Contras, it was not yet publiclyknown that the US government was selling dope to American children to fundthe secret Contra war in Nicaragua (even at the same time that some well-meaninggovernment officials thought they were genuinely fighting drugs). Within days of the Leesburg raid, the first details of the Iran Contrascandal surfaced following the crash of an American supply plane over Nicaraguanterritory and the arrest of Eugene Hasenfus, a member of the crew. In themonths following the Hasenfus capture, more and more pieces of the secretgovernment corruption came out. The case of Lt. Col. Oliver North is one good example of this corruption,especially because so much media attention has been directed toward buildingup the image of the Marine-turned-White House superspy as a model of Americanpatriotism. Evidence made public during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings,through federal and state court cases and international criminal prosecutions,reveals that Oliver North was in the middle of a major international arms-for-drugstrafficking operations which was run out of his National Security Counciloffice at the Old Executive Office building next door to the White House. Colonel North was the day-to-day operations officer for the Contra resupplyprogram. But it was Vice-President George Bush, the former CIA Director,who was formally in charge of the entire Reagan administration CentralAmerica covert operations program. Under National Security Decision Directive3, signed by Ronald Reagan in May 1982, Bush was placed in charge of twolittle-known White House secret committees: the Special Situation Group(SSG) and the Crisis Pre-Planning Group (CPPG). Oliver NOrth was the secretaryof the CPPG, and it was in this capacity that he ran the Central Americaspook show under George Bush. North's personal notebooks, which cataloged most of his meetings, telephonecalls and personal observations during his White House days, betray thefact that he was well aware that the Contras were being heavily financedby Miami-based cocaine traffickers. For example, a 26 March 1985 handwrittenentry in North's notebook read: "Rafael Quintero-Secord's Agent shouldbe on shore when arrivals occur-as liaison w/ APLICANO...Quintero..."Several days later, on 3 April, a sequel note reads: "0600-RAFAELQUINTERO-(captured)-known narcotics trafficker-Enrique Camarena..". Camarena was a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in Guadalajara,Mexico, who was kidnapped and tortured to death in February 1985. In 1990,Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a Honduran national who helped set up Colombiancocaine routes through Mexico, was convicted along with several other menin federal court in Los Angeles of conspiracy to kidnap and murder Camarena. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= vii. BEYOND THE MOON surpressed NASA findings by Fred Steckling suppliedby The P/\NTHER/UMF This article does not deal with the Moon directly, but ventures fartherout into our solar system. Today, despite our Mariner and Viking missionsto Venus and Mars, the mystery about our neighbor planets has only widenedand most questions still remain unexplained. The most pressing questionof all is, does life exist on these worlds? Many scientists have voicedtheir opinion that unless we send manned spacecraft concerning life onthese worlds may never satisfactorily be explained. The late Werner VonBraun, rocket specialist for NASA, once stated that manned space flightsare by far more efficient than the remote controlled devices. Man, afterall, is performing his tasks in space more efficiently than any computerever could. "Besides", Braun remarked, "Man can be massproduced by unskilled labor." The mysteries mount because already from the early analysis of the UnitedStates Mariner and the Soviet Venera missions to Venus, many contradictoryfindings were reported. Since these mysteries cannot be explored by telescopesas the planets are too far away, we must rely totally on data radioed backto Earth by the satellites. Over the centuries our Moon, for instance,has been the target for endless hours of telescopic observations. Theseobservations have revealed to us that at least some unexplainable thingsare happening up there. The problem is, however, that even now after ourApollo landings, these mysteries still remain. This indicates that we knowwhat is going on, to some extent, but hesitate to talk about it. Receiving correct information from our space probes on Venus and Marsmakes it easier to conceal information, if we wish to do so. Therefore,it is for the officials to determine whether to release this truth, oruntruth, over which they retain complete control. If we would live in atruthful world, it would be easy to accept all that we are told. But mostof us know better. Suspecting the very real possibility of "the greatcosmic cover-up" as some authors have termed it, the public needsto maintain a constant vigil on the officials and the validity of theirreleases. Much "between the lines" reading is required as wellas an unrelenting search for contradictory statements to the press andpublic, in order to seize the 'wool' before it is pulled too far over theeyes of the public. We live in a privileged country and our constitutional rights permitus to question the officials, as well as our leaders. In our country wherethe government is of the people, by the people, and for the people, thisrelationship must be maintained under all circumstances, in order thatour freedom may be preserved. Freedom alone, contrary to the belief of many, is not just the rightfor anyone to do as he pleases, but it also entails the duty to seek andmaintain the truth about things of a political, economic, and religiousnature. No doubt the technical feat of steering a remote-controlled spacecraftto the endless voids of space and locating its target with such accuracyis a great engineering undertaking. Intricate mathematical and ballisticproblems must be solved in order to succeed in these missions. We knowthey arrived there, but is the data they send back bonafide? The signals received here on Earth by our tracking stations were sendin a code, deciphered only by the very top scientists through sophisticateddecoding equipment. The point I am trying to make is simple. While thesebeeps, dots, and dashes are witnessed by literally hundreds of scientists,how many of them really know what this jargon means before it is decoded?It is obvious that only a few do and we have to trust them. I recall discrepancieswhich arose when the United States Mariner spacecraft and the Soviet Veneraspacecraft radioed back to Earth temperature differences from Venus, rangingup to 400 degrees fahrenheit. Naturally both nations claimed technicalsuperiority, insisting that their instruments were of superior design.Because of this conflict, secret meetings in Europe by the space expertsfrom the United States and the USSR were held in order to coordinate theirreleases, as such confusion causes the public to become dissatisfied, wondering,skeptical and restless. The soft landing devices on Venus caused much more controversy thananticipated. We were told that Venus is the Earth's sister planet, verymuch the same size as Earth, but that its atmospheric density is over onehundred times as dense as that of Earth, and is laden with sulfuric acid.People would have accepted that. However, when the officials stated thatthese spacecraft landed on Venus by parachute, that stretched the imagination.The explanation is simple. It is impossible to parachute an object of thissize, weight, and density to the surface of Venus through an atmosphereone hundred times as dense as Earth. That is like attempting to parachutethis same device 2,000 feet down to the bottom of our sea, with pressuresidentical to those of the Venusian atmosphere. Even scientists at NASAconfirmed this fact, indirectly, not with the planet Venus, but with Titan,Saturn's moon. The NASA press release of December 12, 1980, stated thatTitan had a 300-mile thick atmosphere, hence its surface cannot be seen.The conditions there seem to be identical to those on Venus. If futurespacecraft entitled the Cronos probe were to be send to Titan to land byparachute, NASA space expert, James Murphy, indicated the parachute wouldnot work, because the atmosphere of Titan is too dense. If the atmosphere of Venus is really over one hundred times as denseas ours, a landing device would float to its surface by itself, like apearl down into the bottom of a shampoo bottle. This would make a parachutelanding unnecessary. Furthermore, a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheitproduces violent thermals. I doubt seriously that even if the Venusianatmosphere were identical to ours that it would be a simple matter to landa parachute there, because of thermal activity. When the USSR landed one of its Venera spacecraft on the surface ofVenus, it transmitted some excellent photographs, depicting a bright landscapeof hills and rocks, much like our deserts on Earth. This caused even greatersurprise, because an atmosphere that dense should produce total darknesson the surface of Venus. how they managed to photograph this well lit landscape,emitting an abundance of sunlight, has been a continuing mystery. This posed other questions, such as the reports of mapping the surfaceof Venus by radar. If this would be possible, then we should be able tomap our own ocean floors by radar. However, this is not possible becauseon earth the water reflects the radar beams and so do water vapor clouds,which have also been detected on Venus. One would assume that with thedensity and consistency of water, we should instead attempt to use sonarto map the surface of Venus. From the charts recently released, the radartechniques seems to work well, which raises doubts that the Venusian atmosphereis really as dense as we are being told. Just recently released findings by the USSR, which is exhibiting muchinterest in Venus, revealed the discovery of electromagnetic dischargesin the form of lighting flashes on that planet. Their spacecraft, Venera11, also recorded a forceful storm ninety miles wide, with lighting dischargesat the rate of twenty-five per second. United States scientists said thatthis was rather remarkable, because nobody expected to find lightning onVenus. Naturally, they are surprised because an atmosphere over one hundredtimes as dense as ours, laden with sulfuric acid, would be self-grounding,making lighting highly improbable. Does this mean now that we are fed untrueinformation deliberately? Or does this mean that the officials are tryingto tell us something, very much like they did with the Moon? Not outrightrevelations, but here and there, a bit of contradiction to make us think. There are more surprises to be found on Venus, and one of them is itscloud formations, which totally envelop the planet. Rotation of Venus wasdetermined by radar, as well as by other means, to be every 280 days, oncearound its axis. Let us hope that this was correctly performed. Photographsof the Venusian cloud patterns, and the behavior of their weather, at leastin the upper atmosphere, is quite familiar to us, because it looks verymuch like our own. The cloud patterns move away from the equator area towardthe northern and southern hemisphere in clockwise and counterclockwisefashion, and it takes them about four days to go around the planet once.One begins to wonder why these clouds behave just like those on Earth,which also take about the same time to move around the Earth. In otherwords, what makes the clouds move? The contradictions continue, one being the importance of having allUnited States landing spacecraft on Venus thoroughly sterilized. This bringsup the question of the necessity of sterilization in an 800 degree fahrenheitatmosphere, which is four times as hot as boiling water. It is true thatcertain bacteria can survive, and even reproduce under many hostile conditions,like the cooling water surrounding nuclear reactors, in tanks of jet aircraft,or in jars of gasoline, as one scientist in Los Angeles demonstrated tome.. Even below, deep in our oceans around hot volcanic geysers, certainstrains of bacteria survive, as well as algae. I am certain that commonbacteria, such as we are exposed to on the surface of the Earth daily,would not enjoy longevity on Venus, should it be as hot there as we havebeen informed. Speaking of contamination of other planets, it has been found that micro-organismshave been traced, even to the far reaches of space, which probably weredeposited there by the trail of Earth's atmosphere, or perhaps even otherplanets. Since these organisms seem to survive in hibernation almost indefinitely,they may in time become part of another atmosphere in another planet, attractedby its gravity, and gently flow toward its surface and multiply. If thisis true, then indeed we live in a chemical universe, where one planet "pollutes"another with seeds of life. This no doubt is an interesting thought, worthwhileto consider in our quest of Nature's secrets in outer space and other worlds. We have high temperatures in the Earth's ionosphere. About 180 milesup, where the cosmic solar rays strike the outer region of our atmosphere,a tremendous friction is generated from he disintegration of atmosphericmolecules. Temperatures of up to 1800 degrees fahrenheit have been measuredthere. Could it be that the high temperature readings of the planet Venusfound their origin in the Venusian ionosphere as our spacecraft descendedthrough it? This is certainly something to consider. Another interesting explanation concerning temperatures is that thesun is positive and the planets are negative, and all are floating in asea of electromagnetic energy. Solar rays are attracted by each planetarybody differently in intensity and velocity, according to the size of theplanet. If this is correct, it would explain why the temperatures in outerspace are 360 degrees below zero, no matter whether it is in space, aroundVenus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, or even farther out. It would also explainwhy the larger planets such as Jupiter and Saturn reflect more heat. Ifthe Sun sends out heat, then why is it 360 degrees below zero in outerspace? The gravity of Jupiter and Saturn is much higher than Earth's gravity.In this case, should my ideas be correct, these larger planets would attractthe solar rays with a much higher velocity and intensity than Venus andthe Earth and even the Moon. In fact, cosmic ray bombardment on the Moonshould be one-sixth in intensity in this case. On the other hand, the friction generated on Jupiter and Saturn whenthese rays strike their atmosphere, causes these planets to receive heatand warmth. This explains from whence their heat is generated. According to present theories, any planet farther out than Mars is anice world or frozen rock. This theory was shaken when our recent Voyagerspacecraft discovered volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io. In fact,Jupiter and Saturn have been compared to individual solar systems, withmany of their satellites, of which more and more are discovered each day,producing nothing but mysteries for us. Granted that my idea does not provethat it is correct, but at least I offer some explanation regarding a multitudeof unexplained questions. On the other hand, our old accepted theories certainly have not producedany satisfactory explanations either. In other words, their ideas are neitherbetter nor worse than mine. The next planet I would like to mention is Mars. When the United Statessucceeded in the successful landing of the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft in1976, there was great rejoicing among the people of the Earth. This wasan achievement well worthy of the celebration. After the excitement abatedsomewhat, certain nagging questions surfaced concerning some of the reportsreleased to the public regarding the planet Mars. I covered these eventsthoroughly and in 1976, in late Autumn, I was compelled to write and articlefor a national magazine, entitled "Life on Mars". This articlewas also later reprinted in Europe and Japan. I herewith reproduce it,with only minor changes. "For centuries man, on this earth, has wondered whether or not'life' existed elsewhere on the distant planets that could be seen passingthrough the heavens at night. Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, togetherwith Venus, our second closest neighbor, would be the most logical placesto assume that there is life close to what we know it to be. "It probably all started with the Italian astronomer, GiovanniSchiaparelli, who in 1877, reported the famous 'Canali' or canals on Mars.Only intelligent beings could have built such structures, it was suggested. "Later, at the turn of the century, Percival Lowell, who, fromhis observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona in 1906, became the ranking experton Mars' observations. He, too, reported and supported Schiaparelli's 'Canali'. "Still later, the world renowned newscaster and actor Orson Wellssucceeded in frightening millions of Americans with his famous radio broadcastof 1938, War of the World, portraying it as a real life invasion by beingsfrom Mars landing in New Jersey. "Decades later, during the 1960's, Soviet astronomers announcedto an astonished scientific world that their close studies of the planetMars had revealed that both moons of the Red Planet were thought to beartificial man-made satellites. Their observations, based on several verypuzzling facts, led to this conclusion. Both of the Martians 'moons' wereorbiting too close to the planet, only 3700 miles away. Normally they shouldcrash into the planet in time. Also both moons reflected too much lightto be natural. Probably the most puzzling fact of all was that both areorbiting the planet in a clockwise direction. All other known planetarybodies and satellites whirl in a counterclockwise direction> Even theentire Milky Way galaxy with its countless number of stars turns counterclockwise,but not the two little moons of Mars. Granted, the idea of two orbitingbodies, one five miles in diameter and the other ten miles being artificial,is a bit controversial and stretches the imagination. "November 16, 1969, a noted space scientist and astronomer, thelate Dr. Harold C. Urey, stated some things just as startling as his Sovietcolleagues. Dr. Urey, speaking at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston,Texas, said, "We should be very careful in sending manned spacecraftto the planet Mars as the 'life' there may be hostile and could preventthe astronauts from returning to earth." Dr. Urey was a Nobel prizewinner in chemistry. In the same article he also defended the space program,stating that we can afford it, for it costs only one-half of one percentof the gross national product. "Turning the pages to 1976 and our recent Viking Missions to theRed Planet, it seems that we have certainly proven all these men wrong,or have we? It may surprise some of you, but after endless hours of studyand investigation into our two missions to Mars, I must say NO, we haveNOT proven these men wrong at all. In the following pages I shall endeavorto explain my findings for your own evaluation in the most logical waypossible. "The reaction of the general public can be broken down as follows:40% were disappointed in the total negative viewpoint of the Viking mission,and 50% definitely believe that intelligent life does exist on Mars andthat the officials in charge of the program are covering up for some reason,while 10% think that the Viking probes were not sent to Mars at all butrather to the Moon. All in all, there exists a great public mistrust ofour officials and their ethics. Undoubtedly, some mistrust is present dueto the past cover-ups and accusations that have come forth from some ofour government agencies, one against the other. "I do feel that we managed to land these two probes on the planetMars, but that their true findings and most pictures are classified materialwhich to this day have not been shown. "My research has resulted in the following findings: "We were told that Mars is about one-half the size of the earth,with a surface gravity of about 40% in relation to our own earth and thatthe atmospheric pressure is some 7.7 millibars in comparison to about onethousand milibars on earth. The Martian atmospheric density is reportedto be less that 1% of that of earth. We were also told that the Martiantemperatures in Fahrenheit ranged from -22 degrees below zero at earlyafternoon to -122 degrees below zero at night. Viking One, which landedclose to the Martian equator, recorded a colder temperature than VikingTwo, which touched down some one thousand miles farther north, closer tothe polar caps. Atmospheric measurements. The argon content of the Martain atmospherewas not 30% as they had thought but only 3%. A mistake of the same magnitudewas admitted when a much higher water vapor reading was received then wehave thought possible from earth measurements. "Dr. George Sands, of Mission Control, stated, 'It is obviouslywetter than we anticipated. There is ground fog at the landing site duringpart of the day. Thirty microns of water have been found in the atmosphere,enough to cause not only ground fog but also frost and snow.' "I am not a scientist, but I have studied meteorology enough tobe able to say that the evidence of ground fog on Mars proves that temperaturesthere are much warmer than we are told by the official reports. Groundfog is a product of warm moist air moving across cool land masses or water.Ground fog, as with any type of fog, is a product of temperatures abovethe freezing level of 32 degrees Fahrenheit. "It is also interesting to note that evaporation clouds have beenphotographed at an estimated altitude of fifteen thousand feet AGL (aboveground level). I can assure you that condensation clouds or any other cloudsincluding simple ground fog cannot exist at the reported atmospheric pressureof only 7.7 millibars. Evaporation clouds on earth may reach up to fortythousand feet, but even at that altitude our atmospheric pressure is stilltwo hundred millibars, enough to support such clouds. "We are told that evaporation clouds exist up to fifteen thousandfeet on Mars. The temperatures, therefore, must be ABOVE the freezing pointof 32 degrees Fahrenheit up to at least fifteen thousand feet. When risingmoist air moves upward it condenses at a given altitude and forms cloudsat given altitudes depending upon the temperatures. This we call the dewpointlevel. One must note at this point that low temperatures such as the reported-122 degrees Fahrenheit on Mars may certainly exist in certain zones butnot everywhere. We have recorded temperatures of -127 degrees Fahrenheithere on Earth at the Antarctica, and we know that life exists here on thisplanet. "Regarding the Viking landers, we find some other unexplained pointsto ponder. "The Viking landers were reported to have an earth weight of twelvehundred pounds. According to our reports of the Martian gravity the landerswould weigh approximately four hundred eighty pounds. The parachute wasfifty feet in diameter. A fifty foot parachute with a weight of four hundredeighty pounds dangling from it would slow that payload down sufficientlyin the earth's atmosphere for a proper adjustment in velocity at retro-rocketfiring. However, in the low density fo the Martain atmosphere, as we aretold (less than one percent of ours), a fifty foot parachute would haveno slowing effect at all. It is even doubtful that in the legendary atmospherethere exists enough air molecules to open the chute. Calculating the sizeof the parachute needed in such a thin atmosphere, the canopy would haveto be some seventy five hundred feet in diameter. The question then ariseswhere would such a thing be stored and what would such a load weigh? Certainlyat least two thousand pounds. It would take up about two hundred squarefeet of space to store it. That is more cubic space and weight than theentire lander itself. So, since they did use a fifty foot chute the airon Mars is much more dense than they tell us. I would say a density ofabout 40% of that of earth. "The lander on the fifty foot chute separated at four thousandfeet AGL, and activated its three descent rockets, which, like giganticblow torches, slowed down the craft to a successful soft landing. However,the three rocket engines develop not only thousands of degrees of heatbut immense thrust. These two factors not only completely sterilized thelanding site before touchdown, but blew away all the soil of biologicalvalue for a least one hundred feet surrounding the lander. We should questionthe ability to find any signs of life in such soil. The scientists shouldhave questioned this. Maybe they did. In the meantime, that little shovelkeeps on digging and searching in that sterilized soil. "The magazine 'Scientific American' had this to say in a recentarticle on Mars: 'The Martian environment is by no means so hostile asto exclude LIFE. Our hopes for obtaining a definitive answer from the Vikingmission should not be too high.' "Other interesting points are to be found. For example, sand duneson Mars photographed by the 'orbiter' have the same height and the samedune to dune spacing as earth's sand dunes to be found in the Sangre deChristo mountains in Colorado. In a Martain atmosphere of less than onepercent of ours these sand dunes could under no circumstances be there! "It has been suggested that hurricane-like winds of two hundredmph or better are needed to move these grains of sand on Mars but up tonow there has been no logical explanation as to where these two hundredmph winds come from in a total sub-zero environment. Again, Mars must bewarmer in at least some regions to create wind of any speed in the firstplace. As we know, wind is created by warm air rising from the ground tobe replaced by colder air masses filling in the gap. The Viking landeronly recorded winds up to forty mph, not two hundred. So, how did the dunesget there? Even better, how did the wind get there in an atmosphere thatis only one percent of earth's and at a temperature of -120 degrees Fahrenheit? "I think that we have to be sensible about all of this, for itcan be seen that too many things just don't seem to make logical sense.Certainly if we can figure this out the scientists and others working onthe project can. Some talk from both sides of the mouth does seem to betaking place. "Viking 2 reveals that the polar caps of Mars are plain snow, justfrozen water. Also, that it snows often, and the atmosphere above the polesis saturated with water vapor. Sounds good? Let us continue. A NASA articlereports that the poles of Mars are all frozen water with temperatures of-90 degrees Fahrenheit to -120 degrees Fahrenheit. The article continuesby saying, 'The North Pole is now going through its summer, so the icecap is as small as it ever gets.' I would like to know how ice in sub-zerotemperatures as reported above can MELT! "Dr. Martin, who has just recently resigned his position with PasadenaViking Control, said at the International Academy of Astronautics, 'Ourbiology instruments on Mars have received positive signs of LIFE in formsof biology even though we cannot find organics.' It is amazing that theyhave found even those little signs at such a blow-torched landing site. "Analysis of the Martian environment has so far shown that thereis carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sufficient amounts of water vapor. Arenot these the basic ingredients for LIFE? "Quoting NASA from Pasadena, 'If we would have placed the Vikinglanders in our Pasadena parking lot and received the same chemical andbiological readings from there as we are now receiving from Mars, we wouldhave called it a definite sign of life.' I leave it to you to figure outwhat the might mean. "I feel that so long as we are going to send probes out to otherworlds with our assumptions that life is unique only to our little earth,instead of being able to see that all worlds are basically made up of thesame 'stuff', we shall continue to be plagued with unyielding difficultiesand insoluble questions. "Planets do not only receive warmth from their sun in forms offriction by rays striking their atmospheres, but also by the same process,warmth from the planet is drawn out of its body, radiating and warmingup the atmosphere. All planets need an atmosphere simply to equalize thepressures set up from within. No planet could exist without air, for itwould disintegrate otherwise in a given time. "The water quantity on Mars has been analyzed to be sufficientto cover their whole planet with an ocean of ONE MILE in depth, shouldall its water now in and under the ground be released. While the polarcaps themselves show a thickness measuring one-half mile. "Perhaps the Italian astronomer Schiaparelli's earlier reportsof the Martian channels do not all seem so impossible when they are comparedwith Dr. Daniel J. Milton's recent findings. Dr. Milton, a geologist withthe U.S. Geological Survey, stated in 'Science Newsfront': 'We have photographedthe Martian mystery channels. They resemble huge flood channels some twenty-fourmiles wide and several hundred miles long, shaped by sudden dischargesof water that dwarf the flow of the Amazon River.' "Finally, here is a report from the wires of the AP: 'New picturesof Mars' northern regions reveal mysterious patters, resembling contourplowing on the planet's red surface and scientists say they cannot finda natural explanation. 'We are getting some strange things. It is verypuzzling,' said Michael Carr, member of the team interpreting picturesof Mars from the Viking 2 orbiter. Carr stated that the newest picturesof the target zone showed striped patterns that resemble an aerial photographof a farmer's field after plowing. 'The stripes are too regular to be ofnatural causes,' Carr stated. But what caused them? 'I really can't tellyou all of the possibilities that were suggested.' Carr responded. 'Butmany suggestions were that it was MAN MADE.' "I would like to point out the most important fact that the suggestionof man-made plowing by the Viking scientists was made AFTER Viking Onecould not find life on Mars as we were looking for it. "To conclude this article, I would like to give credit where creditis due and report that even as we receive double talk on the extra-terrestrialfindings, we have, as a civilization, gained enormous knowledge by venturingout into space. We have learned more about our earth from out there byobservation and photography than is presently realized by the general public.Space satellites placed into earth orbit have revealed our global pollutionproblems. We have learned about the weather patterns, the ocean currents,mineral deposits, soil analysis, flood control, forestry service, and higheryield agricultural areas, both presently cultivated and those as yet unused. "Through out earth orbiting probes we have also found that we arenot always perfect. In the early days we received reports that life couldnot exist even on our own planet. Those probes reported back that therewas not enough water vapor or oxygen to support life as we know it on Earth!Therefore we know that the probes are not always accurate. Much dependsupon the pressures and amount of magnetism that surrounds the probes inspace when the readings are taken. "As it is yet to be revealed, Man's futures on this earth willdepend upon outer space research and exploration for it is from out therethat he will be able to evaluate that small world he now calls 'home'.But one day when things become unbearable, we will be forced to ventureout to find other worlds ready for inhabitation. "Every dollar spend in this program is well spent. It can keepmany busy in the peaceful way, while he is learning. The space programhas all the potentials to allow man to one day explore space and work togetheras brothers, so thoroughly occupied in it, that there is no time left forfoolish wars that only add additional woes and miseries to mankind. "Man calls himself the most intelligent creature on Earth. He willsoon have the Golden Opportunity to prove it." Bradford D. Smith, NASA scientist and head of the 1980 Voyager's photographicmission to Saturn, had this statement to make, which I feel covers or explainssome of the mysteries that have baffled us about outer space. Smith stated,"With any scientific investigation of this magnitude, many of ourlong-standing theories-those cherished interpretations of the Universearound us, are going to become casualties." Dr. Robert Jastrow, the founder and director of NASA's Goddard Institutefor space studies, was interviewed by science reported Marcia Golub ofthe Special Science Digest magazine, Spring edition of 1980. In this revealingarticle, titled "Life on Mars", Dr. Jastrow states very positivelythat life exists there. From his studies of the Viking data, there is nodoubt, Jastrow admitted, that at least some form of primitive life existson Mars. Dr. Jastrow now teaches at both Columbia University and Darthmouth College."But even primitive life forms such as microbes are quite complicatedforms of life," Dr. Jastroy concluded, "because these would settlethe question: 'Is Life common in the cosmos?' We can be sure that humanityis not alone, that planets circling other stars must be swarming with life,and that in solar systems older than ours, this life may be far more advancedthan humanity on Earth." Reporter Golub asked Dr. Jastrow this important question: "Do youthink there is life on Mars? Some scientists disagree. Why?" Dr. Jastrow answered, "My only comment is that scientific cautionis fine if you spend $30.00 of your own money. But if you spend millionsof dollars of somebody else's money, you have to stand the heat. Also scientistsare very sensitive to being wrong." During the Viking 1 microbe test on Mars, nutrients with radioactivecarbon was the food presented to possible Martian microbes. If the microbesate the food, they would exhale radioactive carbon dioxide, and if thegeiger counter clicked, the microbes were eating the food. The geiger counterclicked thousands of times. While many of the Viking scientists tried toexplain this positive result as a way of being merely a chemical reaction,several others, such as Dr. Jastrow, for instance, insisted that this reactionwas a biological one. As a matter of fact, the Viking 2 test produced exactlythe same positive reaction, as the Martian microbes ate away the radioactivecarbon laden nutrients. Nevertheless, the arguments continued as to whetherthese tests were chemical or biological reactions. The soil samples were stored for several months in the Viking landerstorage area and the microbe test was again repeated, and this time thegeiger counter signal disappeared. Dr. Jastrow explains that if one storesliving organisms in the dark, without food and water for several months,they die. This was the convincing fact arguing for the existence of Martian microbes,as the first sign of life on Mars. Dr. Jastrow also stated that Dr. Levin,who did the microbe test, also believes that these test results prove lifeon Mars. But using Jastrow's own words, "Dr. Levin has been a littlerestrained by peer pressure from the Viking team." Chief biologist Chuck Klein now admits that on the basis of the Viking1 and 2 microbe tests, the conclusion would have to be drawn that metabolizingorganisms were definitely present in all the samples tested. "Thatmeans life on Mars exists," Dr. Klein stated. Dr. Jastrow concludes with these remarks: "The taxpayer got a betterreturn on the money he invested in Mars than he realized, but nobody hastold him. It has killed the Mars exploration program." In certain scientific circles, it has been common knowledge for quitesome time now, that life exists on the Moon, on Mars, and many other planetsas well. Just because the general public is not aware of this fact doesnot make it less true. While Dr. Jastrow is a very cautious man, revealingonly primitive life forms on Mars, other scientists are more outspoken. One retired physicist with whom I had the privilege of spending an afternoon,in the summer of 1980, discussed life on other worlds, UFOs, and theirpropulsion methods quite openly with me. This gentleman related to me,with revealing candor, that several friends of his, all top scientists,had been taken to the Moon and Mars by the extraterrestrials. There areseveral secret bases here on Earth, above the 15,000 foot level in mountainousareas, where alien spacecraft land. These voyages, this scientist acknowledgedto me, are not joy rides, but have an extremely valuable scientific purpose. In addition, George Adamski reported in his book, Inside The Space Ships,that on many of his voyages into space, during the 1950's, top scientistswere also taken along. Whatever these gentlemen learned from these voyageswere later put into constructive use, without revealing the source of theirinformation. Adamski was also told by his contacts that while the air is very thinon the Moon, there are certain areas where even Earth men could walk aroundwithout a space suit and air tanks, but it would take twenty-four hoursof depressurization to get their bodies acclimated to this condition. Hewas also told that those men from other planets visiting the Moon mustexperience the same procedure of depressurization. The scientist with whom I conversed in the summer of 1980 revealed tome very much the same information. He stated that when this group of selectedscientists reached the Moon, they were told by their hosts they could takea walk on the surface without space suits. Nevertheless, they were givensmall oxygen bottles with the explanation that they would feel very ill,very shortly, in those conditions to which they were unaccustomed. Theydid not go through twenty-four hours of depressurization. This group waslater taken to planet Mars where they, to their surprise, found it to beinhabited with human beings. They were told that about six hundred millionpeople live on Mars, and that the surface air pressure at sea level wasequal to a 20,000 foot altitude here on earth. Since Mars is a bit smallerthan one-half of Earth, this air pressure seemed to be sufficient enoughthere because of less gravitational attraction. A one hundred pound Earthperson would weigh less than fifty pounds on Mars. Even though this story sounds rather fantastic, I have no reason todisbelieve this gentleman, who struck me as a very mentally alert and honestman, still engaged in electromagnetic research in a private capacity. Asa matter of fact, he too has been invited to take the same trip into outerspace as his friends did some time ago. He told me that he would shareall the information upon his return, whenever that will be. The book, Alternative 3, speaks of a secret Mars mission by the U.S.A.and the U.S.S.R. in 1962. According to the authors of this book, a copyof this secret Mars tape and the special decoder were stolen from NASAin the United States, and transported to Britain via Canada. There thistape was shown to top officials and scientists in the late 70's. This taperevealed that on May 22, 1962, these two super powers, in a consolidatedeffort, landed a remote-controlled spacecraft on Mars, which reported atemperature and atmospheric pressure sufficient to support life as we knowit. Alternative 3 was written by three well-known British television reporters,which produced a TV program with that same title, shown by the BBC TV networkin 1977, with the book following in June, 1979. The retired physicist whohad presented me with the information concerning the Moon and Mars, alsopointed out to me that the book Alternative 3, contained a vast amountof truth. Searching for this type of truth is not an easy matter because the governmentsinvolved in such projects prefer to clamp a tight lid on their findings.However, in time, the truth will always be revealed, because only a fewmen can take such secrets into their graves, and sooner or later, informationwill leak out. To receive the total picture of the truth, those of us who are interestedin finding it must never cease to investigate every little part of it,patiently piecing together the puzzle picture until we see it clearly.It has been said that "Man know the truth and it shall make you free."The involvement of man's intellect or his mind alone is not enough, asoften truth is revealed to us through intuitive feeling, or hunches, whichcome to us through conscious awareness. I feel that man will have no chance to see the total picture of truth,unless he uses both elements of his being, his mind and his conscious awareness,in harmony. Only then he will be able to see the total picture of the truthand at the same time be capable of handling it. *END* -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Only You can prevent New World Order RETURN TO INDEXWT03-B18-103IA019-000202-B043-332http://www.kevinmitnick.com:80/umf/panther/submoon.html 206.16.251.69 19970106192322 text/html 5075HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Monday, 06-Jan-97 19:27:21 GMTServer: WebSite/1.1Allow-ranges: bytesAccept-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thursday, 10-Oct-96 09:00:53 GMTContent-length: 4858   Nuclear Subselene Tunneling Machines On the Moon?    From the book "Underground Bases and Tunnels, by RichardSauder, Ph.D., ISBN 0-9644979-0-5 Nuclear Subselene Tunneling Machines On the Moon? No discussion of government plans for secret tunnelingprojects would be complete without considering NASA's plans for tunnelingon the Moon. 1980s documents from Los Alamos National Laboratory and from Texas A&MUniversity (under contract to NASA) indicate that there are plans to use"nuclear subselene tunneling machines" to melt tunnels underthe Moon's surface, to make living, working, mining and transportationfacilities for a lunar colony. A 1986 Los Alamos report calls for using a fission powered, nuclearsubselene to provide the heat to "melt rock and form a self-supporting,glass-lined tunnel suitable for Maglev or other high-speed transport modes."The report recommends burrowing beneath the surface because of the harshlunar environment. (This would apply to Mars as well. --SW) It furthermentions that the tunnels would 'need to be hundreds, or thousands of kilometerslong ..." The actual subselenes would be automatic devices, remotelyoperated. In 1986, Los Alamos estimated each subselene could be built forabout $50 million and transported to the Moon for anywhere from $155 millionto $2,323 million. The price tag may seem exorbitantly high, but rest assuredthat there is easily that much, and more, available in the military's "black"budget for covert projects. It should be noted that the report did notspecify how the subselenes and their crews would be transported to theMoon. (Large, triangular combination jet/ion-drive powered 'antigravity'craft, or other advanced technologies generally unknown to the public?--SW) A 1988 Texas A&M study outlined plans for a slightly different modelof lunar tunnel boring machine. The Texas A&M "Lunar Tunneler"would employ a "mechanical head to shear its way through the lunarmaterial while creating a rigid ceramic-like lining". Essentially,this kind of machine would be a hybrid, mechanical TBM (Tunnel Boring Machine)that incorporates elements of the nuclear powered subselene. Although themachine would be nuclear powered it would have a mechanical cutter headthat would bore through the lunar subsurface. Just behind the cutter headwould be a "heating section" that would "melt a layer oflunar material within the excavated tunnel to a depth of only a few inches.This molten material could then be cooled to form a rigid ceramic materialsuitable for lining the interior of the tunnel." The Texas A&M designers considered a couple of different muck disposalschemes. The two variants of the first called for the muck to be transferredvertically to the surface and either dumped or "sprayed" intoa tailings pile. The second concept called for the use of special, tunneldump trucks that would carry the muck out of the tunnel and dump it onthe lunar surface. The designers recommend use of a SP-100 fission reactorfor power, using liquid lithium heat pipes of the sort developed by theLos Alamos National Laboratory for the nuclear subterrene. A second Texas A&M study, released in May 1988, also recommendeduse of a lithium cooled nuclear reactor as the power source for a lunartunneler. In the second tunneler design, there are no mechanical tunnelingcomponents. Instead, the cone-shaped, nuclear powered tunneler melts itsway through the subsurface like a subterrene. Some of the melted rock andsoil is plastered against the tunnel walls to form a glass-like ceramictunnel lining. The rest of the melted muck (called regolith) is passedout of the back of the tunneler and then carried to the surface for thedisposal by the dump trucks that follow the tunneler through the tunnel. I don't know if there are nuclear tunneling machines secretly makingpermanent bases and tunnels on the moon. But NASA plans certainly givecause to wonder. (And some of the images from the Clementine and Apollo missions ofthe numerous anomalous structures on the surface of moon, especially thenear infrared images which Richard Hoagland believes show a network ofstructures both above and below the lunar surface, give even more causeto wonder. --SW) BACKWT03-B18-104IA019-000202-B043-100http://www.kevinmitnick.com:80/umf/panther/marspics.htm 206.16.251.69 19970106191947 text/html 1525HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Monday, 06-Jan-97 19:23:47 GMTServer: WebSite/1.1Allow-ranges: bytesAccept-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wednesday, 11-Sep-96 07:58:43 GMTContent-length: 1307         MARS: CYDONIA REGION, FACE & PYRAMIDS ROTATIONAL PHOTOS OF THE FACE SHOW THAT IT IS SYMETRICAL MARS MOON PHOBOS AND 15 1/2MILE LONG UFO PHOTO BY RUSSIAN PROBE PHOBOSII.

The ability to take the simulation directly to the shop floor, allows users to eliminate time and inefficiencies associated with Silicon Graphics based systems costing up to 3 times the price of Workspace. Workspace 4.0 is the culmination of over 10 years of development to create a seamless simulation to programming application. Workspace 4.0 utilizes the latest in 32-bit graphics technology to give users GUI and screen representations that rival the Silicon Graphics machines. With reflective screen shading and solid 3D modeling, users will see their simulations come to life on the screen. Workspace is the first seamless off-line robot programming system that allows users to program the simulation robot in the native language of their controller. The benefit is an immediate capability to download to the robot for testing and evaluation. There is no limit to the number of robots, brands and models that can be mixed within the simulation and programs written simultaneously to the cell design process.  Workspace runs on the #1 selling PC platform, Windows 95, and is suitable for Windows NT. The portability of running on a personal computer or notebook allows users to take the applications out of the design room and directly to the production floor. This puts the power of engineering directly to the production line.  Off-line programming has been deemed in the "Twilight Zone" of the robotics industry. At RWT, we create reality with Workspace as the software engine and Robotrak©, robot calibration and signaturing. The missing component to achieving effective OLP in robotics is being able to consistently predict where the robot is going to go in relative space to the part and how that corresponds to the coordinates plotted in the programming application. This technology is now available and affordable. With paybacks of 10 times the initial investment in the first year by minimizing downtime Workspace and Robotrak will take your company out of the "Twilight Zone." Another component of the Workspace OLP process is the ability to import existing robot programs from the controllers, apply Robotrak calibrations and/or edit the program then re-install them into the robot controller by conventional means. By seamlessly creating the robot program while generating the simulation, Workspace also eliminates post-processing which has proven to create robot programs that, due to their miscalculations and language translations, defeat the benefits of OLP. Workspace, through native language programming, gives you a robot program that is ready to run your applications. Workspace has 28 of the most popular robot languages ready for your use. Simulation of robot workcells has taken on a new meaning with Workspace. Historically linked and housed in the design and engineering departments, Workspace on the PC now allows users to move from the traditional simulation departments and utilize the cell development process throughout the design to manufacturing arena. Workspace 4.0 has CAD importation of IGES and DXF to give quick access to your existing 3-D, solid model part, fixture and tool data. With a library of over 170 robot models, we can generally provide your new or older, robot model with your order. If you have a model we do not have in the library, we can quickly model it and provide you a model with accurate kinematics. Workspace 4.0 is easy to use and learn. Our corporate training facility in Fort Myers Beach, FL holds monthly training classes where you will learn the techniques to maximize your use of Workspace and Robotrak. With the look and feel of Windows based applications, Workspace has a short learning curve and a robot programming or CAD background will decrease your time to implementation.

There are also linksto other pages that provide more information on a particular topic. At thebottom of this page is a link that allows you to download free sample animationscreated with Workspace, as well as the Workspace demo program. Why is programming in the native language of the robotimportant? There areseveral reasons why robots should be programmed in their native language. Themost important reason is compatibility with the robot controller. With Workspaceit is very easy to send programs to the robot controller. There are nopost-processors to add more steps, and more complications, to the process. Oncea program is written in Workspace, it can be run immediately on the robotcontroller. Working in the native language of the robot also allows currentlyrunning programs to be easily brought into, and edited, in Workspace, withoutany pre-processing.  Another advantage of programming in thenative language is it gets the user closer to the robot. The person creating thesimulation will know more about the capabilities of the robot, and a person whois already familiar with the robot programming language will have no problemadapting to using Workspace. Whatis Workspace? Workspace is a graphicalthree-dimensional robot simulation and off-line programming software program. Itallows users to construct workcells and write programs for robots. Once this hasbeen done, Workspace has a number of analysis tools for a user to check thefeasibility of a workcell. These tools include reach and envelope analysis,collision detection, throughput, and cycle time analysis. What is unique about Workspace? Workspace is unique for two main reasons.First, Workspace runs on a PC. Most graphical robot simulation programsrequire high-end (and very expensive) graphics workstations (like those made bySilicon Graphics) to operate. Workspace will operate on any mainstreamIBM-compatible personal computer. Second, Workspace writes robotprograms in the native language of the robot. Each robot manufacturer hasit's own robot programming language. All other robot simulation programs requireyou to work in a "simulator language" that is similar to, but unlike,all robot languages. Whywould I want a robot simulation program to run on a PC? The ability to run on aPC, or notebook, is important for two reasons. The first, obviously, is price.PCs, even high-end PCs, are significantly cheaper than a graphics workstation.Because of this, virtually every employee has one on his/her desk already. Evenengineers with graphic workstations also have a PC on their desk. The reason isobvious, most mainstream programs, like word-processing, e-mail, spreadsheets,etc. are more easily obtained for PCs. We don't feel you should have to buy aspecial computer just to run complex three-dimensional workcell simulations. Another advantage of running on a PC is itallows you to take the simulation to the factory floor. If you are off-lineprogramming a robot, it is important for the simulation to closely match whatreally exists in the real world. The only way to do this is to take thesimulation to the actual workcell. With graphics workstations this is not onlydifficult, but most people do not want to take an expensive piece of equipment(a graphics workstation) to an environment it might get damaged. Workspace canrun on a portable computer, allowing a user to easily take Workspace to thefactory floor with a minimal amount of hassle. Which robot models are available for Workspace? Most robots from ABB to Unimation areavailable for Workspace. There areover 150 robot modelsavailable. If the robot you use is not on the list, contact us and we willbe happy to model it for you. Whichlanguages are available? There are24 robot languagescurrently available for Workspace. These range from the older VAL languagesto the new ABB Rapid language. If there is a language you need that is not onour list, contact us. How do I bring in my CAD drawings? Workspace allows you to bring in CAD drawingsfrom any package through DXF (r12) or IGES (5.1). Both import/export formats areincluded free with each copy of Workspace. Whatif I don't already have a CAD package? Workspace has an integrated threedimensional solid CAD modeler built in. CAD drawings created in Workspace canalso be exported using DXF and IGES. Can I simulate other things besides robots? Robots are only a few of the machines that canbe simulated in Workspace. Virtually any mechanism can also be simulated. Thisis very useful, since few robots operate by themselves without interaction withconveyors, turntables, positioners, etc. I've tried off-line programming before, and it hasn'tworked. Why? The reasonmost off-line programming systems have failed in the past is because of a lackof understanding of the fundamental problem with robots: inaccuracy.Robots are built to behighly repeatable, but little consideration is being given to their accuracy.This really isn't a problem when using a teach pendant because the operatorpositions the robot visually exactly like he/she wants it. What the actual x, y,z coordinates are really doesn't matter. This is a different story if you are off-lineprogramming. When you off-line program, you have a CAD drawing of whereeverything is positioned, and you base the coordinates of the teachpoints onthis. This, in turn, is where the robot will move to. Off-line programming istotally based on the x,y,z coordinates. Due to manufacturing tolerances andstack-up, each robot is built slightly different. Since the robot manufacturersmake no effort to measure what these differences are, each robot controllerthinks it has a perfect robot connected to it. Therefore, when you send therobot to a specific x,y,z coordinate, there is no guarantee that it makes itthere. In fact, robots are inaccurate by about 15 mm (0.59 inches), on average. How does Workspace correct for robot inaccuracies? There are two ways Workspace correctfor a robot's inaccuracy. The first is to account for the inaccuracies found inthe robot itself. This is done with a device calledRobotrak™.Robotrak measures the differences between a robot's theoretical structure withwhat the robot really looks like. This definition of what the robot looks likeis called the robots "signature," and like a person'ssignature, varies from example to example. Then, using Calibration+, a softwareoption in Workspace, a filter is placed in Workspace to insure that allteachpoints in Workspace will be created in the correct x,y,z position. The second method to improve a robots accuracyis to more accurately define where the fixtures are relative to the robot.Usually a workcell is designed in Workspace, and then it is assembled on thefactory floor. The actual, final position of the various fixtures are neverexactly the same as they were designed, and this affects where the teachpointsare generated. The solution to this is to use a signatured robot to measure thelocation of three well defined points on the fixture. By bringing thesepositions into Workspace (as teachpoints), the model can be adjusted accordinglyto re-position the fixture in the exact location of the real fixture. This, inturn, improves the accuracy of the final program. The best thing about these twomethods is that the software to use them is seamlessly integrated intoWorkspace. There are no separate programs to learn or third-party developers youhave to work with. One solution from one supplier. How do I share my simulations with others? If another company you work with, like asystem integrator or installer, also has Workspace, then you can simply exchangeWorkspace models and programs. This allows two companies to work closelydeveloping and implementing a robotic workcell. Most of the time, however, the people youwould like to share your simulations with do not have Workspace. In that case,you can create an animation, or short movie, of the Workspace simulation. Thisis done by using the AVI file format to create ananimation from within Workspace thatcan be replayed on any PC with Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher, whether theyhave Workspace or not. Any animation created in Workspacecan be replayed on any PC. This allows forreal-time playback of an animation. Animationfiles can be used to show a prospective customer how you plan to constructhis/her workcell, or as part of a proposal to get a new project approved. It isalso a very helpful way to convey the sometimes difficult task of how you planto operate a workcell. Looking at a three dimensional simulation is a lot moredescriptive than trying to decipher a two dimensional blueprint. Be sure todownload some sample animations below to see how this works. What is the best way to learn how to use Workspace? The best way to learn how to useWorkspace is by coming to one of ourtraining classes.Training is offered once a month in sunny Southwest Florida.

When working in the virtual world of robot simulationand off-line programming, everything in the workcell is perfect. The robot isaccurate and the fixtures are perfectly placed. Once a program is taken to the floor, however, it is often found that the robotis not placed exactly as it should have been, the fixture does not rotate in anexact circle, and the robot itself has inaccuracies that have not been takeninto account in the simulation. These inaccuracies are not the fault of therobot manufacturers, or the fixture installers, it is just a fact of life thatinstallations are not exact. Traditionally, this is the place where off-line programming has found it'sbiggest critics. When the programs are first run, some programs miss theteachpoints by as much as three inches. A robot operator must then go back andre-teach the entire program with a teach pendant. Not only does this take time,but the assumed advantage of off-line programming has been completely negated. Besides the money and time spent re-programming the robot with the teachpendant, a significant amount of money is also spent trying to duplicate exactlythe positioning of the robot and fixtures. Using lasers and other high-techdevices, the fixtures and robots in a factory are placed as accurately and aslevel as possible. Although this improves the chances the program will work, itis still not as accurate as the simulation. As much as $50,000 per workcellcan be spent to get the positioning "close." The robot in the simulation does not suffer from the inaccuracies of the realrobot (tolerances in the manufacturing process, backlash, and general wear andtear). In order to fix this there must be some way of finding these errors andreducing them as much as possible. Once the errors are found they can be used tomodify the kinematics of the robot model within the simulation. ROBOTRAK IS THE SOLUTION The solution to this is to find the "signature" of the robot and theworkcell through calibration. Calibration only really works, however, if it istied directly to a simulation program When tied with a simulation program, thekinematics of the robot model can more easily be modified. Robotrakis an optional measuring system for Workspace, a PC-based simulation andoff-line programming system. It is capable of measuring static positions ormotion paths to an accuracy of 0.2 mm (0.008 inches) in three dimensions. Thesoftware needed to analyze the robot performance and to modify the robot model'skinematics is combined within Workspace as one piece of seamless software. Noother system offers this worldwide. The Robotrak calibration system consists of the following components: Three incremental encoder measuring units. A robot end effector interface. An ISA computer interface card. A reference bar of known length. A PC running Workspace with the Calibration+ option.  USING ROBOTRAK The three high resolution encoder units are placed anywhere within the workingenvelope of the robot The units should be placed roughly at the corners of anequilateral triangle. This placement does not have to be precise, however,setting the units in a straight line must be avoided. The encoder units are thenplugged into the computer running Workspace through the data acquisition card. A non-stretch cord with a constant tension on it is then pulled from each of theencoder units and calibrated with the use of a reference bar. Once a conversionof encoder counts to length is established for each unit, the relative distancebetween the three encoder units is determined by pulling the cords from eachunit to the adjacent unit. At this point the encoder units are ready to begincalibrating the robot. FINDING A ROBOT'S "SIGNATURE" Each cord is then pulled from the encoder and attached to the robot end-effectorinterface, which has already been attached to the robot faceplate or tool. Oncethe cords are in position, Robotrak uses the length of each cord to determinethe X, Y, and Z coordinates of the robot end-effector, essentially becoming aCoordinate Measuring Machine (CMM). The robot is then moved through 50 points in space, and at each point theWorkspace software records the robot's position through the three Robotrakencoders. Over the length of the test, as many joints as possible should bemoved. The points can either be taught manually with a teach pendant, orgenerated in Workspace and downloaded into the robot controller. This teachpointfile can then be kept in the controller for any future time when the robot mayneed to be re-calibrated. Once the points have been recorded, Workspace will compare the measuredpositions (where the robot actually was) with the teachpoints (where the robotthought it was), and the errors associated with the kinematics of the robot areextracted and stored within Workspace. Errors which are detected include: The zero position of each joint (where the values of the joint variables iszero). The length of each link and the distance offset at each link. The compliance at each joint. Robotrak will also calculate the tool offset if a tool is attached to therobot.  Once these errors are calculated, the kinematics of the robot model in Workspaceare modified to account for the differences between the real robot and the robotmodel A filter is then used within Workspace to modify the teachpoint file sothat they represent actual positions on the real-world robot controller.Programs can then be generated by Workspace that will be precise, sending therobot to the correct position in real space. CALIBRATING A WORKCELL Positions of fixtures and other peripheral equipment within a workcell can alsobe measured and merged into Workspace, allowing for the calibration of an entireworkcell Even individual stations within a rotating fixture can be measured totake into account any errors between stations, or errors in the rotation of afixture. In essence, this is using the power of the Workspace software to makeany of the adjustments for inaccurate robots and the less accurate positioningof equipment by calibrating the workcell once the equipment is in place. Thetime and money spent getting the robot and fixtures precisely into place isreduced. The entire calibration process takes less than one hour per robot, including thetime it takes to set up the encoder units and calibrate them However, the need to calibrate does not end once a workcell is set-up. If arobot crashes during it's operation and bends a tool, Robotrak can be veryhelpful. By setting up Robotrak and recording only a few points, the new  tooloffset can be determined. Then, through Workspace, the program can bere-simulated to look for any collisions (using the collision detection featurein Workspace) that may take place with the workpiece or a fixture. If there areno collisions, the tool may be able to be used until the end of a shift,limiting down-time. Also, as a robot ages, gear backlash and wear increase theerrors in a robot. By periodically re-calibrating a robot, the operator cam beassured that any programs written for that robot will work. Off-line programming can be of great value to a manufacturing firm. It allowsthe robot to continue to operate while the program is being written, allows forgreater flexibility when writing programs, and more control over a process.Interchangeability of programs between robot cells gives manufacturersflexibility in scheduling and equipment utilization. Unless the robot iscalibrated, the program becomes little more than a guide to the robot operatorwho will have to re-teach the entire program if it is too far off from what isneeded. Robotrak, along with Workspace, is the solution to this problem, and itallows off-line programming to live up to its expectations.

By joining our Preferred Partners program, we can not only supply them with the system for free, but increase theirbusiness through our lead referral program. This program has proven to be very successful for matching integration of robot cells and the use of Workspace for our customers. The program is based on the initial rental of Workspace. The Systems Integrator rents a minimum of one seat of Workspace. The base rental fee is $2100 per month with additional robot models and languages extra. They then are fully trained at the RWT-Workspace school in Fort Myers, FL and certified in the use of Workspace. Once they are certified, they are eligible to rent additional Workspace systems to their customers. This benefits the S.I. in having a system on-site for post work and the customer a system for in-house use.  The rental fee to the customer is billed monthly by RWT directly to eliminate hassles for the Preferred Partner. RWT then credits the Preferred Partner's monthly bill for 20% of the rental fee, averaging  $420 per month to the S.I..It only takes 5 systems placed at customer sites to then have the use of one Workspace system for FREE each month. After 5 systems, the Preferred Partner can choose to add additional Workspace seats to their own facility or receive a monthly check for the residual income from the rentals of systems over 5. Preferred Partners can make additional monthly income from this program, but can then increase billable time on their own Workspace as more of their customers are using the system. To go along with the Preferred Partner program is the lead referral program. A program that provides full, systems integration leads to the Preferred Partners that are using Workspace. We have a number of calls each week from prospective robotics customers who are looking for someone to design, implement and program their specific application. Since we are not in the business of systems integration, we pass these on to the specialists, our Preferred Partners.

Customers are pushing for more services, pre and post sales, lower billable time and the ability to use robots for more and more applications. The ability to stand out in the crowd is getting tougher.Robot simulation is not a new tool, but with the advances in computer technology it is now becoming a tool everyone can utilize. No longer a toy of the automotive suppliers, PC based systems like Workspace are showing up on notebook computers and desktops. On the pre-sales side, the use of simulation to sell a concept and provide proof of implementation can make all of the difference when you are competing against 2D drawings and brochures. Not only does the prospect watch their new cell run, they can do it from their office or boardroom. This not only allows the S.I. to show what they plan to do, but gives the customer an interactive way to evaluate the process. In the design and layout phase, S.I.'s can maximize cell layouts with 3D accuracy, import part data and build the most efficient cell. The use of plastic robot models and cardboard mock ups can be replaced with accurate reach checks, collision detection and a myriad of evaluation tools only seen through simulation.All of this comes as a cost to the customer who is anxious to see and know the cell they are purchasing will work and be implemented with the highest efficiency possible. The level of professional expertise conveyed through simulation is measurable by the amount of repeat business and referrals obtained from the happy customer.For more details on how you can profit from offering simulation as a sales and profit tool, contact your RWT Account Manager at 941-466-0488.

RWT is the exclusive North American distributor of Workspace, the world's first PC based robot simulation and off-line programming software package developed by Robotic Simulations, Ltd. of the UK. "The integrator gave us the project to model as a challenge to evaluate Workspace. Using their 2D CAD drawings and rough layout plans, we modeled the cell in Workspace® and created a 3D animation that told them more than they were expecting to find. They had already purchased the robot and were building enclosures based on the 2D drawings and rough modeling in their shop. Which is a fairly standard practice in the industry for companies not using simulation." One of the first comments we got from their design team was that we were asking them questions about components of the cell they normally would not have researched until they were in the final phases of  build-up. So not only did we create a proactive approach to the design and layout, we later discovered several things that would have cost thousands more than the initial purchase of the software. We met with the customer at their facility with the robot setting in the back room awaiting the cell build-up."The first thing we proved through the simulation was the robot could not reach all of the fixtures it needed to. In a 2D CAD drawing it looked feasible, but when you add in the true reach of the robot model, they were coming up short. This was coupled with major collisions in the cycle that would have destroyed the fixtures and the controller monitor. They had also realized the cycle time shown in simulation was 30 seconds over contract time. Even under perfect cycle simulations, they were not going to make their goal and the goal their customer was expecting under contract. All in all, they would have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars including their reputation." "With the simulation in hand, they were able to quickly redesign the cell, reposition the robot, change fixtures and redevelop the entire process with the customer to achieve cycle times and actually exceed the customer's expectations. The ability of Workspaceâ to run on their notebook computer and they could easily take the simulation right to the customers desk, allowed them to graphically show the story and sell the customer without lengthy delays while they deciphered drawings and made their own calculations. They were also able to leave a copy of the simulation for the customer to run on their own PC, using the animation player feature of Workspace, the customer only needed to have a PC running Windows.""This is just one of the success stories we have shared with customers and Workspaceâ." adds Walt. We have such an affordable alternative to the expensive UNIX- based systems that do not have the portability and versatility this program has to offer. For off-line programming, this system is without comparison in it's seamless, native language code writing for over 180 models of robots using 30+ different languages. We also have connectivity capabilities only available with a PC based system. We are bringing true, open-architecture to robot users who have been held hostage to antiquated technology."

The two terms are mutually exclusive, a robot doesnot have to be accurate to be repeatable, and a robot does not have to berepeatable to be accurate. It is important to understand the differences betweenthese two specifications. Repeatability Repeatabilityis the degree to which a robot is able to return to a specific translation orposition point in the workcell. In this procedure a robot is taught the requiredpoint by moving the arm to the location with the teach pendant and then pushingthe program-point button. The repeatability specification thus describes howclosely the robot arm reproduces the taught point on each cycle of theprogram execution. Notice on the bullseye to the left that the marksman hasgrouped his shots close together, however his grouping is far from the bullseye.Repeatability can be thought of as how good of a grouping can be made. Accuracy Accuracy isthe degree to which a robot arm is able to move to a specific translation orposition point in the workcell when the point coordinates are entered from anoff-line programming station, calculated inside the program, or received from avision system. For example, a simulation program could specify that the armshould move to a point described as X = 50.00 inches, Y = 45.30 inches, Z =10.01 inches, Roll = 0.00 degrees, Pitch = 90.00 degrees, and Yaw = 100.00degrees. The accuracy specification describes how close the arm will be whenit moves to the desired point. Typical robot accuracy is about twomagnitudes greater than the arm's repeatability. On the bullseye to the left,notice that all the holes are centered around the middle of the target, but thegrouping is not very close together. You do not have to have good repeatabilityto have good accuracy. Accuracy and Repeatability Accuracyand repeatability are the measure of how close to a programmed point the robotcan come, and how close it gets to that same point again. Notice on the bullseyethat the points are centered around the middle of the target and are groupedclose together. This is good accuracy and repeatability. A robot in thissituation will be the easiest to off-line program. Back toRWT Home Page  Copyright © 1996 RoboticWorkspace Technologies, Inc. All rights reserved.

Weisel wenty-five years ago, when I became one of theindustry's handful of robotics originator's, we made a bold but correctassumption. We believed companies that did not introduce robotics into theirmanufacturing processes would surrender any competitive edge they held and wouldlose the major benefits that the technology offered in improved productivity,higher quality products, and reduced tine. We were right. Today, afternearly three decades of living with the limitations in technology, the roboticsindustry is taking advantage of a new revolution: PC-based simulation. Softwarethat combines off-line calibration of robot and workcell has catapulted roboticsinto the fast lane worldwide. Simulation packages have been developedbased on the premise that PC's would become faster, cheaper and contain morememory. Developers predicted the Pcs' capabilities in the future would bringthem to am operating level where computer workstations are today. Even the mostdaring prognosticators underestimated the possibility or potential of PC-basedsimulation software. No one fathomed robotic simulations being done. Receiversneed a personal computer with Microsoft Windows period. Manufactures now arefocusing on these software developments, and the stakes are much higher than 25or 30 years ago. I predict this new approach to simulation, using astandard PC, provides a universal solution to universal problems. It ischanging the way we so business internationally now. If you aren't already auser, you are in the process of losing your competitive edge even as you readthis article. OLD PROBLEMS, NEW SOLUTIONS Severalbarriers have kept robotics simulation, off-line programming and on-line robotand workcell calibration from reaching fill potential. Today, those barriersare gone Wiped out. Demolished by this new PC-based approach. Thestate-of-the-art for simulation is altered. One of the greatestchallenges has been to devise a way to send a program to a robot, a program thatmakes the robot perform flawlessly without human intervention. Historically,we've demanded inexpensive robot hardware, then assumed the self-limitedposture that it's perfectly acceptable to stand with a robot and teach itspoints by hand. I have believed for more than 25 years that a teach pendentmust not be an acceptable way of life. It's been an industry constant because to date, we never knew what thereal robot on the floor looked and acted like in comparison to what the "perfect"robot in simulation-software looked and acted like. It didn't matter that wecopied the manufacturer's specifications exactly.The mechanical model always hadsomething that didn't match the specified data. Robots always have beenmanufactured to be repeatable, not accurate. The new generation of PC-basedsimulation software solves that problem. Price/performance has always been a major barrier. The old methodrequired a non-portable computer system to operate the software. Total costsare about $110,000. These systems have failed to successfully perform off-lineprogramming functions because they do not take into account the actual robotkinematics. Quantifying the actual robot's kinematics is left up to the othersat substantially higher costs. Simulation's costs benefits and tine saving have industry memberslooking for the fine print, the down side. There is none. Simulation, therobotics industry breakthrough that users have been waiting for, and it salready started to change the fabric of North American manufacturing. Evencompanies receiving proposals and products from suppliers now are insisting onvendor simulations to accompany their proposals. This forces a completeanalysis of a pries down the line to the component level. Statistical analysis in simulation means we can provide predictions ofoverall production on an annualized basis. Once a user has created thesimulation, he or she can analyze cycle rates for all the pieces of equipment ina workcell. Simulation now can be used to layout the entire manufacturing prices-from concept to finished production. A user has the ability to "test drive"a system at all levels of the process before committing hardware. Simulations can be transmitted worldwide for analysis via E-mail ofInternet to anyone who has a PC- a major sales, engineering, manufacturingadvantage. Simulation, formerly regarded as an engineering function, one becomesan affordable vendor tool to show prospective buyers that the system works, andthe vendor has done his or her homework. Simulation before starting floor operations prevents costly crashes anddowntime. Simulation now provides an answer to the challenge ofcalibration to be used in production. This is rarely, if ever, the case. :Letsassume that the robot ordered can reach exactly 2 meters. But constraints inthe reach pattern are directly affected by the inaccuracies we find in everyrobot. The real robot, for a number of valid reasons, may not reach 2 meters,it may fall 20-30 millimeters short. Unless a calibrated robot model is used inthe simulation, and off-line program generated will most likely not work. Thisdecade-old solution: Call the pipe fitters and bring a fork lift to relocateparts of the system. Software simulation now locates the problem before themachines are bolted down, re-verifies at the time of installation, assists incorrecting any remaining problems. Anyone who has even a passingacquaintance of PC-based simulation and its potential applications doesn't needto ask, "What's on the horizon?" But I love it when they ask anyway. My predictions for the industry include: Best estimates suggest the sizeof the North American simulation market today is between $30 and $35 million. Ihave now doubt that in the next couple of years, the market will have surged toover $100 million, and the wave's crest isn't even in sight. Within thenext two to five years, we'll see the widespread entry of PC-based openarchitecture controls. They will replace today's specialized controls thatrequire specialized interfaces. I believe that leading PC simulation softwarepackages will plug and play on mist-if not all- of those PC controllers. We'llsee- and demand- PC-based, resident simulation in engineering at vendorfacilities builders shops and at production facilities. Simulation willbe neutral to the robot and specific to the application. Systems integrators androbot users will demand objective analyses of the entire range of robot manufacturing, and robot manufacturers therefore will not be in the field ofobjective simulation analysis of robotic systems. Factories with robotsfrom different manufacturers will increasingly rely on simulation and demandservices from companies that do not have ties to robot or supplier companies. Users will insist on an objective evaluation of robot function and systemperformance for a wide range of manufacturers products. PC-basedsimulation will be a global fact of life for manufacturers and users, and thetransition is underway. Robot Simulation, Ltd., UK's research anddevelopment team that selected the personal computer for simulation softwaredevelopment, broke out of the mainframe minutes that crippled progress foryears. What they created - a portable, PC-based robotic simulation programwith off-line programming and on-line robot calibration capabilities- meansevery robotics manufacturer, systems integrator and robot user can have accessto an affordable and effective tool for increasing production profits. Ibelieve, without hesitation or doubt, that PC-based simulation technology is thesleeping giant of the 1990's. And the giant has just yawned. Walter K.

(Newcastle upon Tyne, England) orkspace (version 3.2), an industrial robotsimulation software package, is a graphic simulation system and a means ofoff-line programming a robot cell. The software package will create and simulaterobot programs in the native language of the robot. For example, users of Fanucrobots may write robot programs in Karel, and ABB robot users may write robotprograms in ARLA. There is therefore no need for postprocessors to translatefrom a simulation language to the robot language: the full power of the robotlanguage is available to the user through off-line programming. It is also possible to transfer existing robotprograms from the robot controller back into Workspace for optimization, sooff-line programming is a two-way process. This is facilitated by the use ofportable microcomputers which may be taken onto the factory floor and used nextto a robot workcell. The user first selects the targetrobot language required. To create a robot program, the user clicks the mouse onrobot commands on a pull-down menu. These commands are immediately written to anASCII text file. In this way, a robot program is created without the necessityof typing the command words, though the user may also use a built-in text editorif desired. As each command is written to the file, it is simulated graphicallyon the computer screen in color 3D graphics. Programs may be debugged by tracingthrough line by line, seeing at each line what is happening in the simulation.The value of variables may be watched or examined throughout. If an error occursat any point, then the user will immediately be placed in the Workspace texteditor at the position in the robot program where the error occurred, enablingthe error to be promptly corrected. The full structure of the robotlanguages is implemented, including typed variables, teachpoints, subroutines,looping, branching on condition, signals, and condition handler interrupts. Several robots working incoordination, each under the control of a separate robot program, may besimulated to produce one animation (Figure 1). During the simulation ofthe robot program, any collisions that occur between any objects in the workcellmay be automatically reported, and a clock indicates the time taken for theoverall sequence of movements. The 3-D volume of the envelope may be plotted, or2-D slices through the envelope displayed on the screen. All the main industrial andeducational robot languages are implemented, and a library of over 140 robotmodels is available to the user (though it is also possible for users to createtheir own robots). The 3D CAD System & KinematicsModeler 3-D solid objects(including combinations created using Constructive Solid Geometry) or surfaces(including Bspline, Parametric, or Bezier surfaces) may be created usingWorkspace's own 3-D CAD system or imported from an external CAD system using theDXF file format (common among microcomputer-based CAD systems such as AutoCAD)or the IGES file format (common among graphics-workstation-based CAD systemssuch as CATIA). The use of an unlimited number of layers for storing differentlevels of detail makes it possible to turn off the display of objects irrelevantto the current task or display them in wireframe for speed. The movement of any mechanism maybe modeled using a kinematics modeler. The mechanism may have any number ofjoints in any serial or tree-structure combination. Conveyors, automatic guidedvehicles, and other independently moving objects may also be modeled. Defining Positions Positions and paths for the robot tool tomove to may be defined in several ways. A software emulation of a teach pendantis available to move the robot either by stepping individual joint angles or bystepping the XYZ Cartesian position of the tool relative to the robot worldcoordinate frame. Positions may be saved as teachpoints for use later in a robotprogram. These are displayed on the screen graphically as coordinate frames. Ifthe robot is placed in a different position in the workcell, then theteachpoints will change color if they are no longer achievable due to the limitson the joints of the robot or due to the limited reach of the robot. Positions may also be defined byclicking the mouse at different positions on the computer screen (changing theview if necessary to define a 3-D position). Orientations may be defined in manydifferent ways-for example, by dragging the approach vector of the teachpointcoordinate frame in a particular direction using the mouse. Geometry Points The easiest, most powerful way of definingrobot positions is to use the geometry of objects. Points may be defined alongthe seam between two surfaces in such a way that the position of the point onthe seam, the distance of the point from the seam, the lean of the approachvector of the tool towards the seam, or the angle between the adjacent surfacesand the tool approach vector is set by the user. This is of use in applicationssuch as arc welding. Points may alsobe defined normal to a surface so that the position on the surface and thedistance from the surface to the point is set by the user. As the point is movedover the surface, the point is always maintained normal to the surface. This isof use in applications such as spot welding, sealant dispensing, waterjetcutting, buffing, polishing, and surface finishing. Paths to follow a 2-D curve may bedefined automatically. Straight line and segments of the curve are translateddirectly into linear and circular motions for the robot tool to follow. This isof use in applications such as waterjet cutting. Calibration Calibration is an important issue in off-lineprogramming and simulation, because the resulting robot program is only asaccurate as the model of the workcell. Workspace supports three types ofcalibration. Calibration of the robottool involves finding the XYZ offset that must be added onto the kinematics ofthe robot to account for the tool attached to the end of the robot. This uses aprocedure in which the robot and tool are moved repeatedly to a fixed locationand the resulting teachpoints taken from the robot controller back intoWorkspace. A multivariable search technique is then used to calculate the tooloffset. This procedure may need to be repeated if the tool is knocked out ofalignment during use. A similar technique may be used tofind the true zero position of the robot. This is necessary since the zeroposition of every joint of the robot is subject to drift during use. Theresulting offsets are used to produce a more accurate robot model than thekinematics used on the robot controller itself. Finally, the true position ofobjects in the workcell may be measured using the robot as a measuring device,and the resulting teachpoints taken back into Workspace and either used toredefine vertices or else used to redefine known positions within the model.Workspace can integrate with a mechanical calibration system- called Robotrak -for measuring 3-D positions within the workcell independently of the robot. Replaying Simulations in Real Time Simulations may be replayed within Workspacein real time, but recent advances in animation technology enable even morerealistic playback. The simulations may be translated into the FLC file formatused by Autodesk Animator and replayed using a utility at speeds up to 50frames/second. The resulting full-screen animations are very realistic, even ona medium-range 486 color notebook, that it is like looking through a window ontothe factory floor. The utility for replaying FLC files will be bundled with theWorkspace software. Simulation ofDynamics It's possible tosimulate the dynamics of a robot using Workspace for a defined sequence ofmovements. The equations relating the torques and accelerations at each jointand their interactions for a six-axis robot are modeled using numericalintegration. Two type of controller equation may be used: classical anddiscrete-time control. The constant multipliers in the controller equations maybe modified and the resulting effect on the trajectory examined. The effect ofattaching a payload to the end of the robot may also be examined. However, untilit is possible to obtain accurate estimates for the mass, inertia matrices,center of gravity, and controller constants at each joint, dynamics simulationis only of use in demonstrating general principles and obtaining qualitative,not quantitative, information. The Future For many years, robot companies have not beencooperative in providing the information required to accurately simulate thepaths generated by the robot controller when moving through via points. Withoutthis information it is difficult for a simulation to provide precisecycle-times. Now, large automotive robot users, have fully committed themselvesirrevocably to off-line programming, are beginning to make it a condition offuture robot orders that this information is provided as a black box to thesimulation companies. However, simulation and off-lineprogramming will only become widely accepted if there is a change in attitudewithin the simulation companies, who at present seem unwilling to get involvedon the factory floor. Simulation is often carried out on the other side of thefactory, or in some cases on the other side of the country. The resultingprograms are then taken down onto the factory floor This is where the problemsfor the people on the factory floor begin. Reality is seldom the same as asimulation, and the robot programs usually require modification, but by thistime the simulation is being used on the next project. This gap between the factory floorand the simulation is one that Workspace is designed to close by letting aportable microcomputer to be taken down to the factory floor and the simulationto be used next to the robot controller, and by letting robot programs to beshuffled backwards and forwards between the simulation and the robot controlleras many times as required.

That equipment was programmed througha hand-held device that an operator used to move the arm to the requiredlocations, then to enter the points in space. Generally, it would be a matter ofprogramming a robot to perform spot welding of automotive bodies-in-white, whichwas certainly a burgeoning application in the early days. It was a matter ofmoving the arm, making sure it was at the right location, adjusting ifnecessary, entering the point, moving to the next position, and so on. One major downside of this approach, ofcourse, Is that the equipment was tied up for a long time for setup, whichwasn't beneficial from the standpoint of providing a return on what was thenperceived to be a somewhat risky investment. Programming is essential forproduction, but there's no production going on during programming. If there were changes-say the door aperturewas modified-then it was back to this manual programming approach. (Editingwasn't then what it is now, so it was often tedium upon tedium.) A significant change came when off-lineprogramming was developed for robotic systems. With this change, people couldview not merely the image of a single robot and the workpiece on a CRT, but anentire system, including the peripherals. This allows programming to beperformed -while or even before-equipment was on order or while it was operatingin existing applications. Which takes care of that payback tie-up to a degree. However, Walt Weisel, who is now the president& CEO of International Business Link (Ft. Myers Beach, FL), which hasrecently formed a new company called Robotic Workspace Technologies, maintainsthat off-line robotic programming isn't all that it is cracked up to be, andthat the manual programming approach, while not as extensive, still remains anecessary activity. "If an off-line program is able to get the arm to aposition within 1/4-in," Weisel maintains, "it is phenomenally close.He explains that what is the ordinary course of affairs includes manuallytweaking the program after it has been developed. For one thing, he says, notall robotic arms have the same characteristics and kinematics - even robots ofthe same brand, same model. In addition, locating things on the floor is a wholelot different from locating them on a computer screen. These differences must bedealt with in real life, which turns into real money: Weisel estimates as muchas $55,000 per workstation. Which binds up the payback potential, to a degree,once again. So he has identified aproblem. What's his solution? It's aPC-based off-line programming package named "Workspace 3" that, Weiselmaintains, can generate the robot program in a background mode while thesimulation is being created; this program is being developed in the robot's ownlanguage, be it Karel, ARLA, VAL, or others. The simulation is in 3D and incolor, and, Weisel admits, isn't as attractive as the screens generated by themore full-blown robotic simulation packages-then he points out the price forWorkspace is S26,000. Weisel is nottrying to supplant the bigger simulation vendors. Rather, he maintains that whathappens is what the workstation-based simulation packages are used to createoff-line programs that are then passed down to the plant level; the people whocreated them then move on to the next simulation project, leaving the plantpeople to tweak the program. He says Workspace is a tool for the people in theplant who need to get the robots to work as needed. As for the knowing precisely wherethe robot is in space: There is an option called Robotrak, which consists of arobot end-effector interface; an ISA interface card; a reference bar; theWorkspace software with the calibration option; and encoders. The encoders use anon-stretch Dacron cord. The encoders are located; locations are established;and then the cords are attached to the end effector. As the arm moves throughspace, the robot is calibrated to within 0.008 in., according to Weisel.-GSV Reprinted with permission from Production.

Weisel  When I became one of theindustry's handful of robotics originator's twenty-five years ago, we made abold but correct assumption. We believed companies that did not introducerobotics into their manufacturing processes would surrender any competitive edgethey held, and would lose the major benefits robots offered to manufacturers inimproved productivity, higher quality products, and reduced time. We wereright. Today, however, after nearly three decades of living with thelimitations, the robotics industry is taking advantage of a new revolution:PC-based simulation. Software that combines off-line calibration of robot andworkcell has catapulted robotics into the fast lane worldwide. Thesoftware development of WORKSPACE began on a PC platform in the late 1980's. The premiss was that Pcs would have the ability to become faster, cheaper andcontain more memory. Developers predicted that Pcs capabilities in the futurewould bring them to the level at which Silicon Graphics computers are today. Even the most daring prognosticators underestimated the possibility or potentialof PC-based simulation software. No-one thought of robotic simulations beingsent for analysis around the world via e-mail and the Internet-but it is beingdone. Receivers need a personal computer with Microsoft Windows - period; theWORKSPACE program is not required to view the simulation. Manufacturesare focusing attention on these software developments The stakes are muchhigher than 25 or 30 years ago for manufacturers who assume the "wait andsee" posture. The industry's newest simulation program operates on a PC,even a notebook computer. It combines robotic workcell simulation, offlineprogramming and online calibration in a single, seamless piece of software; andit works. Suddenly, a robot manufacturer, systems integrator or robot user candefine a part and a production system for a finished product by using fulldigital representation, whereas before we relied on drawings and analog-basedinformation. Marketed in North America under the name WORKSPACE, the PC-basedsoftware addresses and resolves all the challenges that simulation and offlineprogramming have posed over the decades, and does it for substantially lesscost that the traditional mainframe and engineering workstations. Mostimportantly, we can now determine in simulation whether a job can or cannot bedone before we ever put one penny or pound into the hardware. In essence, auser can "test drive" the applications in software. I predict that this new approach to simulation, using a standard PC, will provide auniversal solution to universal solution to universal problems that can now betransmitted over universal networks. It is changing the way we do businessinternationally - now. If you are not already a user, you are in the process oflosing your competitive edge even as you read this article. Oldproblems/new solutions Several key problems- barriers - have keptrobotics simulation, off-line programming and on-line robot and workcellcalibration from reaching full potential. Today, those barriers are gone; wipedout- Demolished by this new PC-based approach. The state of the art forsimulation is altered. For example, one of the greatest challenges has been todevise a way to send a program to a robot, a program that makes the robotperform flawlessly without human intervention. Historically, we have demandedinexpensive robot hardware, then assumed the self-limiting posture that it isperfectly acceptable to stand with a robot and "teach it" points "by hand". I have believed for more than 25 years that a teach pendent mustnot be an acceptable way of life. It's been an industry constant because up tonow, we did not know how the real robot on the floor looks and acts incomparison to how the "perfect" robot in simulation-software looks andacts. It did not matter that we copied the manufacturer's specificationsexactly. The mechanical model always has something that does not match thespecified data. Robots have always been manufactured to be repeatable, notaccurate. Thenew generation of PC-based simulation software solves that problem. A specialset of precision instruments ( ROBOTRAK) traces or reads each of the robot'sactual kinematics (individual signature), including variances created from theway robots are manufactured, installed and maintained. The WORKSPACE simulationsoftware, called Calibration, then compares the robot's taught positions to theachieved positions in space. A new set of actual robot kinematics is generatedwithin WORKSPACE, and this is the simulation in place of the perfect model. Itis at this point that reach, collision and cycle rates may be more accuratelypredicted. The system quick, accurate, and inexpensive. Once the actual robotis signature, it can be used on its own to calibrate other peripherals in theworkcell. Price/performance has always been a major barrier. The oldmethod required a non-portable computer system to operate the software. Totalcosts are US$110,000. These systems have failed to perform successfully offlineprogramming functions, since they do not take into account the actual robotkinematics is left up to the others, at substantially higher costs. ThePC-based simulation system is portable, fast, accurate, does offlineprogramming, online calibrations and can interface with precision measuringequipment to track a robot's motions and provide an actual signature that isthen used in the simulation. It also smashes the price/performance barrier. NorthAmerica awakening to simulation benefits Simulation's costs benefitsand time saving have industry members looking for the fine print; the down side. There is none. Simulation is the robotics industry breakthrough for whichusers have been waiting , and it has already started to change the fabric ofNorth American manufacturing. Even companies receiving proposals and productsfrom suppliers are now insisting on vendor simulations to be provided with theirproposals. This forces a complete analysis of a process down the line to thecomponent level. Statistical analysis in simulation, also part of theWORKSPACE software, mean that we can provide predictions of overall productionon an annual basis. Once users have created the simulation, he or she cananalyze cycle rates for all the pieces of equipment in a workcell. They can alsoproject pieces per hour, as week as uptime/downtime factors. WORKSPACE containsan option called "throughput", which analyses parts per hour, downtimeand problem areas for improvement. Simulation now can be used to layoutthe entire manufacturing process, from concept to finished product. A user nowhas the ability to "test drive" a system at all levels of the processbefore committing hardware. Simulations can be transmitted worldwide foranalysis via e-mail of Internet to anyone who has a PC- a major sales,engineering, manufacturing advantage. The person reviewing the simulation needto use WORKSPACE; this is a major breakthrough. This unique feature providesthe ultimate tool for concurrent engineering. Simulation, formerlyregarded as an engineering function, now becomes an affordable vendor tool toshow prospective buyers that the system works, and the vendor has done thenecessary homework. Simulation before starting floor operations prevents costlycrashes and downtime. Simulation is not in anyway restricted to robots. It is an outstanding tool to evaluate process lines, stamping lines, everythingup to and including indexing transfer lines and transfer mechanisms. Actualuses of PC-based simulation In addition to traditional uses ofsimulating new processes, WORKSPACE allows a user to reverse engineer or editexisting applications. The PC-based simulation system takes in the actualprogram that runs a robot, them simulates the robot's activities on the screenwhile the operator analyses the robots program. The user then edits the reachpoints within WORKSPACE to improve the robot's program, all while the actualrobot continues in production. WORKSPACE then creates a new corrected/editedprogram in the robot's language- the ultimate editing tool. In recentsimulation analysis of existing robot programs, we were able to take from two tosix seconds out of robot cycle times by editing their previously taught points. Individual companies will have to assign their own values to what it means totake from two to six seconds out of robot cycle times by editing theirpreviously taught points. Individual companies will have to assign their ownvalues to what it means to take a couple of seconds out of a part's cycle time. A company that makes 100,000 parts a year in a robotic cell can recover asignificant amount of production time and money. TheWORKSPACE simulation software also compensates for robot add ons, such as ajunction box, cables and brackets. These engineering changes often mean therobot no longer fits into its work envelope as per the original simulation. Since WORKSPACE can travel with the job, a user can resimulate where necessary. WORKSPACE then reprograms the robot to eliminate costly start-upsurprises-collision points, near misses, and points the robot can no longerreach because of the additional constraints. As example for robotcalibration is: a manufacturer using simulation assumes that the robot used inthe simulation assumes that the robot used in the simulation is the same as therobot to be used introduction. this is rarely, if ever, the case. Let usassume that the robot ordered can reach exactly two metres. But constraints inthe reach pattern are directly affected by the inaccuracies we find in everyrobot. The real robot, for a number of valid reasons, may not reach two metres,it may fall 20-30 millimeters short. Unless a calibrated robot model is used inthe simulation, and off-line program generated will most likely not work. Thisdecades-old solution: Call the pipe fitters and bring a fork lift to relocateparts of the system. WORKSPACE locates the problem before the machines arebolted down, reverifies at the time of installation and assists in correctingany remaining problems. In another example, simulation was used as a "repair"job where interfering with each other in the workcell. The system had been laidout using a simulation system which was on a Silicon Graphics workstation inanother city. That simulation did not travel with the job to finish thatinstallation. By having the WORKSPACE simulation on a 486 notebook, correctionswere analyzed at the job site and corrections made. Predictions Anyonewho has knowledge of PC-based simulation and its potential applications doesn'tneed to ask, "What's on the horizon?" But I love it when they askanyway. My predictions for the industry include the following: Best estimates suggest the size of the North American simulation markettoday is between $30 and $35 million. I have no doubt that in the next couple ofyears, the market will have surged to over $100 million, and the crest of thewave is not even in sight. Within the next two to five years, we'll see the widespread entry ofPC-based open architecture controls. They will replace today's specializedcontrols which require specialized interfaces. I believe that leading PCsimulation software packages will plug and play on most-if not all- of those PCcontrollers. We will see- and demand- PC-based, resident simulation in engineering atvendor facilities builders' shops and at production facilities. Simulation will be neutral to the robot and specific to the application.Systems integrators and robot users will demand objective analyses of the entirerange of robot manufacturing. Robot manufacturers, therefore, will not be inthe field of objective simulation analysis of robotic systems. Factories with robots from different manufacturers will increasingly relyon simulation, and demand services from companies which do not have ties torobot or supplier companies. Users will insist on an objective evaluation ofrobot function and system performance for a wide range of manufacturersproducts. PC-based simulation will be a global fact of life for manufacturers andusers, and the transition is underway. Conclusion RobotSimulation, Ltd., the UK's research and development team which selected thepersonal computer for simulation software development, broke out of themainframe mindset that crippled progress for years. What they created - aportable, PC-based, robotic simulation program with offline programming andonline robot calibration capabilities- means every robotics manufacturer,systems integrator and robot user can have access to an affordable and effectivetool for increasing production profits. Simulations created using WORKSPACE ona personal computer can be sent by e-mail and via the Internet to anyoneanywhere in the world, who is using a PC with Microsoft Windows. WORKSPACEsimulation analysis is not site specific, and the ability to transmitsimulation freely to virtually anyone opens the door to unobstructedinternational resources. I believe, without hesitation or doubt, thatPC-based simulation technology is the sleeping giant of the 1990's. And thegiant has just yawned.

AWorkspace user who has engineered a robotics or automated system can transmit -via e-mail, modem or Internet - a complete simulation file to any computer thatuses Microsoft Windows. Only the originator of the simulation must haveWorkspace.  "This new capability has created the ultimate engineering, marketingand manufacturing tool," says Walter K. Weisel, CEO of Robotic WorkspaceTechnologies, Inc., exclusive North American marketers of Workspace. "Noweach person on the team can view a simulation in real time, confer by conferencecall, make engineering decisions and marketing decisions all at the same timewithout ever leaving their individual offices. All that's required is a PC withMicrosoft Windows and a phone to talk with each other." The PC-generated simulation to be transmitted (called a "Flick File")contains a full-shaded color, 3D simulation, which runs all the peripherals,including robots in real time. Before sending the file, the Workspace userconverts the simulation being run on the PC into a real time picture file. This computer file is then sent via e-mail, Internet, or on a 3.5 floppy toas many worldwide locations as necessary.  During the conference call, all parties watch the same simulation in theirown offices, and discuss and approve proposals, engineering changes, and floorlayouts. Changes can be made quickly in software to verify any new requirements. "Before now, the only way to evaluate a workcell or other system was tocoordinate schedules and meet at one location," Weisel says. "Concurrencythrough electronic mail means there's no lost time from the calendar, no flyingin from around the country or around the world, and incalculable time saved ingetting a system up and running. The Workspace software allows everyone to testdrive the application before ordering the hardware. "Smart buyers around the world are becoming keenly aware of the need tosimulate a system's capabilities before  purchasing expensive hardware,"Weisel adds. "The power of today's PC makes this job easy and theportability - both via electronic mail or operating on a notebook - changes theway we think about proof of concept."

"We were really an afterthought to the customers project plans for a large computer supplier." states Walt Weisel, President and CEO of Robotic Workspace Technologies, Inc.(RWT). RWT is the exclusive North American distributor of Workspace®, the world's first PC based robot simulation and off-line programming software package developed by Robotic Simulations, Ltd. of the UK. "The integrator gave us the project to model as a challenge to evaluate Workspace®. Using their 2D CAD drawings and rough layout plans, we modeled the cell in Workspace® and created a 3D animation that told them more than they were expecting to find. They had already purchased the robot and were building enclosures based on the 2D drawings and rough modeling in their shop. Which is a fairly standard practice in the industry for companies not using simulation." One of the first comments we got from their design team was that we were asking them questions about components of the cell they normally would not have researched until they were in the final phases of  build-up. So not only did we create a proactive approach to the design and layout, we later discovered several things that would have cost thousands more than the initial purchase of the software. We met with the customer at their facility with the robot setting in the back room awaiting the cell build-up. "The first thing we proved through the simulation was the robot could not reach all of the fixtures it needed to. In a 2D CAD drawing it looked feasible, but when you add in the true reach of the robot model, they were coming up short. This was coupled with major collisions in the cycle that would have destroyed the fixtures and the controller monitor. They had also realized the cycle time shown in simulation was 30 seconds over contract time. Even under perfect cycle simulations, they were not going to make their goal and the goal their customer was expecting under contract. All in all, they would have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars including their reputation." "With the simulation in hand, they were able to quickly redesign the cell, reposition the robot, change fixtures and redevelop the entire process with the customer to achieve cycle times and actually exceed the customer's expectations. The ability of Workspace® to run on their notebook computer and they could easily take the simulation right to the customers desk, allowed them to graphically show the story and sell the customer without lengthy delays while they deciphered drawings and made their own calculations. They were also able to leave a copy of the simulation for the customer to run on their own PC, using the animation player feature of Workspace®, the customer only needed to have a PC running Windows 3.11." "This is just one of the success stories we have shared with customers and Workspace®." adds Walt. We have such an affordable alternative to the expensive UNIX- based systems that do not have the portability and versatility this program has to offer. For off-line programming, this system is without comparison in it's seamless, native language code writing for over 174 models of robots using 22 different languages. We also have connectivity capabilities only available with a PC based system. We are bringing true, open-architecture to robot users who have been held hostage to antiquated technology."

Off-line, robot programming is possible with the new "intelligent" software options Fort Myers Beach, FL (September 6, 1996): For the past twenty -five years, the robotics industry has dreamed and worked to find the solution to robot accuracy. Repeatability has been perfected with robot manufacturers concentrating on the hardware of the robot. Now that we have achieved this level of repeatability we want accuracy. Will it come from hardware innovations or follow in the footsteps of the other leading edge technology, from intelligent software solutions. A technology company in Fort Myers Beach, FL has combined the knowledge of a 25 yr. Founder of the industry and an inexpensive software program to achieve what everyone thinks is impossible. Robotic Workspace Technologies, Inc., has proven at multiple sites that robot accuracy is not only attainable but is also affordable. Using the Robotrak and Workspace software package, they have achieved results that no robot manufacturer would begin to offer a user. Their customers have improved inaccuracies from 22mm to .9mm and subsequently saved millions of dollars in the first year.  The piece to the puzzle that has been neglected is in the "brain" of the robot; the software that controls it. Robot manufacturers and third party software vendors have either walked away or have avoided following in the same directions as other technology markets. The PC revolution would have stalled 10 years ago if they had relied on hardware innovations to fuel the advancements in computer technology. It was the software development companies that have created more intelligent programs that have conversely solved many of the hardware limitations.  The technology is available today that will allow you to go beyond mastering your robot and allow you to "signature" each robot. By defining the robot's manufactured discrepancies, each robot can be calibrated in off-line programming to achieve accuracy at the tool tip.It is these robot discrepancies that have plagued robot, off-line programming innovators to state that it is "just not possible." Robotrak® and Workspace® are the cost effective solutions to off-line programming through actual native language programming of your production floor robot. With these two, PC based applications, you can get each individual robots signature and then utilize the kinematics of each robot as you generate the off-line program. Robotrak® is the robot calibration and signature tool that utilizes a series of calibration moves to provide Workspace, an off-line and simulation software package, with the measurements of difference in the robot components. Through the use of Robotrak, you can generate a true signature of the robot that is then utilized in the calculation of the robot program through Workspace®. It is this measurement of robot arm positioning that permits Workspace® to effectively and accurately off-line program the robot controller. Once the signature is determined, about a 30 minute operation, the differentiation in the kinematics is applied to the robot arm positioning algorithm. This imported data becomes a true simulation of the robot on the production floor. Now when Workspace® creates the simulation using your imported, 3D CAD part, you are actually programming the exact robot you have on the floor to the exact part you are manufacturing. Now off-line programming with accuracy is achievable. Workspace® does not utilize language translators but instead uses interpreters that allow you to program in native language just like a teach pendant would. This eliminates the problems associated with other third party programs that program in a proprietary language and rely on post processors to translate the language into something the robot controller can understand.  "We recently received a request from an automotive OEM supplier who was looking for a way to reduce robot programming downtime and to improve tolerances to under 3 mm," said Walt Weisel, CEO of Robotic Workspace Technologies, the exclusive North American dealer of Robotrak and Workspace. "They were losing over $17,000 per month in downtime charged to reprogramming robots. In addition, the lost production at $12.00 per part, per minute created an additional loss of $204,000. Within a 1.5 hour process with Robotrak and Workspace, we were able to take the part tolerance to within .9 mm of accuracy and cut the programming time down to under one hour. An hourly programming savings of over 6 hours on just one of their 30 robots. A high ranking official was so astonished when he added up all of the savings, that he is implementing a 200 plant task force to implement the technology. The total annual savings could, conservatively, exceed $200 million dollars in the first year." To walk away from off-line programming or to settle for the results you are getting is a shame. There is a better answer to achieve substantial savings and to reduce downtime production losses due to teach pendant programming and minimally successful off-line programming.

WORKSPACE®, offered by Florida-based Robotic Workspace Technologies(RWT), Inc., is the world's first PC-based program that creates real-timesimulation of robotic workcells with its own 3D CAD system.  It also provideseffective off-line programming and on-line calibration of individual robotsusing seamless software on a single PC or notebook. There are over 700 systemsinstalled worldwide. WORKSPACE costs a small fraction - less than 1/3 - of engineeringworkstation systems in use today.  A few of the features and cost savings are: complete 3D simulation of entire workcells on a PC, including notebooks; direct CAD input (DXF, IGES): off-line programming in the robot's native language without interruptingrobot operation; on-line robot and workcell calibration; new-program development time reduced; design-before-you-build allows costly errors to be corrected before theybecome hardware; on-line robot program editing and verification WORKSPACE saves time, delivers greater accuracy, and is easier to use thanmainframe and engineering workstation systems.  The system's purchase price isunder $28,000.  WORKSPACE may also be rented or leased, an ideal route toimproved productivity today when the budget says wait.  WORKSPACE was developed for the PC platform in the late 1980's by RobotSimulations, Ltd. (United Kingdom) and is now offered exclusively by RoboticWorkspace Technologies, Inc., 17105 San Carlos Boulevard, Suite A6151, FortMyers Beach, Florida, 33931; (941) 466-0488; FAX (941) 466-7270.

That means the alreadylow-priced software can be installed immediately by manufacturers who thoughtthey had to wait for another budget cycle. Robotic Workspace Technologies (RWT), Inc., exclusive North Americanmarketers of WORKSPACE, recently added the rent and lease options, said CEOWalter K. Weisel.  "For an average of $1,500 a month, a manufacturer canlease this highly sophisticated software that creates and simulates roboticworkcells and other production processes with its own 3D CAD system."  Thelease fee converts to $8-10 an hour for a single shift, and less than $5 an hourfor a double shift. WORKSPACE features include simulation, a 3D CAD modeler, off-lineprogramming in the robot's native language, and on-line robot and workcellcalibration.  "For the first time, manufacturers have the ability to proveout the feasibility of robotic workcells before they commit to hardware,"Weisel said. In addition to the lease program, which can be converted to a purchase atany time, RWT rents WORKSPACE for individual simulation projects.  RWT alsoprovides support to get new users up and running, and a three-day trainingperiod is included in the lease fee. "There are many advantages to the rent/lease opportunities,"Weisel said.  "Two are critical.  First, a manufacturer who cannotauthorize a $28,000 capital investment to buy the system today can lease nowrather than wait to convert to this cost- and time-saving system in six months,a year or more.  Second, there are still some who just can't believe howaccurate and easy it is to operate WORKSPACE.  They now have a chance to workwith the PC-based simulation software before they decide to install the systempermanently."

Furthermore,the manufacture, distribution and consumption of petroleum products isreceiving ever-increasing attention, not least from the public at large. Air quality in particular is under the regulatory spotlight, not onlybecause of the European Auto/Oil Programme, the first phase of which reacheda conclusion in June, but also as a result of other legislative procedures,e.g. the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC), the Air QualityFramework Directive (AQFD) and the possibility of further directives relatingto fuels and vehicle emissions. The need for the oil industry to understand and address such issueseffectively means a growth in demand for CONCAWE�s expertise. This need,however, comes at a time when the industry continues to face problems ofprofitability and consequential staff and budget cutbacks. The problemis compounded by the trend towards increasing specialization. The reason that CONCAWE was founded (more than 33 years ago), i.e. topool limited resources to study environment, health, and safety issuesof mutual interest, makes even more sense now. The efficient use of theseresources will be one of my main priorities as Chairman. I will ensure that the Management Groups and the CONCAWE Secretariatcontinue to work closely together. Collectively, we will maintain an ongoingdialogue within the industry to ensure that we have a good understandingof upcoming issues and priorities. In this way, we will be able to undertakeappropriate technical programmes to form the basis of sound decision-makingin a timely manner. It is also my intention to ensure that CONCAWE maintains its reputationfor technical excellence, even-handedness and openness. We will continueto provide advice, guidance and data for the European legislative decision-makingprocess, based on sound-science and costeffectiveness principles, in away which will continue to provide excellent value for money. We will be working hard to improve communications and networking betweenCONCAWE�s member companies, particularly through better use of electronicmedia. Recognizing also the ongoing need to demonstrate the value of CONCAWE�sactivities, and to publicise the results of our work, we will be assessingthe use of other options, such as newsletters, information meetings, andissues briefings, in addition to the traditional medium of the CONCAWEReview. We will also be following with interest the response to our InternetHome Page which was opened recently.

Theengine behind the CONCAWE reputation as a �tell it as it is� organizationis the stream of high quality technical studies which, since inceptionin 1963, CONCAWE has been reporting into the public domain. As time haspassed, the questions being addressed have become much more complex, moreto do with economics and more interactive with other issues. Studies were,therefore, taking longer to complete. Each study group had to establishits own basis and boundaries whilst working simultaneously but independentlyof each other. The reconciliation of results was becoming bedevilled byapparent anomalies in the basic data and planning assumptions employed.In the late eighties, CONCAWE�s Refining Planning Advisory Group (RPAG)was formed to establish a structure for carrying out industry-wide refiningstudies and to provide the computing tools to do the job. At the core of the toolmaking was the CONCAWE Linear Programming (LP)model; the foundation of the structure was the establishment of a planningcycle to provide a planning basis and to update it when necessary. Thefirst CONCAWE planning cycle was carried out in 1994 and was made available(CONCAWE document no. 95/02) on request to anyone in the business of doingrefinery studies. The structure has proved to be invaluable in carryingout the many refining studies required for the European Auto/Oil Programme,and for others such as the disposal options for used lubricating oils. At the heart of any planning basis is an oil product demand forecast.CONCAWE has not tried to set itself up in the �crystal ball� forecastingdepartment but uses the Directorate General for Energy (DG-XVII) view ofthe future. This forms a major element in determining the effects of initiativeswhich can arise in any of the European legislative bodies. DG-XVII hasrecently published its views in �European Energy to 2020�. The CONCAWERPAG has analysed these views in the context of its own thinking on thesupply side of the equation, such as crude slate developments and futurerefinery processing economics trends. The results of this analysis havebeen reviewed by a number of independent consultants having an acknowledgedexpertise in the field. Thus, armed with knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses in the supplyand demand scenarios, the RPAG is proceeding with its 1996 Planning Cycle.The CONCAWE LP model is being used to develop a detailed planning basisfor the year 2000 through to 2010 and beyond. This should be ready wellbefore the end of this year.

Urban air quality is one of the most widely discussed of all the environmentalissues. It has grabbed the attention of the media, public, legislatorsand politicians. The European Auto/Oil Programme carried out by the EuropeanCommission and the auto and oil industries, aimed to introduce measuresto meet stringent air quality targets across Europe with particular emphasison large metropolitan areas. This article concentrates on the implicationsof the Auto/Oil Programme for urban air quality across Europe and is followedby one on regional ozone and another on the emissioncontrol proposals. Sevencities with existing emission inventories and air quality data were chosenas representative for Europe in terms of their air quality, size, location,and topography. These were Athens, Den Haag, Köln, London, Lyon, Madridand Milano. ASSESMENT OF CURRENT URBAN QUALITY The review of air quality from 1980 onward examined a range of pollutantsincluding: benzene, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, particulatematter, and total hydrocarbons. It concluded that, in general, one or moreEuropean Union air quality limit values or WHO air quality guidelines havebeen exceeded on occasion in all of the cities studied. AGREED AIR QUALITY TARGET VALUES Target values were selected for modelling purposes in the Auto/Oil Programmeas agreed EU air quality objectives (AQOs) are not yet available. The basisfor these reference values was a pragmatic one. Guidance for their settingwas gained from guidelines set out by the World Health Organization (SeeHealth Effects of Nitrogen Oxides) and by referenceto other standards or guidelines in EU Member States which are generallymore exacting than in the USA. *Air quality data are measured as NO2;NOx emissions are converted to an "as NO2"basis. ** Equivalent to an annual mean of 1500 µg/m3.*** Long-term aspirational value LINKING EMISSIONS TO URBAN AIR QUALITY Internationally recognized and tested air quality models were used toestablish the relationships between emissions and air quality. Three pollutants-nitrogenoxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and benzene-were predicted for the baseyear 1990. Three different 'state-of-the-art' atmospheric dispersion modelswere used to ensure that any prediction was robust and not due to the choiceof model. For each of the seven cities, a 100 km x 100 km area includingthe city and its surroundings was examined at a resolution of 2 km x 2km. In addition, two types of meteorological conditions were examined,one that would represent average conditions and one that would be typicalfor the production of an episode of particularly poor urban air quality. Air quality models considered emissions from: passenger cars (gasolineand diesel); two-wheeled vehicles; buses; light-duty and heavy-duty commercialvehicles; and large-, medium- and small-size stationary sources. Source-receptor relationships were established and the contributionsto air pollution from each of the various source categories determinedfor each 2 km x 2 km square in each city. Figure 1a shows the 1990 basecase annual mean NOx concentrations for London, and Figures 1b and 1c showhow these decrease by 2010 for two cases. If European cities are rankedin terms of their overall air quality, approximately 80 per cent of themhave better air quality than London. The yellow areas show where the annualmean NOx air quality target of 66 µg/m3* is exceeded. Predicted annual mean NOx concentrations in air for London Figure 1.

The previous article was about urban air pollution. Elevated concentrationsof ozone, however, are found in both rural and urban locations. This articleon ozone moves away from urban to regional air quality. It highlights theeffect of the Auto/Oil Programme proposed measures on ozone formation acrossEurope. Ozone is considered a pollutant in the lower atmosphere because, abovecertain concentrations, it can cause respiratory irritancy, adverse effectson breathing and damage to plants. However, in the stratosphere, ozoneforms a protective layer absorbing potentially-damaging ultra-violet lightbefore it reaches the Earth's surface. In the lower atmosphere, ozone is formed through complex reactions involvingnitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), aided by sunlight.Ozone concentrations are linked to the relative proportions of VOC andNOx concentrations, weather conditions and topography. Sources of VOCsand NOx are both man-made and natural. In 1990, road vehicles contributed36 per cent of man-made VOC emissions and 51 per cent of NOx emissions. MODELLING OF OZONE GENERATION Europeanozone levels were modelled by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. ItsEMEP (UN-ECE's 'Cooperative programme for monitoring and evaluation oftransmission for air pollutants in Europe') regional ozone model is usedwithin the UN-ECE under the Convention on Long Range Transboundary AirPollution in Europe. It takes into account the reactions of the variouschemicals that together lead to the formation of lower atmosphere ozone,and predicts ozone air quality on the basis of emissions data for 50 kmby 50 km grid squares. The data on the effects of measures are presentedfor 150 km by 150 km grid squares. a) Ozone concentrations, 1990 b) Ozone concentrations, 2010 c) Ozone concentrations, 2010 Precursors emissions=50% reduction (Auto/Oil + base case measures on stationary sources). d) Ozone concentrations, 2010 Precursors emissions=70% reduction Figure 1. EMEP-predicted ozone concentrations(µg/m3), mean hourly values, 99 percentile The model's 1-hour ozone predictions for 1990 (Figure 1a) fit well withavailable measurement data, although EMEP's highest 1-hour predictionsfor 1990 are generally higher than the measured data (Figure 2). EMEP predictsozone on a regional scale but does not predict urban concentrations. Allof the Figures are based on European Commission data, available on CD-ROM. Figure 2. EMEP's highest 1-hour predictions for 1990 are generally higher than the measured data. Figure 1a clearly shows that, in 1990, exceedances of the 1-hour averageozone level of 180 µg/m3 reference value at 99 per cent compliancelevels (see table in Auto/Oil-perspectives onurban air quality) were centred primarily in Northern Europe, with thepeak concentrations of those exceedances centred around the Benelux region.Given this current situation, the Auto/Oil Programme, through EMEP, hasattempted to determine the effect of already-agreed environmental controlson future air quality, and what more needs to be done to meet ozone airquality targets in Europe.

During the three years of very hard work in the Auto/Oil Programme anEU strategy has been developed to deliver the least-cost measures to meetthe agreed reference air quality values on the five pollutants of concern.On 18th June, the European Commission adopted two of the legislative proposalsrequired to implement the strategy. These proposals are now submitted tothe European Parliament and Council for adoption before they can becomelegislation. The most costly of the two proposals, and the one which provides thelargest benefit in terms of air quality, concerns the setting of tighteremissions standards for passenger cars. The other proposal, providing smallerbut commensurate benefits, concerns tightening of fuel specifications forgasoline and diesel fuel. Both proposals are intended to be implementedby 1st January 2000. Further legislative proposals will be presented nextyear concerning emissions standards for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles,and vehicle inspection and maintenance. Moreover, the Commission has suggesteda follow-up to the Auto/Oil programme to evaluate the need for furthermeasures, and other EU initiatives are underway which target stationarysource emission controls. ROAD FUELS QUALITIES FOR YEAR 2000 The main changes to gasoline and diesel fuel quality specificationsare shown in the two tables below. The changes in the average qualitiesfor these transport fuels marketed in the EU, which are intended to resultfrom the specifications, are also given. The total cost of the Auto/Oil package is predicted at some 82.5 billionECU Net Present Value (NPV) over 15 years. Of this, the oil industry�scosts in implementing fuels changes will be in the region of 11.5 billionECU ($15 billion). Most of this is upfront capital investment of 7.2 billionECU. In practical terms, this means that, on average, every oil refineryin the EU will have to find roughly $80 million to assure compliance. Theword �average� should be treated with caution because, for example, thereare a few complex refineries with low sulphur crude slates that will needto do very little; some other refineries will be very hard hit. EMISSION REDUCTIONS DUE TO THE IMPROVED FUELS The methodology used does not require that the contribution to the overallemissions reductions due to the fuels part of the package should be inapproximately the same proportion as its share of the package costs (around15 per cent). In fact, the fuels measures were only just selected as theyare among the least cost-effective of the measures chosen. Only benzene(-15 to -20 per cent, but amounting to only a kilotonne or so of emissionsby 2010) and to a much lesser extent particulate matter (Pm, -6 per cent)are reduced anything like commensurately by the fuels measures. The reductionsof NOx and VOCs are only a few per cent at best (see CONCAWEReview Volume 5, Number 1 (April 1996), pages 10 and 11 for more onthis). The small fuels effects on these particularly important pollutantsmeans that extreme fuel formulations with steeply higher costs, such asCalifornian style gasoline and Swedish city diesel, are inappropriate forgeneral application across Europe. NEXT STEPS The oil industry believes that, overall, the fuels proposals constitutea well-judged response in an optimum package to meet real environmentalneeds. Clearly, there is now much to do to inform properly those bodiesreviewing the proposals. If this is successful, it is expected that thisdraft legislation will be adopted by the EU in the next year or two.

The October 1995 edition of the CONCAWE Review (Volume 4, Number 2)introduced the purpose and scope of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive(AQFD). This, together with its air pollutant-specific daughter directives,will constitute the legal basis for the monitoring and control of air pollutionin the EU Member States. Over the past year, much work has been carriedout in the EU Working Groups which are developing the standards, and inthe UNICE* Shadow Groups. So far, four position papers are being developed (on lead, NOx, SO2and particulate matter (Pm)) by the four EU Working Groups in which MemberStates (usually 6), the European Commission, the European Research Centre,the Non-Governmental organizations, the European Environmental Agency andIndustry participate by supplying single representatives. The Commissionwill use these position papers as a basis for developing draft proposalsfor air quality standards and measurement requirements. CONCAWE�s major contribution is scientific analysis, and a CONCAWE AQFDCoordination Group has been set up to coordinate the oil industry inputinto the UNICE Shadow Groups and the cost-benefit study (see later). CONCAWEhas representatives in the Shadow Groups on NOx and SO2, and chairs theShadow Group on Pm through which it also takes on the role as the industryrepresentative on the EU Working Group on Pm. In view of its major interestin benzene, CONCAWE will make available to UNICE a member company expertto represent industry in the EU Working Group on the air quality standardfor benzene. The EU Working Groups are developing a position paper for each pollutant,which deals with all aspects of measurement and monitoring, and with health/environmentalrisk characterization. Based upon the guidelines prepared by the WHO regionaloffice for Europe, the Working Groups have determined the range of valueswhich should be considered as health-/environment-based starting pointsfor EU ambient air quality standards. CONCAWE has concentrated its effortson the health risk characterizations since, in most cases, health protectionconsiderations will determine the scientific basis for the standards. CONCAWE reports have been prepared for use in the UNICE Shadow Groupsand the EU Working Groups for each air pollutant currently under discussion(except lead) and for the Phase 2 air pollutants (benzene, carbon monoxideand ozone) on which work will start in the autumn of this year. CONCAWE is also preparing a critical review of the recently publishedepidemiological studies which form part of the Commission-funded APHEAproject (short-term effects of air pollution on health: a European approachusing epidemiological time series data). These studies have been carriedout in a number of European cities and investigate the associations betweenexposures during episodes of air pollution, mortality and hospital admissions.It is CONCAWE�s opinion that these studies, because of their very nature,can only be used for generating hypotheses, and not for quantitative riskassessment. Most of the work so far has been concentrated on the health/environmentalrisk characterization and on the measurement and monitoring techniques.Recently a consultant has been appointed by the Commission to study thefinancial cost-benefits of setting a range of ambient air quality standards,and the expected health benefits. This cost-benefit study was originallyplanned to be carried out by each Working Group, but is now to be doneby the consultant on behalf of all working groups. Through UNICE, CONCAWEis actively contributing to this study, using expertise gained in the Auto/Oilstudy. CONCAWE representatives will continue to input into the health riskcharacterizations when the relevant CONCAWE reports are discussed in meetingsof the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health, the UNICE ShadowGroups and the EU Working Groups. CONCAWE representatives will also continue to stress the need for differentiationbetween the risk characterization and the risk management processes (seepage 1 of CONCAWE Review, Volume 5, Number1 (April 1996). The experts involved in the risk characterization processshould not make their own choice as to which sensitive populations shouldbe protected. They should present to the risk manager all known dose-responserelationships for those populations which vary in degree of susceptibility.It is the role of the risk manager to determine which populations shouldbest be protected with generic measures, such as ambient air quality standards,and which should receive additional protection by following up with specifictailor-made measures or advice. The risk manager should combine and integrate the knowledge generatedin the review of measurement and monitoring methodologies and in the riskcharacterization process with the results from the cost-benefit studies,before deciding on a proposal for a numerical standard. In doing so, therisk manager will need to understand the degree of certainty associatedwith the health-/environmentally-based proposals for standards. A dialoguebetween the risk assessors and the risk managers is therefore essential. * Union of Industrial and Employers� Confederationsof Europe WT03-B18-146IA019-000199-B016-515http://www62.interpac.be:80/HTML/VOLUME52/Health.htm 193.53.125.113 19970106200548 text/html 7430HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsMIME-Version: 1.0Server: CERN/3.0.interpacDate: Monday, 06-Jan-97 20:04:18 GMTContent-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 7218Last-Modified: Tuesday, 03-Dec-96 09:39:13 GMT   European oil industry accident statistics    Health effects of nitrogen oxides A reasonable level of compliance with theWHO-Europe NO2 guideline will suffice Nitrogen oxides are natural constituents of the atmosphere and, fromthe point of view of health effects, the most important of them are nitrogenmonoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), collectively referred to as NOx.Emissions are roughly 90 per cent NO and 10 per cent NO2. However, in airNO is rapidly oxidized to NO2, the oxide which has been studied more extensivelythan NO. People can breathe nitrogen oxides in low concentrations in air withoutany apparent adverse effects but NOx in polluted urban air can, on occasions,have a measurable effect on human breathing. However, these effects arereversible, i.e. after the elevated exposure is ended, the function ofthe lungs returns naturally to what it was previously. Although the effectsare reversible, some, such as excessive airway constriction, can be dangerousto the individual concerned and must therefore be taken into account whenconsidering appropriate air quality standards. The air quality guidelineproposed for ambient NO2 concentrations by the World Health OrganizationRegional Office for Europe (see also "Linkingemissions to urban air quality" & "Predictingfuture air quality") is 200 µg per cubic metre of air (0.11ppm) measured over a 1-hour exposure period. A great advantage of reversible health effects is, that they can beresearched in experiments with humans. For many air pollutants, much researchhas been carried out with human volunteers in chamber studies where exposurescan be maintained at controlled levels and the effects can be measureddirectly. The populations studied include healthy people, young and old,and people with obstructive lung disease (e.g. asthmatics). The studieshave covered exposures to NO2, both on its own and in conjunction withother materials which cause constriction of the airways. Exposure timeshave ranged from 10 minutes to six hours, with or without exercise. Exposureconcentrations of NO2 in the chambers have ranged from 0.1 ppm to a highof 4 ppm. The effect of NO2 on lung function has been assessed by measuring lungcapacity (FEV1) and airway responsiveness (AR) following exposure of normaland asthmatic patients to various concentrations of NO2. Based on normalvariability, a reduction in lung capacity of more than 5 per cent for healthyindividuals and about 11 per cent for patients with airways obstruction(e.g. asthmatics) is necessary before the change from normal is consideredsignificant. The results of all the research are, firstly, that healthy subjectsshow no significant change in lung function from baseline at NO2 concentrationsas high as 2 ppm. Furthermore, studies of several hundred asthmatics indicatethat most patients with chronic obstructivepulmonary disease(COPD) also show no apparent change in lung function from baseline as aresult of exposure to NO2 concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 3 ppm. Onthe other hand, five studies on asthmatic and other COPD patients exposedto 0.3 ppm NO2 give different results. These five studies show decreasesof lung function ranging between 5.1 per cent and 14 per cent; howeveronly two of these studies have been published in full in peer-reviewedjournals. Secondly, the data on airways responsiveness show that for both healthyand asthmatic subjects, exposure to NO2 causes an increase in the responseto agents such as cold air, SO2 and ozone. However, the data also showthat the increased effect on lung function overall is small and indistinguishablefrom normal variations. Thus, overall, the evidence indicates that there is little or no changein lung function as a result of short-term exposures to NO2 concentrationsup to a few ppm for both healthy subjects and patients with asthma andobstructive airway disease. Concentrations of NO2 likely to be found inambient air cause marginal changes in lung function which are so smallas to be indistinguishable from the background variability of people breathingunpolluted air. The 1995 WHO-Europe guideline for NO2 is based on a 50 per cent uncertaintymargin applied to the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 0.2to 0.3 ppm for 1 to 2 hour experimental exposures to NO2 in chamber studies.The health endpoints used by WHO-Europe are: a) small reductions in lungfunction (>5 per cent drop in FEV1); and b) changes in airway responsiveness. The 50 per cent uncertainty factor is based on a possible increasedairway responsiveness in one study at 0.1 ppm, and a meta-analysis (reviewof epidemiological data from several studies) suggesting a threshold forincreased airway responsiveness below 0.2 ppm. WHO-Europe indicates thatthe LOAEL for 'possible small effects in pulmonary function of asthmatics'is about 0.21 ppm, and that simultaneous and/or sequential exposures toNO2 and an aeroallergen (an allergic substance in aerosol form) 'increasethe risk of an exacerbated airway response'. The LOAEL for healthy personsis acknowledged to be greater than 1 ppm. Thus the rationale for the 0.11ppm NO2 guideline is to avoid changes in airway responsiveness and to avoidexacerbation of airway constriction in COPD patients when concomitant exposureto aeroallergens and NO2 occur. It follows that a reasonable level of compliance (e.g. 98 per cent ofthe time) with the precautionary WHO guideline will provide an adequatelevel of health protection.

Benzene was included in the first list of priority substances for evaluationunder the requirements of the EU Regulation (No. 793/93) on the evaluationand control of the risks of existing substances. There were 42 substanceson the first list, published in May 1994, and benzene is one of 18 forwhich Germany is the rapporteur. In Germany, the competent authority requested industry to prepare areport, characterizing the risk for benzene, which would be used as thebasis for the risk assessment. When the rapporteur has prepared the riskassessment report it will be reviewed by industry and EU Member States'experts, before final approval. It was also agreed that all sources ofbenzene (including its presence in gasoline) should be taken into accountin the risk characterization. The place of this risk characterization inthe overall risk assessment process was covered in CONCAWE Review Volume4, Number 1 (April 1995), pp. 12-14. The risk characterization report was prepared, under contract, by ExxonBiomedical Sciences Inc. (EBSI) for CONCAWE, EUROPIA and the CEFIC AromaticProducers Association (APA). It was given to the German competent authorityin May 1996, who now has to prepare the EU risk assessment for benzene.However, the time-scale for this is unclear and completion could take sometime. The purpose of this article is to explain briefly what is includedin the Industry report and to summarize the key findings regarding thecharacterization of the environmental and health risks associated withbenzene. The industry risk characterization report follows closely the TechnicalGuidance Document which was prepared jointly by EU Member States, the Commissionand Industry. It represents the most up-to-date, comprehensive review ofthe environmental and health effects of benzene. THE FINDINGS Health The report summarizes the various health effects that have been describedand identifies the no observedadverse effectlevel (NOAEL) for each of them. The criticalhuman health effect (i.e. the adverse health effect of most concern) fromrepeated occupational exposure to low levels of benzene is the occurrenceof acute non-lymphocyticleukaemia (ANLL). The epidemiology studies demonstrate that ANLL has occurred above occupationalexposure levels of 20-50 parts per million (ppm) of benzene in the ambientair, i.e. 64 000 to 160 000 microgrammes per cubic metre (µg/m3)expressed as long-termaverage concentrations (LTA). ANLL has notbeen observed in individuals occupationally exposed to levels of 1 ppmor less. Mechanistic studies indicate that the occurrence of ANLL is a multi-stepprocess and some of the steps do not occur unless a certain threshold concentrationis exceeded. It follows, that the overall process of the occurrence ofANLL is dependent on a threshold concentration, which differs from theprevious view that, for benzene carcinogenesis, the threshold concentrationis zero. The true threshold concentration for ANLL lies somewhere between 1 and20 ppm LTA, possibly even higher. For the purpose of the risk characterization,1 ppm (3200 (µg/m3) has been taken as the NOAEL which is a conservative,responsible approach. The report includes the available exposure data for each of four sub-populationsof the general public, and 46 sub-populations of workers occupationallyexposed to benzene. For each of the sub-populations it calculates the marginsof safety (MOS)i.e. the ratios of the NOAELs to the observed exposure concentrations whichoccur. The arithmetic mean levels of benzene to which the general public isexposed are calculated to range from 8.6 µg/m3 (2.7 parts per billion-ppb)to 10.9 µg/m3 (3.4 ppb). The MOS calculations show that the meandegree of safety with respect to benzene carcinogenesis is about a factorof 300 or more. Furthermore, urban benzene levels are expected to dropsubstantially over the next few years due to the progressive replacementof non-catalyst equipped cars and other legislated measures. Thus thereis at present no need for risk reduction measures beyond those that arebeing applied already. For the worker sub-populations, mean exposures are generally below 3200µg/m3 and therefore the cancer risk MOSs are above 1. Gathering furtherinformation, and/or more testing is indicated for a few groups of workers. Environment All reported effects on aquatic and terrestrial organisms are summarizedand, for each reported effect, the concentration at which no effect isobserved-the predicted noeffect concentration(PNEC)-is identified. These PNECs are compared with the available informationon the measured or predicted environmentalconcentrations (PECs) of benzene in the variousenvironmental compartments, in order to identify scenarios involving risk. Most industrial benzene plants with advanced effluent treatment plantspose no benzene-related environmental risks. In the few cases where thereis limited waste-water treatment the uncertainty is greater. For such sites,further monitoring and emissions data are required to refine the evaluations. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? The existence of a threshold concentration means that the low levelsof benzene exposure for the general public poses no health risks. Furthercontrols on benzene emissions are not expected to have any effect at allon the risk of contracting leukaemia. From an occupational health point of view it is important to recognizethat, currently, there are only very few industrial activities possiblyassociated with occupational exposures to benzene at levels greater than1 ppm LTA. This is because either the operation itself is not practisedso widely and/or controls have been introduced to reduce exposure levels.Continued monitoring is required, however, to verify the current situationand to ensure that occupational exposure to benzene is kept within the1 ppm level. Water, air and soil-borne exposures to benzene do not pose a risk tothe environment, except possibly in some industrial and commercial situationswhere there are no waste-water treatment facilities. Provided that furthermonitoring can establish that benzene levels in surface waters are belowpredicted no-effect levels at these locations, no further action is anticipated. The findings from the risk characterization of benzene should be usedeffectively in continuing to underwrite the basis for an EU OccupationalExposure Limit of 1 ppm for benzene and during the forthcoming discussionson the development of an Air Quality Standard for benzene. If considered necessary, the rapporteur will recommend further riskreduction measures and, for the petroleum industry, this would mainly concerngasoline. However, it is agreed by the European Commission and Member Statesthat any measures relating to gasoline will not be recommended until arisk assessment report has been prepared for gasoline itself under theExisting Substances Regulation.

WHAT IS ASPIRATION? Aspiration is the introduction of liquid into the lungs. It is almostalways an accidental process involving a single dose and it may occur directlyor indirectly. When it occurs directly liquids 'go down the wrong way',i.e. they enter the respiratory tract rather than the digestive tract andso find their way to the lungs. Aspiration frequently occurs indirectlywhen hydrocarbon liquids are swallowed, following which vomiting occursas a natural reaction, and it is this secondary effect that may resultin liquid entering the respiratory tract. EFFECTS OF ASPIRATION OF HYDROCARBONS The only class of substances that has received significant study interms of the effects of aspiration are hydrocarbons. Animal experimentswere performed by Gerarde and reported in 1963. He found that aspirationof as little as 0.1 ml kerosine could be lethal to rats. In contact withthe lungs, light hydrocarbons spread rapidly and cause lung inflammationwhich is referred to as 'chemical pneumonitis'. The latter condition developsrapidly and it can be fatal for humans, just as much as for animals. Whereasfor gasoline a single lethal dose for adults would be about 400 ml if swallowed,a much lower volume (perhaps 2 to 3 ml) could prove fatal, if aspirated. Which petroleum products present an aspiration hazard? Gerarde found that all petroleum products having a viscosity below45 SSU (Saybolt Seconds Universal) at 100°F (37.8°C)-equivalentto 7 cSt at 40°C-presented an aspiration hazard. In addition to individualhydrocarbons he found that the normally-marketed products such as gasoline,kerosine, diesel fuel, home heating oil and hydrocarbon solvents couldall cause mortality in animals by aspiration. However, a medicinal productsuch as liquid paraffin was too viscous to cause significant effects, evenif it managed to reach the lung by aspiration. Human experience of aspiration Analysis of hospital admissions has revealed that human exposure byaspiration almost always occurs in domestic situations through the accidentalswallowing of petroleum products and subsequent vomiting. Such incidentsmost frequently involve young children who are particularly at risk sincelow doses can have serious effects. The temporary storage of solvents orfuels in drinks containers can result in such incidents. A further obviousadult activity that carries an aspiration risk is siphoning gasoline. EMERGENCY TREATMENT For those involved in the emergency treatment of patients who have swallowedpetroleum products, the primary advice is that vomiting must not be inducedsince this clearly carries the additional risk of secondary aspirationof liquid into the lungs. The emergency treatment of patients who haveexperienced aspiration is even more important. The key step is to obtainmedical attention immediately and make sure that the casualty is sittingin a half upright position. CLASSIFYING AND LABELLING FOR THE ASPIRATION HAZARD The recognition of the need to classify and label petroleum productsfor their aspiration hazard followed from industry pointing out this effectto the Technical Progress Committee (TPC) of DG XI. Accordingly, sinceingestion was the route of exposure, the TPC determined that certain lowviscosity petroleum substances would be classified as 'Harmful' and wouldbe labelled with risk phrase R22 ('Harmful if swallowed') and safety phraseS62 ('If swallowed, do not induce vomiting: seek medical advice immediatelyand show this container or label'). Legislation was enacted in the shapeof directive 94/69/EC, the 21st adaptation to Technical Progress (ATP)of the Dangerous Substances Directive (DSD) requiring the classificationand labelling of 142 gasoline naphthas and 31 kerosines, this to be implementedin the EU by 30 September 1996. Even when the 21st ATP was agreed in September 1994, members of theTPC realized that there was a need for aspiration to have a separate hazardclassification with its own criteria, and work commenced almost immediatelyon this subject. Eventually, such criteria were defined and it was agreed that, for petroleumsubstances and certain preparations that met the criteria, the classificationwould be 'Harmful' and that labels would carry the risk phrase R65 ('Harmful:may cause lung damage if swallowed') and the safety phrase S62. This requirementis embodied both in the 22nd ATP of the DSD and the 4th ATP of the DangerousPreparations Directive (DPD). Both directives have to be introduced intoMember States' national legislation by 31 May 1998, but some competentauthorities are permitting the immediate use of R65 rather than R22. ASPIRATION HAZARD CRITERIA The aspiration hazard criteria for petroleum substances and preparationsare summarized as follows: Other important points relating to this legislation are: Aspiration is a stand-alone effect and cannot be regarded as additivewith any other toxicological effect, under the DPD. Consumer products presenting an aspiration hazard must be suppliedin containers having child-resistant closures. The publication of the 22nd ATP, directive 96/54/EC and the criteriafor R65 means that suppliers must 'self-classify' their products for theiraspiration hazard and denote this in their labels and safety data sheets.

The nature and extent of oil contamination at a site can range frommajor to trivial. More importantly, the potential for this soil and groundwatercontamination to expose a neighbour, an on-site worker, or another potentialreceptor varies enormously. The first decision to take is whether the potentialhealth risks caused by soil/groundwater contaminants are severe enoughto require action. In many cases, if risks to human health or the environmentare minimal, then contaminants can be safely left to degrade naturally.If action is required, then further decisions have to be taken as to howmuch soil or groundwater needs to be cleaned, and what level of contaminantscan safely be left. In the past, some countries have set fixed numerical criteria to decidethese issues. These limits are based on generic assumptions on site conditionssuch as: soil type, depth to groundwater, geology and hydrogeology, andproximity to potential receptors (e.g. water well, basement, surface waterbody). Such an approach ignores the fact that contaminated oil industrysites vary widely in terms of complexity, and the potential risk they maypose to either human health or the environment. As fixed numerical criteriaare nearly always set at very low levels to ensure safety, their use leadsto the clean-up of more land than may be necessary. The result is wastageof industry resources (and ultimately added expense to the consumer) conductingclean-up with no incremental reduction in risk to human health and theenvironment. In recent years, the principles of risk-based corrective action havebeen applied in a number of countries in Europe and in North America whereit has been developed by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM).This follows a flexible approach to decision making whereby correctiveaction is appropriately tailored to site-specific conditions and hazards.This leads to more cost-effective solutions, and allows the greatest effortto be applied where it is most beneficial. In its broadest sense, riskassessment in relation to contaminated land can be defined as �an evaluationof whether there is a potential for adverse effects to occur, based onfactual knowledge about a site, scientific theories concerning the environmentalbehaviour and toxicity of the chemicals present, assumptions which haveto be made where there is a lack of site-specific data, and predeterminedacceptability criteria�. Many CONCAWE member companies have been involved with this Americanactivity but realized that there are a number of differences between thetwo continents and even within them. Their wish has been to develop similartechniques for Europe and they have therefore established a task forceto carry out this work and produce a Guideline setting out the approachwhich could be adapted to the situations prevailing in the various Europeancountries. This guideline is now nearing completion and describes a three-tieredapproach to corrective action decision making. The CONCAWE guideline isbuilt on the premise that one begins with relatively little site data (usingconservative generic assumptions) and, through additional investigationand analysis, progresses towards more site-specific knowledge and lessconservatism. The result is an equal level of protection of human healthand the environment throughout Tiers 1, 2 and 3. The three-tiered approach in the Guideline is summarized schematicallyin Figure 1. It starts with an initial assessment of the site, which involvesgathering general data including potential sources of contaminants, obviousevidence of contamination, land-use, presence of potable groundwater, etc.The pathways by which contaminants could reach populations and environmentalcompartments at risk are also identified. This initial assessment is followedby Tier 1 in which chemical data on the degree of contamination of thesite is collected and compared with Risk-Based Screening Levels (RBSL)and other relevant criteria. The RBSLs comprise of a set of trigger concentrationsfor contaminated soil and groundwater. These figures are not intended tobe soil standards or clean-up targets. If exceeded, they are simply anindication that further study is required. RBSLs are derived using conservativeassumptions and contaminant migration models and, as such, are based ona generalized risk assessment. If the observed values are below these levels,then the risk will be insignificant. In Tiers 2 and 3, the assessment involves refinements of the study totake into account more site-specific considerations, with the possiblecollection of additional data. The actual environmental compartments andpopulations at risk are identified, along with the possible pathways. Thesepathways are modelled to prepare quantitative risk estimates which canbe compared with acceptability criteria. There is an option at the endof each of these Tiers to develop a corrective action programme based onremediation to the newly derived Site Specific Target Levels (SSTL). CorrectiveActions could include taking no action or instituting a long-term monitoringprogramme. Although this procedure may seem complicated, it is expected to providea consistent framework for decision making. The outcome should be cost-effectivebut still result in the clean-up of those sites where it is necessary toprotect man and the environment.

CONCAWE played an active role in planning the programme, publicisingit amongst the pipeline operators and providing speakers. More than 100participants attended, representing most of the OECD member countries.These included representatives from governments, other regulatory authorities,academia, consultants, pipeline operators and industry organizations. The CONCAWE presentations covered three main points which were introducedin an initial overview presentation. These were: pipelines are an essential element in the transport of petroleum products; oil pipelines in Western Europe are a safe method of transport; and the good safety record has not been achieved by chance, but throughapplication of rigorous safety management systems (generally called PIMS�pipelineintegrity management systems). These topics were amplified in further presentations covering: the results of the collection of incident data by CONCAWE over 25 years; essential elements of a PIMS; leak detection; and measures to stop third-party damage in the Netherlands and France. All these presentations were well-received and led to lively discussions.Indeed, the whole workshop was characterized by the active participationin discussions by all the participants. Another notable feature was thegeneral consensus reached between the various groups. The most important conclusion was that pipelines provide a vital andsafe means of transport for large volumes of potentially hazardous materials.It was recognized that pipeline operators have compelling reasons for ensuringthe safety of their operations and that they have the primary responsibilityfor ensuring this within a framework of regulation. Another conclusion was that risk assessment was a necessary tool fordecision makers in both industry and government. However, it should beused for comparing options rather than as a definitive means of decisionmaking. Risk assessment depends on the availability of reliable statistics. It was noteworthy that, although many people collect records of pipelineincidents, the CONCAWE statistics are almost alone in also containing fullrecords of the relevant population of pipelines to which the incident dataapplies. They are therefore invaluable to all involved in such risk assessmentsand were quoted by many independent speakers. The workshop recommendedthat more attention should be made to collecting accurate and usable data. Finally, the positive benefits of safety management systems were recognized�theseshould be an integral part of the overall management of a company. It wastherefore recommended that industry should share its experiences in thisfield. This has been one of the major activities of OPMG since its inception.

In the very first issue of the CONCAWE Review, Volume 1, Number 1 inApril 1992, the opening article entitled 'About CONCAWE' introduced ourorganization to the worldwide Review readership which contains a very broadspread of interests with a variety of needs. We hope that the existenceof the CONCAWE Review has kept you well informed about what CONCAWE is anddoes. So we think it unnecessary to tell you again 'what CONCAWE is', but'why CONCAWE is' may not be as clear. Most oil companies who refine crude oil in Western (OECD) Europe have chosento be CONCAWE members, several of them continuously so since 1963. Furthermore,the possibility of associate membership for Eastern European oil companieshas recently been opened up and what is hopefully the first of many suchcompanies has already signed up. It is all of these companies that contributethe essential resources to keep CONCAWE viable. The annual costs of CONCAWEand the people who contribute management and technical expertise to CONCAWEon a part-time basis are major commitments. These are particularly to beappreciated in today's competitive times of downsizing and the need to extractmaximum value out of the existing assets. CONCAWE is founded as an international association with a scientific objectiveand without profit-making intent. Our product is sound economic, technicaland scientific information and our mission is to disseminate it to all theplayers with influence in our field. This means finding out as many of thefacts of a matter as can be determined by applying the rigour of a scientificapproach. Many issues are very complex and, where opinions are required,CONCAWE's advice is rationally based and unbiased taking account of allthe knowledge that we can bring to bear. We publish our findings not onlyfor our sponsoring industry but for the neutral players and the opponentstoo. CONCAWE's track record of trustworthiness is its greatest asset andis carefully safeguarded in all it does. By maintaining CONCAWE, our members ensure that reliable information onenvironmental, health and safety issues gets tabled, even if their own individualsituations may be somewhat different. Thus all the involved parties havea true basis for a rational debate. But it's not altruism that keeps themember companies speaking with one voice as CONCAWE; each company can fightfor its own interests in other forums. The companies are united in seeingthe fundamental needs for CONCAWE's existence and the greater cost-effectivenessachievable by this approach. What the companies also gain by working cooperativelythrough CONCAWE is elimination of the replication of many tasks which eachcompany would otherwise have to do for itself. In the field of environment health and safety, the involvement of a wide range of scarce specialists can be necessary. Both the quality and the quantity of what is done are enhanced by fielding the companies' best and most dedicated experts together in teams which are well-managed to get timely results.

Now is a very busy time for CONCAWE. It is not only the large number ofinitiatives underway but also their complexity. These days, many more issuesneed to be addressed across the boundaries of the different scientific,technical and economic fields that CONCAWE represents. AIR QUALITY CONCAWE's work on the EU's Air Quality Framework Directive involves evenmore than the five List 1 pollutants mentioned in the article on page 6.From List 2, there are also benzene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, carbon monoxideand nickel on which CONCAWE has substantial contributions to develop. The work for the European Auto/Oil Programme is at last nearing completion.The results, in the form of European Commission draft proposals for EU legislation,are due out at any moment. MOTOR FUELS AND EMISSIONS A major new study commenced by CONCAWE relates to the particulate matterin car exhaust emissions, focusing on the very fine particles that are emittedfrom gasoline as well as from diesel cars. The objective is to quantifythese emissions in terms of particle size and distribution. As a first step,a literature review of particle size measurement techniques has been completed.A special effort has started to redefine how best in future to publish theauto emissions regulations and fuel specifications data in view of its rapidlygrowing bulk. WATER QUALITY, SOIL & WASTE MANAGEMENT The EU is developing a coordinated range of policies and legislative instrumentsto cover all aspects of water management. These include water supply, groundwaterprotection, quality of the aquatic environment, discharges to water andother aspects. These will also relate to the Integrated Pollution Preventionand Control Directive (IPPC). To be in a position to respond to these developments,CONCAWE has an active task force on a risk assessment approach to soil andgroundwater clean-up targets which is making good progress. A new task forceto look at aspects of Best Available Technology (BAT) and its relationshipto the Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) approach is in the process ofbeing formed. The two task forces on waste legislation and refinery waste have completedand reported their work and have been wound up. REFINING PLANNING The 1994 Planning Cycle supply/demand basis for the years 2000 and 2010(CONCAWE Document 95/02) has served well for evaluation of the refiningimplications of the road fuels in the Auto/Oil Programme (see page 10).Now, a new Planning Cycle has been started which will update and extendthe timescale of the plans to 2020. Discussions with the European Commission'sDG-XVII (Energy Directorate) have been held to initiate the work. OIL PIPELINES The 1994 results of the annual spillage performance survey are briefly summarizedin the article on page 22. These regular surveys (recorded in publicationsdating back to 1973) are now proving their value as the EU has commenceda study into major hazards aspects of pipelines. CONCAWE is participatingin this study and the performance reports provide a unique record demonstratingthe safety of well-managed pipelines as a means to transport oil products. CONCAWE will also participate and is assisting with the organization ofa workshop on pipelines which will be held under the auspices of the OECDin Oslo in June. SAFETY MANAGEMENT The first report on the frequency of accidents in the European Oil Industrywill be produced shortly and is summarized in the article on page 20. Anew task force on the vetting of barges used for transporting oil and petrochemicalproducts has attracted wide support from member companies. The aim is toensure that these barges are 'fit for purpose' but, at the same time, tominimize the number of inspections by the sharing of information. HEALTH AND PRODUCT SAFETY Benzene was on the first priority list for risk assessment under theEU's Existing Substances Regulation. The German rapporteur required thatindustry produces the draft risk characterization, and CONCAWE has collaboratedwith CEFIC's Aromatic Producers Association Sector and EUROPIA on this project.Documentation has been provided to the rapporteur who is required to producethe definitive risk assessment together with any recommendations for riskmanagement. The environmental hazard classification of petroleum substances accordingto Dangerous Substances Directive criteria is being addressed by the TechnicalProgress Committee working party of DG-XI (Environment Directorate). CONCAWEis working with the European Chemicals Bureau and with representatives fromsome Member States to develop proposals for petroleum substances groups,based both on experimental data and hydrocarbon composition. It is expectedthat DG-XI will make decisions on many of the classifications before theend of this year.

EU Air Quality Framework Directive development CONCAWE is helping with Industry's contribution to the process. In the last issue of the CONCAWE Review (Volume 4, Number 2, October1995) the article on pages 4 and 5 described how the European Commission,the Member States and the industries concerned were organizing the jointdevelopment of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive (AQFD). In that article,CONCAWE welcomed this further opportunity to assist the Commission to continuewith a rational approach to the development of EU environmental legislation.To expand on what is said in the Foreword to this issue of the Review, somefeatures that CONCAWE believes are necessary ingredients in the processare described below. RISK ASSESSMENT The pollutant types addressed in the AQFD, e.g. nitrogen oxides (NOx),sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (Pm), lead (Pb) and ozone (O3),occur naturally in ambient air at some concentration. Knowing that thereare health and environmental hazards linked with elevated levels of thepollutants, by itself, tells society nothing definitive about whether orwhat action should be taken. Put simply, life cannot ever be made hazardfree; only the level of risk can be reduced. Thus risk assessment is essential, and the concept of risk management isintroduced. The Commission has prepared an 'issues' paper which sets outthese factors and recognizes the need to establish the dose-response relationshipfor each pollutant. Taken together with the costs for compliance with variouslevels in the range of the dose response curve, these enable the risk managerto be in a position to determine an appropriate standard by comparing levelsof risk reduction with the associated costs. An unavoidable complication inherent in the risk relationships is that theyshould include considerations regarding sensitive minorities (asthmaticstaking exercise, for example). Thus the process should be extended to includethe dimension of the target group to be protected. CONCAWE considers thatthe dose response curves for both the sensitive minorities and the nextmost sensitive population, together with the factoring in of the relevantrisk management procedures (e.g. rescheduling exercise routines, self-medication),all have a part to play in setting appropriate air quality standards. LIMIT VALUE/ALERT THRESHOLD/PERCENTILE COMPLIANCE CONCAWE believes it is self-evident that these aspects are interrelatedand form an essential part of the overall consideration of the risk managementstep. The function of a limit value air quality standard (AQS) is to provide continuousprotection of the target group based on an assessment of risk and cost.Compliance with a limit value in the EU will generally be based on an emissionreduction strategy, e.g. implementing control measures. General emissions controls can be cost-effective up to certain compliance percentiles, beyond which localized risk management strategies are more appropriate. The alert threshold concept recognizes that for infrequent occurrences(e.g. when a severe meteorological temperature inversion episode traps highpollutant levels), general emission control approaches are extremely cost-inefficientand specific risk management schemes are more appropriate. Thus alert thresholdsopen up practical approaches to avoid spending a great deal of society'smoney on reducing emissions to meet conditions that only occur for a fewhours/days in a given year at any one location. Percentile compliance setting serves to address two aspects. The first recognizesthat total compliance, as distinct from almost total compliance, can resultin significant increases in compliance costs for little additional protection.The second aspect is that there is some optimal split between emission controlstrategies and risk management strategies in providing the most cost-effectiveprotection of the target group. Here, the nature of the exceedances of therelevant AQS needs to be understood. For example, are the exceedances confinedto discrete ongoing 'pollution episodes' or short daily events spread overlong time periods? Analysis of data from short-term continuous measurements(e.g. as available in Germany) will provide some necessary guidance to theprocess. SHORT-TERM STANDARDS (e.g. 15 MINUTES) EU Member States have expressed significant concerns about setting veryshort-term standards-specifically with regard to human health considerationsrelated to SO2 exposures. It is recommended that the Working Group shouldfully evaluate the potential for the derivation of a robust 'surrogate'longer-term standard (e.g. 24 hours) that would be comparably protectiveagainst the short-term effects. The resulting significant simplificationof measurement requirements would reduce the compliance costs without increasingthe health risk. INDUSTRY EMISSION CONTROLS COST DATA The individual industry sectors are each attempting to identify the costsof reduction targets, e.g. for SO2: &shyp;20%, &shyp;40%, &shyp;60%, froma base of 'today'. This should permit the Working Group to relate thesedata to a range of possible limit values drawn from the dose-response relationshipsand today's measured air quality. This equal reduction concept for all sectorsshould simplify the assessment, for example, by eliminating the need forsource-receptor modelling. AIR QUALITY MONITORING NETWORK DESIGN The following technical issues will need particular attention in networkdesign guidelines to be developed by the European Environment Agency andthe Commission's Joint Research Centre: What site classification system is required to enable the principleof representative sites to be used reliably? What siting criteria should be used and how can they be related to theprinciple that measured air quality should be an appropriate surrogate forindividual exposure over the averaging time of the standard? (Note: particulatesexposure over 24 hours; NO2 exposure over 1 hour.) What criteria should be used to define the minimum number of sites fora given pollutant? What criteria should be set for acceptable 'assessment' techniques? What criteria should be set for acceptable dispersion models?

Air quality standards- a focus on ozone Relationships between ozone exposure levels, human health effects andannual crops growth. There are two distinct issues concerning atmospheric ozone. One is aboutstratospheric ozone; the thinning of the ozone layer which protects Earth'secology from damage by too much ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Theother concerns pollution of the air in the biosphere, with elevated concentrationsof ozone resulting from mankind's activities. Air quality standards forozone relate to this low-altitude issue only. Ozone is naturally present in the air we breathe and can also be generatedfrom photochemical reactions involving hydrocarbon vapours and oxides ofnitrogen. The concerns about ozone arise from human health effects and ecologicaleffects, resulting from exposure of humans and crops or other vegetationrespectively, to low but significant levels of ozone. The issues surroundingthe setting of air quality standards for ozone have been described in CONCAWEReport No. 95/60. Based on a review of the existing knowledge about human and animal healtheffects of ozone, coupled with the present uncertainties as to what trulyconstitutes an adverse health effect, two different approaches to settingan air quality standard are plausible at the present time. A scientificallydefensible air quality band for ozone could range from 0.12-0.20 ppm(235-392 µg/m3) as a 1-hour average to protect against the triggeringof human respiratory symptoms such as losses of lung functionality, coughingand so forth. On the other hand, a more conservative air quality band toprotect against inflammation and the potential development of chronic lungdisease resulting from longer-term exposures at lower ozone concentrations,could range from 0.06-0.12 ppm (117-235 µg/m3) as an 8-houraverage. The higher end of these bands should protect the majority of individualsunder most conditions of exposure. The lower end of the bands will increasethe probability that more potentially sensitive sub-populations are protectedunder more rigorous conditions of exposure.

The lower end of the bands will increasethe probability that more potentially sensitive sub-populations are protectedunder more rigorous conditions of exposure. As the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing human and animalhealth data are equivocal, arguments can be made to support both the loweras well as the higher end of the ranges, presented above. Because ambientlevels of ozone are known to fall within these ranges at some times andin some places, other considerations such as technical feasibility and costof the control measures need to be factored into human health risk managementdecisions. Not doing so would risk wasting society's resources which wouldbe better employed on other priorities. Selecting a single air quality band to protect against ecological effects(i.e. on vegetation) on a broad European basis cannot yet be done crediblygiven the current lack of a consistent scientific effects basis. Althoughit is known that ozone can produce adverse effects on vegetation, thereis not yet a clear understanding of the relationships between ozone concentration,duration of exposure, ozone uptake by the plant, and adverse plant response.Numerous factors which can substantially affect these relationships havebeen identified but not adequately examined in the existing studies. Thesefactors include soil and meteorological conditions, placement of leaveswithin the canopy, the mechanisms which open and close the pores on leafsurfaces, and cellular factors. It is also noteworthy that the scientific community has been unable to decideupon a single acceptable form of exposure index to weight the short-termpeak exposures and the long-term exposure levels in terms of an ecologicaleffect. A number of indices are being evaluated for use with European andUnited States crop data. One reason for the lack of consensus is that keyaspects of an effect-causing exposure regime (e.g. importance of peak concentrations,duration of respite periods, etc.) are inadequately defined for the existingindices. Nevertheless, there is general agreement that a mean exposure levelis not an appropriate index for modelling ozone exposure regimes which mayresult in adverse effects on vegetation. Significantly different exposureregimes can result in the same value of a mean index, and much higher short-termexposure levels may be 'hidden' in a mean index. At present, it appearsthat all indices being evaluated are data set specific, i.e. while theymay adequately correlate exposure with effect for the specific crops testedand under the specific local conditions (soil, climate etc.), they may notadequately correlate exposure and effect for other crops, regions, or conditions. It can be concluded that determining the significance of the ecologicaleffects of man-made contributions to ozone air quality at the present timeremains firmly in the realms of fundamental scientific research. Whilsta good deal of exposure data is available for ozone, a satisfactory parameterto express an environmental standard has not yet been devised.

Costing of fuels for the European Auto/Oil Programme Extreme constraints on road transport fuels compositions can be verycostly and the resulting incremental emissions reductions are limited. One of the many 'bricks in the wall' of the urban nitrogen oxides (NOx)emission controls cost-effectiveness evaluation for the Auto/Oil Programme(see CONCAWE Review Volume 4, Number 2, pages 10 and 11) was the definitionof the costs of modifying road transport fuels, i.e. gasoline and dieselfuels, in ways which would provide improvements to the emissions of thevehicle fleet, i.e. cars, trucks, buses, etc. As the project manager forthe cost-effectiveness aspect, DG-III (Industry) of the European Commissionappointed Touche Ross which used the independent consultant Arthur D. LittleLtd. (ADL) to identify the implications in terms of the capital cost, thefixed operating cost, the energy cost and the total cost effect expressedin terms of Net Present Value. The process started in April 1995 with delegates from EUROPIA (oil industry),ACEA (auto industry) and DG-XI sitting together to agree on a basis forthe average qualities for gasoline and diesel fuel for year 2000. This wasdone taking into account the direct and indirect effects of existing EUlegislation and oil industry initiatives which, by the year 2000, will improvethe emissions potential of road fuels. Particularly noteworthy amongst thesechanges are: for gasoline, average benzene content is coming down from 2.8per cent v/v to 2.3 per cent and sulphur content down from 450 ppm (m/m)to 300 ppm; whilst for diesel fuel, sulphur content is coming down fromabout 2000 ppm (m/m) to 450 ppm. Table 1: the averagequalities of the four gasoline packages represent progressively more restrictiveoverall reformulations for the year 2000. Table 2: the averagequalities of the five diesel fuel packages represent progressively morerestrictive reformulations for the year 2000 The delegates' next step wasto agree a matrix of 4 gasoline and 4 diesel fuel packages representingprogressively more restrictive universal (EU-wide) reformulations and acity diesel case (Case V) for up to 25 per cent of diesel demand. NOx hadalready been established as the air quality aspect of first concern fromthe technical viewpoint, i.e. air quality did not meet the required airquality standards (AQS) by the year 2010. Thus, NOx emission was a primefactor in picking the fuel packages, with hydrocarbon (and benzene) andparticulate emissions also targeted for gasoline and diesel, respectively.The fuels packages qualities and emissions effects (Tables 1 and 2) andthe corresponding array of costs as published by ADL (Table 3) are shownin terms of the NPV in millions of ECU (multiply by 1.3 to give US$ millions).  Table 3: Array of costs calculated by Arthur D. Little Ltd for the various fuel package combinations. There are many possible pitfalls when developing costs for a non-homogeneousset of refineries such as exist within the EU oil refining sector, particularlyin the face of an anticipated very tight study budget and time pressures.Not the least of the problems comes with the cost bases and units used:care has to be taken about whether Net Present Values (NPVs) or CapitalExpenditures are being shown, in ECUs or $s, in millions or billions (i.e.giga-). Tables 3 and 4 have been left in the format of their original publicationto illustrate this point. CONCAWE had decided a year earlier to set up its own task force (AE/STF-9)for an in-depth investigation of costs, and to prepare for a validity checkon the eventual analyses. This group set up hypothetical cases with extremeuniversal quality/compositions and evaluated the costs for these severelyreformulated gasoline and diesel fuels singly and together. As it transpired,STF-9's 'severe' gasoline case was similar to ADL's Gasoline Package IV;the 55 cetane diesel to Diesel Package III and the 58 cetane diesel to DieselPackage IV. CONCAWE's study has been reported in CONCAWE Report No. 95/54. In summary,the published capital costs found are shown in Table 4 in giga US$. Dividingthese figures by 1.3 (to give ECU) and multiplying by about 1.8 (to giveNPV for Package IV/IV, for example) demonstrates the reasonably close agreementwith the corresponding ADL package costs. Table 4: CONCAWE's owninvestigations into the costs of reformulated gasoline and diesel fuelsare in reasonable agreement with the corresponding ADL package costs. Attention is drawn to the magnitude of the costs of such extreme fuels changesin the light of the small emissions effects. It is unsurprising to CONCAWEthat these were found by Auto/Oil to be clearly out of the running.

Vehicle emissions and fuel specifications update Key points from the 1995 update on motor vehicle emission regulations and fuel specifications. The new report Motor Vehicle Emission Regulations and Fuel Specificationsin Europe and the United States-1995 update (report 5/95) is availablefrom CONCAWE. For the first time, the report restricts itself to eventsin Europe and the United States in view of the large amount of informationto be reported. A worldwide update is planned for 1997 (meanwhile report4/94 should be retained for information on countries outside Europe andthe United States). EUROPE The update includes an account of the European Auto/Oil Programme, theEU Commission initiative that resulted from Directive 94/12/EC which requiredthe submission of proposals for further reductions in exhaust emissionsby 1 June 2000. It also covers the regulatory regime of European countriesthat do not comply with European Union (EU) regulations. Recent EU membersAustria, Finland and Sweden are undergoing a four-year transitional periodafter which their regulations will either be harmonized with those of theEU or further renegotiated. Austria has adopted EU directives for passengercars and light- and heavy-duty vehicles but not those for mopeds and motorcycles.Finland has adopted those for cars and heavy-duty vehicles, and Norway hasadopted all relevant EU directives. A number of countries from central andeastern Europe are expected to join the EU by the year 2000 (Poland andHungary have already applied), by which time they plan to have brought theirenvironmental legislation in line with that of the EU. It is thought thatthe Czech Republic has conformed to EU regulations since 1992/93 and thatthese regulations also apply in Slovakia. Although a benzene content of no more than 5 per cent by volume is specifiedfor all gasolines in EU countries, several countries have or are about tohave lower limits. In Italy, for example, a 3 per cent limit was adoptedon 1 January 1993. In 1995, voluntary agreements were made with oil companiesto further limit benzene content (e.g. 1.8 per cent). A ministerial decreepassed in September 1995 requires that from 1 July 1997 a 1.4 per cent limitwill apply to all Italy's gasolines, and will reduce to 1 per cent fromJuly 1999. UNITED STATES In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) has issued a Final Rule that will apply California Air Resources Board(CARB) low emission standards (LEV) for light-duty vehicles to members ofthe Ozone Transport Commission (OTC, which comprises the District of Colombiaand 12 eastern states) with effect from the 1999 model year. The rule willallow, but not require states to adopt zero emission levels (ZEV). The EPAhas proposed an alternative national LEV schedule which will involve a phasedintroduction of the Californian LEV, with all states adopting CalifornianLEVs by the model year 2001. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has no authorityto promulgate such standards, which can thus only be adopted by voluntaryagreements .The OTC states are working towards a voluntary agreement withmotor manufacturers but the desire of some states to adopt ZEVs has beena stumbling block. The EPA has assured the oil industry that it will notimpose nationwide gasoline standards as part of a national LEV programme,unlike the Californian programme which will require very low-sulphur (30ppm) reformulated gasoline. The report highlights the growing intricacies of US legislation. CONCAWE'ssummary of the 'complex model' for certifying reformulated gasolines runsto some twelve pages, incorporating 21 tables. Similarly, the regulationscontrolling the mandatory use of deposit control additives in gasoline hasbeen distilled down to four pages, including two tables. The implicationsof these changes, in terms of the administration burden alone, cannot yetbe estimated. What is clear, however, is that a vast array of records mustbe kept accurately, since missing data, any misclassification of gasoline,inconsistency between blending and shipping records, or other record-keepingproblems all constitute a violation of the regulations. The associated penaltyis up to $25 000 per day, per violation. In the area of heavy-duty vehicles and buses, the EPA, CARB and membersof the automobile engine industry have signed a Statement of Principleson how to achieve a NOx emissions limit of 2.0 grams per brake horse powerper hour (g/bhp.h) by the year 2004. The EPA is expected to make a finalrule on alternative limits of non-methanic hydrocarbons (NMHC) + NOx of2.4 g/bhp.h or NMHC+NOx of 2.5 g/bhp.h plus a maximum NMHC of 0.5 g/bhp.h.The automobile industry has agreed to meet these standards on the understandingthat the EPA will not further reduce particulate standards for diesel enginesnor CO emissions requirements for spark-ignition engines. Furthermore, theEPA is required to assess the effects of fuel parameters on emissions sothat any needed changes in fuel quality can be legislated by October 2003.It is calculated that the NOx reductions in the Statement of Principleswill reduce emissions by 900 000 tons a year by the year 2020 (by whichtime the truck and bus fleet will have been entirely replaced). CARB has published the specification for a reference diesel fuel (see table)against which suppliers have to measure the performance of their products.Any fuel is allowed that has equivalent emissions to this reference fuel.A number of Californian suppliers have produced alternative compositionfuels which testing shows meet these criteria overall, although most havea much higher cetane number and somewhat more aromatics than the referencefuel. Thus the strict limits specified in the table do not necessarily haveto be complied with on all points.

A recent CONCAWE report (no. 2/95 Alternative fuels in the automotivemarket) reviews, in a European context, the advantages and disadvantagesof alternative road transport fuels when compared with conventional petroleumderived fuels. The alternative fuels are considered in two broad classifications: gaseous fuels (from non-renewable sources); and 'biofuels' (derived from renewable agricultural produce). Methanol does not fit comfortably into either classification. Its majorsource is currently natural gas but it can be made from any carbonaceousmaterial including agricultural products or by-products. Gaseous fuels have been used on a limited scale for many years. Historicallythey have been employed for a mixture of economic, availability and environmentalreasons. Being gaseous and of relatively narrower compositional range thanconventional liquid fuels they have the potential to be low emissions enginefuels. However, they do require more expensive and technically complex on-boardstorage and distribution systems. In addition, larger volumes of fuel areneeded to move the same vehicle weight a given distance. The extra weightof on-board storage compounds this problem. Emissions are better in somerespects when compared with gasoline or diesel fuel, but worse in others-particularlymethane, a greenhouse gas which is not considered in US emission limits.Substantial investments are required by both fuel supplier and vehicle ownerto 'get started' with compressed natural gas (CNG). Liquefied petroleumgas (LPG) offers much lower investment entry costs but the amounts thatare potentially readily available are considerably smaller. All gaseousfuels present hazards that are different from their conventional liquidcounterparts and which need to be assessed. In addition, 'well to wheel'energy balances continue to favour liquid fuels.  Brussels has introduced some natural gas fuelled buses. Natural gas and LPG are particularly suitable for consideration as fuelsfor buses in city centre use. The potential environmental improvement isat its greatest, limited range is less of a problem and fleet refuellingfacilities at depots is a practical proposition. Several cities have trialvehicles or fleets already in service. LPG can be viable, with suitablefiscal encouragement, in dual fuel applications for gasoline cars as wellas for bus fuels. However, service station facilities are limited or non-existentin many countries. Methanol is purported to offer two air quality benefits over gasoline,i.e. lower ozone forming potential plus minimal benzene and polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon emissions (assuming the use of methanol as a neat fuel). Offsetagainst these advantages are high formaldehyde and buta-1,3-diene emissions.Methanol has only half as much energy per unit volume compared with gasoline,so limited vehicle range may be a problem. The most serious drawback ofall is the toxicity of methanol, which poses major problems for storage,distribution, dispensing and accidental or deliberate ingestion or exposure. The use of oxygenate materials derived from agricultural produce as transportationfuels is also receiving considerable attention in Europe. Since they areproduced from renewable resources, biofuels appear to offer no net CO2 emissionsand reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. However, the true situation ismore complex. In the case of bioethanol, the energy consumed in producingthe fuel can equal the energy content of the ethanol itself, so that thereare no net CO2 and virtually no energy gains. The use of rape-seed methylester (RSME) produced from oil-seed rape (canola or colza) oil gives a positiveenergy balance, but even here half the energy content of the fuel is requiredin its manufacture. Oxygenated fuels can give lower emissions of HC andCO, but some emissions, notably NOx, can be increased, and effects on dieselparticulates are variable. The true costs of biofuels are several timeshigher than those of conventional gasoline and diesel fuels, and alternativeinvestments are likely to achieve greater environmental and energy gains. The oxygenates called MTBE and ETBE and several other ethers commonlyblended into gasoline have, by and large, uncontroversial chemical structuresfrom the public health viewpoint and very good octane, i.e. anti-knock,quality. These materials are being promoted by the environmental and healthpressures to decrease gasoline sulphur, benzene, aromatics and olefins contents. Small-sized MTBE plants, typically 50 to 100 kt/year, sometimes fit inwith the feedstock available in EU cat cracking refineries, and many ofthese and other special niche opportunities have already been built. Thenext step would mainly entail large grass-roots projects and these wouldbe very much more expensive. A 500 kilotonnes/year (kt/yr) butane dehydrogenationbased MTBE/ETBE plant needing a ready supply of methanol or ethanol wouldcost roughly US$350 million to build. A 600 kt/yr methanol plant, big enoughto supply three of the MTBE plants, could easily cost some $400 millionincluding the requisite natural gas feedstock and logistics infrastructures.Such a plant would most likely not be built in the EU but in a remote regionwith a sizeable natural gas field to underpin the economy of scale benefits.These special factors tend to hold down the prices of methanol on the worldmarkets. Regarding bioethanol, it has been calculated that to compete withmethanol at the few EU locations where the petroleum part of the MTBE/ETBEfeed could be found, the bioethanol would command a price which is onlyabout one sixth of its EU production cost. Such world-scale oxygenate plant projects, in places which are much lesspolitically stable than the EU, clearly present major financing and commercialdifficulties. The before-tax prices of conventional road fuels made fromcrude oil are, in relation, actually very cheap, being typically only aboutone third of what the motorist pays.

Emissions from motor vehicles are only one source of atmospheric pollutionbut represent, for the general public, an all too obvious cause for concern.CONCAWE has always tried to put the contribution of automotive emissionsin perspective and has long advocated the need to study the vehicle andits fuel as a single 'system'. CONCAWE's Automotive Emissions ManagementGroup (AE/MG) therefore welcomed the European Commission's 'Auto/Oil' initiativeand many of its fuels and emissions experts contributed long hours to theEuropean Programme on Emissions, Fuels and Engine Technologies (EPEFE). An example of how AE/MG and its associated task forces proceed is illustratedby CONCAWE's EPEFE work on the influence of heavy gasoline components onexhaust emissions. In the USA, it has been shown that heavy components ingasoline can increase certain emissions of the US car fleet by 10 to 30per cent. But not only are US cars different from the European parc, USgasolines are different too, being in general a wider cut from refineriesbecause the road fuels demand pattern is very different. This is partlydue to the fact that diesel cars are rare in the US and common in Europe.Thus a technical information gap needed to be filled and CONCAWE was askedto respond. The steps taken in this project were as follows: Defining the question: it was decided that not only the boiling range(volatility) needed investigation but also the effect of the various chemicalspecies involved, as both are potentially influential variables. Designing the project: it was ascertained that a 10-car fleet, a 7-fuelsmatrix, and measurement of exhaust Hydrocarbon (by species), CO and NOxwere required; the test protocols and so on were identified. Budgeting for costs; identifying a schedule and resources required:an agreement by CONCAWE's member companies to fund the study was obtained. Overseeing the experimental work: this was carried out in the researchlaboratories of the members with suitable facilities and with the capacityto meet deadlines. Analysing the results: statistical techniques were required to separateout the small fuels effects from the large differences in vehicle performances. Peer review and report: CONCAWE reports are generated by task forcesand reviewed by AE/MG and others. One such report recently published showsin essence that, in the European context, gasoline back end volatility hasonly a small and discontinuous effect on exhaust emissions. Although EPEFE was a massive exercise with the two industries (representedby EUROPIA and ACEA) cooperating at an unprecedented level, it should notbe assumed that the programme was the end of the story. As our understandingof the environment develops, new potential problems may emerge. That understandingis not limited to tail-pipe or evaporative emissions but has to take intoaccount air quality issues and possible health effects. CONCAWE's work isbecoming increasingly multi-disciplinary and this is reflected in closerties between AE/MG and the Air Quality and Health Management Groups. Themore 'traditional' role of the Automotive Emissions Management Group continues-AE/MGand its Task Forces have to keep abreast of other developments, notably: emissions legislation and test procedures; vehicle and fuel technology; and alternative fuels, particularly natural gas and liquefied petroleumgas (LPG). Within this portfolio, AE/MG has already embarked on two new projects: particulate size and distribution; and cold start emissions.  Some test procedures are conducted inside 'SHEDs' (Sealed Housing for Evaporative emissions Determination) . These projects will encompass both gasoline and diesel vehicles, so twonew Task Forces, staffed by both gasoline and diesel specialists, have beenset up. This is a departure from previous CONCAWE automotive emissions studies,which tended to focus on either gasoline or diesel fuel. STF-1, the gasolineemissions group, has met as required over the past 15 years, and the dieselemissions team (STF-7), which was created some years later, has been equallyactive. Some twenty reports have been published and numerous scientificpapers have been presented at such prestigious meetings as those of theSociety of Automotive Engineers (SAE). STF-1 and STF-7 are now standingdown and this article provides an opportunity for AE/MG to publicly thankthe Task Force members for all their work. PARTICULATE SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION The potential health effects of fine particulate matter (Pm) below theconventional size threshold of 10 microns (Pm10) have become a matter ofincreasing interest. On the legislative front, a particulates standard willbe incorporated in the impending Air Quality Framework Directive. In addition,a recent review by the UK Government has indicated that significant numbersof particles in this size range are produced by both gasoline and dieselengines-a move away from the conventional wisdom that diesel engines arethe sole source of automotive particulates. Unfortunately, little soundinformation is available on particle size distribution from gasoline ordiesel engines, and measurement techniques are still being developed. Giventhe lack of published information relating to this topic in Europe, CONCAWEhas decided that an authoritative scoping study would add to the generalunderstanding of the subject. The objectives of the programme are: To develop information on particulate size, number and mass distributionfrom current diesel and gasoline engines, using currently available measurementtechniques. To compare results from different laboratories and establish the besttechniques, with some information on their reproducibility. As a first step, a literature review has been completed which has identifiedappropriate generic classes of equipment for measuring automotive particulates.It was then necessary for CONCAWE to establish the best currently availabletest methods for particulate emissions sizing. These techniques are veryspecialized, and so it has been decided that the information is best developedin cooperation with recognized outside experts in this field. Project planningis at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that the programme will becompleted in 1996.

CONCAWE published the first of its product dossiers in 1992. The series,which will include 11 volumes (of which seven are already published, seebox below), was conceived to help the industry's approach to classificationand labelling, risk assessment and the provision of information in safetydata sheets. Each volume is prepared jointly by CONCAWE's Petroleum Productsand Health Management Groups and summarizes all the information availableon a major petroleum product group, dealing with typical properties, toxicity,health hazards, exposure limits, safe handling advice, emergency treatment,disposal, fire and explosion hazards, and environmental hazards. It alsoidentifies entries in the European Inventory of Existing Commercial ChemicalSubstances (EINECS) for each main product group. The dossier series enablescompanies to comply more easily with the EU's Existing Substances Regulationwhich requires the provision of all available data on substances manufacturedin, or imported into, the EU. The dossier provides detailed data on the many studies that have been madeon the acute and sub-acute toxicity of these fuels when ingested by mouth,inhaled or after skin contact. It also reviews the data on skin and eyeirritancy, skin sensitization, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and reprotoxicity.The toxicity chapter alone cites 66 references. The effects on human healthare summarized with the conclusion that, under normal conditions of storage,handling and use as fuels, gas oils do not present a risk to health, providingregular repeated skin contact is avoided. Special care is needed when gasoils are used as solvents, or where repeated skin contact is possible. The final chapter concerns the effects of gas oils on the environment. Thechapter concludes: 'If gas oil is released to the environment, it will besubject to a number of loss processes. Lighter components will evaporateand be photo-oxidized by atmospheric reaction with OH radicals. Higher molecularweight components may also be subject to photo-oxidation but will also adsorbto soil and sediment. In aerobic soils and sediments most gas oil componentswill be subject to biodegradation but under anaerobic conditions gas oilsare persistent. Gas oil components are predicted to bioaccumulate on thebasis of their high octanol/water partition (Kow) coefficients, but theavailable literature suggests that organisms are able to metabolize gasoil hydrocarbons. The aquatic toxicity data on gas oils indicate that acuteLL50/EL50 values* for aquatic organisms are in the range 1 to 100 mg/l.However there are few available data generated using accepted protocolsfor oil products and the current database should be interpreted with caution.' The dossier includes 107 references. * LL50/EL50: Lethal Loading/Elevated Loading rate concentrationswhich cause either 50 per cent lethality or 50 per cent immobilization (i.e.comatose) in the test species, e.g. fish, daphnia (see CONCAWE report 92/56).

For many years, CONCAWE has collected a wide range of statistics on variousaspects of the operations of the downstream oil industry but, until now,it has not collected information on personal accidents in the operationsof member companies. It was felt that such an exercise would be worthwhileso that companies could compare their performance against others and hopefullyto confirm the belief that the downstream oil industry was a good safetyperformer despite the hazards intrinsic to many of its operations. Thisbelief has in no way led to a sense of complacency in the industry, andconsiderable effort is expended on improving safety, and reducing the numberof accidents to as low as is reasonably possible. To collect this information, a task force was established under the SafetyManagement Group. This group first agreed definitions of the parametersto be measured. Some of these are described in Figure 1. This was as notas easy as it sounds. Not all companies collect the same statistics, andtheir definitions often differ from those used in the survey, often becausedifferent countries have different accident reporting requirements. However,companies were encouraged to submit what data they had in the knowledgethat they might not all be completely compatible. It was` felt that anyinaccuracies in the data caused by this would be slight. For this first exercise, companies were asked for data for the two years1993 and 1994. In all, sixteen companies responded, and it was notable thatthe majority of these were willing to allow their data to be shared openlywith the other companies. This free exchange indicates that they felt thatthey could both learn from the experience of others, and help other companieseven though they are their competitors. Figure 1 Definitions of categories of statistics collected. Information on road accidentswas also requested but omitted from this list. The response to this survey was good considering that this was a first attempt.The sixteen member companies that responded were approximately half of theCONCAWE membership. In terms of throughput, however, this represents a largemajority of the refining industry in Europe. The survey covered marketingoperations (which includes all non-refining activities including 'Head Office')personnel as well as refineries and also included contract staff as wellas own employees. To take account of the fact that not all companies couldsupply data in all of the sections, the results are expressed in terms offrequencies per hours worked. Figure 2 Lost Workday Injury Frequencies for the different classes of workers showingboth the worst and average performances. In most cases, the best performancein class was an LWIF of 0. Overall, the reported hours worked were over 300 million with an overallLost Workday Injury Frequency (LWIF) of 3.3 in 1994. To put this into perspective,an 'average' oil industry worker only has a one in four chance of havingto lose a days work through an injury at work throughout his working life.The performance of each company varied widely around the average as shownin Figure 2. Although some of these differences are real, some are statistical,as an accident involving a few workers can result in a high LWIF where thework population is small. In most cases, the 'best' performance was a frequencyof 0. Figure 3 In most cases, the 1994 statistics were better than for 1993 with the exceptionof fatalities which were increased by one tragic accident. The results for the various categories of workers are shown in Figure 3.Perhaps the most striking aspect of this figure is the consistency of theseaveraged reported LWIF. All lie within the range 3 to 5, with little differencebetween manufacturing and marketing operations, and between company staff(employees) and contract labour. There has been a trend over recent yearsfor more and more of oil industry activities to be carried out by specialistcontractors and there has been a fear that this could lead to poorer safetyperformance. Although this fear seems justified in some of the 'worst' cases,overall, the average incidence was very similar. Member companies are takinggreat strides to ensure that contracting companies are applying the samehigh standards as themselves. There was one more fatality (at 19) in 1994 than 1993. However, the numberof these is so small in any one year that it is not a reliable indicatorof safety performance. In fact the 1994 figure would only have been abouthalf of that in 1993 if it had not been for the tragic loss of nine stafffrom one company who were travelling as passengers on the ferry Estoniawhen she sank. Over the two years, only about one third of the fatalitieswere in the refining area of the industry. Of those on the marketing side,the major cause was road accidents. All of the average LWIF were lower in1994 than 1993. Whilst this is satisfying, two years is far too short aperiod to indicate a trend. For this reason CONCAWE intends to continue,and hopefully extend this survey in future years.

CONCAWE's oil pipelines database enlargement The oil pipelines inventory monitored by CONCAWE has expanded to incorporate non-commercially owned pipelines and a step out eastwards is being investigated. Since 1971, CONCAWE has collected spillage performance information onoil industry owned cross-country oil pipelines in OECD Europe. CONCAWE hasalso collected data on several pipeline systems which, originally, wereexclusively used for government purposes and which, over time, have openedup their operations to transport oil products on a commercial basis. Theoperators of these pipelines, which we have called the 'non-commerciallyowned', have in fact been represented in CONCAWE's Oil Pipelines ManagementGroup (OPMG) almost since its inception in 1971. Thus the benefits of sharedexperience and new developments on integrity management have always beenavailable to all categories of oil pipeline operators in OECD Europe. However,in the past CONCAWE's published performance statistics have not includedthe non-commercially owned sector. The OPMG and the pipeline operators concerned recently took the decisionto change this status quo and to report all of the data that were availableto CONCAWE, thus improving the transparency and credibility of what CONCAWEreports. Thus the possibility no longer exists for a non oil industry oilpipeline to have a spillage which features in the media but which does notget reported by CONCAWE. The non-commercially owned pipeline inventory, annual spillage performancedata and intelligence pig inspection records have been retroactively incorporatedin CONCAWE's computerized database commencing from year 1988. This has addedsome 175 pipeline sections totalling about 9200 kilometres in length thusincreasing the records inventory from 21.6 to 30.8 thousand kilometres.The spillage incidences calculated before and after these inclusions averageout at similar figures, indicating that the integrity of the non-commerciallyowned pipelines is comparable with the oil industry ones. The 1994 spillage performance has been reported in CONCAWE Report No. 4/95.There were 11 spillages in 1994 resulting in a gross spillage of some 2400m3 which, after clean-up, resulted in a net loss of oil into the environmentof 2000 m3, about half of which was consumed when an accidental fire resulted.In 1994, the unconsumed part of the net loss matched the lowest ever recordedloss into the environment and the spillage frequency at 0.36 spillages peryear per 1000 km of pipeline continues the long-term trend of improvingperformance recorded since 1971. CONCAWE is now considering how to incorporate the Hungarian oil pipelinesystem which extends to roughly 2000 km. The oil company MOL, CONCAWE'srecently-gained associate member, has started to collect the required data.The collection of data for other eastern European countries is under investigation.

The other Management Group Chairmen are unchanged(see CONCAWE Review, Volume 3, Number 1, April 1994). SECRETARIAT After a long period of stability, a number of changes of personnel aretaking place in the Secretariat. Denis Lyons, who has been with the Secretariat for 10 years, has recentlytaken early retirement. Over these years, Denis has been responsible forboth the Refining Planning function and for overseeing CONCAWE publications.In this latter role he has had the job of principal editor for the CONCAWEReview, successfully published since early 1992. Mr Kees van Leeuwen (Shell)is taking over as Technical Coordinator, Publications and Refining Planning. Roger Hutcheson will also be taking early retirement after more than sixyears as Technical Coordinator for Automotive Emissions activities. In thisrole, he has overseen a large proportion of CONCAWE's research budget andbeen instrumental in producing many authoritative reports on the subjectincluding CONCAWE's well-received encyclopedia on auto fuels and vehicleemissions regulations. Roger will hand over to Dr Peter Heinze (Mobil) atthe end of September. Les White has been with CONCAWE for six years as the Technical Coordinatorfor Air Quality matters. He will shortly be returning to a post in Esso.Over the last couple of years, Les has been the kingpin of CONCAWE's contributionto the Auto Oil Programme in which he has worked closely with our sisterorganization, EUROPIA. His replacement is Dr Suzie Baverstock (BP). The three colleagues will be sorely missed by the other members of the Secretariatbut we have been fortunate to have found excellent replacements. We wishall of them well in their future endeavours. The new Secretariat following these changes is shown in the Table below.

Thesemodified emissions data were then used as the basis for predicting whatthe future air quality would be if no further measures were introduced. Figure2. Future urban air qualitypredictions based on European Commission data. The green columns show thepredicted emissions generated within the Auto/Oil Programme. It can beseen that the measures to reduce NOx, PM10 and ozone coincidentally helpto reduce CO and benzene concentrations to levels even further below theair quality targets. (London represents more than 80 per cent of Europeancities; Athens is worst case). The yellow columns in Figures 2 (a, c and d) show the predicted reductionsin NOx, CO and benzene for the year 2010 given already-agreed measures,for example, the introduction of catalyst cars. It can be seen that theair quality targets for CO and benzene are met in both London and Athensbefore the year 2000 with already-agreed measures. However, it is alsoclear that further measures are still required to meet the air qualitytargets for NOx and PM10 in 2010.� With proposed Auto/Oil Programme measures A wide range of different emission reduction measures were carefullyexamined and their individual cost-effectiveness calculated and ranked.Emission reduction measures were selected, first to attain the NOx airquality target, secondly the PM10 target, and thirdly the ozone target.It was the ozone target which proved the most difficult challenge and broughtabout the selection of the most stringent measures (see following articlefor more details on the measures and on ozone). It must be noted that thesepredictions of the future assume that the emission reductions achievedin the transport sector are matched by those from the stationary sector. Although the outlook for London (i.e. 80 per cent of urban population)looks favourable, Figures 2a and 2b also show that the stringent air qualitytargets are still not met for NOx, PM10 and benzene in the worst case city(Athens). This is primarily due to the existing traffic problems in Athensand the very slow turnover in the car fleet. This means that catalyst-equippedcars will be slow to penetrate the Athens car fleet. Even if all possibleAuto/Oil Programme measures are applied, Athens still would not meet theseair quality targets. A clear outcome from the Auto/Oil Programme was that,for such special circumstances, the Europe-wide Auto/Oil measures willneed to be supplemented by local measures such as city traffic managementprogrammes and early vehicle-scrappage schemes. Clearly it would not besensible or cost-effective to mandate measures across Europe to try tosolve the local problem in Athens. The Commission�s proposal follows thisline of thinking. For further information on the Auto/Oil Programme air quality study,please refer to the Report of Sub-Group 2 published by DGXI entitled AirQuality Report of the Auto/Oil Programme. � In the case of PM10 suitable models were not availableso emission reduction targets were set without the benefit of modelling.

Legislativemeasures that affect emissions of ozoneforming chemicals were examinedand included in the EMEP modelling to predict future air quality. The 'donothing more' picture for 2010 is certainly encouraging. Figure 1b givesthe Auto/Oil Programme's predictions for the year 2010 given already-agreedmeasures. The exceedances of the 99 percentile 180 µg/m3 hourly valueare much reduced but still centred in northern Europe. These already-agreedmeasures would bring the EU into 99 percentile compliance with, for example,the alert threshold 1-hour standard of 240 µg/m3 used in Germany. More would need to be done to reach the ambitious goal of 180 µg/m3in 2010. The EMEP modelling work showed that a 70 per cent reduction inemissions of ozone-forming chemicals (NOx and VOCs) was needed from bothmobile and stationary sources (Figure 3a and 3b). Figure 3. Emission reduction requirements to meetthe ozone air quality target PROPOSED NEW MEASURES A wide range of different emission reduction measures were carefullyexamined which covered the following: improved vehicle technology; improved fuel quality; better vehicle maintenance and annual inspection tests; and local initiatives such as road pricing and public transport. The individual cost-effectiveness of each measure was then calculatedand ranked (Figure 4). Then the most cost-effective emission reductionmeasures were selected, first to attain the NOx air quality target, secondlythe particulate matter target, and thirdly the ozone target. It was theozone target which proved the most difficult to achieve and brought aboutthe selection of the most stringent emission control measures. Figure 4. Costs to meet air quality targets. AUTO/OIL IMPLICATIONS Figure 1c shows the effects of the Auto/Oil Programme measures on ozoneconcentrations, provided the precursor emission reductions achieved inthe transport sector from 1990 are matched by those from the stationarysector. Figures 1d, 3a and 3b all reinforce the need for equivalent measuresfrom stationary sources. There would be widespread exceedances of the ozoneair quality target in 2010 without these equivalent measures. For 2005, the European Commission has proposed a second set of evenmore stringent standards for vehicles, and a study to determine the needfor further tightening of fuel measures in 2005. This 'second step', withthe most severe measures on fuels, has a minimum impact on air qualityin 2010. This is demonstrated in Figures 3a and 3b, but the impact on overallcosts is very high. A far more certain and necessary path to attainingair quality targets in Europe is to tackle the emissions from stationarysources in a cost-effective way.

To harness the energy released by fusion, key challenges forfusion researchare to confine these plasmas by magnetic fields and to control the interactionswith the surrounding walls. UC San Diego participates in national andinternational collaborations on large plasma confinement experiments and alsooperates the leading facilities in the world for studying the interaction ofplasma with materials. While the field of plasma physics has been nurtured inlarge part by the world's fusion programs, plasmas have found widespreadapplications in manufacturing of advanced materials and microelectronic chips,and in the processing of waste materials. PISCES-B Plasma-Surface Interaction Research PISCES-B is the leading facility in the U. S. for studies of fusion plasmainteractions with materials. The facility provides steady-state simulation ofthe boundary regions in a burning fusion reactor, with a maximum plasma densityof 2.5 x 10^19/m^3 in deuterium and temperatures in the range of 5 - 30 milliondegrees centigrade. One of the unique features of the facility is afully-qualified safety enclosure for performing tests of plasma interactionswith beryllium - one of the leading materials for the plasma-facing walls. Plasma Boundary Layer Physics and PISCES-A PISCES-A is a plasma wind tunnel used in investigations of atomic processes andplasma turbulence. PISCES-A creates plasma conditions in the laboratorysimulating the boundary plasma in a steady-state fusion power plant. It alsoserves as a test bed for validating theory and models which are used in thedesign of fusion facilities such as ITER.

We have observed that the levels of electrostatic turbulenceand the turbulent particle transport across the magnetic field can be modified by changing thestrength and profile of the electric field in the plasma. In the next six months, we will be installing a temperature fluctuation diagnostic extensionto the midplane scanning probe on the DIII-D tokamak. Correlated measurements of the fluctuationsin the electron temperature with fluctuations in the floating potential of the plasma will provide an estimate of the fluctuation of the plasma space potential. Measuring this at two spatiallocations will allow for the fluctuating electric field and this data, correlated with the fluctuating plasma density, allows for an estimate of the cross field particle transport.

Blush, L. Schmitz, B. Merriman, S. Luckhardt, R.W. Conn (Fusion Energy Research Program, UC-San Diego) Previous experiments in the PISCES-A linear plasma device ( n < 3x10^19 m^-3, kTe < 20 eV) have indicated enhanced retention of impurities near the target in a simulated gas targetdivertor as compared to a high recycling divertor regime. Preliminary impurity transport modeling, using a 1 1/2-D fluid code, shows that the impurities are impeded from transporting away from the simulated target by friction with both the neutral and ionized hydrogen. To further investigate the mechanisms of impurity transport, we are upgrading the PISCES-A experimental arrangement to include strong differential pumping to isolate the plasma source from the gas target region. This will allow us to seed the background hydrogen plasma with higher concentrations of impurities and investigate a regime dominated by impurity radiation. We are presently developing a spectroscopic detection system to simultaneously measure axial impurity density profiles of up to three charge states. This will provide us with more detailed experimental information for comparison to our impurity transport fluid modeling code. This work supported by US-DoE contract DE-FG03-95ER-54301.

Doerner, C. Mays, Y. Hirooka, S.C. Luckhardt, C.F. Sze, J. Won, R.W. Conn (Fusion Energy Research Program, U.C. San Diego) The PISCES-B device has started plasma-beryllium experiments in its newlocation at U.C. San Diego. An improved controlled atmosphere enclosure wasconstructed to assure safe operation with beryllium materials. In theprevious experimental campaign we found that a total of 600 mg of berylliumhad been eroded during materials tests. This provided us with a uniqueopportunity to investigate the lost beryllium. Swipe sampling and vacuumsampling of the PISCES-B vacuum chamber revealed that 3% of the erodedberyllium resided as uniformly distributed loose dust within the vacuumchamber. An additional 33% of the eroded beryllium was coated onto thechamber wall. Filtering through a series of decreasing pore size meshesrevealed a uniform distribution of particle sizes in the respirable range(between 10mm - 0.1mm), fewer larger particles (>50mm) were observed.

Lehmer, L. Schmitz, R.W. Conn (Fusion Energy Research Program, UC-San Diego) Increases in the sheared edge electric field and poloidal ion flow have been observedto coincide with the L to H transition and the formation of a radial transportbarrier in tokamaks. Experiments in thePISCES-A linear reflex arc discharge devicestudy the effect of the radial electric field on the plasma turbulence and thefluctuation-induced radial particle transport. When the electric field layer width is on theorder of the ion Larmor radius (l_E \approx 1-2 \rho_i), the poloidalion flow induced by the electric field profile is significantly modifiedfrom the E \times B drift speed. Under these conditions, the poloidal ion rotation increases as the electric field layer width increases. A radial transport barrier forms if the magnitude of the poloidal ion rotation is substantially increased by widening the electric field layer.Modeling of the poloidal ion flow profile is consistent with the experimentalmeasurement of the phase velocity of coherent structures. Detailed, two-dimensionalmeasurements of the spatial size and radial and poloidal propagation ofcoherent structures observed in the plasma will also be presented.

Sze, R. Doerner, J. Won, Y. Hirooka, S.C. Luckhardt, R.W. Conn (Fusion Energy Research Program, University of California, San Diego) The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) design makes use of three plasma facing materials: beryllium, carbon, and tungsten. In this paper we examine plasma-materials effects resulting from the mixtures of these elements. In our earlier beryllium-plasma interaction experiments in PISCES-B, we found that thin film formation, due to carbon and other plasma impurities, can increase the erosion lifetime of beryllium by a factor of four or more [J. Won, et al. submitted to J. Vac. Sci. Technology]. In this paper we present initial investigations of plasma deposited beryllium onto carbon/tungsten mixture targets in PISCES-B.

Won, R. Doerner, S.C. Luckhardt, F.C. Sze, R.W. Conn (Fusion Energy Research Program, U.C. San Diego) Understanding hydrogen retention is crucial to estimating the tritiuminventory in a fusion reactor and to predicting outgassing and recycling.The retention of hydrogen isotopes in plasma-facing components is governedby diffusion, trapping and desorption, with proper account taken of the roleof the incident plasma flux and ion bombarding energy. In PISCES-B experiments beryllium metallic samples were exposed to steady-state, high-flux deuteriumplasmas, and afterwards a set of thermal desorption experiments were carriedout on the beryllium samples. Importantly, these data show two deuterium(D2) release peaks occuring at approximately 340 C. and 470 C. respectively.We interpret this spectrum in terms of a surface component and a bulkcomponent. Analytical modeling of the diffusion data will be presented. This work is supported by USDOE under grant DE-FG03-95ER-54301.

The system is currently implementedwith 10-bit quantization, 20MSPS sampling rate, and 256k samples per channelstorage capacity. The system was designed using modular boards for later upgrading. The controllermodule can be ganged with up to 4 digitizer modules, each with 4 channelsfor a grand total of 16 channels per controller (using only 5 slots of crate).Control modules can handle 16 Mega-Sample per channel. They can run up to40 Mega-Samples per second. An external clock input is also available whichwill allow multipule controllers to be ganged together or to allow externallycontrol burst mode digitizing. The Digitizer module is comprised of 2 daughter cards, the digitizer boardand the memory board. Both boards are set up for 16 bit quantization pathwaysgiving the capability to expand to 16 bit data. However, the system runningtoday only has 12 bit digitizer chips. To expand to 12 or 16 bits wouldrequire that this board be redesigned. The memory board is designed for16 bit data storage. It can hold enough RAMs to hold 512K samples per channelat 40MSPS. The system today only has 256K samples per channel of 12 bitwide RAM with fast enough access speed to sample at 20MSPS. All of the RAMis in sockets so upgrading to 512K samples per channel at 40MSPS is easy.To upgrade to 16 Mega-sample per channel would require that the board beredesigned. The price of building the system (excluding design time) was far less thanthat of purchasing anyting from LeCroy or KineticSystems. The controllermodules were around $1K and the digitizer modules were around $4K incluedingmemory. This is due to the fact that this system fills a gap in thier productline. Their digitizers go up to the low-hundreds of KHz. and their transientwaveform digitizers start at around 100 MHz. As part of the documentation process, all details of opperation are containedin the programmer's manual .

The control box was designed so that the back panel couldbe easily removed (relatively speaking). The circuit board sould remainattached to the back. DO NOT FORGET TO UNSCREW THE CIRCUIT BOARD FROMTHE BOTTOM. With the back properly dislodged, no wires needto be disconnected and with care, the box can be powered up and diagnosed.

He does not like it one tiny bit. Click on a picture to see the expanded versions. This picture is also in Popular Mechanics (Oct. issue). The related blurb(less than an article) is really meaninless blab. It implies that Berylliumwill replace the magnetic bottle which contains the plasma when in reality,the magnetic bottle is still very necessary. The Beryllium will line thewall of the vacuum vessel where it will be subjected to the intense energyemission from the plasma. The plasma will also just graze parts of theBeryllium wall which will help contain the plama (create a stable flow). Thus the confussion on the part of the magazine regarding containment.

ABSTRACT The most recent design of the ITER (International ThermonuclearExperimental Reactor) tokamak divertor and first wall utilizes a variety ofmaterials, such as beryllium, carbon, and tungsten.1,2 Under plasmaoperation, these materials will be eroded and redeposited resulting inplasma-facing surfaces consisting of complex materials comprised of all threecomponents, hydrides, and other related compounds. Therefore, the physicalproperties of such mixed materials are of great interest for ITER. In thisreport, we present the results of a literature search for data on the physicalproperties of binary mixtures of beryllium, carbon, and tungsten. This searchwas done using the MELVYL INSPEC database. The results of the search includingauthor list, titles, and abstracts of the extracted articles are compiled here.Further, we present a compilation of journal citations on beryllium materialsexperiments and mixed materials experiments in tokamaks. 1.1Introduction It is well known that the surface material of the inner walls and ofplasma-facing components in fusion experiments is a mixed material, oftencalled "tokamakium" (See Chapter 2). This surface layer is the result ofmaterial transport due to sputter-erosion, melting, evaporation, etc..Moreover, the recent design of the ITER tokamak divertor includes threedifferent materials, i.e., beryllium, carbon and tungsten.1,2 To respond to the urgent need for information about the properties of mixedsurface-layer materials, a literature search has been performed using theMELVYL INSPEC database. This database has 1,396,046 citations indexed by theInstitution of Electrical Engineers from over 4000 journals and otherpublications in physics, electronics, and computing. We examined the databasefor papers on mixed materials published between 1/1/69 and 9/25/95. Because wewere interested in the mixed materials of beryllium, carbon, and tungsten, thekey words, such as "beryllium, carbon", "beryllium, tungsten", and "carbon,tungsten" were used. The following table shows the number of papers that havebeen found using these commands.         key word           1969 to   1980 to   1985 to   1989 to    sub total                                 1979    1984      1988      1995                        beryllium carbon         228     116       121       210           675          beryllium tungsten         67     26        41        45            179            carbon tungsten         601     226       319       439          1,585      The numbers indicate that tungsten and carbon are widely used materials in thefield of thin film. We examined the titles and abstracts of these papers andselected those having relevant data. In the following report, we haveclassified these papers according to subject area and listed the bibliographicinformation and abstracts. ________________________________________________________________________ 1D.

Thermal absorption and desorption of deuterium in beryllium and berylliumoxide. Fifth International Conference on Fusion Reactor Materials (ICFRM-5),Clearwater, FL, USA, 17-22 Nov. 1991 Journal of Nuclear Materials, Sept. 1992, vol.191-194, pt.A:263-7. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Thermal desorption measurements have been made on high purityberyllium samples loaded with deuterium by thermal absorption in 13.3 kPa ofD/sub 2/ gas at 773 K. The saturation content of deuterium in the Be wasdetermined to be 6.3 appm. Rutherford backscattering analysis indicated thatthe surface oxide grew significantly during the experiments, even in a vacuumof <10/sup -5/ Pa. In order to determine deuterium solubility in BeO, asample was oxidised in air for 16 h at 1073 K prior to deuterium loading. Thedeuterium content was estimated by /sup 3/He-D nuclear reaction analysis asapproximately 200 appm. From attempts to fit previously published data usingdiffusion models, it is concluded that surface recombination is unlikely to bean important factor, whereas surface oxide and trapping effects significantlydelay the release of deuterium from Be and BeO.

Sixth International Conference on Fusion Reactor Materials (ICFRM-6), LagoMaggiore, Italy, 27 Sept.-1 Oct. 1993 Journal of Nuclear Materials, Sept. 1994, vol.212-215, pt.B:942-7. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Deuterium thermal absorption and desorption experiments wereconducted in high-purity Be, BeO and Be/sub 2/C samples. Ion-beam analysis wasused to measure the surface contamination and near-surface deuteriumconcentration (up to depths of 500 nm). For bulk BeO the deuterium solubilityis small, with S approximately=10/sup 18/ exp(-0.8 eV/kT) at/m/sup 3/(Pa)/sup1/2/, possibly indicative of the formation of hydroxide bonds; the diffusivityis >or=7*10/sup -5/ exp(-2.1 eV/kT) m/sup 2//s. In deliberately corroded Besamples the deuterium surface concentration was about 0.02 at.% where there waslittle or no carbon contamination, and up to 1.6 at.% when the carbon andoxygen contents were similar. This implies the presence of large concentrationsof trapped deuterium at or near the surface. The approximate solubility of bulkBe/sub 2/C samples was estimated as 3.4*10/sup 27/exp(-0.58 eV/kT) at/m/sup3/(Pa)/sup 1/2/. The solubility for deuterium in bulk Be was found to be7*10/sup 27/exp(-1.0 eV/kT) at/m/sup 3/(Pa)1/2 and the bulk diffusivity is8*10/sup -9/ exp(-0.36 eV/kT) m/sup 2//s. 1.2.2Adsorption of N, H, O, CO on Be film (1) Hurd, J.T.; Adams, R.O. Adsorption of nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide on a berylliumfilm. (25th national vacuum symposium, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, 30, Oct.-1 Nov.1968). Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology, Jan. 1969, vol.6, (no.1):229-32. Abstract: Results of measurements of sticking coefficients of nitrogen,hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide on beryllium thick films at roomtemperature are described. Beryllium was vapor deposited onto glass substratesand the sticking coefficient of the impinging gas molecules was measured as afunction of quantity adsorbed. No adsorption was observed with either nitrogenor hydrogen. A sticking coefficient of 0.4 for oxygen was measured with a totalcoverage of 8.4*10/sup 14/ molecules/cm/sup 2/. Carbon monoxide displayed somepressure dependence and the initial sticking coefficient was found to beroughly proportional to the square root of the pressure. In the 10/sup -8/ Torrrange a sticking coefficient of 0.1 was measured with a total coverage of4.0*10/sup 13/ molecules/cm/sup 2/; in the 10/sup -7/ Torr range a stickingcoefficient of 0.5 was measured with a total coverage of 2.4*10/sup 14/molecules/cm/sup 2/. 1.2.3Chemical bond of Be with B and C (1) Neshpor, V.S.; Samsonov, G.V. [Electrophysical properties and the nature of the chemical bond in compoundsberyllium with boron and carbon]. Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, Neorganicheskie Materialy, 1971, vol.7,(no.1):50-5. Language: Russian. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The specific electrical resistances of beryllium borides increasesregularly with increasing relative content of boron from values characteristicof metallic conductors in the lower borides, to values characteristic ofinsulators in the higher borides. The structure and electrophysical propertiesof the lower borides of beryllium are determined by the pattern of berylliumbonds, basically of the metallic type. The structure and electrophysicalproperties of the higher borides of beryllium are determined by the pattern ofthe boron bonds of the covalent type. Between the higher- energy electronconfigurations of beryllium and the electron configurations of boron there isan energy gap which causes the insulating properties. The higher berylliumborocarbide, bec/sub 2/b/sub 12/, is close to b/sub 4/c in structure, hardnessand electrical properties. The lower beryllium borocarbide bec/sub 2/b2 hassemi-metallic properties. 1.2.4Diffusion of C in Be and BeO (1) Gladkov, V.P.; Zotov, V.S.; Skorov, D.M. [Carbon electromigration in beryllium]. Atomnaya Energiya, Feb. 1972, vol.32, (no.2):163-4. Translation: Soviet Atomic Energy. Language: Russian; English. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Carbon migration was investigated in polycrystalline beryllium withgrain size of 56 microns. The magnitude of the effective charges in berylliumat 1273, 1373 and 1473 degrees K were 26.5, 0.154 and 0.264 resp. The inherentcharge of the carbon in beryllium was calculated in an approximation to atwo-region model of the solid (atom charge=2 for the range 1373-1473 degreesK). It is assumed that solid-solution decompositions may exist in theberyllium-carbon system. (2) Zotov, V.S. [Diffusion of carbon in beryllium of differing purities]. Fizika i Khimiya Obrabotki Materialov, July-Aug. 1979 (no.4):125-9. Language: Russian. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The parameters of the temperature dependences of the coefficients ofdiffusion of carbon in remelted /sup 14/C and metal-ceramic beryllium ofdiffering degrees of purity are determined by layer-by-layer radiometricanalysis using the /sup 14/C isotope. The linearity of the relationship betweenInD/sub 0/ and Q, which may be evidence of the preservation of the diffusionmechanism in all the materials under investigation, is demonstrated.

Translation: Soviet Physics - Doklady, June 1981, vol.26, (no.6):608-10. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Attempts, with independent estimates, to resolve the existingdiscrepancies and identify with greater confidence the mechanism of diffusionof C in Be. For this purpose the authors have carried out additionalmeasurements of the dependences of the dislocation damping on the amplitude ofdeformation and the temperature for samples of powdered and cast Be, containing0.1 wt.% each of Fe and C as the main impurities. The experimental results areplotted as ln tan alpha vs. T/sup -1/ in accordance with the theory ofdislocation damping. On the basis of an analysis of the interaction ofdislocations with point defects, it is established that, upon heating to 470K,thermal unpinning of dislocations takes place in Be, and, conversely, at highertemperatures (470-740K), dislocations become effectively pinned by dissolvedimpurities.\ (4)Nieh, T.G.; Wadsworth, J.; Joshi, A. [Interfacial reaction between carbon and beryllium (optical mirrorfabrication)]. Scripta Metallurgica, Jan. 1986, vol.20, (no.1):87-92. Translation: (B02). Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Determines the kinetics of Be/sub 2/C formation. An interfacialreaction between amorphous carbon and beryllium takes place at about 450degrees C. The reaction results in the formation of beryllium carbide, Be/sub2/C. Heat treatments of C/Be couples at temperatures higher than 450 degrees Ccause the growth of the carbide layer. The growth is apparently controlled bythe diffusion of Be in the carbide. (5) Kiiko, V.S.; Kashcheev, I.D.; Makurin, Yu.N.; Zhelonkin, N.A.; andothers.

[Enhanced carbon diffusion in silicon during 900 degrees C annealing]. IN: Impurity Diffusion and Gettering in Silicon Symposium. (Impurity Diffusionand Gettering in Silicon Symposium, Boston, MA, USA, 27-30 Nov. 1984). Editedby: Fair, R.B.; Pearce, C.W.; Washburn, J. Pittsburgh, PA, USA: Mater. Res.Soc, 1985. p. 89-94. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Enhanced diffusion of carbon is observed to be produced duringannealing of silicon at 900 degrees C under conditions of surface oxidation andphosphorus in-diffusion. Silicon containing high concentrations of carbon (approximately 9*10/sup 17//cm/sup 3/ substitutional) and varying levels ofinterstitial oxygen and differing defect concentrations has been studied.Diffusion coefficient enhancement over the value found for an anneal in aninert ambient is by a factor of three during oxidation and a factor of fortywith phosphorus in-diffusion. Carbon accumulation takes place in a region0.3-0.5 microns from the sample surface only under conditions of phosphorusin-diffusion and is attributed to carbon precipitation. A model that assumesinteractions between silicon self-interstitials and the carbon can explain boththe enhanced diffusion and the carbon accumulation. (2) Rollert, F.; Stolwijk, N.A.; Mehrer, H. Diffusion of carbon-14 in silicon. 15th International Conference on Defects in Semiconductors, Budapest, Hungary,22-26 Aug. 1988). Materials Science Forum, 1989, vol.38-41, pt.2:753-8. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Diffusion of carbon into silicon was investigated between 1176 K and1658 K by the radiotracer technique using precision grinding for serialsectioning. Gaussian- or erfc-type penetration profiles were observed,depending on the applied /sup 14/C-source technique. Diffusion coefficientsdetermined on virtually defect-free material, CZ wafers containing mainlystacking faults and highly dislocated crystals agree within the experimentalaccuracy. The data obey an Arrhenius relationship with an activation energy of3.04 eV and a pre-exponential factor of 0.95.10/sup -4/ m/sup 2/s/sup -1/. Theresults are discussed in terms of diffusion via interstitial-substitutionalexchange. 1.2.6Sputtering yield (1) Gauthier, E.; Eckstein, W.; Laszlo, J.; Roth, J. Physical sputtering of low-Z materials. (Ninth International Conference onPlasma-Surface Interactions in Controlled Fusion Devices, Bournemouth, UK,21-25 May 1990). Journal of Nuclear Materials, Dec. 1990, vol.176-177:438-44. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: A compilation of physical sputtering under deuterium bombardment ispresented for various low-Z materials and compared with results from computersimulation. To evaluate the self-sputtering yield of these materials theauthors performed carbon ion bombardment at a grazing angle. They alsoinvestigated the radiation enhanced sublimation of these materials inexperiments at high temperatures up to 1850 K. Radiation-enhanced sublimationcan be avoided in boron carbide up to 1700 K under deuterium ion bombardment,but not under carbon ion bombardment. This is interpreted as an effect ofmaterial modification of the surface layer due to carbon enrichment. (2) Roth, J.; Eckstein, W.; Gauthier, E.; Laszlo, J. Sputtering of low Z materials.

Pub type: Theoretical or Mathematical; Experimental. Abstract: Materials are compared only in view of their erosion due tosputtering under ion bombardment. Firstly. low-Z elements are compared withregard to physical sputtering with D/sup +/ and self-ions taking the dependenceon the angle of incidence into account. Secondly, sputtering data for low-Zcompounds, such as BeO. Be/sub 2/C, Be/sub 4/B, B/sub 4/C and TiC arepresented. Difficulties in the theoretical treatment of these compounds arisingfrom preferential sputtering and surface segregation are discussed. Finally,the behaviour of low-Z materials at elevated temperatures is compared to pureand boron-doped graphite. (3) Eckstein, W.; Roth, J.; Gauthier, E.; Laszlo, J. Physical and chemical sputtering of multicomponent solids. Fusion Technology, July 1991, vol.19, (no.4):2076-82. Pub type: Practical; Theoretical or Mathematical. Abstract: The bombardment of beryllium by carbon is investigated by a dynamicMonte Carlo simulation to demonstrate the complicated nature of this type ofsimple system by considering only collisional effects. Furthermore, thesputtering yield dependence on the incident angle is investigated for O-BeO,Be-Be, and C-Be systems at 3 keV. Experimental data on the influence of boronin carbon targets on the sputtering yield for bombardment by 1-keV deuteriumare provided. 1.3Beryllium and Tungsten 1.3.1Adsorption of Be on W (1) Polanski, J.; Sidorski, Z.; Zuber, S. Adsorption of beryllium on tungsten; Measurements on single-crystal planes. Acta Physica Polonica A, March 1976, vol.A49, (no.3):299-305. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Adsorption of beryllium on (110), (111) and (211) planes ofsingle-crystal of tungsten was studied using a probe-hole field electronmicroscope (FEM). The dependence of the work function on the time of depositionwas measured for these planes. The average work function was determined aswell. On the (110) plane the work function varies regularly, i.e. it decreasesat low coverage, passes through minimum and saturates for a thick layer at thevalue of 4.1 eV, which is that for bulk beryllium. On (111) and (211) planesthe work function increases for low coverage and saturates for thicker layer atvery high values which are 5.3 eV and 6 eV, respectively. The irregularbehaviour has to be connected with loose structure of these planes and smallatomic radius of beryllium. (2) Sidorski, Z.; Zuber, S.; Polanski, J.

Proceedings of the First EuropeanConference on Surface Science Being the Fifth International Symposium onSurface Physics, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 5-9 June 1978). Surface Science, Feb. 1979, vol.80:626-36. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The work function changes induced by the adsorption of beryllium onW(211) were measured. It was found that the work function increases steeply ininitial stage of the adsorption reaching a local maximum at the coverage of 1/2and saturates at approximately 3 monolayers. Starting from 1/2 of the berylliummonolayer an additional peak appears in the spectrum of back-scatteredelectrons ascribed as due to the excitation of plasma oscillations. Its energyloss of 17.6 eV is distinctly higher than that corresponding to the surfaceplasmon of bulk beryllium. The explanation of the observed phenomena isproposed.

Surface Science, Aug. 1979, vol.37, (no.2):375-88. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Work function changes induced by the adsorption of different amountsof beryllium on W(110) and W(100) planes have been measured. At roomtemperature the work function increases on the (100) plane and decreases on the(110) plane. The effect of the substrate temperature on the work functionchange is distinctly different for both crystal planes. Both surface and bulkplasmons have been excited within the Be adlayer at coverages less than onemonolayer. The loss spectra for Be layers adsorbed on the two crystal faces aredistinctly different. An explanation of observed phenomena is proposed. (4) Czyzewski, J.J.; Grzesiak, W.; Krajniak, J. Field-emission spectroscopy of beryllium atoms adsorbed on tungsten. Acta Physica Polonica A, Aug. 1981, vol.A60, (no.2):249-59. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Field emission energy distributions (FEED) have been measured for theberyllium-tungsten (023) adsorption system over the 78-450K temperature range.A temperature dependence of the normalized half-width, Delta /d, of FEED peakschanged significantly due to beryllium adsorption; and the curve, Delta /d vsp, for the Be/W adsorption system was identical in character to the calculatedcurve based on the free electron (FE) model in contrast to the curve for theclean tungsten surface. In the last part of this paper Gadzuk's theory of theresonance-tunneling effect is applied to the beryllium atom on tungsten.Experimental and theoretical curves of the enhancement factor R as a functionof energy have been discussed.

Abstract: The adsorption of beryllium on a W(211) surface was investigated byAuger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), workfunction change ( Delta phi ) measurements and thermal desorption spectroscopy(TDS). Measurements were made at room temperature before and after annealing ofthe adsorbed layer. The work function change depends on the thermal history ofthe sample and can be explained in terms of a temperature-dependent adsorptionprocess involving double layer formation. 1.3.2Growth of Be on W (1) Dworecki, Z. Growth of beryllium crystals on tungsten. (Ist Seminar on Surface Physics, Tagow, Poland, 7-11 June 1976). Acta Universitatis Wratislaviensis, 1977 (no.380):57-62. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Field-emission microscope observations of beryllium crystallites ontungsten at temperatures from 400 to 850K showed that crystallites generallyoccupied atomically rough regions around (001), (112) and (011) planes. Theultimate size of a crystallite was limited by the extent of the favourable areaaround its position on the substrate. The rate of beryllium deposition wasabout 4 layers per minute. The average values of work function of bulkberyllium are between 3.9 eV and 4.1 eV. (2) Schlenk, W.; Bauer, E. Beryllium films on the tungsten (110) surface. Surface Science, April 1980, vol.94, (no.2-3):528-46. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The growth mode, work function, thermal desorption and structure ofBe films up to several layers in thickness on a W(110) surface areinvestigated. At room temperature layer-by-layer growth occurs, at least up to3 layers. Thick films show a complex growth and annealing behavior. Within thefirst layer the bonding to the substrate is only slightly ionic, the bondingbetween the adatoms probably at least in part via indirect electronicinteractions. Filling of the first layer proceeds by a sequence ofdiscontinuous structural transformations combined with changes of theelectronic properties of the deposit and of the adsorbate-substrate bindingforces. 1.4Carbon and Tungsten 1.4.1C coatings on W (1) Joyner, R.W.; Rickman, J. Quantitative examination of electron beam induced carbon deposition at apolycrystalline tungsten surface, studied by Auger electron spectroscopy. Surface Science, Oct. 1977, vol.67, (no.1):351-7. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Electron beam induced carbon deposition on a polycrystalline tungstenribbon has been examined by Auger electron spectroscopy, (AES). Depositionoccurs from carbon monoxide, through dissociation of weakly held alpha-CO, andalso from carbon dioxide and methane. In each case the saturation coverage is3.0-3.3*10/sup 15/ atoms cm/sup -2/, approaching the monolayer of the basalplane of graphite. The Auger line shape indicates that the deposited layer isgraphitic in nature and incorporation of carbon into the graphite layer issuggested to be rate determining.

Translation: (A01). Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Layered synthetic microstructures composed of alternate layers ofcarbon and tungsten (prepared by triode sputtering) are analysed by Augerelectron spectroscopy. A superficial pollution by silica is observed. In themultilayer, an in-depth contamination by oxygen is detected: a preferentialoxidation of tungsten relative to carbon is observed. The Auger depth profilepresents periodic and asymmetrical C and W waves. As LSM's were not annealedthis result is related purely to an effect of sputtering. A theoreticalapproach based on the overlap of Gaussian distributions is proposed and agreesfairly well with the experimental data. (3) Shinno, H.; Sakai, Y.; Tanabe, T.; Fujitsuka, M.; and others.

Fusion Engineering and Design, May 1989, vol.9:139-42. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Carbon coatings on the first wall and the shielding of the first wallby graphite tiles effectively improve plasma parameters by reducing radiationlosses in the plasma. In this experiment, a fast in-situ coating method of lowatomic number materials by a compact vacuum-arc deposition gun was developed.This method is useful for in-situ carbon coating on the first wall as well asfor in-situ regeneration of coatings on graphite tiles damaged through plasmawall interactions or by high heat loads from the plasma. Thick carbon andcarbon-carbon coatings of up to the thickness of 310 mu m were made onmolybdenum or tungsten by this deposition gun. X-ray diffraction analysisindicates that the degree of disorder in the crystal structure of the coatingfilms deposited in argon is larger than that deposited in hydrogen. Manydiffraction peaks associated with Mo/sub 2/C, WC and W/sub 2/C were observed inthe X-ray diffraction. These peaks show that the interdiffusion between thedeposited film and the substrate increased the adhesive strength of thedeposited film to the substrate. (4) Douyon de Azevedo, M.; Meunier, J.-L. Vacuum arc deposition of carbon thin films in a low pressure of hydrogen. IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, Oct. 1991, vol.19, (no.5):734-9. Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: Results on the vacuum arc deposition (VAD) of thin carbon films onsilicon, tungsten, and nickel are presented for different hydrogen pressures inthe arc chamber. Raman and Auger electron spectroscopy and SEM analysis showthat a large variety of film structures can be obtained. Highly orientedpyrolytic graphite is formed at high hydrogen pressure and low substratetemperature. Vacuum deposition resulted in a diamondlike structure.

Very hard solid-solution-type tungsten-carbon coatings deposited by reactivemagnetron sputtering. Materials Letters, March 1992, vol.13, (no.2-3):157-60. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Tungsten-carbon coatings have been deposited on stainless steelsubstrates by reactive magnetron sputtering in Ar-CH/sub 4/ mixtures. Thecomposition of coatings was determined by electron microprobe analyses. Onlythe cubic alpha -W phase with an expanded lattice parameter was detected byX-ray diffraction in the W-C coatings containing less than 25 at.% of carbon.Since the lattice dilatation of the alpha -W phase increased with increasingcarbon content these coatings were assumed to be tungsten-carbon solidsolutions. The dilatation of the W crystal lattice and Vickers hardness of thesolid-solution-type W-C coatings were measured as functions of the carbonconcentration. A lattice dilatation-microhardness relationship wasestablished. 1.4.2C segregation on W (1) Ostermayer, Jr., F.W.; Koch, F.B. Carbon segregation and arc damage of tungsten electrodes. Applied Physics Letters, 15 Feb. 1980, vol.36, (no.4):266-80. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Eruptions that occur on tungsten electrodes after repeated 35-A arcsof 1.44-msec duration have been studied with a scanning Auger microprobe andfound to contain high concentrations (20-30 at.%) of carbon. This is muchgreater than the average carbon concentration in the tungsten and is in thevicinity of the W-W/sub 2/C eutectic at 25 at.%. Further evidence that theeruptions are rich in W/sub 2/C comes from their solubility in hot HNO/sub 3/.Therefore it appears that carbon progressively segregates in the arc spots dueto its low solid solubility in tungsten and the resultant lowering of themelting point is responsible for the eruptions. 1.4.3C, N, and O in W (1) Fromm, E.; Jehn, H. Thermodynamics and phase relations in refractory metal solid solutionscontaining carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. (Symposium on Refractory Metals, Atlanta, GA, USA, 17-21 May 1971). Metallurgical Transactions A (Physical Metallurgy and Materials Science), July1972, vol.3, (no.7):1685-92. Pub type: General or Review. Abstract: The refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W dissolve C, N, and O byforming interstitial solid solutions. The concentration of these components canbe increased or decreased by annealing treatments, depending on the partialpressure of gases such as N/sub 2/, O/sub 2/, H/sub 2/O, CH/sub 4/, or CO andon the temperature of the specimen. New results in binary and ternary systemscombined with those obtained in the last few years provide most of the dataneeded for the thermochemical analysis of the solid solution phases and for theestablishment of p-T-c phase diagrams. The mechanisms of the gas-metalreactions and the general feature of the constitution diagrams are similar forall refractory metals. However, marked differences exist between group Vametals niobium and tantalum and group VIa metals molybdenum and tungsten in theabsolute values and temperature dependence of the equilibrium pressure ofgaseous species and therefore also in the amount of gas absorbed. The data nowavailable for the estimation of the final content of interstitials in solidsolution after annealing treatments are compiled and discussed. (2) Housley, M.; King, D.A. Coadsorption studies by Auger electron spectroscopy: Nitrogen with oxygen andcarbon on W (100). Surface Science, Jan. 1977, vol.62, (no.1):93-105. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Coadsorption experiments on polycrystalline tungsten showed that theinitial sticking probability and the total uptake of oxygen are unaffected bythe prior adsorption of 6.5*10/sup 14/ atoms cm/sup -2/ of nitrogen. Desorptionspectra revealed that nitrogen is not displaced in the process and that theadsorption energy for nitrogen is relatively unaffected by the presence ofcoadsorbed oxygen. AES peak-to-peak height intensities were absolutelycalibrated as a function of nitrogen coverage on W (100), and compared withprevious calibrations for C and O. It was found that during oxygen adsorptionon a nitrogen-saturated surface both the W and the N Auger signals wereattenuated. Flash desorption again shows that nitrogen is not displaced from W(100), and it is concluded from the degree of attenuation of the N Auger signalthat the N adatoms are buried approximately 3.6 AA beneath a pseudomorphiclayer of tungsten oxide. AA structural model is proposed which is consistentwith the results. The growth of a carbon layer from electron beam interactionwith adsorbed CO was also examined on a N-presaturated W (100) surface, and asimilar model proposed to explain the results.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The nature of the interaction between C, O/sub 2/ and N/sub 2/ andmolybdenum and tungsten is examined. The most harmful influence on thestructure and properties, particularly the plastic properties, is exerted bythe carbon. The carbides in the cast molybdenum and tungsten are dendritic inform while the oxides are crystallised in the form of films along the grainboundaries and subboundaries. Methods of purifying the metals of C, O/sub 2/and N/sub 2/ are considered-thermal cycling in a medium with a low oxygencontent, electron-beam zone refining and the plasma-arc method. 1.4.4Carburized W(001) surface (1) Mullins, D.R.; Overbury, S.H. [The structure of the carburized W(001) surface]. Surface Science, Jan. 1988, vol.193, (no.3):455-74. Translation: (A10). Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The carburized surface of W(001) has been of interest because of themoderating effect of the carbon on the catalytic properties of the W surface.The authors have studied the carburized surface of W(001) formed bydissociative adsorption of ethylene using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES),low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and alkali ion scattering. Thepreviously published sequence of LEED patterns and associated coverages werereproduced. The intensity of the Li/sup +//C single scattering intensity wasmonitored as a function of exposure for various ion incident angles andcorrelated to the C/W Auger intensity ratio. Analysis of this data showed thatC adsorbed above the first W layer at all coverages, including that associatedwith a (5*1) LEED pattern generated by adsorption at 1500 K. The structure hasbeen obtained by analysis of the incident angle dependence of the Li/sup +/ onW single scattering intensity for the clean and carbon covered surfaces. Nomajor reconstruction of the carburized surface occurs, even for the (5*1). Theprominent C single scattering peak, the incident angle dependence and K/sup +/multiple scattering features indicate that the C resides at or near thefour-fold hollows at all coverages. Analysis of the incident angle associatedwith shadowing of W by C demonstrates that the C atoms are 0.5 AA above theplane of the first layer W. The LEED (5*1) pattern is attributed to ordering inthe C overlayer and a possible small amplitude periodic strain induced in thefirst layer W by the C. 1.4.5Chemisorption of CO on carburized W (1) Hrbek, J.; Pavlicek, J.

Abstract: The desorption of a CH/sub 4/ layer adsorbed at 300K onpolycrystalline tungsten gives rise only to molecular hydrogen and probably toatomic carbon. Experimental results are presented and discussed. Data onactivation energies suggest that the CH/sub 4/ dissociation reaction takesplace via an adsorption-desorption process through state one ( theta=1). 1.4.8Diffusion of C in W (1) Shepela, A. The diffusion of carbon-14 in tungsten and tungsten-rhenium alloys. Journal of the Less-Common Metals, Jan. 1972, vol.26, (no.1):33-43. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The diffusion coefficients of the radioactive tracer, carbon-14, inrandomly-oriented single crystals of tungsten and tungsten-rhenium alloys (3.9at.% Re, 6.8 at.%Re) have been measured over the temperature range 1500 degrees-1800 degrees C. Experimentally, a thin carbide layer, formed on one face ofthe sample by a reaction with carbon-14 (fine powder, 10 mc/mM), provided thesource of carbon throughout the diffusion anneal. Since a non-equilibriumredistribution of carbon occurred during cooling, the concentration profilewithin 60 mu m of the interface, measured at room temperature, was differentfrom that established during the diffusion anneal. Therefore, a computeriteration technique was used to calculate a best-fit value for D, the diffusioncoefficient, from the measured values of the activity, A(x); the distance fromthe carbide-solid solution interface, x; the annealing time, t, and from theestimated values of the activity at the interface, A/sub L/. In all diffusionsamples, a zone of carbon depletion adjacent to the interface was observed as aresult of carbon segregation to the interface. The extent of the depleted zoneis a function of cooling rate. (2) Radon, T. Surface diffusion of carbon on tungsten. Acta Physica Polonica A, July 1976, vol.A50, (no.1):3-9. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The surface diffusion of carbon over tungsten was investigated bymeans of the field-emission microscope. Observations and measurements werecarried out for different initial doses of carbon in the range of temperatures800-970K. The diffusion boundary is anisotropic in character and takes placeaccording to the parabolic law. The activation energy of the surface diffusionwas measured for three segments in two crystallographic directions: (011) to(001) and (211) to (001). For a given direction the value of the activationenergy depends on the character of the substrate surface. Also it was observedthat the activation energy decreases with the increase of the initial dose ofcarbon. Diffusion constants D/sub 0/ were estimated. (3) Rawlings, K.J.; Foulias, S.D.; Hopkins, B.J.

Abstract: The equilibrium segregation in the system W(100) plus two monolayersof total carbon content has been studied in the range 1600 to 2073K. The energyof segregation is -56 (+or-2) kcal mole/sup -1/. The kinetics of carbonsegregation at 1350 and 1420K were observed. From a semi-empirical treatment anupper limit to the activation energy for volume diffusion is deduced to be 59(+or-8) kcal mole/sup -1/. 1.4.9Sputtering (1) Roth, J.; Bohdansky, J.; Martinelli, A.P. Low energy light ion sputtering of metals and carbides. (Proceedings of the International Conference on Ion Beam Modification ofMaterials, Budapest, Hungary, 4-8 Sept. 1978). Radiation Effects, 1980, vol.48, (no.1-4):213-20. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: For a great number of ion-target combinations similarities in lowenergy sputtering have been found. Near the threshold energy for sputteringE/sub th/ the energy dependence of the sputtering yield can be written asS=Y(E/E/sub th/)/sup 1/4/(1-E/sub th//E)/sup 7/2/. E/sub th/ and Y depend onlyon the surface binding energy E/sub B/ and the ion-target atom mass ratio.Using this relation the energy dependence of the sputtering yield of B/sub 4/C,SiC, TiC, TaC, WC is compared with the yields from C, Si, Ti, Ta, W, for H, Dand He in the energy range of 50 eV to 8 keV. A strong similarity of the energydependence, i.e. E/sub th/ and Y, can be found between the carbide and theheavier component of the compound. This leads to the assumption that the targetsurface is depleted of the light component due to preferential sputtering andthe sputtering process is dominated by the heavy component.

Abstract: Sputtering yields of prospective materials for the first wall infusion devices such as TiC, SiC, C, W, and stainless steel with typicalimpurity ions as O/sup +/ and C/sup +/ have been measured in thefusion-relevant energy range from 100 eV to 10 keV. In the case ofoxygen-bombardment sputtering is reduced compared to sputtering with noble gasions of similar atomic masses for all materials investigated but graphite. Inthe case of C/sup +/-bombardment a collection of carbon was observed. (3) Roth, J.; Bohdansky, J.; Roberto, J.B. On the influence of impurities on the high-temperature sputtering yield ofgraphite.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The influence of near-surface impurities on the enhanced sputteringof graphite near 600 degrees C and above 1000 degrees C has been investigatedunder various doping conditions. The chemical sputtering yield of methanemolecules for 2 keV D/sup +/ ions on graphite at 600 degrees C has beendetermined for several coverages of Si, Fe, Ni, Ti, Mo, and Au. Graphitesamples were pre-deposited with approximately 500 AA of a given impurity, andweight loss was monitored in-situ using a vacuum balance while sputteringthrough the deposited layer. Small accounts of impurities remaining on thesurface after prolonged sputtering reduced chemical erosion by 30-50%. Theradiation-enhanced sublimation of graphite observed for energetic ionbombardment above 1000 degrees C was investigated during 50 keV Ar sputteringand simultaneous Ti evaporation. For very low surface concentrations of Ti,graphite sputtering increased while for concentrations above 10 at.% the yieldswere significantly reduced. A graphite sample containing 4 at.% bulk Si wasalso investigated and showed greatly reduced chemical erosion at 600 degrees Cbut no reduction in radiation-enhanced sublimation at 1500 degrees C due tosurface enrichment and depletion of Si for the low- and high-temperatureirradiation, respectively.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The sputter-erosion of molybdenum and tungsten due to the bombardmentwith 7 keV Ar/sup +/, Ne/sup +/ and CO/sup +/ ions and that with 7 keV Ar/sup+/ ions under oxygen exposure has been measured between room temperature and1500 degrees C by weight-loss measurements. The reduction of the erosion yieldas well as its enhancement could be found for Ar/sup +/ ion bombardment ofmolybdenum under oxygen exposure, which is strongly dependent on bothtemperature and oxygen pressure. It was also found in molybdenum that forCO/sup +/ ion bombardment the erosion yield is reduced at 25 degrees C comparedwith that for Ne/sup +/, although their theoretical values are nearly the same,and increases up to a factor of three in a complicated manner as thetemperature rises, whereas for Ar/sup +/ ion bombardment the erosion yieldshows only a small increase with increasing temperature. On the other hand asmaller temperature dependence and a reduced sputtering yield at 25 degrees Cwas observed for CO/sup +/ bombardment of tungsten. The results are discussedin relation to various oxidation processes of molybdenum and tungsten. (5) Eckstein, W.; Roth, J. Sputtering of tungsten by carbon.

Abstract: The sputtering of tungsten by carbon is investigated experimentallyand by computer simulation.

Applied Physics Letters, 27 April 1992, vol.60, (no.17):2077-9. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The hydrogen plasma erosion and abrasive wear resistance of glassycarbon implanted with tungsten has been studied as a function of ion dose. Itwas found that the onset of hydrogen plasma erosion inhibition occurred at adose of approximately 6.5*10/sup 15/ ion/cm/sup 2/. In addition, the tungstenimplanted material exhibits an increase in wear resistance similar in magnitudeto that obtained with nitrogen and other nonmetallic ions. Carbon ionimplantation does not significantly inhibit erosion in a hydrogen plasma.Hence, the resistance to such erosion observed with tungsten implanted glassycarbon is believed to be due to a chemical effect specific to certain metallicions. In contrast, increased wear resistance is a defect driven effect notspecific to the ion used. (7) Hoffman, A.; Evans, P.J. Chemical effects induced by hydrogen plasma exposure on tungsten-implantedglassy carbon. Journal of Applied Physics, 15 Feb. 1994, vol.75, (no.4):2235-9. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The effect of hydrogen plasma erosion of glassy carbon implanted withtungsten has been studied for a dose of 2.5*10/sup 16/ ions/cm/sup 2/ and anaverage ion energy of 60 keV. Raman measurements of the tungsten-implantedlayer prior to and after exposure to the hydrogen plasma revealed that thedamaged layer induced by tungsten ion bombardment, unlike by C/sup +/bombardment, has not been completely removed in the plasma erosion process.Auger profile measurements were performed on the as-implanted layer and afterexposure to a hydrogen plasma for 1 h. By comparing the tungsten depthdistribution for these two cases the hydrogen plasma erosion rate oftungsten-implanted glassy carbon has been estimated. It has been found thatduring the first hour of exposure to the hydrogen plasma the average erosionrate of the implanted layer was estimated to be 265+or-35 AA/h. In contrast theerosion rate of unimplanted glassy carbon in the hydrogen plasma was found tobe 3000+or-300 AA/h. 1.4.10Effect of carbon on high-temperature strength of tungsten 1.

Abstract: The work described concerned the effect of carbon on the mechanicalproperties of cast tungsten, obtained during short-term and long-term (on thebasis of 100 h) tests in the temperature range 1200-2000 degrees C (0.4-0.65T/sub me/), and on its recrystallization temperature. Tungsten alloyscontaining 0.01-0.2% (by mass) carbon were investigated. All mechanical tensiletests were carried out on cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 5 mm and aworking part length of 25 mm using a PRV-203 machine with indirect heating in avacuum of 1.10/sup -4/ mm Hg. The strain rate was 1.6*10/sup -3/ sec/sup -1/.The specimens were in a recrystallized state after annealing at 1800 degrees Cfor 1 h. After heat treatment the grain size of W-C alloys varied over therange 32-28 mu , depending on carbon content, while for nonalloyed tungsten itwas 45 mu . 1.4.11W-Fe-C and W-Co-C films (1) Trindade, B.; Vieira, M.T.; Bauer-Grosse, E.

Abstract: Metastable W-Me-C (Me=Fe,Co) films were obtained by non-reactive RFmagnetron sputtering. Their initial state and thermal stability were studied bymeans of electron probe microanalysis, secondary ion mass spectrometry andX-ray diffraction. The results show that the structure at room temperaturedepends on the percentage of iron and cobalt in the films, varying from beta-WC/sub 1-x/ to amorphous with the increasing content of these elements. Thestructure of the crystalline films changes with temperature from beta -WC/sub1-x/ to WC and W/sub 2/C. The crystallization mechanism of the amorphous filmsis characterized by the formation of carbon-deficient phases, such as W/sub 2/Cor M/sub 6/C. 1.5Metal and Carbon 1.5.1Desorption of H and CH4 from metal-deposited graphite (1) Fukuda, S.; Hino, T.; Yamashina, T.

Abstract: Thermal desorption processes of H/sub 2/ and CH/sub 4/ from cleangraphite surfaces and metal-deposited graphite surfaces have been investigated.Thin metal layers of Ti, Cr and Fe on isotropic graphites were prepared by anelectron-beam evaporation method. For these specimens, the irradiation and thedesorption experiments were performed with the use of an ECR ion irradiationapparatus. The desorption spectra of H/sub 2/ and CH/sub 4/ from the cleansurface had only a single peak at 700 and 800 degrees C. These peaks were foundto originate from the diffusion limited process and to be attributed to theintrinsic nature of graphite. The metal depositions on the graphite surfacecaused a new desorption peak for H/sub 2/ and CH/sub 4/ besides the intrinsicpeak. The temperature and intensity of the new peak depended on the metalspecies. The presence of the metals increased the amount of adsorbed H/sub 2/for fluences of more than 1*10/sup 18/ H/cm/sup 2/ but decreased the amount ofdesorbed CH/sub 4/ in the whole fluence range of this study. 1.5.2Metal sputtering from metal-carbon composite materials (1)Morita, K.; Ohno, H.; Takami, M.; Itoh, N.

Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: The authors have studied the condition for self-sustaining coating,under which coverage with a segregated carbon layer protects a nickel layerdeposited on graphite from ion-induced sputtering. Both the concentration andthe sputtered flux of carbon atoms segregated onto the bombarded surface of thenickel layer from the graphite underlayer are calculated as a function of ionflux, utilizing a theoretical model which has been developed for analysis ofthe preferential sputtering of alloys. The condition for self-sustainingcoating depends on the diffusion constant and the rate constant of segregationto the bombarded surface. The calculated results are compared with theexperimental results of the ion-flux dependence of the sputtered fluxes ofnickel and carbon atoms and the rate of segregation for the nickel-carbonsystem is 57 s/sup -1/ at 650 degrees C and 1.2 s/sup -1/ at 600 degrees C.Using the obtained value, the critical thickness of the nickel layer for aself-sustaining coating is evaluated of the order of 10/sup -2/ cm.

Abstract: Reports experimental results on the erosion of thin carbon layerssegregated on nickel surfaces caused by hydrogen ion bombardments at elevatedtemperatures. The erosion yield of the segregated carbon layers at temperaturesof around 900K was found to depend on their thickness and for the layers with athickness less than 20 AA the yield near 900K was found to be nearly the sameas the physical sputtering yield.

Abstract: The sputtering of metal atoms and the retention and release ofhydrogen isotopes in metal-carbon composite layer materials are discussed. Thecriteria for suppression of metal sputtering are derived on the basis of theconcentration of carbon atoms segregated at the surface, which is calculatedtaking into account segregation and dissolution at the surface and at theinterface as well as diffusion. Data on the ion flux dependence of thesputtering yield of metal from different metal-carbon systems are presented,and the critical flux and thickness required for suppression of metalsputtering are discussed. Furthermore, data on retention and release ofimplanted hydrogen isotopes are presented and compared with those forgraphite. (4) Morita, K.; Mori, K.; Muto, Y.

Abstract: A WC layer deposited on graphite has been bombarded with a 5 keVAr/sup +/ ion beam at different fluxes at 1550 degrees C, as well as at6*10/sup 13/ Ar/sup +/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ at different temperatures. Thethickness and the atomic composition of the carbide layer have been measured bymeans of the RBS technique at each stage of the Ar/sup +/ bombardments. It isfound that the sputtering yield of W at 1550 degrees C decreases down to zeroat a critical value of 4.6*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ with decreasing ionflux, and that the sputtering yield of W at 6*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/also decreases down to zero at a critical temperature of 1600 degrees C withincreasing temperature. It is determined from the analysis of the latter datathat the activation energy of the dissolution rate of carbon atoms at thesurface is 2.0 eV, which is a key parameter for predicting the critical fluxand temperature under different conditions. 2.Mixed Materials Found on Inner Walls of Tokamaks 2.1Introduction A literature search on the mixed materials found in inner walls of tokamaks hasbeen performed using the MELVYL INSPEC database. We examined the database forpapers published between 1/1/85 and 9/25/95 using the name of the tokamk for"find title words" command. Over 1,800 papers were identified with this method.We examined the titles and abstracts of these papers and selected those havingrelevant information. In the following report, we have listed the bibliographicinformation and abstracts for each tokamak. 2.2Alcator C-Mod (1) Megusar, J.; Yang, T.F.; Martin, J.R.; Wan, A.S. [Redeposition of SiC-coated graphite limiter in Alcator C]. (Workshop on Surface Modification by Plasma-Surface Interactions, Princeton,NJ, USA,1-2 May 1986). Nuclear Instruments & Methods in Physics Research, Section B (BeamInteractions with Materials and Atoms), May 1987, vol.B23, (no.4):476-81. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: SiC-coated graphite limiter material was eroded by a plasma duringthe plasma edge experiments in Alcator C, and redeposited on the molybdenumsurface of the Janus probe. Surface morphology, composition and structure ofthe deposit was examined after a total exposure time of approximately 1000 s.The redeposited material typically showed a 'layered' morphology. AES depthprofiles revealed increased oxygen content in the redeposited material and anapparent diffusion of Si and C at the deposit-molybdenum interface. Two clearlydistinguishable chemical states of silicon in the deposit, as observed by XPS,suggest that plasma ionized polycrystalline SiC is being redeposited as amixture of SiC and SiO/sub x/. Preliminary examination of the near surfaceregions by SIMS indicated (a) the presence of deuterium in the deposit, (b) thepresence of molybdenum in the first few layers of the deposit, (c) formation bythe plasma of multiple states of Si/sub x/O/sub x/, Si/sub x/C/sub x/, andSi/sub x/C/sub x/O/sub x/ which do not appear in the spectrum of the unexposedSiC.

Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: In this paper we present data concerning impurity sources andtransport in a tokamak with a divertor and molybdenum first wall. Aspectrometer, viewing visible and UV light, has been used to take timedependent spectra of C, O, and Mo from both the divertor and the inner limitersurfaces. In the divertor the sputtering threshold for Mo is not normallyreached (T/sub e/<or=25 eV). Chord measurements from four filteredphoto-diode arrays have enabled us to invert the measured brightness profilestomographically and obtain 2D emissivity information for H/sub alpha / andCIII. The total C flux sputtered at the divertor target can be twice as high asfrom the inner wall surface, increasing with density to about 2*10/sup 18/s/sup -1/. However, modeling the SOL, we find that the penetration efficiencyfor C is roughly 10 times smaller for the divertor than for the inner wall.Oxygen fluxes are generally observed to be 1/3 of the C flux.

Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: Alcator C-Mod is a high-field tokamak with which experiments wereinitiated in April 1993. The divertor and the first-wall have plasma-facingsurfaces of molybdenum. The divertor has a configuration which is closed incomparison to other, currently operating tokamaks. The combination of divertorgeometry and high field (density) make Alcator C-Mod an ideal experiment toinvestigate dissipative (radiative/CX) divertor scenarios. Single-null divertoroperation has become the standard mode of operation. Relatively clean plasmas(Z/sub eff/<or=1.3) are obtained with short periods of baking and electroncyclotron discharge cleaning only. Impurity source rates and screening havebeen investigated with an extensive set of wavelength-filtered diode arrays andspectrographs. Carbon and oxygen and molybdenum dominate the impurity levels.The molybdenum source from the divertor proper is negligible. 2.3ASDEX (1) Sawicka, B.D.; Behrisch, R.; Sawicki, J.A.

Nuclear Fusion, Dec. 1986, vol.26, (no.12):1725-8. Pub type: Theoretical or Mathematical. Abstract: This letter reports on two experiments undertaken to evaluate theretention of gaseous and target produced impurities in the ASDEX divertor. Theretention for gaseous impurities was determined by puffing Ar into the mainchamber and simulating the time behaviour of the Ar XVI line intensity with atime dependent impurity transport code including a simple divertor model.During ohmic heating a factor of 3 and 4.5 enhancement of impurity retention iffound relative to the vacuum time constant (90 ms) of divertor chamber, forn/sub e/=2*10/sup 13/ and n/sub e/=3.5*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -3/, respectively,while a drastic breakdown of the retention occurs during high power NI heating.To deduce the retention of impurities generated at the divertor plates, asegment (3.5%) of the plates was covered with copper, a metal previously notused in ASDEX. By measuring the CU influx at the target plates and the lineintensity of the Cu XX line (11.38 AA) in the core plasma and by using thetransport code, it is found that during NI heating (n/sub e/<or=2*10/sup 13/cm/sup -3/) Cu atoms originating from the target plates have a <or=3.5 timeshigher probability to penetrate into the core plasma than if they had whenoriginating from the main chamber walls.

Abstract: Metal impurity (Fe, Cu) fluxes to the divertor plates of ASDEX weremeasured using a collector probe during discharges with various plasmaparameters. The Cu deposition shows generally a different distribution acrossthe scrape-off layer compared to the Fe deposition. The maximum Cu depositionis close to the Cu divertor plates indicating evaporation or sputtering fromthese plates. In the center of the SOL, Fe fluxes are indicative of the Fecontent in the central plasma. Variations of the Cu and Fe fluxes withauxiliary heating and vessel carbonisation are analysed and discussed inrespect of impurity production mechanisms.

Abstract: Carbon tiles and probes, which had been mounted on the vessel wallsof the divertor tokamak ASDEX during different experimental periods as well asthe Ti divertor plates removed in 1986 have been analysed with respect todeposition of D and metal atoms. The lowest Fe, Ni, Cr deposition (5*10/sup 15/cm/sup -2/) was found at the area where the separatrix intersects the divertorplates, while the deposition is much larger (of the order of 10/sup 17/ cm/sup-2/) at the divertor entrance and the walls of the divertor chamber, as well asat the walls of the main discharge chamber. This indicates that metal atomsdeposited at the divertor plates are re-eroded, while the final sink for plasmaimpurities are the walls of the divertor chamber and of the main plasma vessel.During the last operation period the plates were made from Cu and the Cudeposition on the vessel walls was found to increase with the number ofdischarges indicating material transport from the divertor chamber into themain plasma vessel. From the survey of metal atom deposition a materialtransport balance is established comparing impurity sources and sinks. (5) Janeschitz, G.; Fussmann, G.; Hofmann, J.; Ran, L.B.; and others.

Abstract: The authors describe experiments undertaken to evaluate the retentionof target produced impurities in the ASDEX divertor. The titanium divertorplates have recently been replaced by water-cooled copper plates. Since copperis a material not previously present inside the ASDEX torus, a uniquepossibility existed to study the transport of the target plate material fromthe divertor chamber into the main plasma. By spectroscopic measurement of theCu flux emerging from the target plate and of the Cu density in the mainplasma, the retention is assessed. They find a poor retention (R=1) for lown/sub e/ (n/sub e/<3.0*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -3/) but a substantially improvedone (R>30) at high densities. During additional heating (NI, ICRH) at thesame density as in the OH case, the retention is lower, but approaches similarvalues at slightly higher densities. The retention seems to be independent ofthe heating power. (6) Roth, J.; Janeschitz, G. Impurity production and transport in the divertor tokamak ASDEX.

Abstract: The complete heavy impurity cycle of the divertor tokamak ASDEX ispresented. The impurity sources, i.e. sputtering at the vessel wall and at thedivertor plates, have been investigated spectroscopically or with specialerosion probes. The measured erosion fluxes agree with data from sputteringcalculations using measured incident charge exchange (CX) neutral and ionfluxes. The impurity transport in the plasma boundary has been simulated with atime dependent one-dimensional computer code. Central impurity confinements hasbeen investigated with a laser blow-off technique. Investigations on impuritytransport from the divertor plates back to the main plasma have shown asurprisingly low retention capability of the divertor for plate producedimpurities at low densities, but no adequate code calculation is available.Finally, the deposition of heavy impurities has been investigated with timeresolving probes and long term wall probes as well as through a post mortemanalysis of the limiters and divertor plates.

Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: An experimental investigation of metallic impurities has been made inthe ASDEX divertor in order to better understand their likely sources andproduction mechanisms. The impurities were collected on rotatable carboncollector strips which were exposed to the scrape-off layer plasma near theupper outer divertor plate under various discharge conditions. Quantitative ionbeam analysis of exposed samples were subsequently carried out by Rutherfordbackscattering spectroscopy, proton induced X-ray emission and nuclear reactionspectroscopy. Time resolved measurements and spatial profiles of collectedimpurity fluxes reveal an increase in collected metallic impurities duringauxiliary neutral beam heating of plasma discharges causing strong erosion ofthe copper divertor plate. To a rough approximation, 0.2% of this auxiliaryheating power is invested in the production of stainless steel impurities.Measurements made for single-null divertor discharges show a copper flux of6*10/sup17/ atoms.s/sup -1/ in the scrape-off layer which is not directlysputtered from the target plates. Collected impurity fluxes in the divertorchamber are found to increase with both the main plasma current and thedensity. Measurements made after boronization reveal an initial reduction incollected stainless steel impurities although boronization does not have anylong term effect on the suppression of such impurities. Some limitations of thecollector probe technique are also pointed out, and planned improvements of theexisting setup are outlined. (8) Adamson, S.; Staudenmaier, G.; Taglauer, E.

The probe head consists of a rotatable graphitecylinder housed in a fixed molybdenum shield containing an exposure slit.Measurements were made on the scrape-off layer plasma streaming to the upperouter divertor plate and, after extraction of the probe, collected impuritieswere identified and quantified using surface physics techniques. Single nullohmic discharges produce a threefold increase in erosion of the Cu plate of theactive upper divertor compared to similar double null discharges. The radialdistributions of scrape-off layer impurities change in both shape and intensitywith vertical plasma position. Boronization of the main vessel reduces theamount of Fe collected by more than a factor of two but the oxygen depositincreases. Radial distributions of Cu and Fe deposits as a function of time fora neutral beam heated discharge are also discussed. (9) Adamson, S.; Apicella, M.-L.; Martinelli, A.-P.; Taglauer, E.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Impurity production and transport in ASDEX have been studied using arotatable graphite collector probe which was exposed to the scrape-off layerplasma in the upper divertor chamber. Metallic deposits on the probe were lateranalysed using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and nuclear reactionanalysis. Time resolved information (during tokamak discharges) and spatialprofiles of collected impurity fluxes indicate strong erosion of the copperdivertor plate during neutral beam heating of the plasma. Both stainless steeland copper deposits increase with neutral beam power. It is shown that, to arough approximation, 0.2% of this auxiliary heating contributes to the increasein collected stainless steel impurities. Measurements made for single-nulldivertor discharges show that a copper flux of 6*10/sup 17/ atoms s/sup -1/ ispresent in the scrape-off layer which is not directly sputtered from the targetplates. Measurements made subsequent to boronization reveal an initialreduction in collected heavy impurities although boronization does not appearto have any significant long-term effect on the suppression of suchimpurities.

Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: The origin of carbon and oxygen impurities observed in the bulkplasma of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak is investigated by means of particle influxmeasurements using spectroscopy in the visible spectral range and impuritydensity measurements using spectroscopy in the soft X ray range. A number ofohmically heated discharges are evaluated and statistically analysed to reducethe influence of the individual experimental scatter. The interpretation of thespectroscopic measurements is supported by mass spectrometry, which allows thepartial fluxes of the various molecular species to be resolved. The measuredfluxes and concentrations reveal a consistent picture: for low electrondensities and impure wall conditions, CO recycling in the main plasma chamberis the dominant source of carbon and oxygen, leading to similar concentrationsof these species in the bulk plasma. At higher densities or with freshlyboronized walls, the oxygen concentration is significantly reduced to 0.05% ofthe electron density. The corresponding reduction of carbon saturates at alevel of about 0.3%. This behaviour is attributed to chemical erosion due tohydrocarbon formation and desorption with a yield of a few per cent of thehydrogen flux. The resulting carbon ion flux is reduced owing to wallredeposition, but still amounts to about 0.45% of the hydrogen flux. This levelimposes severe limitations on the use of graphite in a low temperature, highrecycling divertor of a future reactor. (11) Roth, J.; Naujoks, D.; Krieger, K.; Field, A.; and others.

Abstract: The erosion, plasma penetration and redeposition of divertor platematerial such as C, Si, V, Mo and W have been studied in the ASDEX-Upgradedivertor. Long-term erosion and redeposition have been studied using evaporatedmarkers, while time resolved measurements and plasma penetration were studiedspectroscopically on W tiles. The expected reduction of erosion due to plasmaion sputtering could be confirmed. This reduced erosion is accompanied bylargely enhanced deposition for high-Z ions, when the gyroradius exceeds theionisation length.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Passive spectroscopy has been used for in situ studies of the erosionof various divertor target materials in ASDEX-Upgrade. Yields measured for theerosion of graphite over a range of moderate densities can be explained byphysical sputtering alone, although there may also be small contributions fromchemical processes. At high density, detachment of the divertor plasma occursand sputtering of the target ceases. Under such high-density conditions high-Zmaterials, e.g. tungsten, offer a promising alternative to graphite. Firststudies of the erosion of these materials confirm the expected low sputteringrates and the short ionisation lengths of sputtered neutrals. The latterimplies efficient prompt redeposition which should suppress production ofhigher ionisation stages and associated problems with self-sputtering. 2.4DIII-D (1) Mills, B.E.; Hill, D.N.; Smith, J.P.; Hsu, W.L.; and others.

Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: Since the introduction of new graphite tiles on the divertor regionsand the center post of DIII-D, beta backscatter measurements have been made ofthe metals codeposited on these surfaces at three different times. At the firstvent (June 1988), the upper and lower portions of the machine appeared verysimilar, with the average amount of metal on a surface increasing withincreasing radius and indications that local tile alignment had an effect onthe amount of metal deposited. Measurements made during subsequent vents showthat there has been much more metal deposited on the lower divertor than on theupper. Metal seems to be concentrated at radii both less than and greater thanthat expected for the strike zones. From measurements made during the latestvent (December 1989) there is clear indication that material has been erodedfrom a position of the outer strike zone, probably to be redeposited at alarger radius.

Abstract: Hydrogen recycling and impurity influx are important issues inobtaining high confinement discharges in the DIII-D tokamak. To reduce metallicimpurities in DIII-D, 40% of the wall area, including the highest heat fluxzones, have been covered with graphite tiles. However, erosion, redeposition,and hydrogen retention in the tiles, as well as metal transport from theremaining Inconel walls, can lead to enhanced recycling and impurity influx.Hydrogen and metal retention in divertor floor tiles have been measured usingexternal ion beam analysis techniques following four campaigns where tiles wereexposed to several thousand tokamak discharges. The areal density of deuteriumretained following exposure to tokamak plasmas was measured with externalnuclear reaction analysis. External proton-induced X-ray emission analysis wasused to measure the areal densities of metallic impurities deposited upon thedivertor tiles either by sputtering of metallic components during discharges oras contamination during tile fabrication. Measurements for both deuterium andmetallic impurities were taken on both the tile surfaces which face theoperating plasma and the surfaces on the sides of the tiles which form thesmall gaps separating each of the tiles in the divertor. The highest arealdensities of both deuterium (from 2 to 8*10/sup 18/ atoms/cm/sup 2/) and metals(from 0.2 to 1*10/sup 18/ atoms/cm/sup 2/) were found on the plasma-facingsurface near the inner strike point region of each set of divertor tiles.Significant deposits, extending as far as 1 cm from the plasma-facing surfaceand containing up to 40% of the total divertor deposition, were also observedon the gap-forming surfaces of the tiles.

Abstract: Net erosion/deposition rates of carbon and tungsten were measured atthe outer strike point of the divertor plasma on the floor of the DIII-Dtokamak during deuterium H-mode operation at an average power deposition ofabout 45 W/cm/sup 2/. For carbon, net erosion rates of up to 4 nm/s were found.For a tungsten film, no appreciable erosion was detected. However, measurementsof deposited tungsten on adjacent carbon surfaces indicated a net W erosionrate of 0.06 nm/s. 2.5JET (1) Ehrenberg, J.; Borgensen, P.

Abstract: The interaction of the boundary plasma with the limiters has beenanalyzed for two 5 MA 20 s Ohmic discharges in JET by Langmuir probes and by anall carbon collector probe. The deposition of D, C, Ni and Cr and the erosionon the probe have been measured as functions of the distance to the last closedmagnetic flux surface. The values are compared to the particle fluences andtheir energies as calculated from the measured plasma parameters. Thecalculated deuterium fluences are about a factor of 5 to 10 larger than thedeposition on the probe and the calculated e-folding length is steeper than themeasured values. The carbon deposition and erosion at the probe has beendetermined with the aid of /sup 13/C implants as well as from the depth of themetal and deuterium depositions and the interference colours of the depositedfilms. The distribution of deposited carbon similar to the trapped deuteriumwith a ratio D:C of about 0.3, indicating that D trapping is dominated bysaturation of the deposited C layer. The metal deposition is small; it amountsto a few times 10/sup -3/ of the carbon deposition, indicating the dominance ofcarbon in the boundary layer. 2.6JT-60 (1) Fujita, I.; Amemiya, S.; Hino, T.; Yamashina, T.; and others.

Abstract: The isotropic graphite ETP-10 was used as the divertor tiles(divertor plate) in the lower X-point configuration of JT-60. For thesegraphite tiles, numerous surface properties were investigated. The surfacemorphology was largely changed into a spongelike, column or smooth structure.The Raman spectroscopy analysis showed that the structure was composed ofbroadened crystal and defective structures, in addition to the amorphousstructure, in every surface region. As the major impurities, O, Ti, Ni, Cr andFe were detected by both AES analysis and PIXE analysis. The total outgassingamount, measured by the technique of TDS, was one or two orders of magnitudelarger than that of the as-received sample. At the surface within a depth of 50nm, the hydrogen concentration ranged from 10 to 20 at.%. A considerable amountof hydrogen was observed in the deeper region up to several millimeters.

Abstract: Damage to a TiC coated Mo divertor plate used in JT-60 for about twoyears was re-examined from a material viewpoint to obtain data concerningutilization of high-Z plasma facing components in future fusion reactors.Serious damage was observed on the edge of several divertor plates located nextto a toroidal gap. Due to very high heat fluxes a part of the edge was meltedand a large crack of about 12 cm wide and 2.5 cm deep was caused near themelted edge along a lamination of the Mo plate. Recrystallization by the heatloading embrittled the subsurface region and resulted in cracking and meltingat a lower heat loading. The present work suggests that the maximum temperatureof the powder metallurgical Mo should be maintained below the recrystallizationtemperature to prevent material degradation and plasma radiation losses. 2.7TEXTOR (1) Besocke, K.H.; Flentje, G.; Winter, J.; Wienhold, P.; and others.

Abstract: A plasmachemical in-situ technique for the deposition of carbon onlimiters and first wall of the tokamak TEXTOR has been developed. RG-dischargein a throughflow of hydrogen with admixed 1.5% methane has been used to implantmethane ions into the limiters and wall. Different samples (Inconel 600) inliner position have been exposed and afterwards analyzed with SIMS and AES. Ithas been shown that during the plasmachemical carbon deposition at 240 degreesC predominantly chromium carbide was formed in the surface near layer. Nickelcarbide was traced in a negligibly small amount. Depth profiles indicate anexponential dependence of the chromium carbide concentration up to a depth ofabout 10 nm. This is in agreement with the estimated diffusion profile ofcarbon; literature values of the carbon diffusivity in Ni, Ni-Cr and Ni-Coalloys yield a mean characteristic diffusion length of about 8 nm. The totalamount of deposited carbon as determined from AES measurements is 6*10/sup 15/atoms cm/sup -2/, in reasonable agreement with 1.2*10/sup 16/ cm/sup -2/ asdetermined from the partial pressure balance during the carbidizationprocess.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Samples of Si, Ni and Cr exposed to an in situ 'carbonization' in theTokamak TEXTOR have been investigated. Depth profiles have been measured byargon ion sputter etching and AES. From the AES energy spectra (directcounting), the relative AES signals (peak to background ratios) have beenderived by properly fitting the background and the peaks. The depth profilesare discussed in light of a ballistic-mixing model for sputter etching and astandard exponential Auger escape probability.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: A POCO graphite sample was exposed to an electron cyclotron resonance(ECR) plasma for 5 h. Surfaces of the sample were analyzed by AES. No metaldeposition was found. Another graphite sample was exposed to an RF-assistedglow (RG) discharge for 6 h. Iron and nickel were found with AES, at surfaceconcentrations of 3% and 1%, respectively. The space potential measured by aLangmuir probe was less than 20 V for ECR plasma and 265 V for RG discharge. Inthe case of the ECR discharge, the impact energy of ions on the wall is lowerthan the threshold energy of metal sputtering. Actually, no metal contaminationof the carbon sample occurred.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Carbonaceous films as produced for in-situ wall conditioning purposesin the TEXTOR tokamak have been investigated with SIMS (Secondary Ion MassSpectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). The measurements weresupplemented by optical analyses and mechanical thickness measurements. Theexposure to the in-situ carbonization process has been performed by placing thesamples (Si, graphite, glassy carbon, Ni, Cr and Inconel) in linear positions.Independent of the substrate material the obtained films were homogeneous inthickness and composition. Depth profiles revealed impurity-free films withconstant C/H ratio and slightly contaminated interfaces. The contaminants, i.e.metals (Fe, Ni, Cr) and O as detected on appropriate substrates, are supposedto be deposited due to sputtering of wall material during the initial period ofthe carbonization process. The hydrogen in the carbon film is strongly bound.Exchange processes of the incorporated hydrogen during plasma discharges havebeen investigated. Blistering of the carbon films during noble gas ionbombardment have been observed. (5) Noda, N.; Hori, Y.; Akaishi, K.; Miyahara, A.; and others.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Surface analysis has been carried out on samples exposed tocarbonization, discharge cleaning and tokamak discharges with Auger ElectronSpectroscopy (AES). A carbon layer of approximately 30 monolayers on an Inconelsample was neither fully removed nor contaminated during exposure to 134tokamak discharges at the liner position. The carbon layer was also not removedwith exposure to 25 discharges at 1 cm behind the main limiters. Deposition ofmetals and oxygen was observed on the top surface of the C-layer in this case.Deposition of carbon on silicon samples was found with a carbonized wall afterexposure to tokamak discharges. From a semi-quantitative discussion of theseexperimental results, it has been concluded that the C-layer on the liner, onFaraday shields and on limiters have long life time, and redeposition processescontribute to maintaining the carbon layer. Removal of the carbon layer byglow-discharge cleaning has also been demonstrated. (6) Waelbroeck, F.; Esser, H.G.; Winter, J.; Wienhold, P.; and others.

(Seventh International Conference on Plasma-Surface Interactions in ControlledFusion Devices, Princeton, NJ, USA, 5-9 May 1986). Journal of Nuclear Materials, Feb. 1987, vol.145-147:665-70. Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: The carbonization of the metallic liner and limiters of TEXTOR led toplasmas which contained less than 10/sup -5/ metal, and, in best cases,(0.6+or-0.4)% low Z ions per D/sup +/. However disruptions damaged some of thecarbon film and evaporated metal atoms. These were redeposited on the carbonlayer and became a source of impurities. Graphite limiters have been used sincemid-1985. The metal pollution is not a problem for more than 1000 dischargesafter one carbonization. However the low Z contamination was initially fivetimes larger than earlier. Surprisingly, the oxygen concentration hadconsiderably increased. Experiments were performed to identify the sources of Cand O and to improve the conditioning methods in this 'all carbon' surrounding.The main tools used were: RG (radiofrequency assisted DC glow) discharges inH/sub 2/, D/sub 2/, and their mixtures with CH/sub 4/ and CD/sub 4/, the studyof the H/D ratio in water and hydrocarbons and of the CO and CO/sub 2/ releasedduring the ramp heating and cooling of limiters, liner, vessel and mainportholes, and the modulation of the deuterium fluxes to the liner and limitersduring tokamak discharges. The quality of tokamak plasmas measures the progressof the wall conditioning. The authors describe the optimized conditioningprocedure which was applied after the most probable oxygen source had beendrastically reduced.

Journal of Nuclear Materials, Feb. 1989, vol.161, (no.2):153-63. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and nuclear reaction analysistechniques were used to determine the concentration of oxygen, metals anddeuterium in the surface region of collector probes exposed to the plasmadischarges in the carbonized TEXTOR fusion device. The paper focuses on time-and space-resolved measurements of oxygen collected during 13 tokamak shots onthree cylindrical graphite probes placed near to the plasma boundary. Eachprobe was exposed to several discharges. Generally, the areal concentration ofoxygen was found to be 15-25 times higher than that of metals and about 5-8times lower than that of trapped deuterium. The influence of ICR heating,plasma density and other plasma parameters upon the deposition rate of oxygenand other species are discussed. The possible chemical state of the depositedoxygen is considered. (8) Emmoth, B.; Rubel, M.; Bergsaker, H.; Wienhold, P.; and others.

Typical fluxes were (1-8)*10/sup18/ atoms m/sup -2/ s/sup -1/. The metal density was determined to be in therange 10/sup 15/ atoms m/sup -3/, and the cross-field diffusion coefficient 6m/sup 2/ s/sup -1/. A distinct reduction of deposited metals as well asdeuterium and oxygen was found in comparison to earlier measurements performedin the presence of the poloidal and ALT I limiters. Increased fluxes wereobserved during auxiliary ICR heating. (9) Littmark, U.; Linke, U.; Flentje, G.; Esser, H.G.; and others. Carbon diffusion from a-C:H coatings into the bulk of the TEXTOR liner.

Journal of Nuclear Materials, April 1989, vol.162-164:881-6. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Long-term samples literally cut out of the TEXTOR liner after 31months of tokamak operation and with 81 a-C:H coatings and correspondingwall-cleaning cycles have been analyzed for carbon and carbide contents. Theanalysis consisted in AES depth-profiling, AES line-scanning, andelectro-chemical etching of sample cross-sections. A 10 to 35 mu m thickunder-stoichiometric carbide layer with 10 at.% of carbon at the surface wasfound. There is an unpredicted correlation between the thickness of theindividual coatings and the carbide layer, although 50% fluctuations in thetoroidal distribution are observed. Apparently more than 20% of the carbonsupply to the surface during coating is built into the liner surface, despitethe glow discharge cleaning of the remaining a-C:H before each new deposition.The presence of the carbide layer may in general cause changes in themechanical and thermal properties of the first wall in plasma devices which areroutinely carbonized.

(NinthInternational Conference on Plasma-Surface Interactions in Controlled FusionDevices, Bournemouth, UK, 21-25 May 1990). Journal of Nuclear Materials, Dec. 1990, vol.176-177:150-7. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The material redeposited on the collector probe in the SOL of TEXTORafter boronization has been identified as a-C/B:D, i.e. as almost identicalwith the virgin coating. A conversion factor of 6.3*10/sup 17/ C/cm/sup 2/ for100 nm thickness was found which corresponds to a density rho =1.26 g/cm/sup2/. Erosion of C and B from the coated graphite limiters causes stationarydeposition during the discharge and distributions within the SOL. After 200discharges the ratio B/C=0.23 is lower than the original (B/C approximately0.5-1). Observations made with the collector probe confirm the reduced C and Ocontamination of the plasma due to boronization. Carbon rates have beendetermined shotwise after an integrated exposure by AES-depth profiling of thestratified deposit. A deposition rate of 1*10/sup 16/ C/cm/sup 2/ s typicallywas found at a+2 cm and n/sub e/=2.8*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -3/. It increases atlower densities as do the other impurities.

Pub type: Practical. Abstract: The graphite limiters and the inconel liner of TEXTOR have beencoated in-situ with boron-doped carbonaceous film (boronization). Severalsamples of SS 304, Inconel 600, graphite (EK 98) and silicon single crystalswere exposed to the boronization procedure at two different toroidal locations(liner level). The depth composition of the deposited layers (noted as a-C/B:H)have been investigated later by AES analysis combined with Ar-sputtering, andby SNMS. Depth profiles showed the homogeneity of the films. In addition, atoroidal variation in the B/C-ratio ( approximately=0.5 and approximately=1.0),in the hydrogen content, as well as in the thickness, was observed. No tracesof bulk oxidation were found. A boronized Inconel target, exposed to 253tokamak discharges in D/sub 2/, exhibits only a minute erosion of theoriginally deposited film. An additional thin layer deposited by plasmatransport on the surface contained mainly carbon, and little boron, oxygen andmetal impurities. (12) Banno, T.; Wienhold, P.; Winter, J.; Waelbroeck, F.G.

Abstract: Impurities transported in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of a tokamakTEXTOR were collected on Si samples exposed in SOL, and their amounts weremeasured quantitatively, using an in situ surface analysis station equippedwith an Auger electron analyser and an ion gun. Tokamak discharges have beenmade in all carbon surroundings, i.e. graphite limiters and the carbonizedliner and also recently in boron-carbon coated (boronized) surroundings. Theanalysis shows that mainly carbon is collected accompanied by oxygen (less thanapproximately 15%), and by boron (approximately 20%), after boronization. Theauthors present data concerning the amount of the redeposited carbon as afunction of the toroidal distance between the sample and limiters, and of theelectron density, in order to discuss the mechanism of its redeposition.

Abstract: Plasma induced erosion and redeposition at the vessel walls has beenmeasured by surface layer analysis of a carbon probe with evaporated markersbefore and after exposure in the boundary plasma of the TEXTOR tokamak. Theresults are compared with those calculated with the computer simulation programERO. The erosion is dominated by carbon and oxygen impurity fluxes in theboundary plasma. Carbon is deposited on the marker surfaces and has to beresputtered for the marker material to be sputtered. Mo atoms sputtered fromthe marker are found to be redeposited in the slit of the probe. Theredeposition pattern can be explained by direct deposition of sputtered Moneutrals. (14) Tanabe, T.; Philipps, V.; Ueda, Y.; Unterberg, B.; and others. High-Z Mo-limiter test in TEXTOR.

Journal of Nuclear Materials, Sept. 1994, vol.212-215, pt.B:1370-5. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: In TEXTOR a Mo limiter has been tested under various conditions ofohmic and NBI heating for about 100 discharges. Maximum power fluxes of 20MW/m/sup 2/ have been loaded onto the Mo limiter without any serious damagewhich led to maximal surface temperatures of about 2800 K. The Mo-limitersurface was molten twice with a very thin layer of melting. Local spectroscopyshows that Mo is released predominantly by physical sputtering of the low-Zimpurities carbon, oxygen and silicon. The impurity deposition rates in the SOLwere measured using collector probes showing a ratio of Si/C and Mo/C oftypically 6/100 and 0.1-1/100, respectively. Post-mortem analyses have revealedno impurity deposition on the Mo surface indicating that the limiter wasoperated under erosion conditions. The Mo limiter did not influence the plasmaperformance very much except for high-density ohmic shots where strong centralradiation appeared resulting in a minor disruption or special mode. No seriousafter-effect due to a possible contamination of the first wall by Mo impuritiescould be observed. (15) Tanabe, T.; Ueda, Y.; Philipps, V.; Unterberg, B.; and others.

Fusion Engineering and Design, 1995, vol.28:13-21. Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: In TEXTOR a high Z limiter experiment was carried out. Mo and W wereused as a limiter (10 cm long, 6 cm wide and 5 cm high) and inserted up to 3 cmcloser to the plasma than to the main limiter, an ALT-II graphite limiter. Boththe thermal response of the limiter and the influence to the plasma performancewere analyzed in detail and compared with those for the fine-grained graphite(EK98) routinely used. Maximum power fluxes of about 20 MW m/sup -2/ for 2 scould be loaded on the Mo limiter without severe damage, and the maximumsurface temperature was about 2600 degrees C. Consequently the limiter surfacewas subjected to local melting leaving the trace of molten layers. However, theevaporated Mo during the melting did not influence the main plasma very much,probably owing to redeposition of Mo within one period of gyromotion after theionization. After the experiment the surface of the Mo limiter was examined byvarious techniques. Although the limiter head was not seriously damaged,appreciable recrystallization and grain growth were observed, which enhancedthe propagation of intergranular cracking owing to the thermal stress triggeredby congruent melting with the thermocouple. No deposition of impurities of B,C, O and Si which were the main impurities in the TEXTOR plasma, was observedon the limiter head. The very high temperature of the limiter surface seems topromote the evaporation of once-deposited impurities. 2.8TFTR (1)Dylla, H.F.; Ulrickson, M.A.; LaMarche, P.H.; Owens, D.K.

The surface characteristicsof the graphite tiles were analyzed prior to installation to establish theinitial limiter conditions, and after exposure to 800 Ohmically heateddischarges in TFTR to provide data on the limiter conditioning processes. Sometiles surfaces showed nearly complete removal of the TiC surface as a result ofplasma exposure. 3D and 2D elemental mapping of the tile surface region showdeposition of vacuum vessel metals (primarily Ti and Ni) in the form ofoxides.

Abstract: Central medium and low Z impurity concentrations and Z/sub eff/ havebeen measured by X-ray spectrometry in Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor dischargesduring three periods of operation. These were (1) startup period, (2) ohmicheating, and (3) ohmic heating portion of the two neutral beam periods,distinguished mainly by different vacuum vessel internal hardware andincreasing plasma current and toroidal field capability. Plasma parametersspanned minor radius a=0.41-0.83 m, major radius R=2.1-3.1 m, current I/subp/=0.25-2.0 MA, line averaged electron density n/sub e/=(0.9-4.0)*10/sup 19/m/sup -3/, and toroidal magnetic field B/sub T/=1.8-4.0 T. The metal impuritiescame mostly from the limiter. At low densities titanium or nickel approached 1%of n/sub e/ during operation on a TiC-coated graphite or Inconel limiter,respectively. Lower levels of Cr, Fe and Ni (<or approximately=0.1%) wereobserved with a graphite limiter at similarly low densities; these elementswere removed mainly from stainless steel or Inconel hardware within the vacuumvessel during pulse discharge cleaning or plasma operation on an Inconellimiter and then deposited on the graphite limiter. Hardware closet to theplasma contributed most to the deposits. Subsequent discharge slowly eroded thedeposits from the limiter and reduced the metal impurity levels in the plasma.Both total low Z and metal impurity concentrations, relative to n/sub e/,decreased approximately exponentially with n/sub e/ and increased with I/subp/. The metals showed much larger variations than did low Z elements, droppingto >or approximately=10/sup -5/ n/sub e/ at high density. Low Z impurities,mainly carbon and oxygen, ranged from 10% of n/sub e/ at low n/sub e/ to 3% athigh n/sub e/ and usually dominated Z/sub eff/ and power loss. In low densityplasmas with a TiC-coated graphite or Inconel limiter, the respective metalscontributed 30-50% of Z/sub eff/ and <or approximately=10-20% of the centralinput power. The metal contributions to Z/sub eff/ and radiated power were muchlower with the graphite limiter. (3) Ramsey, A.T.; Stratton, B.C.; Boody, F.P.; Bush, C.E.; and others.

Journal of Nuclear Materials, Feb. 1987, vol.145-147:592-5. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The important impurities in ohmically heated TFTR plasmas are carbonand oxygen. The concentration of O is independent of the mass or charge of thefuel gas; C is slightly less abundant in D plasmas than in He plasmas. C ismore abundant than O by a factor of 10 at low densities (Sin/sub e/approximately=2*10Su1/sup 9/ m/sup -3/); at the high density limit (n/sub e/equivalent to 4*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/ for H, n/sub e/ equivalent to 8*10/sup 19/m/sup -3/ for He) the O concentration is equal to or slightly greater than thatof C. The impurity concentration as a function of edge electron temperature iscompared with a simple sputtering model which shows the importance of C-C andO-C sputtering at the limiter in addition to fuel gas sputtering in explainingthe observed carbon concentration.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: A plasma-enhanced CVD process was used to deposit thin (40-100 nm),amorphous carbon/boron films onto the first wall of TFTR. A series of plasmaexperiments was performed to test the effect of this first-wall modification onlow-Z impurity (carbon, oxygen) behavior, suppression of metallic impurities,post-disruption recovery, hydrogenic recycling, and plasma density limits. Theanalysis of the plasma performance following the first few boronizationattempts on TFTR shows: (1) suppression by a factor of 1.5-3 of carbonimpurities immediately after boronization, although this suppression isshort-lived ( approximately 10 shots); (2) long term suppression of oxygen andmetallic impurities by a factor of two; (3) significant suppression of oxygenimpurity emission following disruptions and during pulse discharge cleaning;and (4) no significant change in hydrogenic recycling properties in comparisonto the pre-existing carbon first wall. 3.Beryllium Experience in Tokamaks 3.1Introduction As beryllium was selected as a reference plasma-facing material for the ITER, aliterature search for the use of beryllium in tokamaks has been performed usingthe MELVYL INSPEC database. Beryllium has been used as a plasma-facing materialin three tokamaks such as Unitor, ISX-B, and JET. We examined the database forpapers published between 1/1/69 and 9/25/95 using "the name of the tokamk" and"beryllium" for a "find title words" command. In the following report, we havelisted the bibliographic information and abstracts for each tokamak. 3.2Unitor (1) Hackmann, J.; Uhlenbusch, J. Experimental study of the compatibility of beryllium limiters with a Tokamakplasma. Nuclear Fusion, May 1984, vol.24, (no.5):640-2. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Beryllium rail limiters were inserted into the plasma of the tokamakUnitor to study the behavior of this material. The power load onto the limitersurface was about 2 kW.cm/sup -2/. The occurrence of heavy (Cr) and light (O)impurities was monitored spectroscopically. It was found that the contaminationby heavy impurities stemming from the first wall (Cr) was reduced by a factorof ten in the course of a few subsequent shots. In comparison with otherlimiter materials (graphite, TiC, spinel, Ni, Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/) the number ofdisruptive discharges was considerably reduced. After breaking the vacuum andopening the vessel, the beryllium deposition on the wall and the variouscomponents (pumps, mass spectrometer, etc.) were studied. No volatile berylliumdust could be detected by samplers. The released beryllium was found to bequantitatively condensed on the torus wall with a thickness of ten monolayersafter 1000 tokamak shots.

(Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Plasma SurfaceInteractions in Controlled Fusion Devices, Nagoya, Japan, 14-18 May 1984). Journal of Nuclear Materials, 1984, vol.128-129:418-21. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Beryllium rail limiters are inserted into the tokamak UNITOR to studythe compatibility of this material with the plasma. The power load onto thelimiter surface is 1-2 kW/cm/sup 2/ during the plasma pulse length of 50 msduration. The concentration of heavy (Cr) and light (O) impurities is monitoredby means of spectroscopy. In comparison with other materials tested likewise(graphite, Ni, Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/, TiC, SiC, SS) the Be-experiments have shownthe following improvements: (a) the concentration of heavy impurities isconsiderably reduced, (b) this reduction is preserved if the poloidalBe-limiters are retracted from the plasma, (c) the plasma resistivity isdiminished, (d) the occurrence of disruptions decreases. A total amount of 6 mgberyllium was found distributed on the inner torus wall after 1500 shots. Thedecontamination of the apparatus was performed without major problems. Onlyvery little volatile Be-dust was detected, and peripheric parts (pumps, massspectrometer etc.) were not contaminated. The beryllium released from thelimiters was found to be entirely deposited on the torus wall mainly in thevicinity of the limiters. (3) Bessenrodt-Weberpals, M.; Hackmann, J.; Uhlenbusch, J.

Abstract: The release and transport of beryllium in a tokamak plasma areinvestigated numerically in order to characterize the impurity concentrationsand fluxes. A model has been developed and applied to the small-scale tokamakUNITOR when operated with beryllium limiters. The source term for the berylliuminflux is evaluated to be approximately 10/sup 18/ s/sup -1/. The spatialdistributions of the various beryllium ions are given which reveal that fullystripped beryllium is dominant in the plasma core. There the contribution ofberyllium to Z/sub eff/ is at most 1. Further, the solution of rate equationsindicates that the population densities of ground state and metastable neutralberyllium are of comparable order. These theoretical results will be used tointerpret measurement of the beryllium concentrations and fluxes in front ofthe limiter by laser-induced fluorescence, which are now under way.

The transport of neutral and ionized berylliumreleased from poloidal limiter is studied both experimentally and numerically.The numerical simulation is based on an impurity transport algorithm incylindrical geometry. It comprises anomalous diffusion as well as ionization;recombination via charge exchange processes is included for highly ionizedberyllium atoms. The code yields the spatial distribution of the variousionization states with densities up to 4% of the electron density n/sub e/ andfluxes up to 10/sup 19/ m/sup -2/s/sup -1/. The contribution of beryllium toZ/sub eff/ is evaluated to be well below 1. The spatial and temporaldistribution of neutral beryllium is measured by laser induced fluorescence.For this purpose, the Be I resonance line at 234.9 nm is pumped by a frequencydoubled dye laser. These measurements yield the densities as well as the fluxesof neutral beryllium released from the limiter. The experimental results revealthat besides sputtering additional erosion mechanisms are of importance. (5) Bessenrodt-Weberpals, M.; Hackmann, J.; Nieswand, C.; Uhlenbusch, J.

Abstract: Laser-induced fluorescence experiments are performed in UNITOR inorder to study the release and the transport of beryllium which is ablated frompoloidal limiters. The concentrations of neutral and ionized beryllium atomsare measured. The experimental results are used as input data fortwo-dimensional transport calculations. The results show that low-lyingionization stages of beryllium remain localized in the vicinity of the limiter.The bulk contamination consists of fully stripped beryllium at a level of about0.9% n/sub e/ at the centre. This indicates that beryllium contributes at most0.14 to Z/sub eff/. (6) Nieswand, C.; Born, M.; Hackmann, J. Release of beryllium from poloidal limiters in UNITOR.

Abstract: The release of beryllium from poloidal limiter tiles was investigatedby laser-induced fluorescence. The measured beryllium fluxes are in the range10/sup 19/-10/sup 20/ m/sup -2/ s/sup -1/, depending on the proton flux andheat load onto the limiters. Evaluation of the data shows that besides physicalsputtering by protons sublimation becomes important at elevated surfacetemperatures. The density of neutral metastables in front of the limiter wasfound to be two times higher than the ground-state density. 3.3ISX-B (1) Davis, M.J.

Abstract: A movable, temperature-controlled beryllium rail limiter has beenused in the Impurity Study Experiment (ISX-B) tokamak at the Oak Ridge NationalLaboratory (ORNL). The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate thesuitability of the material for installation on the Joint European Torus (JET)experiment. The limiter was designed for a surface temperature rise of 600degrees C for each tokamak shot. This rise corresponds to a heat flux to thelimiter surface of approximately 2.1 to 2.4 kW/cm/sup 2/ for 0.3 s. Theexperimental test was expected to require a lifetime of approximately 3000neutral beam-heated plasma discharges to meet the planned surface fluence of10/sup 22/ hydrogen ions per cm/sup 2/. A temperature control system was usedto maintain the base-plate temperature of the limiter at about 200 degrees C.Normal plasma radius was 24 cm. the experimental results indicate that theberyllium limiter functions normally unless brought to melting point, whenevaporated beryllium covers the liner walls, gettering the discharge. Underthese conditions beryllium was the dominant impurity. (3) Watson, R.D.; Smith, M.F.; Whitley, J.B.; McDonald, J.M.

Abstract: Materials testing of S-65-B beryllium has been conducted in supportof the beryllium limiter experiment on the ISX-B tokamak at Oak Ridge NationalLaboratory. The S-65-B grade of hot-pressed beryllium was chosen over S-200-Ebecause of its superior strength and ductility at elevated temperatures. Thetesting has included measurement of tensile and yield strength, ductility,Young's Modulus, thermal conductivity, and specific heat from 50 degrees C to700 degrees C. Thermal fatigue testing of a 2.5 cm beryllium cube was conductedusing an electron beam to apply a heat flux of 2.5 kw/cm/sup 2/ for 0.3 secondpulses for 1500 cycles. Results from the tests are compared to elastic-plasticfinite element stress calculations. The testing indicates that the ISX-Bberyllium limiter should survive the tokamak environment without seriousstructural failure, although some surface cracking is expected to occur.

One facet of the studies centred oncharacterizing impurity influxes and concentrations. The radiation from bothlow-Z (Be, C, N, O) and intermediate-Z (Ti, Cr) contaminants was measured atthe limiter surface and at a wall location 90 degrees away from the limiter toassess the relative contributions of metallic impurities from the two differentsources. The effect of limiter melting, with concomitant reduction of bothlow-Z and intermediate-Z elements, was also documented.

Abstract: Materials testing of S-65-B grade beryllium has been conducted inorder to evaluate the use of this material for limiter surfaces in the ISX-Band JET tokamaks. Selected thermal and mechanical properties were measured attemperatures up to 700 degrees C. These measurements revealed that S-65-B hasexceptionally high ductility (up to roughly 50% elongation) at temperaturesexpected in normal operation of a beryllium limiter. Thermal fatigue testsunder conditions relevant to limiters in ISX-B and JET were also performedusing the Sandia National Laboratories Electron Beam Test System (EBTS).Results from these tests were compared to calculated results based onelastic-plastic finite element stress analyses. It was concluded from thesetests and analyses that properly designed beryllium limiters should survivenormal operation in ISX-B, JET, and similar devices without serious structuralfailure. Some degree of surface cracking can be expected, however unless cyclicplastic deformation at the heated surfaces can be adequately controlled bycareful design of the limiter.

Abstract: An experiment has been performed on the Impurity Study Experiment(ISX-B) tokamak to test beryllium as a limiter material. Beryllium is anattractive candidate for a limiter and has been proposed for use in the JointEuropean Torus (JET) experiment. A temperature-controlled, segmented, berylliumtop-rail limiter was located inside the plasma radius described by the existingtitanium limiters. An extended set of diagnostics was added for measurement ofscrapeoff and limiter parameters. These included visible and infraredmonitoring systems, probes, and surface analysis experiments. Tokamakexperiments included parameter surveys of both Ohmically heated andneutral-beam-heated plasmas and an extended fluence test of the limiter. Themost significant effect of operation with a beryllium limiter was the reductionin low-Z impurities caused by gettering action of beryllium deposited on theliner walls. The experiment required the design and implementation ofcontamination control apparatus and work procedures to prevent the accidentaldispersion of beryllium dust.

Abstract: An experiment to test beryllium as a limiter material has beenperformed in the ISX-B tokamak. The effect of the plasma on the limiter and theeffect of the limiter on the plasma were studied in detail. Heat and particlefluxes to the limiter were measured, and limiter damage by melting wasdocumented as a function of power flux. Strong melting and evaporation of thelimiter caused beryllium gettering of the vacuum vessel. Postmortem analysis ofthe limiter was performed to document the amount of retained hydrogen and theerosion and impurity deposition on the limiter. The effect of the limiter onthe plasma performance was studied in terms of parameter space, impuritycontent, and confinement for the ungettered and gettered cases. Operationalexperience with beryllium in a fusion experiment is discussed. (9) Langley, R.A.; England, A.C.; Edmonds, P.H.; Hogan, J.T.; and others.

Abstract: A beryllium limiter has been installed in the Impurity StudyExperiment-B (ISX-B) tokamak to test the applicability of beryllium as aplasma-side component for possible use in the Joint European Torus (JET). Thistest is a collaborative effort involving both ORNL and JET personnel. The ISX-Btokamak is operated for more than 3000 high power neutral beam injecteddischarges using the beryllium limiter as the main confining aperture. In orderto access the migration of beryllium in the tokamak and attached diagnostics,both stainless steel and silicon samples are placed at various strategicpositions and used as catcher plates. Nuclear reaction analysis is used tomeasure the beryllium deposited on the plates and provided a measure of theberyllium migration. Both particulates and a thin film are found. The toroidaldistribution of these two migration components is presented as well as adiscussion of the analysis technique for the deposited beryllium. Analysis ismade of the distribution of beryllium particulate matter deposited on theinside of the vessel wall. Both a size distribution and spatial distributionare presented.

Abstract: The weight changes of Be tiles which functioned as a rail limiter inthe Impurity Study Experiment-B (ISX-B) for more than 3500 beam-heateddischarges have been determined. The net weight loss for the limiter is 2.0 g,with the central tiles losing a total of 3.2 g, and the inboard tiles gaining1.2 g. The weight loss is attributed primarily to the release of Be droplets asa result of limiter surface melting. The weight gains result from an inwardflow of molten material along the limiter surface. The results indicate higherosion (melt loss) with incomplete and nonuniform redeposition (melt flow) oflimiter material during periods of limiter melting. (12) Zuhr, R.A.

Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology A (Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films),July-Aug. 1986, vol.4, (no.4):1933-8. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Changes in plasma impurities and radiated power due to cleanup andgettering during the beryllium limiter experiment are related to changes of thesurface composition of the torus walls and residual gases in the torus. Pulsedischarge cleaning was very effective in cleaning the ISX-B vacuum vessel afterinstallation of the beryllium limiter. As a result of discharge cleaning, areasnear the limiter were soon covered with a beryllium rich deposit containingsome iron, nickel, chromium, and titanium as well as oxygen, carbon, sulfur,and nitrogen. Oxygen levels on the wall were reduced to below 10 at.%.Materials transport during discharge cleaning was apparently due to sputteredneutrals. Evaporation of beryllium from the limiter and subsequent depositionon the torus walls caused by high power tokamak shots produced gettering of themachine equal or better than that previously obtained with titanium orchromium. This gettering by beryllium eliminated the need for further dischargecleaning or other gettering. Beryllium transport in this case appears to bemostly as ions in the plasma edge.

Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: One of 12 beryllium tiles on a top rail limiter in the impurity studyexperiment (ISX-B) tokamak was intentionally made radioactive. The migration ofthe radioactivity due to melting, ablation, and general excoriation of theradioactive tile was studied. Several hundred milligrams of material from theradioactive tile were spread to the other tiles over the course of theexperiment, which consisted of more than 3000 tokamak discharges. A smallamount of activity was found on the bottom of the tokamak vacuum vessel. Thedistribution of activity on the other limiter tiles showed a marked radiallyinward directivity, although all of the tiles received some activity. Thepossibility that some of the activity was the result of photo- andelectro-excitation by runaway electrons cannot be ruled out but probably cannotaccount for the bulk of the effect. 3.4JET (1) Rebut, P.H.; Dietz, K.J.

Pub type: General or Review. Abstract: In JET, at full performance, the power injected through the portswill reach 45 MW. From these 45 MW, 25 MW only will reach the center of theplasma and will be efficient for the heating. This power will fall on the innerwall of JET and on the limiters. The local thermal load on the limiters mayreach values as high as 10 MWm/sup -2/ for a duration of 10 s. In addition tothis, the material facing the plasma must be a 'low-Z material' in order tolimit the radiation from the impurities produced by sputtering and evaporationof the limiter surface. The cooling foreseen uses the hypervapotron technique(two phase system). The first cooled limiter on JET will be made of coppercovered by a layer of 1.5 mm nickel of 99.6% purity. This limiter could bedeveloped towards a low-Z one by replacing the nickel with a set of tiles ofcarbon or beryllium. Uncooled limiters of graphite will also be installed onJET. The concept of an antenna limiter which is being developed for the heatingof the JET plasma is another domain where the interaction of the plasma, theelectromagnetic waves and the antenna will play a dominant role.

The authors assessthe choice of nickel, graphite and beryllium for the limiter in JET and theeffectiveness of additional impurity control using a specified influx of neonto cool the edge plasma. The limiter materials are distinguished with respectto their ability, or otherwise, to allow plasmas with high central temperaturesand low limiter erosion. They concentrate on the effect of changes in theparticle transport and the effect of neon as a control gas to illustrateimportant features of the assessment. (3) Fielding, S.J.; McCracken, G.M.

Abstract: The processes producing impurities in tokamaks are still not wellunderstood, nor easy to predict in new machines. However, it is clear thatsputtering must be minimised. A model has recently been proposed whichdiscusses sputtering in terms of global parameters. The impurity level isdetermined by a self-consistent energy balance between the input power, thepower radiated and the power conducted out. This model has been used as thebasis for comparison of three different limiter materials, nickel, carbon andberyllium. Although some plasma parameters such as particle confinement timeare difficult to predict, the model allows the impurity behaviour to be readilycompared under a wide range of different conditions, including varying densityand additional heating. The effect of different levels of other impurities suchas oxygen can also be estimated. (4) Easoz, J.R.; Brussalis, W.G.; Andre, G.R.; Ohkawa, K.; and others.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: It is proposed to use in JET a single low-Z material for the beltlimiters and the walls to reduce impurity radiation losses to the lowest level.The only practical materials are graphite and beryllium. Their relative meritsare compared. Graphite has better thermomechanical properties than beryllium,but simulation experiments on beryllium carried out at Sandia NationalLaboratory and in ISX-B have proved these properties sufficient for the beltlimiters. Recent measurements indicate that beryllium retains 2-3 times lesshydrogen than graphite. The ISX-B experiments have shown that beryllium has anexcellent gettering action also. The main drawback of beryllium is the toxicityof its dust, but the control of beryllium dust is well within standardindustrial techniques. It is concluded that beryllium offers the best prospectsas a material for the JET belt limiters and walls. (6) Celentano, G.; Deksnis, E.; Shaw, R.; Sonnenberg, K.; and others.

This beltlimiter consists of two toroidal rings located above and below the equatorialplane of the vacuum vessel. Each of the two rings comprises a structure withwater cooling pipes and fins welded to the pipes. The limiter material incontact with the plasma (graphite or beryllium) is inserted between fins in theform of tiles. The belt limiter is designed to handle up to 40 MW of totalpower at flux densities of 3-5 MW/m/sup 2/ for 10 s and to permit rapidexchange of different limiter materials. This paper describes the design andmanufacture of the belt limiter and the results of thermomechanical analysisfor different edge properties, power levels and shot repetition rates.

Pub type: Practical; Theoretical or Mathematical; Experimental. Abstract: Beryllium is an attractive alternative to graphite for use as armormaterial for plasma interactive components in fusion devices because of its lowatomic number, high strength, and good compatibility with hydrogen. However,beryllium is susceptible to damage from cyclic thermal stresses because of itshigh elastic modulus and thermal expansion coefficient. The authors haveperformed 2-D elastic-plastic finite element stress analyses of prototypeberyllium limiter tiles for the JET project that are exposed to a surface heatflux of 250 W/cm/sup 2/ for 15 second pulses. Plastic deformation was predictedto occur at the heated surface during both the heating and cooling phases ofthe cycle, thereby causing cyclic plastic strain. They also performed thermalfatigue tests using a rastered electron beam to apply the heat load toprototype limiter specimens. After 10000 thermal fatigue cycles, the onlydamage of the beryllium tile was microcracking of the heated surface. The depthof this microcracking, 4 mm, corresponds closely to the calculated depth ofcyclic plastic strain. These favorable results show that the operatingconditions for the JET limiter design can be extended into the regime of cyclicplastic deformation without causing overall structural failure, despite theformation of thermal fatigue cracks.

Abstract: About 50% ( approximately 100 m/sup 2/) of the inner surface of theJET vessel is now covered in graphite tiles. High purity, fine grain graphitewas chosen for areas during the flat top time of the discharge, typically 10 s,the power loads do not exceed 5 MW m/sup -2/; carbon fibre reinforced graphitewas selected for areas where loads above 20 MW m/sup -2/ can be expected. Allother parts of the walls are carbonized. Fine grain high purity graphite hasbeen employed for the limiters from the very beginning of plasma operation.With increasing heating power the limiter surface has gradually been increasedfrom approximately 1.2 to approximately 15 m/sup -2/, and the power handlingcapability to 40 MW for ten seconds. This paper describes modifications to theinner wall introduced during the various operation phases of JET, the differentmaterials used, their performance in the presence of plasmas, and theirinfluence on plasma properties. Operational limits, future developments and theuse of beryllium as an alternative to the present concept of an all graphitemachine are discussed.

Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: During Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) heating in JET(Joint European Torus) with beryllium gettered walls and RF antenna screensboth the global and local impurity influxes are significantly reduced ascompared to the previous operation. In particular oxygen is reduced by an orderof magnitude and the deuterium is efficiently pumped. The deuterium recyclingR/sub D/<1 except at the onset of RF pulse (1<R/sub D/<1.1) for t=0.75s, indicating modest desorption. This provides the density control. Except forthe lowest densities, Z/sub eff/=2 at P/sub RF/=10 MW is routinely achieved. Atcomparable densities, P/sub RAD//P/sub TOT/ is 30-50% lower. If we assume thatthe long term evolution of the beryllium signal at the antenna screen is due toerosion, rather than coverage by carbon, the authors estimate the correspondinginflux in monopole configuration (k/sub II/=0 m/sup -1/) to be Phi /subBe/SCREEN=1.16*10/sup 19/ atoms MW/sup -1/ s/sup -1/ from an effective areaA/sub EFF/=0.5 m/sup 2/. At the same coupling resistance the beryllium influxscales with the RF power of the antenna and with the plasma density. Withdipoles (k/sub II/=7 m/sup -1/), the influx is reduced by more than a factor 3.The contribution of antenna influxes to Z/sub eff/ is small, Delta Z/subeff//sup Be/=0.08 and Delta Z/sub eff//sup Ni/=0.05 at P/sub RF/=5 MW.

Pub type: Practical; Theoretical or Mathematical. Abstract: JET has always been operated with graphite limiters. Carbonisationhas been performed from time to time resulting in a temporary reduction ofZ/sub eff/. However, the latest results at high power (up to 30 MW) indicatethat in most cases the impurity content in the plasma is too large to reachnear reactor conditions. To reduce the impurity content to a level acceptablein a reactor, it is proposed to use beryllium as a material for the limitersand wall surfaces in JET. This proposal was first made four years ago on thebasis of a report comparing the relative merits of beryllium and carbon. Theeffects of impurities on the plasma performance are discussed. The physical andchemical properties of graphite and beryllium are compared. A simple model forthe impurity production at the plasma edge is presented.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Beryllium films (150 to 300AA) have been evaporated on all JETin-vessel components (carbon limiters, nickel screen, inconel walls). Immediateand lasting improvements of the plasma have been observed in all plasmaregimes. The authors concentrate on the results obtained with ICRH and NBI onthe density limit and on H-mode plasmas which are particularly sensitive toimpurity release. Specific effects produced by RF waves are reduced to anegligible level when the following 3 aspects are combined: berylliumevaporation, dipole phasing and correct screen angle. The density limitobtained with ICRF is now identical to NBI heated cases and substantiallyhigher than the values obtained in the pre-beryllium phase. Long H-modes (1.3s) have been obtained with RF alone. The H mode confinement is similar to thatof NBI cases. In limiter plasmas Z/sub eff/ decreased to 1.2-1.4 at highdensity and for 10 MW input power. The results are related to oxygen gettering,suppression of nickel sputtering from the antenna screens and to the use ofdipole phasing. (12) Keilhacker, M.

In August the graphite limitertiles were replaced with Be tiles, and a three week experimental campaign wasconducted in September/October. In the first phase oxygen was reduced to anegligible level and the carbon flux halved. In the second phase, for limitermode operation, carbon was reduced by another factor of five, and Be became thedominant impurity. High power, long pulse additionally heated limiter modedischarges with Z/sub eff/<1.5 were achieved, and density limits wereincreased by a factor of up to two. ICRF produced H-modes were obtained inX-point operation (double null). The combination of Be gettering with newoperational procedures to delay the strong influx of carbon from the X-pointtiles enabled the achievement of record fusion parameters in H-mode dischargesincluding a transient n/sub d/T/sub i/ tau /sub E/ value of 9*10/sup 20/ m/sup-3/ keVs, corresponding to a Q/sub DT/ equivalent of about 0.8.

The machine initially operated with metallic walls,but the inner surface of the vessel ( approximately 200 m/sup 2/) is nowcovered to more than 50% with fine grain and carbon fibre reinforced graphitetiles. The remaining wall area is carbonized. The authors present the materialsbehaviour in the presence of plasma; their influence on plasma properties; theconditioning methods employed; a discussion of future enhancements of innerwall components and the planned use of beryllium as an alternative to thepresent concept of an all graphite machine. It is essential for the furtherdevelopment of fusion that the experience gained in JET is transferred to thenext machine, which should produce a burning plasma on a scale comparable to areactor. Such a proposed machine is a single null divertor tokamak with thefollowing parameters: 3 m plasma minor radius, 7.5 m major radius, elongationapproximately 2, aspect ratio approximately 2.5, toroidal field, 4.5 T, pulseduration 2000 s and fusion power up to 5 GW. The underlying physics for thechoice of these parameters and the basic design is presented. (14) Jacquinot, J.; Bhatnagar, V.; Bures, M.; Campbell, D.; and others.

Abstract: Beryllium films (150 to 300 AA) have been evaporated on all JETin-vessel components (carbon limiters, nickel screen, inconel walls). Immediateand lasting improvements of the plasma have been observed in all plasmaregimes. The authors concentrate on the results obtained with ICRH and NBI onthe density limit and on H-mode plasmas which are particularly sensitive toimpurity release. Specific effects produced by RF waves are reduced to anegligible level when the following three aspects are combined-berylliumevaporation, dipole phasing, correct screen angle. The density limit obtainedwith ICRF is now identical to NBI heated cases and substantially higher thanthe values obtained in the pre-beryllium phase. Long H-modes (1.3 s) have beenobtained with RF alone. The H mode confinement is similar to that of NBI cases.In limiter plasmas Z/sub eff/ decreased to 1.2-1.4 at high density and for 10MW input power. The results are related to oxygen gettering, suppression ofnickel sputtering from the antenna screens and to the use of dipole phasing.

Abstract: During Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) heating in JET(Joint European Torus) with beryllium gettered walls and RF antenna screensboth the global and local impurity influxes are significantly reduced ascompared to the previous operation. In particular oxygen is reduced by an orderof magnitude and the deuterium is efficiently pumped. The deuterium recyclingR/sub D/<1 except at the onset of the RF pulse (1<R/sub D/<1.1) fort=0.75 s, indicating modest desorption. This provides the density control.Except for the lowest densities, Z/sub eff/=2 at P/sub RF/=10 MW is routinelyachieved. At comparable densities, P/sub RAD//P/sub TOT/ is 30-50% lower. Ifone assumes that the long term evolution of the beryllium signal at the antennascreen is due to erosion, rather than coverage by carbon, one estimates thecorresponding influx in the monopole configuration (k/sub II/=0 m/sup -1/) tobe Phi /sub Be//sup SCREEN/=1.16*10/sup 19/ atoms MW/sup -1/ s/sup -1/ from aneffective area A/sub EFF/=0.5 m/sup 2/. At the same coupling resistance theberyllium influx scales with the RF power of the antenna and with the plasmadensity. With dipoles (k/sub II/=7 M/sup -1/), the influx is reduced by morethan a factor of 3.

Abstract: An investigation of the scrape-off layer (SOL) at different poloidalpositions have been carried out with Langmuir probes for limiter dischargeswith ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) at JET. Comparison of the effectsof ICRH on the edge is presented for operation with all carbon limiters, andfor operation with a beryllium layer evaporated on the walls and limiters ofJET. The behaviour of the SOL parameters is similar for both cases, althoughedge temperatures tend to be lower in the Be case. Measurements with probesbetween the belt limiters and close to the ICRH antennas show that the edgeparameters in this region are strongly influenced by the vicinity of an activeantenna.

Abstract: Results from the initial operation of the JET tokamak (Plasma Physicsand Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research (IAEA, vienna, 1985), Vol.1, p.11) withberyllium are summarized.

Abstract: JET is investigating beryllium as material for walls and limiters.Studies were carried out with initially a thin layer of beryllium evaporatedonto the walls of the machine, later in addition the graphite material of thebelt limiter was exchanged against beryllium. The use of this material wasgenerally beneficial for the plasma behaviour. Combined with a reduction in theoxygen content, strong pumping of hydrogen isotopes was found which allowed JETto widen considerably the operational space with respect to ion temperatures,densities and plasma purity. In this paper a comparison of the plasmaperformance with graphite and beryllium will be presented. The author discussesespecially the impurity behaviour with respect to fluxes, concentrations,effective charge and dilution, and reports on density limits, disruptionbehaviour, wall pumping, hydrogen isotope retention, and the power handlingcapability of the beryllium limiter in the present design. Examples of improvedplasma performance are given. (19) Thomas, P.R. Results of JET operation with beryllium.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The 1989 JET experimental campaign assessed the properties ofberyllium as a plasma-facing material. This campaign had three phases: (i) anall-graphite phase to recommission the tokamak, (ii) a phase with berylliumevaporation on graphite to isolate the effect of oxygen gettering and (iii) aberyllium limiter phase. Beryllium evaporation removed oxygen from the plasmaand reduced carbon concentrations by a factor of two. Strong deuteron pumpingwas obtained which resulted in a significant, long-term improvement in densitycontrol and eliminated the deconditioning effect of disruptions. The use ofberyllium limiters reduced the plasma radiation, increased the density limit,reduced the incidence of disruptions and enhanced the deuteron pumping. In theberyllium phases impurity influxes were lower during ICRH heating whichpermitted the first ICRH-only H-modes. The deuteron pumping allowed heavy gasfuelling to be used to reduce impurity levels of limiter and X-point plasmas. (20) Pasini, D.; Summers, D.; Philipps, V.; Weisen, H.; and others.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: During high-power operation in JET, a sudden and large increase inthe flux of impurities (carbon and beryllium) entering the discharge is oftenobserved shortly after the start of additional heating, especially at the lowplasma density required for high ion temperature and fusion yield. This influxleads to a degradation of the plasma performance due to an increase of theimpurity concentration and associated deuterium dilution, reduced beampenetration and a reduction in the ion temperature. There is good evidence thatthese influxes result from a small fraction of the total area of the carbon(beryllium) surfaces in contact with the plasma (tile edges particularly)reaching temperatures where radiation-enhanced sublimation and thermalsublimation for carbon and evaporation for beryllium become important. Theauthors report on measurements of the phenomena observed during inner-wall andcarbon or beryllium belt limiter discharges both with and without berylliumgettering.

For the Be-phase,effective transport parameters for diffusion and recombination of deuterium atsurfaces of in-vessel components of JET are derived using plasma discharge dataonly. This and the analysis of the outgassing behaviour after the dischargesuggest that deuterium release is controlled by recombination with D/k (D isthe diffusion, k the recombination coefficient) of about 10/sup 21/-10/sup 22/m/sup -2/, larger than expected from laboratory measurements.

Abstract: Scaling of edge particle flux and temperature with central density inJET has been studied in ohmic and auxiliary heated beryllium limiterdischarges, using Langmuir probes in the edge. Data has been obtained over amuch wider density range than previously, and it is found that flux densityscales almost linearly with central density. The edge temperature, on the otherhand, is almost constant at low densities, but falls rapidly when gas puffingis used in the edge to achieve high densities. A global power balance assumingT/sub i/=T/sub e/ suggests a shortfall in power to the edge, particularly atlow densities, suggesting T/sub i/>T/sub e/. The consequence of high T/subi/ on limiter sputtering is considered. (23) Peacock, A.T.; Coad, J.P.; Lama, F.; Behrisch, R.; and others.

Abstract: During 1989, following a brief all carbon phase, JET was operatedwith an evaporated beryllium film on all the plasma facing surfaces and then,in a third phase, with bulk beryllium used for the belt limiters and one set ofantenna protection tiles. Subsequent analysis of wall components and long termsamples (LTS) using beta backscatter and ion beam analysis has been conductedto determine the condition of the first wall and its deuterium inventory afterberyllium operation. Ex-situ analysis of components where deposition occursduring operation shows mixed carbon and beryllium layers with an approximateratio 1:1 and some localised higher Z components. The deuterium inventorysituation is little changed by the introduction of beryllium. Similar surfacelevels of deuterium, approximately 1*10/sup 22/ atoms m/sup -2/, have been seenfor both carbon and beryllium belt limiter tiles.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: During ICRF heating in JET with Be gettering and Be-belt limiters theimpurity influxes are significantly reduced as compared to the all carbon case.The dominating 'global' influxes originate at the limiters and wall and areconsequence of the increased power flow in the scrape-off layer (SOL). The 'RFspecific' influxes from the torus internal surfaces, far away from the antenna,are not observed. Z/sub eff/=1.5-2 is routinely achieved at power levels up toP/sub rf/=15 MW and with Be limiters even at densities (n/sub e/)=(1-2)*10/sup19/ m/sup -3/. The dilution is n/sub d//n/sub e/>0.8. Z/sub eff/ scalesinversely with density and weakly with RF power, (Z/sub eff/-1) varies as P/subRF//sup 0.4-0.6//(n/sub e/)/sup 0.9-1.1/. P/sub rad//P/sub tot/ is 50% lowerthan previously observed. Even at densities (n/sub e/)=(4-6)*10/sup 19/ m/sup-3/ the radiated fraction is below 30% of input power. In the case of Begettering and carbon limiters the dominant impurity is carbon. With the Belimiters it is replaced by Be. The oxygen is eliminated in both cases. Thedensity is controlled by the pumping of deuterium and the recycling coefficientR/sub d/ is less than one during the entire RF pulse. The density limitobserved in the all carbon phase was exceeded by a factor 2-4. Volume averageddensity (n/sub e/)=1*10/sup 20/ m/sup -3/ was achieved with gas puffing atpower P/sub RF/=8 MW.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The effect of different fuelling scenarios (gas fuelling and pellets)on the scrape-off layer parameters is presented for ohmic and additionallyheated limiter discharges at JET, during operation with Be-coated carbonlimiters and all-Be limiters. The carbon and beryllium impurity production iscalculated using edge parameters measured with Langmuir probes, and comparedwith the central impurity content (Z/sub eff/). The local particle diffusioncoefficient is also calculated. For all the different dynamic processesstudied, a correlation is found between electron edge temperature and edgedensity, which does not depend on the fuelling or heating scenario used. Acooling of the edge is observed with increasing edge density, and the impurityproduction by sputtering decreases for edge temperatures below 20 eV. Stronggas and pellet fuelling are found to be very efficient in controlling Z/subeff/. (26) Deksnis, E.; Cheetham, A.; Hwang, A.; Lomas, P.; and others. Damage to JET beryllium tiles.

Approximately 2-4% of the surface of the limiter hasbeen melted near the plasma contact point. Another 10-15% of the surface showsevidence of edge heating. some 5% of tiles have been subjected to abnormalloads at points distant from the contact area. Damage shows strong correlationof localised heating of the toroidal field ripple. Edge heating rates of 260Mw/m/sup 2/ have not caused gross mechanical failure of the limiter. Themechanical damage comprises fatigue cracks analogous to those due to sustainedloading at low power levels. (27) Hwang, A.; Stamp, M.F.; Summers, D.D.R.; Elder, D.; and others.

Abstract: The sputtering yields for deuterium on carbon and beryllium at thebelt limiters in JET are determined with an OMA spectrometer and/orphotomultiplier detectors with optical interference filters. The apparentsputter yield for carbon in the absence of oxygen from 4-10%, and for berylliumthe yield from 6-30%. A CCD camera with optical interference filters has beenused to record the 2-D spatial distributions of the BeI (825.4 nm) lineradiation at the belt limiters. Clearly resolved individual tile images areobserved, and the dependence of the toroidal and poloidal impuritydistributions on plasma density and input power has been investigated.Transport of the Be neutrals has been modelled with the LIM impurity code overthe plasma density range (0.35-2.50)*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/ for 3 MA ohmicdischarges, and good agreement with the experimental data has been obtained.

The measured dependenceof carbon influx on surface temperature is compared with results from a modelof the plasma boundary. The spatial distribution, in the region around theprobe, of spectral emission from low ionisation stages of carbon are comparedwith results from the Monte Carlo transport code, LIM. In both models, measuredvalues of local plasma parameters were used. In plasma with Be-gettered carbonlimiters, carbon influx from the probe increased rapidly when the surfacetemperature exceeded 1200 degrees C. Experiments with beryllium metal limitershowed that under these conditions, a layer of mainly beryllium was depositedon the probe surface, and this suppressed the carbon influx until highersurface temperatures were reached.

The ratio D/2 K/sub r/(m/sup -2/) (D: diffusion coefficient, K/subr/: recombination rate coefficient), which characterises the hydrogen transientpumping behaviour of the materials, has been measured for hydrogen anddeuterium in Be as a function of temperature, in the range373<or=T(K)>or=553. D/2K/sub r/ was found to be approximately=10/sup 20/m/sup -2/ and depend weakly on the Be temperature (activation energies ofapproximately=0.1 eV). This value of D/2K/sub r/ was then used as an inputparameter to the PERI code to simulate the plasma deuterium inventory behaviourassuming that the main processes governing the recycling during the dischargeare diffusion in the bulk and recombination on the surface of beryllium. Thedeuterium fluxes from the plasma-facing surfaces are simulated with goodaccuracy. The simulation of the deuterium plasma inventory is somewhat worse,although a satisfactory agreement between the calculated experimental timeevolution is achieved.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Surface probes have been exposed at JET with all-carbon walls, whenberyllium was evaporated onto graphite limiters, and with beryllium limiters.The aims have been to study the impurity content in the scrape-off, erosion anddeposition, and the pumping of deuterium by codeposition with carbon andberyllium. Thermally activated erosion makes it difficult to study timeresolved erosion close to the LCFS. In the all-carbon machine, the carbondensity in the outboard scrapeoff between the belts was estimated toapproximately 20% of the deuterium. With a fresh Be coating on the limiters,carbon in the SOL was initially suppressed, but increased from discharge todischarge. The D/C ratio in codeposition layers was three times larger withBe-evaporation than in all-carbon conditions. Edge profiles determined fromimpurity deposition became flatter during RF heating and current ramp down. (31) Dietz, K.J.; Pick, M.A.; Peacock, A.T.; Sonnenberg, K.; and others.

Edited by: Lubell, M.S.;Nestor, M.B.; Vaughan, S.F. New York, NY, USA: IEEE, 1990. p. 517-21 vol.1. Pub type: Practical. Abstract: The evaporation of beryllium inside the JET (Joint European Torus)has changed considerably the behavior of the machine and the plasmaperformance. Recovery from disruption was fast and density control was easilyachieved. The operational space with respect to Z/sub eff/-values, dilution,density, and temperature could be considerably extended. The dilution wasreduced and consequently the fusion parameter was doubled to 5*10/sup 20/ m/sup-3/ keV. The equivalent Q/sub DT/-value, albeit nonstationary, approaches 0.5.Beryllium tiles were installed on the belt limiter, requiring for the firsttime an intervention into the vessel with full biological protection. Thecontrol of the beryllium environment was successful and installation times didnot require more manhours than previously for in-vessel work. Experimentalresults from operation with the beryllium limiter are not yet available.Preliminary findings indicate the possibility of obtaining very low Z/subeff/-values (<1.3-1.8) for additionally heated discharges. Energies of up to180 MJ were deposited on the limiter, twice the amount which can be taken bythe graphite limiter before the occurrence of the carbon bloom. At the edges ofthe beryllium limiter tiles, hot spots develop (as was also observed for thegraphite). (32) Peacock, A.T.; Dietz, K.J.; Israel, G.; Jensen, H.S.; and others. Operational experience with the JET beryllium evaporators in the J1W testbed. JET Joint Undertaking, Abingdon, UK, 1990. Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: Four beryllium evaporators were fitted onto the JET vessel duringMarch 1989. These evaporators are planned to give the first introduction ofberyllium into the JET machine to study the effect of using beryllium as afirst wall material. Over 200 hours operational experience with such anevaporator had been gained on a test bed facility in which the evaporationrate, radial evaporant distribution and head operating temperature had beendetermined. The results obtained on this facility with two different headmaterials, sintered S-65B and vacuum cast beryllium are described. The testvessel has also been used to conduct beryllium wall pumping experiments usingthe 'Langmuir effect'. The initial results of these experiments aredescribed. (33) Harris, G.R. Comparisons of the current decay during carbon-bounded and beryllium boundeddisruptions in JET. JET Joint Undertaking, Abingdon, UK, Dec. 1990. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: Presents results of preliminary investigations of the current decayphase in JET major disruptions, where the plasma is bounded by berylliumlimiters and a beryllium gettered wall. The average decay time of the currentis 175 ms, about 14 times longer than the initial decay time for carbon-bondeddisruptions. Vertical stability is often lost before the current has decayedsignificantly in Be-bounded disruptions, leading to substantial net verticalforces on the vacuum vessel. Subsequent interaction of the plasma with the topor bottom divertor tiles leads to increased impurity contamination, cooling ofthe plasma and a second phase of more rapid current decay. No runaway currentplateau is observed for carbon-bounded x-point disruptions, although in somecases a small hesitation in the current decay is observed that is coincidentwith the hard X-ray and photoneutron signals associated with runaway electrons.The total photoneutron yield in x-point disruptions is at least 10 timessmaller than that measured from limiter discharges. Both x-point and limiterdisruptions in Be-bounded discharges show no runaway production, except for afew cases where carbon contamination is also suspect. Direct ECE measurementsindicate the temperature T/sub d/ following thermal quench in Be-boundeddisruptions is at least 30 eV, and often higher. Plasmas of such temperatureshave resistive decay times consistent with the observed current decay rates.The lack of runaway production is also consistent with these temperatures as,for n/sub e/=1*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/, the runaway production rate for T/subd/=30 eV is estimated to be a factor 10/sup -6/ less than that at 5 eV. Evengreater reductions are estimated for higher densities. (34) Bures, M.; Jacquinot, J.; Stamp, M.; Summers, D.; and others. Assessment of beryllium Faraday screens of the JET ICRF antennas. JET Joint Undertaking, Abingdon, UK, July 1991. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The installation of beryllium (Be) Faraday screens (FS) at the ICRFantennas in JET resulted in elimination of the RF specific effects on theplasma boundary by the impurity influx originating at the screens. In dipolephasing, k/sub II/=7 m/sup -1/, the influx is for all purposes negligible. Inmonopole (k/sub II/=0 m/sup -1/) the beryllium influx does not exceed phi /subBe//sup FS/=1*10/sup 19/ atoms MW/sup -1/ s/sup -1/ and corresponding deltaZ/sub eff//P/sub RF/<0.005 MW/sup -1/. The observed dependences of the phi/sub Be//sup FS/ (in monopole phasing) on plasma density, antenna voltage,antenna phasing and the angle between FS elements and the magnetic field in theboundary B(a)=B/sub theta /(a)+B/sub T/(a) confirm that the release mechanismis the sputtering by the ions accelerated in the RF-enhanced Bohm-Debye sheathsforming at the front face of the FS. When the angle between FS and the B(a) isapproximately=22 degrees the fraction of the RF power radiated by the antenna,dissipated at the screen, can reach 40%. At high antenna voltage arcing acrossthe FS can occur. With dipole phasing the heating efficiency is not degradedeven with the large angle and all the power coupled by the antenna is absorbedat the resonance position near the plasma centre. The open screen design didnot introduce any disadvantages. The experience from the JET operation atpowers up to 22 MW shows that, if the necessary conditions are met, i.e., RFrectification is minimised and material with the low sputtering coefficients atenergies 0.5-1 keV is used, then the influx from the FS is eliminated.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The JET ICRF antennas, equipped with beryllium (Be) Faraday screens(FS), can be operated in such a way that the RF specific effects on the plasmaboundary, by the impurity influx originating at the screens, are reduced to anegligible level. In dipole phasing, k/sub ///=7 m/sup -1/, the influx is forall purposes negligible. In monopole phasing (k/sub ///=0 m/sup -1/) theberyllium influx does not exceed phi /sub Be//sup FS/=1*10/sup 19/ atoms.MW/sup-1/.s/sup -1/ and the corresponding delta Z/sub eff//P/sub RF /is <0.005MW/sup -1/. The observed dependences of phi /sub Be//sup FS/ (in monopolephasing) on plasma density antenna voltage, antenna phasing, and the anglebetween FS elements and the magnetic field in the boundary, B(a)=B/sub theta/(a)+B/sub T/(a), confirm that the release mechanism is sputtering by ionsaccelerated in the RF enhanced Bohm-Debye sheaths forming at the front face ofthe FS. When the angle between FS and B(a) is approximately=22 degrees , thefraction of the RF power radiated by the antenna, dissipated at the screen, canreach 40%. At high antenna voltage, arcing across the FS can occur. With dipolephasing the heating efficiency is not degraded, even with the large angle, andall the power coupled by the antenna is absorbed at the resonance position nearthe plasma centre. The open screen design did not introduce any disadvantages.The experience from JET operation at powers of up to 22 MW shows that, if thenecessary conditions are met, i.e. if RF rectification is minimized, antennasare phased as dipoles and material with low sputtering coefficients at energiesof 0.5-1 keV is used, then the influx from the FS is, for all practicalpurposes, eliminated.

New York, NY, USA:IEEE, 1992. p. 596-9 vol.1. Pub type: Practical. Abstract: The measures detailed in the 'Code of Practice for the Safe use ofBeryllium at JET' are summarized. JETs (Joint European Torus') policy ofsegregating beryllium related work into BeCAs (beryllium controlled areas) hasensured that the general workplace (torus hall, assembly hall, etc.) remainfree of airborne and surface contamination, and hence no safety precautionshave had to be adopted in these areas. There have been no beryllium incidentsleading to airborne concentrations in excess of 0.2 mu gm/sup -3/ outside ofany BeCA. Aerial discharges of beryllium have generally been undetectable andhave never approached the limit of 0.01 mu gm/sup -3/. No cases of acute orchronic beryllium intoxication have been diagnosed; some minor cuts have beensustained in BeCAs (no contamination of the wound was found on samples) and notreatment has been required beyond conventional first-aid procedures. In-vesselwork has continued to be possible despite high levels of surface contaminationand variable air concentrations, but the logistics support for in-vesseloperation has increased very noticeably as a result of beryllium.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The dependence of impurity production and retention on the divertordensity, on the power flow into this region as well as on the X-point to targetdistance are investigated. Model predictions suggest a good impurity retentionabove a certain divertor (scrape-off) density threshold, which is dependent onheating power. Pre-programmed midplane or X-point gas puffs were used to scanthe density, as well as to avoid the depletion of particles form the divertorand the scrape-off during H-modes. The gas puffs reduce T/sub e/ and increaseN/sub e/ in particular at the outer strike zone. In general the Be as well asthe C influx increases with density, which is understood from the T/sube/(T/sub i/) dependence of the sputtering yields. The impurity retention showsthe expected improvement with increasing scrape-off (divertor) density as wellas with increasing X-point to target distance (connection length).

Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: The radial distributions of the low charge states of Be near the JETberyllium belt limiters have been measured experimentally. When interpretedwith an impurity production/transport code, these measurements elucidate theplasma behaviour near the limiter, and the source and sink action of thelimiter on the impurity ions. The authors have considered 3 MA ohmicallyheated, limiter discharges with n/sub e/=1-4*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/. A modelwhich satisfactorily reproduces the measured profiles required the followingassumptions: (a) an n/sub e/(r) profile just inside the LCFS (0 toapproximately 10 cm radially inwards) which extrapolated smoothly from the SOL(probe) measurements; (b) a T/sub e/(r) outer edge profile which extrapolatedsmoothly from the core (ECE) measurements; (c) a cross-field impurity diffusioncoefficient D/sub perpendicular to / approximately= 0.5 m/sup 2//s in the outeredge; (d) no strong inward or outward pinch action in the outer edge; (e)impurity production by physical sputtering, rather than by evaporation; (f)sputtering due to parallel plasma flow onto the limiters; no significant directperpendicular flow onto the limiters, as has been observed for largerlimiters.

(Tenth International Conference on Plasma-Surface Interactions in ControlledFusion Devices, Monterey, CA, USA, 30 March-3 April 1992). Journal of Nuclear Materials, 1992, vol.196-198:735-8. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: The 1991/92 JET experimental campaign assessed the performance ofthree different toroidally continuous X-point target plates. The maindifferences were in the tile material, beryllium and carbon, and the presenceof exposed edges. These three configurations have been tested up to powerlevels in excess in 22 MW and with gas fuelling at the X-point and in themidplane. With the beryllium a radiating divertor was achieved by puffingdeuterium into the X-point region, while rapid ELMs resulted from deuteriumpuffing on the carbon target. The investigation into the importance of smalledges, up to 1.5 mm, yielded some interesting results. Although the surfacetemperature rise was substantially reduced by eliminating exposed tile edges,the onset of the carbon bloom was not delayed by a similar amount. In thispaper a model is presented which can explain this and other features of thebloom. (40) Philipps, V.; Ehrenberg, J. Analysis of outgassing after JET-discharges under beryllium first wallconditions. JET Joint Undertaking, Abingdon, UK, July 1992. Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: During the beryllium phase of JET, hydrogen (H/sub 2/, HD, D/sub 2/),hydrocarbon (C/sub x/H/sub y/) and CO outgassing after discharges has beenanalysed by means of mass spectroscopy and Penning gauges. The analysis hasbeen performed over a period of up to 3000 seconds after ohmic and additionallyheated limiter and X-point discharges. The temporal behaviour of hydrogenicoutgassing could be characterized by a uniform power law t/sup -n/ withn=0.73+or-0.1 which is independent of plasma operation parameters. This resultis discussed in view of possible transport and retention mechanisms in anddeuterium release mechanisms from plasma facing surfaces. It is concluded thatnot a single but several mechanisms can explain the release behaviour. However,one of the most plausible explanations is accumulation of hydrogen in limitersand walls. Outgassing of hydrocarbon and CO were significantly lower underberyllium wall conditions as compared to the earlier all carbon wallconditions.

Pub type: Practical; Experimental. Abstract: Single null X-point discharges having exactly the same main plasmaparameters were performed on the C and on the Be target tiles in order tocompare the two materials under similar conditions. Low power L-mode, H-modeand hot-iron H-mode pulses were used in this comparison. The impurityproduction when using a Be target is a factor of 3 higher than at the C targetunder similar plasma conditions. The power handling capability of Be isapproximately a factor of 1.5 lower than that of C. In radiative divertor (gastarget) experiments, however, Be seems to be superior to C. This may be due tothe fact that the maximum Be radiation occurs at a plasma temperature of 1.5 eVcompared with 7 eV in the case of C. (42) Martinelli, A.P.; Behrisch, R.; Peacock, A.T.

Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: After plasma operation in 1991 samples were cut from C and Be tilesof the JET vessel walls, limiters, and X-point tiles along a poloidal crosssection in octant 4W, and the surface layers were analysed by the MeV ion beammethods NRA, PIXE, and RBS to determine the D and metal impurity distributions.The amount of trapped deuterium ranges from 5*10/sup 15/ to 5*10/sup 17/D/cm/sup 2/, metal impurities such as Ni, Cr, and Fe are in the range of 10/sup15/ to 3*10/sup 16//cm/sup 2/, Cl in the range of 10/sup 16/ to 10/sup18//cm/sup 2/, K and Ca in the range of 10/sup 15/ to 10/sup 16//cm/sup 2/ andTi about 10/sup 15//cm/sup 2/. Except for Cl, all measured concentrations are afactor of up to about ten lower than those observed on JET walls tiles beforeBe evaporation and Be wall components were used. This observation is inagreement with the reduced impurity concentrations measured in the JET plasma.The D and impurity distributions along the X-point tiles were analysed in somedetail. Generally, the deuterium trapping and impurity deposition show minimain areas where erosion dominates and amounts to a factor of about ten timeslarger inbetween.

New York, NY, USA: IEEE, 1995. p. 1-4. Pub type: Experimental. Abstract: A long pulse JET divertor requires the production of beryllium cladcopper alloy hypervapotron target plates. Vacuum brazing of beryllium poses anumber of problems relating to the stable beryllium oxide and ready formationof brittle intermetallics. Induction brazing offers some advantages and a righas been developed for producing vapotron test target plates for power loadtesting in the Neutral Beam Test Bed. The brazed components have survived over1000 shots at 13 MW/m/sup 2/ with an ultimate power loading capability up to 17MW/m/sup 2/. These results have been interpreted with respect to both localisedstresses and thermal fatigue at the interface. This study analyses the powerhandling capability with respect to instantaneous heat flux failure, localisedhot spots from target plate deflections and high cycle fatigue with a view toestablishing an optimum unit size.

Abstract: Since the introduction of beryllium (Be) into the JET machine in 1989the occupational hygiene screening for Be contamination has been a key featureof JET health physics tasks. Beryllium dust is toxic and if inhaled can resultin severe acute and chronic conditions which have been well documented.Techniques to rapidly assess Be contamination have been investigated. A laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) system, in which a laser is used tovapourise Be from a filter paper prior to analysis was found to be inaccuratedue to particle size differences between the calibration and JET samples. Aprototype on-line sampler although rapid was found to be insufficientlysensitive. The lack of a practical direct monitoring method for assessing JETBe contamination complicates the procedures required for the safe handling ofthe material. The requirements of the UK Control of Substances Hazardous toHealth Regulations have necessitated the provision of on-site Be analysisfacilities to provide the information necessary to protect the work force anddemonstrate compliance with these regulations. The technique described hereinvolves the dissolution of filter paper samples bearing Be dust in sulphuricand nitric acids and the analysis of the resulting liquor by atomic absorptionspectrometry and is recommended by the UK Health and Safety Executive assuitable for assessing personnel exposure to Be.
