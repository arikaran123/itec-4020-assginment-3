The recently launchedNorwich Union Direct offers a motorcycle policy and existingpolicyholders may see advantages in buying direct in the future.Premiums fell again last year, reflecting increasing competition aswell as a significant fall in biking accidents.  In 1994, thesetotalled 25,100, a reduction of more than half the figure of 65,300recorded for 1984.  As the number of motorcycles also halved over thesame period, the statistics are not as encouraging as they mightappear.  However, there are signs that insurers are beginning to revisetheir view of motorcyclists as high risks, particularly as a new breedof more mature "enthusiast" motorcyclists is emerging.  The currentpremium value of the market is estimated at #150m.In the wake of Norwich Union's introduction of group-rated cover in1994, Lombard General followed suit last year, with rates designed for20 different categories.Uninsured loss recoveryThe ULR policies described are for legal expenses associated withprivate motor and marine risks.  They all have to be purchased and inforce before the insured event takes place apart from Motorists LegalProtection's After the Accident policy.  This is a stand-alone policydesigned for purchase by an accident victim - motorist, cyclist orpedestrian - following an accident to cover the future legal costs ofpursuing a claim arising from that accident.Motor ULR insurance is now widely sold in the UK, with most motorinsurers offering their policyholders the chance to add on legalexpenses cover.  Both DAS Legal Expenses Insurance and CornhillInsurance have recently produced upgraded versions of their standardproducts, while DAS also offers a more basic policy.Introduction of the conditional fee system in the UK last year,accompanied by the launch of a conditional fee insurance scheme backedby the Law Society,  led to some confusion among brokers as to thecontinued need for ULR cover.    For #85 premium, the Law Society'sscheme - Accident Line Protect - pays up to #100,000 of costs awardedagainst plaintiffs if they lose a personal injury case.  It is arrangedby Johnson & Higgins in association with the insurers' agents AbbeyLegal Protection, and placed with Lexington Insurance, part of AIG.Motoring Uninsured Loss Recoveries Association (MULRA) chairman PaulAsplin has responded with assurances that conditional fees will notmake any impact on the desirability or need for ULR cover.  Over 80% ofnon-fault motor accidents do not involve personal injury and in suchcases the conditional fee system is not available.  He also pointed outthat, under the conditional fee system, plaintiffs are left to pick upthe costs awarded against them if they fail their case.  He statedthat, with the new conditional fee insurance scheme, plaintiffs mightfind that the full amount of damages recovered was swallowed upon incosts before the insurance cover came into play.Back to Headline List CopyrightPERSONAL POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NEW SUBSIDENCE RATING SYSTEMHiscox Underwriting is pioneering a revolutionary system, provided bythe British Geological Survey (BGS), for rating the subsidence risk ofindividual properties.  The computerised system - known as the GeoHazard Susceptibility Package 2 (GHASP 2) - is based on the BGS's1:10,000-scale geological maps, the most detailed information on geohazards available across the UK.  It enables the underwriter topinpoint the precise bedrock beneath individual properties, even wheresituated close to other properties.Hiscox says that the system represents a major advance on other currentmethods of assessing subsidence risk, which are based just on the firstthree or four digits of a postcode and give only the average risk forgroups of several hundred homes.  It claims that use of GHASP 2 willlead to premium savings of up to 60% for existing policyholders withlower risk properties that are currently included within higher riskpostcodes, and even bigger reduction for policyholders moving to theunderwriter from other insurers.The new rating system is being applied to the underwriter's 606 HighValue House and Contents Policy and will be used in particular to rateproperties in southern England, where many postcodes are susceptiblelocally to a wide variety of geo hazards.Back to Headline List CopyrightPERSONAL POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996RIAS DISCOUNTSThe Retirement Insurance Advisory Service (RIAS) is giving discounts ofup to 15% to customers taking out a joint contents and buildings policyas part of the RIAS Home Insurance Plan.

Recent legal developments have introduced the useof actuarial evidence in determining multipliers and the adoption of adiscount rate linked to the yield of index linked governmentsecurities.  These combined factors will have an enormous impact uponthe claims burden falling to UK motor insurers and reinsurers, says theinsurer.Relevant developments are the production of the "Ogden" tables and theCivil Evidence bill in October 1995 which permits courts to adopt Ogdenmultipliers in the assessment of personal injury damages in all futurecases brought before them.  This means that if a personal injury claimfor an accident that occurred in, say, 1988 now comes before the court,Ogden multipliers may be applied to the assessment of that claim.It has been estimated that these new multipliers will produce a generalincrease in claims of between 15% and 25% but could be as high as 50%.Not all claims will be affected but plaintiff solicitors are currentlypleading Ogden level multipliers in approximately 10% of all cases.This percentage is sure to rise very quickly, warns Insurance (GB), asotherwise there could be implications for solicitors' E&O policies.The insurer states that the overall effect will be an increase ininsurers' reserves for outstanding claims, which will be seen in manyreinsurance programmes now under negotiation as well as those in thefuture.  As the introduction is retrospective, the 1996 revenue yearwill see adverse developments due to increased reserves on prior yearclaims.Significant effects are already being shown on quotations forreinsurance for 1996.  Insurance (GB) concludes that these increases,coupled with the deterioration in claims reserves, will almostcertainly force appreciable premium increases on the industry earlythis year.Back to Headline List CopyrightPERSONAL POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996WORST EUROPEAN RECORD FOR CAR CRIMEBritish motorists are at much greater risk of having their cars stolenthan drivers in the rest of Europe, according to the second annualEuropean Car Crime study by Eagle Star.  The study, compiled from thelatest EU government and insurance organisation statistics, comparedthe number of cars stolen in 1994 in each country with the total numberof cars in use.The UK has by far the worst record for car crime, with an average of 22cars per thousand on the road stolen in 1994.  That is nearly doublethe level in the next worst country, France, where 12.5 cars perthousand were stolen in 1994.  The study found that car theft is lowestin Austria where less than two cars per thousand were stolen in 1994.The next most secure country was Switzerland, where just three perthousand cars went missing.Overall, a lower proportion of cars were stolen in 1994 than in 1993.The European average fell from 11.7 thefts per thousand cars to 9.7.In the UK, the proportion was down from 29 to 22 per thousand.Back to Headline List CopyrightPERSONAL POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996COMBATING CAR "RINGERS"A Code of Practice for the Disposal of Motor Vehicle Salvage has beenproduced by the Association of British Insurers and Lloyd's MotorUnderwriters' Association to help eliminate the practice of "ringing",whereby the identity of a written-off vehicle is transferred to astolen vehicle by criminals.  The Code sets out the steps to be takenby insurers and salvage dealers in the disposal of vehicles whichcannot be economically or safely repaired.All total loss vehicles are placed into one of four categories,depending on the extent of the damage, with the necessary action to betaken in each case.  Vehicles in Category A are suitable for scraponly; Category B should be broken for spare parts.

Absolute Software monitors the location of itscustomer's computers using CompuTrace, a software program which isundetectable once it is loaded onto the hard drive of the computer.The program takes control of the computer's modem once a week, turnsthe modem's speakers off and then secretly dials Absolute Software'stoll-free monitoring centre where the call is logged.If a computer is lost or stolen, the customer contacts the CompuTraceTheft Retrieval Centre to report the incident.  Once the theft isreported, the customer's account is changed to alert status, so thatthe call will be traced.  If a thief connects the stolen computer'smodem to a telephone line, when CompuTrace makes its scheduled call,the Theft Retrieval Centre tracks the call using advanced equipmentthat cannot be interfered with by call-blocking methods.CompuTrace does not disrupt work while it makes a call.  If the modemis in use or disconnected, the system waits until a telephone line isopen or connected.  It does not show up in the file directory, and willsurvive even if the hard disk is formatted.  CompuTrace works with anyDOS or Windows 3.1 based computer as long as it is equipped with amodem.

The state senate is controlled by a liberal Democrat,Bill Lockyer of Hayward. There is a very significant election - from alegislative standpoint -coming up this fall. And so the California workers'comp insurance lobby is taking a reality check on the chances of any importantbills being passed this year.The general thinking is that any significant improvements in the system have abetter chance of coming from new or improved regulations that implemented orshould have implemented reforms passed in 1989, 1990 and 1993.One lobbyist told the Executive,"I don't think public policymakers feel theneed to do any major workers' comp reform. So efforts at improving theworkers' comp system should be viewed as: What can we do? What can enough ofthe stakeholders agree to so that they can put something on Wilson's desk?"Other lobbyists agreed that major reforms are unlikely, but that some cleanupbills from last year are a possibility. Assemblyman David Knowles,R-Placerville, has informed the lobby that he is interested in the permanentpartial disability issue and looking at ways to legislatively enact theAmerican Medical Association guidelines as the impairment rating system.The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation reportedly isconsidering a study on the schedule to determine whether or not it has a majorimpact on the cost of workers' comp and whether or not it adequatelycompensates the injured worker, says Barry Carmody, president of theAssociation of California Insurance Companies.According to Mark Webb, senior counsel for the Coalition of CaliforniaCompensation Companies, the assembly-man's exposure PPD draft, that is makingthe rounds, would also make some significant revisions to the med-legalprocess. While the measure is gaining support by the day, Webb feels it isalso the type of bill that would likely face difficulty getting passed thisyear.At the top of the list of 1996 legislative goals for the Alliance of AmericanInsurers happens to be an effort to pass two of their bills from 1995 - AB1046 and AB 1859."What they have in common," says Pete Gorman, assistant vice president of theAlliance, "is that they reduce the discretionary authority of the Departmentof Industrial Relations. One (AB 1046) brings them in under the OAL (Office ofAdministrative Law). The other prohibits them from assigning out the lienservice process."A second top priority item for the Alliance is one that is on everyone's hitlist, effective action on the Tricor v. State Fund case."I don't think the bureau's (WCIRB) weighting scheme (frequency basedexperience modifications) does it," says Gorman. "It just flies in the face ofevery traditional way of developing X-Mods."Gorman is also leery of a proposal to give the insurance commissioneradministrative authority to review disputes before they went to litigation."We don't agree with that approach," he says. "I think it's too bureaucratic.And the cost-benefit probably isn't there. What we may do...It seems to me tobe much easier just to run a bill that declares legislative intent thatelevates the standard for litigation from one of injury to one of bad faith."He explains that an aggrieved employer would have to demonstrate that aworkers' comp carrier had taken a certain action in bad faith in order to haveit actionable. As it is now, he says, the employer can say unintentional orintentional, "we suffered an injury and so therefore we can sue."Gorman says, "So just raise the bar on where you can sue. That would be a muchbetter way to do this, because I don't think the legislature ever intendedthis consequence of Tricor. They wanted only to give employers access to thefiles." A third Alliance legislative goal is an updated medical fee schedule."We've already filed a letter saying we think it's going to end up being afloor instead of a ceiling," Gorman fears. "And for small companies, we'replaced at a disadvantage. We don't have the leverage and the bargaining powerto get it down below that floor, whereas the big companies do."The American Insurance Association has a list of specific issues on which itwould like to see action taken during 1996. Terry Miller, assistant vicepresident, expresses concern over one of the first issues that needs to bedealt with, the hospital fee schedule proposed by the Division of Workers'Compensation."The AIA says we should postpone it," Miller relates. "We believe there iscurrently insufficient information to accurately gauge the impact of theschedule on workers' comp hospital costs."Miller also notes that there appears to be no hospital fee schedule anywherein the US that is widely supported as THE model.The AIA is also involved with PPD and the benefits of permanent partialdisability. It is working on a PPD bill but that the effort is in a veryembryonic stage at this point. Miller said that there were several bills onthe subject being floated around for comment.A third key issue for the AIA is fraud. Miller says that the AIA has beendiscussing the subject with the Department of Insurance "because it wants somefraud legislation." Exactly what it should be, how broad it should be andwhether it should be geared just to workers' comp is still not determined.Given the possibility of legislative gridlock, Webb of the CCCC sees theprincipal focus for the year should be on reviewing all that's been put inplace over the last five years and seeing "what we can do with Casey Young,Chip Aubrey and Chuck Quackenbush to make at least the best world we can withwhat we have to deal with."It's no surprise that Tricor is on CCCC's list, and Webb says, "We will workclosely with the California Workers' Compensation Institute and see what typesof things can be done to, at least, bring it into sharper focus - what thecourts need to look at in dealing with these types of bad faith lawsuits.."Back to Headline List CopyrightWORKERS' COMP EXECUTIVE via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996CARRIERS PLAN TO FOCUS ON MAKING REGS MORE EFFECTIVE (PART 2)Webb said that he felt it was significant that the CWCI board in Decemberdecided to "take a step back" on any actions toward Tricor. The question theyhad in mind was whether or not there would be any more such suits once thesystem had completely shifted to competitive rating. The practices that hadcome under fire in Tricor were a phenomenon of the minimum rate law era soonto be in the dim and distant past.Webb adds, "At the same time, let's look at ways that insurance cases can bebetter made in the courts so that potentially we don't have 12 jurors suddenlybecoming claims managers."The CCCC plans to present testimony on the permanent disability schedule tothe Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation at its hearingon January 18 in Los Angeles. The hearing should be a packed house.Webb says the association will then look at vehicles currently in place,including Senator Steve Peace's SB 622 which was designed last year to makethe Chula Vista Democrat's 1993 health care organization law more effective.The CCCC has been working with the California Association of HMOs to invent anoncontroversial means for implementing managed care in a more effective way.Webb notes that it's a task that's easier said than done."If we have some good treatment guidelines promulgated by the IndustrialMedical Council (and we're able) to combine those with...good utilization dataguidelines already in place, we may be able to get somewhere," Webb reasons."And that goes back to saying we need to get 1989, 90 and 93 implementedbefore we can come back (to the legislature) and say this doesn't work."In order to make the HCO process work, there will have to be changes in thestructural flaws - "multiple offerings, the multiple time frame, the abilityto opt out," Webb observes. They make it difficult for a capitated arrangementto work. "All those are reasons why it has not received much of a response inthe marketplace."But the point Webb wanted to stress was that there were other medical costcontainment devices that were put in place in 1993, "that aren't there, thataren't being done right now." Webb says, "That goes back to the IMC andtreatment guidelines which could make managed care work even better under just30-day control. And we're seeing a lot of managed care marketing using that30-day control."The ACIC's Carmody wants to champion a review of regulations. "There are justtoo many regulations," says Carmody, "that cost too much money and that don'tprovide any additional services to workers, attorneys, insurers or anybodyelse." The way to get the ball rolling, he suggests is to get all of thestakeholders to ask the questions: "Why am I getting this report? Why am Iproducing this report? Why do I have to have this report?"He said you need to take the reporting alone, forgetting the conduct ofbusiness, and evaluate what is really critical and essential, and what is not.Then you make recommendations to the administration "saying we think theseregulations, these records, this material required by regulation isunnecessary, and it's a cost-driver. And let the administration make adecision on whether it wants to repeal the regs or not."Carmody observes that it doesn't mean the regulations are going to be changedautomatically but it does mean that those being regulated will have theopportunity to provide their perspective on the value of the regulations."The governor basically called for this," Carmody notes. "He called for allagencies to review their regs. The problem is the agencies do it alone. Theydo it in a vacuum, a bureaucratic one in which they decide what is right andwrong, or what is good and bad for the regulated public."Carmody emphatically adds, "Frankly, they're not elected. And the public oughtto have some input on whether or not these regulations are needed."The ACIC president feels there are kindred souls out there who aren't fond ofall the reports they have to fill out and submit to bureaucrats."I remember after the '89 and '93 reforms, the moaning from all of theattorneys about all the paper one has to go through. And all of the reportsthat are thrown in the trash can because their workers don't understand them,"Carmody said. "Perhaps the benefit notices report process is the mostludicrous of them all. They started out at about 15 and are up to 150 now.Why? Why!"Back to Headline List CopyrightWORKERS' COMP EXECUTIVE via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996AIA, CCCC CONFIRM W/C EXEMPTION FROM 1995'S EXPERT WIITNESS LAWSACRAMENTO - An opinion by the California Legislative Counsel has put smileson the faces of more than just a few members of the workers' comp insurancecommunity in California.The Counsel has determined that legislation passed last year does not subjectemployers and insurers to additional expert witness fees in cases before theWorkers' Compensation Appeals Board. The legislation, AB 1204, was stronglyopposed by several company trade associations which requested the governor toveto. He didn't.Once the measure was chaptered, representatives from the American InsuranceAssociation and the Coalition of California Compensation Companies jointlyrequested that Assemblyman David Knowles (R-Placerville), chairman of theAssembly Insurance Committee, seek a Counsel clarification on whether the lawresulting from passage of AB 1204 applied to workers' comp."This opinion puts to rest any question about the testimony of medicalwitnesses in workers' compensation cases," said Terry Miller, AIA assistantvice president, western region. "It is clear that the director of the Divisionof Workers' Compensation has the authority for setting witness fees byestablishing a medical-legal fee schedule."The Legislative Counsel's opinion specifically states: "The fees for witnessesproviding medical testimony before the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board orin other workers' compensation proceedings are not affected by the amendmentsto Section 1034 of the Code of Civil Procedure enacted by Chapter 797 of theStatutes of 1995 (AB 1204)."Miller explained, "The expert witness fee is exactly the kind of hidden costthat we sought to eliminate with the 1993 reforms.

Most do not take effect until February, well after the competitiveJanuary renewals. The loss ratio debacle predicted by all in the early days ofopen rating seems to be in the offing, albeit fairly well covered up.With premiums down some 22 percent and pure loss ratios being reported at 60percent the actual combined loss ratios we will see - after development - willprove this year mighty unprofitable for many carriers. Will combined ratios bereported in the 130s to 150s like so many pundits predicted? Nope, they willnot be reported in this year's results. But they will develop.According to the Compline rate analysts (actually they can also be calledrate-icidal maniacs because they seem to actually enjoy the monitoring of thisstuff) there have been some significant changes in the rate basis from manycarriers. Here is a brief recap.Fremont Group filed a 33.2% increase and re-calculated its own rates again.State Compensation Insurance Fund increased manual rates 8% resulting in a6.8% increase in collectable premium. SCIF is maintaining its current premiumdiscounts. Allianz Insurance is adding a 24-hour pilot program and taking a 4%increase. Fairmont/TIG Insurance filed a 14.7% increase in rates. CitationInsurance has taken a 9.3% increase. National American Insurance Company ofCalifornia is maintaining its '95 rates but dropped its split rating which wasbased upon EAP over or under $10,000. Great States Insurance, a unit of FHP,has instituted an 11% rate increase. Liberty Mutual Insurance Group filedincreases of from 9.7 to 15.2 percent depending upon the company. Safeco hasprovided for an 11.3% increase, although it is using the same multipliers aslast year. Golden Eagle Insurance calculated a change of 10.782% andrecalculated its own rates again.

Additional assets to be sold off have yet to bedecided, with sales to take place over the next four to five years.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD CORPORATE INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996HAWKPhilip Singer and Chris Hughes of Coopers & Lybrand have been appointedjoint provisional liquidators of Hawk Insurance Co Ltd, London, by theHigh Court on the company's own winding-up petition.  Hawk, asubsidiary of Al-Ahleia Insurance Co SAK, Safat, ceased underwriting in1976 and has been in run-off since.

It has signed a wide-ranging co-operation deal with Citibank Privatkunden AG and Citicorp DeutschlandAG and, with effect from 1 January, took over the German insuranceoperations of Citibank, Citi Lebensversicherung AG and CitiVersicherung AG, both Dusseldorf.  It acquired TransatlantischeLebensversicherungs-AG (Transleben), Hamburg, in December from LloydsAbbey Life plc, Weybridge, which it will merge with its own lifecompany, HDI Lebensversicherung AG.  However, the company's lifebusiness itself will be moved away from that company into a new,Hamburg-based life insurer, leaving HDI Leben as an empty shell with aconsiderable tax-loss to carry forward.  HDI Leben will be renamed andconverted into a sub-holding under the parent HDI VVaG, and into whichall operational insurance interests outside the actual HDI VVaG will bebundled, including those of reinsurer Hannover Ruckversicherung AG,Hanover, and its subsidiary Eisen und Stahl Ruckversicherung AG.Such a setup (parental mutuals, sub-holding for other interests) is theclassic model for a "Gleichordnungskonzern", a group formed of twomutuals which cannot formally merge.  The group is then held togetherby a joint management for both, and by stakes in the sub-holding, intowhich the mutuals bring their non-mutualised insurance business.  MrBaumgartl does not deny that this could be a model and although he saysthat there are "no current talks going on", it seems likely that such amove towards an alliance with a life mutual would not be unwelcome tohim.Following the signing of the deal with Citibank, Mr Baumgartl said that"In order to be a global player on the life market, you need premiumincome of about DM2bn" (US$1.4bn).  His present life companies are farshort of that: to 30 November, Citi Leben reported premium income ofDM322m for 1995, so the total for the year will be below DM400m.Transleben reported DM216m for 1994, and the 1995 total is likely to bebelow DM300m.  HDI's own life company is still struggling with theproblems of being relatively new, and premium income will total onlyDM36m. Together, therefore, the whole HDI life group will write notmore than DM650m - and it is difficult to see where HDI will gain theDM2bn it is seeking, if Mr Baumgartl does not have a major partnershipup his sleeve.The deal with Citibank was not surprising, and aimed as much at volumeas the sales channels offered by the two companies.  Citi Leben has atotal life portfolio of DM16.7bn and Citi Versicherung gross premium ofDM23.5m.  The former Citibank insurers will continue as companies intheir own right, and will change their names to CiV LebensversicherungAG and CiV Versicherung AG.  Product names like "Citi Leben Plus 4"will also remain unchanged, and policies will continue to be soldexclusively through the sales channels of Citibank Privatkunden.  Thosechannels - reaching at present about 2.5m customers - were of keyimportance for HDI, Mr Baumgartl stressed.  "That is why we were onlyinterested in an exclusive and long-term cooperation with Citibank.Without Citibank's salesforce, the two insurers would be of no valuefor us!" he said, adding that by co-operating with Citibank, HDI hadcompleted its range of distribution channels.  HDI had no interest inbecoming an Allfinanz group, Mr Baumgartl said.HDI will sell banking products exclusively for Citibank, and in returnCitibank will only offer CiV and other HDI policies in the insurancesector.  Mr Baumgartl said that there would be no assimilation betweenthe Citi and HDI products.  "The CiV products will remain tailor-madefor Citibank's demands," he saidAccording to Mr Baumgartl, HDI's moves to strengthen its life businesswere needed to counterbalance the sharp swings in the profits of theindustrial, motor and portfolios which were the group's major lines ofbusiness.  "What we need is the broad private life business with arelatively balanced development," he said.The HDI deal with Lloyds Abbey Life was also confirmed in December, ata price of about DM110m, according to sources at Lloyds Abbey Life.The company has life business in force of about DM7.2bn.  For 1995, thecompany again forecasts losses, although the expected DM7m is a strongimprovement over the DM11m loss in 1994.  Transleben, whichconcentrates on broker-produced business, has suffered from highcancellation ratios.  In 1992, it began a reorganisation, including adrastic restructuring of its sales network.  HDI said that its 1995premium income rose 9% from DM2.78bn to DM3.03bn, with motor being themain earner, up by 140,000 risks to 1.8m at the year-end, and givingHDI a market share of 4% - one of the winners in the present price war. 1995 motor results had been excellent, but following massive pricecuts, an underwriting loss was likely for 1996.  Industrial fire, too,was suffering from weaker prices, board member Gunter Wager said.HDI officials confirmed that the company is one of four insurersbidding for the business acquired by the UK's Automobile Association(AA) from its members, more than 1m policies a year. Originally, HDIhad been the only bidder.  They also indicated that the acquisition ofa small insurer in Italy was likely soon, but did not specify anycandidate.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD CORPORATE INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996INDEPENDENT/LA PALATINEAachener und Munchener Beteiligungs-AG, Aachen, has finally managed torid itself of La Palatine Assurance SA, Suresnes, the source of muchdistress for another of its more recent disposals, AachenerRuckversicherungs-Ges AG (Aachen Re), Aachen.

Liquidators are suing, among otherthings, over property deals which were allegedly sometimes approved bythe boards in retrospect, and sometimes with not all board memberspresent at crucial meetings.  Further suits could follow concerningevents in 1993 and 1994, and these could raise the claims to FM1bn.One matter awaiting clarification is the disappearance of FM700m in thesummer of 1993, without the authorisation of the board.Seven of the Kansa companies have been the subject of extraordinaryaudits and all of them are nearly complete.  The administrators haveasked some of the larger creditors for comments, which are expectedthis month, but should not change the assessment of management'sresponsibilities.

Motor claims cost itRs1,950m.  Chairman KC Mittal said that although there was anunderwriting loss of Rs1,307.9m for the year after a profit of Rs118.5min 1993-4, this was essentially due to provisions for motor TPL claimsof Rs5,040m on 21 March 1995, compared with Rs2,730m int he previousyear, and resulting from changes to the Motor Vehicles Act and a trendtowards higher awards by claims tribunals.

Ceo Lars Thunell believes that Swedish insurersface tough competition from niche and foreign companies, and to survivemust halve their costs.  His method will be to double income whileholding expenses unchanged.  To achieve this, Mr Thunell plans newdistribution channels, simplifying products, improving services tolarger customers, as well as international expansion.  For the non-lifemarket the watchwords will be simplification and standardised products. Mr Thunell was resigned to slow progress at home, "nibbling half apercent a year" in Sweden.  In addition, non-life products wouldincreasingly be sold by telephone and over the Internet, which shouldallow penetration into Finland and Norway.  Slightly further afield, MrThunell believed that the future markets were in the Baltic area.Many of the lucrative opportunities were in the life market, he said,as cutbacks in Sweden's social security and pension system opened theway for new products combining savings and insurance.  This was afurther reason for the joint stock company (Trygg-Hansa AB)strengthening its grip on Trygg-Hansa Liv (WICR177/18, 178/23, 183/22). A major step towards this consolidation was taken when the shareholderagreement between SPP and Trygg-Hansa Liv was dissolved in lateDecember (WICR183/22).  This agreement involved Trygg-Hansa Liv and SPPundertaking not to sell shares to third parties before the year 2000,and thereafter offering first refusal to the other until 2010.This paved the way for Trygg-Hansa Liv to pay SK626.5m (US$94.7m) tobuy 632,000 A shares and 5m B shares of Trygg Hansa AB from SPP.Together with its existing holding of 19.4% of capital and 28.1% ofvotes, this will give Trygg-Hansa Liv all of the 2m A shares in Trygg-Hansa AB, and leave it with 26.2% of the capital in the company and39.2% of the votes.  Trygg-Hansa Liv's chairman Gosta Wiking indicatedthat the life company did not intend to take up any more Trygg-Hansa ABshares, so that the outstanding packets were large enough to beattractive to other institutional investors.SPP still holds 16,447,512 B shares in Trygg Hansa AB, which have amarket value of around SK1.8bn at a market price of around SK110 ashare.  SPP has already adjusted these to SK98 per share on its balancesheet (from SK 80), and a substantial proportion is likely to be sold.The 16.44m shares represent 19.9% of Trygg-Hansa AB's capital and 16.3%of the votes.

Theproposals, if approved by all members of the group, will be adopted forthe policy year commencing 20 February.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD CORPORATE INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996WEST OF ENGLANDThe West of England Ship Owners Mutual Insurance Association(Luxembourg) has warned that an "even greater level of self-insuranceis the only option" for members of the International Group ifuncertainty surrounding the future of the Lloyd's market continues andno viable alternative is found.  In its annual review for 1995 the clubsaid that concerns remained about the International Group's heavydependence upon Lloyd's, which still writes up to 80% of the combinedlayer of the International Group's reinsurance contract.  While therehad been "some optimism during recent months that Lloyd's would berestructured", delays in Equitas meant that there was continuinguncertainty over the future of the leading reinsurer for the club andthe Group and the prospect that "even greater levels of risk will haveto be retained within the industry", it said.P&I providers could not expect to be immune from the type of litigationthat has "so bedevilled" the Lloyd's market over the past few years.One way to prevent or defeat such litigation was for a club'sunderwriters and committee to have a basic underwriting plan whichanalysed potential exposure, laid down a policy to limit that exposureacceptable to its members and then communicated that policy to them.The club said that "unless and until the International Group introducesa realistic limit on cover, a major overspill claim would inevitablylead to litigation."  While the International Group had recognised theneed for limiting catastrophe liability calls to an "economicallycollectable" level, its intention to have that level determined by anindependent expert after an event was troubling.  The club suggestedthat a glance at the Lloyd's experience of trying to collect moniesowed from names would provide a "salutary lesson" to the InternationalGroup about such a course.Another challenge lay in the International Group's own Poolingarrangements.  Since the individual club retention had increasedsubstantially in recent years from $1.2m per loss in 1989 to $5m in1995, it was possible that the pattern of development of incurred poolclaims data will be different to that of the 1980s.  Whereas a claimfor $900,000 would have taken less time to appear in the pool, in 1995a significant loss might take much longer to develop to the point whereit will concern the pool.  Claims information may therefore appearunnecessarily optimistic.  The West of England concluded that "timealone will tell", but urged club underwriters to take measures toensure that any negative impact may be minimalised.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD CORPORATE INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996COLONIA LEBENColonia Lebensversicherung AG (CL), Cologne, is set to turn itsDeutsche Crzte-Versicherung (DCV) branch operation into a company inits own right.  According to its chairman, Carl Hermann Schleifer, CLwas currently discussing the legal and fiscal aspects of theseparation.  "By carrying out the spin-off, we break new ground," DrSchleifer said.  DCV will receive one-third of CL's existing portfolio,which totalled DM62.5bn (US$43bn) at the end of 1995.  Dr Schleifer wasconfident that a satisfactory solution would be found by this Spring,and that DCV will then be turned into a separate joint stock companyretroactively from 1 January.  One major problem seems to be the offerthat has to be made to independent CL shareholders.It is expected that DCV will eventually seek close co-operation withDeutsche Apotheker-und Crztebank, Dusseldorf, the specialised bank forthe medical professions.  The small property and casualty unit DeutscheCrzte-Versicherung Allgemeine AG, Cologne, which is alreadyindependent, would not be affected by the separation.Dr Schleifer, who also heads Nordstern Lebensversicherungs-AG andprivate health insurer Colonia Krankenversicherung AG, also announcedanother project of holding company CKAG Colonia Konzern AG,establishment of a specialised consultancy and sales organisation toconcentrate on investments for customers over the age of 45.  A salesforce was currently being recruited in the banking sector who would notonly sell CKAG life insurance, but also funds, investment certificatesand other products.  Dr Schleifer said that former majority ownerBankhaus Sal Oppenheim would certainly be a co-operation partner forthe new project, but that CKAG was also negotiating with other banks.He added that the new organisation was one step in CKAG's strategy ofaiming at a new target group, the generation of the "young elderly".Dr Schleifer displayed optimism regarding the prospects of lifebusiness in Germany.  In his view life insurers would again benefitfrom an improved economic environment and record growth in new businessin 1996.  He expects new business for both companies to rise by about7% in 1996.  One major factor for the upturn would be the estimatedrise in the purchasing power of German consumers, which was expected tobe up by DM11bn (US$7.65bn) on 1995.  Germans were becomingincreasingly aware of the value of life policies as a provision fortheir old age, Dr Schleifer said, adding that German life insurers hadnot felt any effect from foreign competitors offering life policies inthe German market hitherto.  In his view, European Monetary Union wouldbring no disadvantages for German insureds.In 1995, Colonia Lebensversicherung AG (CL) suffered an 8.7% decline innew business to DM7.5bn in sums insured.  "The market as a wholeanticipates a 13% fall in new business, so Colonia held firm and gainedmarket share," Dr Schleifer said.  He expected premium income for theyear to rise by 5.2% to DM1.9bn.  The cancellation ratio deterioratedby 0.1 points to 4.7%, "but is still markedly below the market averageof above 6%", he said.  Sales by pyramid-sales company Proventus AG,Bremen, accounted for less than 10% of newly sold business.  Theorganisation did particularly well in selling private health cover ineastern Germany.  "Overall, we are very satisfied with this saleschannel," Dr Schleifer said.CL's cost ratio improved from 3.8% to 3.7%, mainly as a result of themerger of the Colonia and Nordstern back-offices.  Dr Schleiferexpected a gross profit of DM593m for Colonia Life, up 4.4%.  Sistercompany Nordstern Leben (NL) will outperform the rest of the market in1995, the ceo said.  It maintained new business at the 1994 level, withDM4.7bn in sums insured.  Premium income was expected to rise by 14% toDM1.4bn, compared with an average growth of 7% in the German market,although the cancellation ratio worsened from 3.7% to 4.3%.

A joint communiquestressed that auditors had found that there were no significantdifferences in the financial situations of the companies, a movedesigned to quash doubts over the soundness of the financial positionof Elake-Varma.According to unofficial reports, one bone of contention was that Elake-Varma wanted to assume a 10% future yield on shares, which othersconsidered unrealistic.

Consequently, there was some incredulity when the companyannounced that the surplus of its insurance and investment activitieswould increase from around FM40m (US$9.2m) for 1994 to nearly FM270m.Elake-Varma managing director Paavo Pitkanen declined to speculatewhether another attempt to reorganise the two companies would be made,while Elake-Sampo managing director Risto Kausto considered the matterclosed.The other merger within the Sampo group, that of Kaleva MutualInsurance Co., Helsinki, and Nova Life Insurance Co Ltd, Helsinki, isto proceed.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD CORPORATE INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996R+VGermany's highest administrative court Bundesverwaltungsgericht inBerlin, has issued an important ruling affecting demutualisation in thecountry.  The court said that the German insurance supervisionBundesaufsichtsamt fur das Versicherungswesen (BAV), Berlin, had actedcorrectly when it allowed the 1989 transfer of the life portfolio fromthe mutual R+V Lebensversicherungsverein aG to the joint stock companyR+V Lebensversicherung AG, Wiesbaden.Several insureds of the old mutual had taken legal action against BAV,complaining that the compensation paid to members was too low and didnot take the hidden reserves of the mutual adequately into account.  Atthat time, a total of DM218m (US$152m) was paid to members tocompensate for their loss of that status.  The plaintiffs argued thatthe hidden reserves totalled "a multiple" of that sum.The court said that the BAV had taken sufficient care of the interestsof policyholders.  The legal and effective material situation of theplaintiffs had not been worsened to a noteworthy degree.  As far asthey had suffered losses at all, they had been compensated.  Thetransfer of the portfolio was no reason to dissolve the hiddenreserves.  The BAV's agreement to the deal did not prevent members fromsuing for higher compensation.The judgement is of considerable importance because it eases thetransformation from mutuals to joint stock companies.  Many mutualssuffer from inadequate equity, and must increase capital throughprofits.  The EU directive on the solvency of insurance groups which isin preparation would aggravate the problem for life mutuals, asreserves for premium repayments to policyholders would no longer countas equity.Back to Headline List WT03-B03-4IA086-000615-B045-11http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/in14.html 205.156.212.5 19970122021320 text/html 78756HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:11:14 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:30 GMTContent-length: 78569Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/in14.html Sample Issue Copyright WORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNet January 12, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES EURO THOUGHTS (765 words) PUBLICATIONS REVIEW SWISS RE ON SOLVENCY (938 words) ROI IMPROVED (673 words) STATE REINSURER, NEW COMPANIES (249 words) NEW LIFE INSURER FOR THOSE RESETTLED BY DAM PROJECT (141 words) NINE FOREIGN APPLICANTS (143 words) CCI ON MARKET REFORM (243 words) MINIMUM CAPITAL INCREASED (160 words) MOTOR POOL PROPOSED (177 words) MOTOR THEFT ESCALATING (213 words) EARTHQUAKE LIMIT RAISED (170 words) GLASS-STEAGALL AMENDMENTS CLOSE TO VOTE (185 words) PEOPLE'S BANKCORP GRANTED INSURANCE LICENCE (84 words) NEWS NEW LAW IMMINENT (47 words) AMENDED LAW IN FORCE (255 words) NEW SUPERVISION COMMISSION (179 words) MORE CATS, LOSSES LOWER (330 words) DISASTERS BILL UNDER FIRE (281 words) WINDSTORM MARKET ASSISTANCE PROPOSAL (87 words) STORM INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO RISE (141 words) TAX BREAK "CRITICAL" FOR EQ PLAN (252 words) "FAIR TORRENT" OF SNOW CLAIMS (345 words) BUILDING CODE PROPOSED (285 words) 1996 CAPACITY (95 words) IN THE COURTS (272 words) LLOYD'S INVESTMENT TRUSTS RULING (53 words) LLOYD'S TO SCRAP HARDSHIP SCHEME (59 words) LLOYD'S OF LONDON PRESS SOLD IN MANAGEMENT BUYOUT (38 words) VETO TO BE OVERTURNED?

Allstudies have reached the same conclusion: most of the costs generatedby the move to the single currency will occur during the preparatoryphase whereas the majority of benefits will only appear after theimplementation of the single currency, the Comite Europeen desAssurances (CEA) said in a preliminary commentary.  There is thereforea real economic interest in limiting the transitional period for themove from one system to the other, while allowing the necessary timefor adaptation, it said.Recurrent monetary crises in Europe over the last three years, havelargely shown that despite the EMS, Europe regularly suffers fromunbridled speculation aimed in particular at weaker currencies.  Thecreation of a single currency in Europe would in theory be one solutionto such attacks and the only one capable in limiting such destabilizingbehaviour.  That participating states should meet on a sustainablebasis the criteria of convergence born when they join and in future isa sine qua non for the success of the process but not insufficient initself, the CEA concluded.Although technical differences exist between life and non-lifeinsurance, globally the prospect of monetary stability in Europe isvery much in the interest of insurance, especially life insurance.  Thereinforcement of monetary stability should achieve a fall in long-terminterest rates and greater confidence by the public in the singlecurrency which should, eventually, gain status as a reserve currencylike the dollar.  An end to exchange rate manipulation, thedisappearance of exchange rate risks between member states and theoptimum allocation of financial resources permitted by a singlecurrency were particularly important for European insurers as they maynow invest assets anywhere in the European Economic Area, the CEA said. A more favourable business climate should result and European insurerswould also be able to propose contracts in a single currency to clientsoutside the EU.At a micro-economic level, a single currency will reduce the cost oftransactions and bank transfers to insurers and make for better pricecomparability and improve the quality of service offered.Supplementary costs would be incurred because of modification ofcomputer programmes and financial management systems, re-denominationof policies and other documents and some staff reorganisation.Although the CEA found it probable that these changes will eventuallybring about gains in productivity and competitiveness, "it isundeniable that they will represent, in the short term, a majoroutlay".  Most insurers, however, would consider these costs asinvestments, if the return on costs incurred was reasonably guaranteedby firm and irrevocable commitments by governments on the continuity ofthe process, it suggested.Among obstacles likely to cause difficulties are the absence of aprecise, detailed timetable or a firm political commitment to conformto it, which creates uncertainty, the CEA said.  Even if commitmentsare given in this respect, insurers fear that insufficient co-ordination of monetary policies, or sudden economic and/or socialdifficulties in one or more states would have disastrous effects on theprocess as a whole.The absence of harmonisation in taxation (as well as in state socialsecurity schemes) could also cause tension and constitute a barrier toexpected developments, the CEA considered.  The problem is the absenceof harmonisation of indirect taxation on savings and co-ordination offiscal provisions on overall assets and benefits.  The CEA raised anumber of issues with members with regard to the Green Paper onmonetary union published at the end of May by the European Commission.The majority of European insurers favours a big bang solution, viewingthe three-year preparation period envisaged in the Green Paper as toolong.  During the transitional period (phase B) a large critical massof business must be undertaken in the single currency.  Undertakingsshould not have to use double accounting during phase B even if theyunderwrite single currency contracts from the start of 1999, the CEAstressed.  Only national currencies will still be legal tender duringphase B, but as they will become real substitutes for the singlecurrency, conversion rates into the single currency, fixed irrevocably,must make it possible for an automatic and cost-free move from any onenational currency to the single currency and back.  A Europeandirective was also required to stipulate that the move to the singlecurrency may not in itself be used unilaterally to cancel currentcontracts.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996SWISS RE ON SOLVENCYFinancial security of insurers is increasingly important in theindustry, but higher security has its price because it must beultimately paid for by policyholders and cedants or shareholders,Schweizerische Ruckversicherungs-Ges (Swiss Re) concludes in its latestSigma study*.  "Just as investors are prepared to accept a lower returnon a bond issue with a high rating, so policyholders and cedants mustbe prepared to pay higher premiums to a company with high security,"the study said.Since 1978, 648 non-life insurers worldwide have become insolvent.  Atthe end of the 1970s, the number of insolvencies annually averagedabout 10, but by the 1990s had increased to about 80.  Although in 1994there was a decline to just above 40, it was too early to speak of areversal of the trend, Swiss Re considered.  Two-thirds (66%) of theinsolvencies between 1978 and 1994 involved US companies, while inEurope, UK insurers were most bankruptcy-prone, with 7% of the worldtotal.  Europe excluding the UK accounted for 4% (and at the same timefor 26% of global premium income).  Elsewhere, Bermuda represented 8%of bankruptcies.According to Swiss Re, the causes of insurance insolvencies arecomplex.  In general, bankruptcy is greater in deregulated markets, asthese are exposed to greater fluctuations in premium rates, and theprofitability of the market as a whole tends to be both lower and morevolatile.  The US and UK markets were also adversely affected by highburdens of loss from liability claims and natural disasters.  Prolongedperiods of falling interest rates also probably favour insolvencies, itsaid.  Swiss Re expects that, especially in Europe, deregulation ofinsurance markets and the replacement of material control by financialsupervision will increase competition and insurance market volatility,exacerbating the risk of insolvency.The study also analysed various methods for assessing solvency.  "Takenin isolation, the solvency ratio means little.  The reserves ratio atleast must also be taken into account," Swiss Re said, adding thatgenerally, the use of premium volumes as a measure of exposure to riskswas "problematic".  There were distortions as a result of fluctuatingpremium rates and different portfolio composition, and investment riskswere ignored.  In deregulated markets, insurance supervisionessentially consists of financial supervision, based in the EU onrelatively simple solvency ratios.  In the US, new risk-based capitalapproaches were already being used, under which both underwriting andinvestment risks assumed are quantified and used to determine thenecessary capital.  The study discusses several alternatives, includingsimulation models and Swiss Re's own method of measuring its necessaryrisk-adjusted capital.This it describes as follows.  "The capital requirement is calculatedin accordance with the business risk, that is to say on the basis ofthe probability distribution of the annual operating results.  Thisdistribution is made up of the results distributions of the variouslines of business and of investments.  The individual distributions aredetermined in two stages: firstly, from empirical data from the past, aprobability function of the results is formed which is adjusted bydisregarding exceptional major events.  Secondly, using so-called`threat scenarios' (for the various lines of business and investments),exceptional loss events of the kind which, on the basis of Swiss Re'sportfolio, are to be expected statistically every 10, 20, 50 and 100years are simulated.  The adjusted distributions and the distributionsof the exceptional events are combined to form the resultsdistributions.  From these, the probability distribution of theoperating result is derived, taking account of the most importantcorrelations.  This means that the diversification effects of SwissRe's portfolio are included.  It is most unlikely that extremelyunfavourable events will occur in all regions and lines of business atthe same time, which means that an unfavourable result in one area canbe cushioned by a favourable result in another.The capital required is thus determined by the extent to which theExecutive Board is prepared to take risks.  The Executive Boardstipulates the probability with which, and the period over which, thecompany's financial strength is not to be adversely affected.The risk-adjusted capital determined in this way is then allocated tothe individual lines of business and profit centres on the basis of thevolatility of the results.  This allocation enables the results of thelines of business and profit centres to be measured adequately."Insurers' claims-paying ability is assessed not only by regulators butalso by private rating agencies, of which the best-known are Standard &Poor's, Moody's and AM Best.  Comparing individual agencies' ratingswas not without its problems either, Swiss Re said.  Definitions ofrating categories differed, as did rating procedures, but there was aclearly identifiable tendency for an ever smaller proportion ofinsurers to receive a top rating.  "Best's clearly rates more companiesas `excellent' than do Moody's and Standard & Poor's," Swiss Re said."Moody's is the most cautious in assigning the highest rating," itadded, but of the companies examined, only Standard & Poor's rated someas `vulnerable'.The accuracy of ratings was analysed with AM Best's data, looking atthe rating three years prior to a company's collapse.  Correspondingdata from the other rating agencies were not available.  For most ofthe companies becoming insolvent, the rating had been withdrawn or nonehad been assigned.  Three years before bankruptcy, 45 out of 247insurers had an A rating, and one year before only six.Development of insolvencies and the importance of security in theinsurance industry, Swiss Re sigma 7/1995, Swiss Re, Economic Research,POB, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland.

Catastrophes for 1995are expected to cost about US$8bn, down from $17bn in 1994, althoughHurricane Opal and some lesser storms made 1995 the third worst year onrecord for catastrophe losses, after 1994 and the record $23bn of 1992. Investment income increased by 10.4% in 1995 over 1994.  In 1994, theincrease was an "anaemic" 3.4%, after declines of 1.5% and 3.2% in 1992and 1993.  Interest rates rose in 1994 and remained relatively high inearly 1995, so insurers could invest new funds in higher-yieldingassets.  Record stockmarket highs also generated  increases in capitalgains, while the fall in interest rates in Q3-Q4 1995 added to therealised gains of insurers which sold bonds.  Realised capital gainsincreased to $5bn last year, from $1.7bn in 1994.Overall profitability for 1996 is expected to show further significantgrowth, mainly due to investment income as premium growth is slowed bysevere price competition.  Alan Levin of S&P predicted a combined ratioof 107.9% for 1996, and a continued fall in the quality of earnings asunderwriting losses increase through 1997.  "As a result, we expect tosee even more action in controlling expenses, possibly through moremergers as insurers attack their cost base in order to preserve profitmargins.  With underwriting expenses accounting for approximately 26%of net premium volume, internal expense control becomes the onlyalternative open to insurers as a means for maintaining adequateprofitability," Mr Levin said.A similar conclusion was reached by a study* by the Insurance ServicesOffice Inc (ISO), which measured risk as the variability in return onyear-end net worth for the 20 largest insurers and the 20 largestcompanies in 30 non-property/casualty insurance industry groups,including life/health insurers.  It found that from 1979 to 1993 themedian rate of return for the 20 largest p/c insurers was 9.6%, 1.6points below the average of the corresponding medians for the 20largest companies in each of the non-insurance groups.  It also foundthat insurance was riskier than most non-insurance industries on eachof three measures of variability used to assess risk, total variabilityin rate of return, a variability adjusted for industry cycles and anISO composite index averaging the first two.The number of industry groups more profitable and less risky thaninsurance was about three times the number which were the reverse.Similar results were found when ISO examined all companies in industrygroups, not just the 20 largest.  However, about a quarter ofindividual insurers analysed were superior to the typical company inthe non-insurance industry groups.  The property/casualty industry's10.1% average rate of return during the two insurance cycles for 1978to 1994 also was lower than the corresponding rates of return for fiveout of six key composite indices, including the Standard & Poor's 500and the Standard & Poor's Financials.The study found that stockholder-owned insurers earned higher returns,but faced greater risk than policyholder-owned mutuals.  Commercial-lines insurers have also been more profitable, but faced more risk thanpersonal-lines insurers, and agency companies have been more profitablebut also more risky than direct writers.  The major short-tail propertylines have been more profitable, but also more risky than the majorlong-tail lines, catastrophes increasing the volatility in property andyear-to-year changes in reserve adequacy smoothing results forliability.*Risks and Returns: Property/Casualty Insurance Compared with otherIndustries, ISO.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996STATE REINSURER, NEW COMPANIESYang Wenyou, director of the Administration Department for Foreign FundFinancial Organs of the People's Bank of China, said on 30 Decemberthat a State Reinsurance Company would be established to break themonopoly of the People's Insurance Co of China (PICC), Beijing, whichhe said created unfair competition between the PICC and its potentialcompetitors which was unfavourable for the healthy development of theinsurance market (WIR527/7).  Implementation decrees on the provisionalregulations for the operation of the Insurance Administration and theadministration of agents to supplement the new Insurance Law wereexpected to be issued shortly, he added.On 13 December, approval was announced for a joint venture life insurerto be set up in Shanghai by Manufacturer's Life Insurance Co of Canada(Manulife), Toronto.  Manulife has been present in China for 15 years,and has representative offices in Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chengduand Guangzhou, and has demonstrated its goodwill by funding insuranceand actuarial training schemes as well as contributing to a "Help thePoor" programme in Sichuan.However, in an interview with China Information last month, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said that although China was committed to openingits financial and insurance markets to foreign capital and its socialinsurance system was in its infancy, hurried approval of a large numberof licences for foreign insurers would not necessarily benefit thedevelopment of China's insurance industry.

It favours the opening of themarket to foreign investors, but only through a locally-incorporatedsubsidiary, and preferably in a joint venture with Indian partners.The Malhotra Commission recommendation to restrict the maximumshareholding of the promoter of a new insurance company to 40% may notbe sufficiently attractive to attract investment, the Chamberconsidered, and suggested a higher limit of 75%.  Capital criteria alsoneeded review, it considered, recommending minimum capital of Rs1bn(US$28m) be brought in stages.Privatization of pension funds, with a strong regulatory body, was alsorecommended.  In order to popularise individual pension plans,contributions to prescribed limit should be fully exempted from tax,the Chamber proposed.  For rural business, clear guidelines wererequired given the high acquisition cost, and cross-subsidization wasnecessary, the Chamber said.

Most foreign insurers in the UAE should have no difficultyin meeting the requirement, it added.  According to the EmiratesInsurance Association, 27 of the 46 insurers operating in theFederation are foreign.Under the new legislation, insurers are required to increase theirminimum paid-up capital to Dh25m immediately, and Dh50m by the end ofthe sixth year.  Those unable to do so have the option of merger orclosure.  Some insurers consider that of the 46 currently operating,only about 30 can easily manage the latest increase.  Minimum capitalrequirements have already increased  from Dh7.5m in 1993 to Dh10m in1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996MOTOR POOL PROPOSED- High premium motor insurance has prompted the UAE Ministry of Economyto ask insurers to form a pool for high-risk motor.  A spokesman saidthe proposal was in response to a spate of complaints that someinsurers were demanding premiums of up to 25% of the value of thevehicle.  The Ministry approached the Emirates Insurance Association tostudy the idea in consultation with its members.  "We think this couldbe a reasonable alternative to tackle the problem," the spokesman said.Pool members would provide loss, damage, TPL and passenger liabilitycover for hire cars, the vehicle renter, publicly-operated buses andtrucks of all types - all known high risk category vehicles - and anyother vehicle the pool decided to include.  The spokesman said the poolwould be able to draw on the collective experience of member insurersto fix fair rates meeting the needs of both insurer and insured, aswell as saving legal expenses by pooling costs.  The pool would also beable to arrange excess of loss treaty protection, he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996MOTOR THEFT ESCALATINGFaced with mounting theft losses, Israeli insurers said in Novemberthat motor premiums would have to increase by 7% unless the police tookmeasures to reverse the trend.  One third of total premium volume isconsumed by the costs of large scale organised theft of cars by Israeligangs for resale or cannibalisation in Palestinian autonomous areas.In October, 3,000 cars were stolen according to police figures, thehighest monthly total ever.  The conclusion of the Oslo agreements onPalestinian autonomy resulted in a 44% increase in vehicle thefts inthe first quarter of 1995 compared to the same period in 1994,according to Israel Insurance Companies Association data.  ChairmanRimon Ben-Shaul, in a letter to Premier Shimon Peres, claimed that ifnothing is done, insurers may stop providing cover for theft.Once vehicles disappear into Gaza and other autonomous towns, little isdone to recover them.  Joint Israeli/Palestinian patrols instituted inDecember have reportedly reduced the incidence of thefts of Israelicars destined for resale whole, but theft of vehicles to be broken downand sold as parts has increased.  Palestinian sources suggest that afrequently-practised form of insurance fraud is for Israeli citizens tosell their vehicles to a Palestinian and then report it stolen to thepolice and insurers.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996EARTHQUAKE LIMIT RAISEDSince 1 January, Israelis have been able to buy earthquake insurancefor 100% of the value of their property rather than the former 75%.Awareness of earthquake risk, which has been steadily increasing, washighlighted by the Gulf of Aqaba event in late November (WIR526/13),after which the Knesset Finance Committee sub-committee for insuranceheld a special session to try to formulate new measures.  Premium forearthquake cover has been raised since 1985 from 0.2% to 1.5%, with adeductible of 10%.  A proposal is also under consideration by the sub-committee for establishment of a fund into which all earthquakepremiums would be paid, partly with the intention of saving the cost ofreinsurance abroad, since earthquakes are rare.Meanwhile, following a report that over 60% of Israel's 1.3m householdscarry no home insurance, Isracard, one of Israel's two credit cardcompanies, has decided to offer contents cover to people travellingabroad.

The proposals would permit banks toaffiliate with firms involved in securities operations, and become moreinvolved in insurance activities.  Disputes between representatives ofinsurers and banks have bedevilled the bill, the American Council ofLife Insurance (ACLI) accusing the banks of deliberately preventing acompromise settlement.  At issue are state regulation of bancassuranceactivity and proposed powers for the Comptroller of the Currency toimpose a five-year moratorium on banks' entry into insurance.

The publication of such a list in Septemberappeared to de-register hundreds of insurers, brokers, assessors andsurveyors (WIR523/7).  Some brokers and assessors de-registered at thattime continued to operate with some insurers, Mr Makove said, addingthat the Insurance Commission would continue to enforce licencerequirements.  Insurers should refuse business from unlicensed agents,he added.Of the two insurers "de-listed" in September, Mr Makove said that Co-operative Insurance Service Ltd (CIS), Nairobi, had now met allnecessary requirements.

Foreign-owned insurers will be required to have minimumcapital of USh1bn for life or non-life, USh2bn for composite companiesand USh2.5bn for reinsurance activity.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996MORE CATS, LOSSES LOWERWhile indications have become stronger during 1995 that the graduallychanging world climate is having an effect on the occurrence of naturalcatastrophes, especially floods and windstorms, insurers suffered fewerlosses from such events last year, Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Ges AG,Munich, said in its annual report on catastrophes.  The year 1995 hadprovided a "breathing space for the insurance industry, which has beenhaving to cope with particularly heavy claims burdens from naturalcatastrophes for nearly ten years," it added.The company also drew attention to an important and mainly positive,factor: the long-lasting El Niuo effect, a natural cyclical warming ofthe tropical Pacific, came to an end in 1995.  El Niuo had resulted inextreme drought in Australia and heavy rainfall on the US Pacificcoast, but had also contributed to a reduction of hurricane activity inthe Caribbean.According to Munich Re, the number of events it categorises as naturalcatastrophes rose from 580 in 1994 to about 600 in 1995 which claimed atotal of 18,000 lives, up from 10,150.  In terms of economic losses,1995 was a record year, the total of US$180bn dwarfing the $65bn of1994, the previous worst year.  In 1995, however, insured lossesreached only $14bn, compared to $28bn in 1992 and $17bn in 1994.  Thisresulted from the fact that insurance density in the regions most badlyaffected in 1995 was comparatively low.This applied in particular to what was, in economic terms, the mostexpensive natural catastrophe to date, the Great Hanshin Earthquakewhich struck Kobe on 17 January and caused overall losses of about$100bn.  Although of only medium intensity, it reduced parts of theindustrial and port city to rubble and ashes.  More than 6,000 peoplewere killed and 300,000 left homeless.  Other notable events during1995 were the January floodings of the rivers Rhine, Moselle and Maas,only 13 months after similar occurrences, and tropical windstorms inthe Caribbean, the US and East Asia.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996DISASTERS BILL UNDER FIREAt hearings before the US House Transportation & InfrastructureCommittee's Water Resources & Environment subcommittee at the beginningof December, the proposed Natural Disaster Protection Partnership Actcame under severe criticism by Rep Mike Parker (R-MS) as "a public-sector solution to a private-sector problem".The legislation proposes the establishment of a private sector insurerto provide homeowners' cover and reinsurance in areas at high risk fromnatural disasters.  Mr Parker said that a clause which would permit theentity to borrow from federal government should its reserves bedepleted by a major catastrophe would make the government liable forthe insurance industry's risks.In his testimony to the Committee, Deputy Assistant Secretary of theTreasury Mozelle Thompson recommended an approach combining state-regulated mandatory disaster insurance with a federal reinsuranceprogramme rather than the federal corporation proposed in the Act.  MrThompson feared that the proposed National Disaster Insurance Corpcould develop into a monopoly, placing policyholders at a disadvantage. He said the Clinton administration feared that the Act could exposethe government to unlimited liabilities, and had reservations about thefinancial viability of the scheme.He proposed instead development of "a required phased-in policy" fordwellings for up to four families mortgaged with federally-relatedlenders or secondary issuers, administered by states, together with afederal excess of loss programme through the mechanism of an annualauction of contracts covering a proportion of the loss from a singlenatural disaster, triggered by industry-wide insured losses and with abase price set in line with risk plus a cost of capital adjustment.The programme would be designed to phase itself out between years 15and 20 of operation.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996WINDSTORM MARKET ASSISTANCE PROPOSALActing New Jersey insurance commissioner Elizabeth Randall said sheintended to create a windstorm market assistance programme to improvethe availability of insurance for homeowners on the NJ coast, she toldthe New Jersey Senate judiciary committee.

TheAssociation said that an independent actuarial assessment hadrecommended an average increase of 124%, and that it had incurred aloss in excess of $192m for claims in 1995.  Its rates are currentlysignificantly below those for other residual markets for homeowners inFlorida and in other states, as well as some rates in the privatesector, it said.

This would force the state toconsider other alternatives, such as an involuntary insurance pool, headded.The proposed California Earthquake Authority will have access to fundsof up to US$10.5bn.  The California Insurance Department proposes apremium rate of $3.10 per $1,000 of insured house value.  An initial$1bn in funding for the Authority would be provided by insurers,together with a guarantee of $3bn in the event of claims.  $2bn inreinsurance would be bought in excess of this figure.  Last monthInsurance Commissioner Charles Quackenbush toured Bermuda, London, NewYork and Zurich in search of potential capacity, where reaction wasfavourable, Mr Wiebe said.  Brokers for the reinsurance element will beEW Blanch Holdings Inc.  Losses above $6bn will be covered by an issueof state bonds for $1bn, and a further $1.5bn in bonds placed on theNew York stock market by Morgan Stanley as lead manager, co-managed byBear Stearns and Goldman Sachs.  A further $2bn would be paid by theinsurance industry on a contingency basis, bringing the Authority'stotal capital to $10.5bn.The Insurance Department hopes to deliver an interim report on progressof the plan in the near future, and secure final approval by the end ofMarch.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996"FAIR TORRENT" OF SNOW CLAIMSWhile blizzard conditions brought a white Christmas to Scotland,Northern Ireland, Wales and northern parts of England, the subsequentNew Year thaw has caused estimated damage of #350m (US$545m) accordingto loss adjusters, The Balcome Group, London.  The group's initialestimate of #500m in insured damage was refuted last week by theAssociation of British Insurers (ABI), London.  Share analystsvariously predict the likely eventual cost to UK insurers at about#400m, or #20m to #30m off the net profit of each of the UK composites.UK insurers are receiving a "fair torrent" of claims after this "majorincident", an ABI spokesman told WIR, but insured damage was morelikely to total #100m to #200m rather than #300m to #500m.  It will beseveral weeks before the official ABI estimate is known.  The majorityof claims are expected in Scotland, Northern Ireland and north eastEngland, primarily for household damage following burst pipes,commercial water damage and business interruption.Significant claims are also expected to arise from commercial users ofwater following the failure of water supplies, he added, although somebusinesses would be self-insured or lack appropriate cover and therewould be significant uninsured damage for householders in Scotland.Increased weather damage claims recorded over the past week are stillwithin normal expectations and unlikely to lead to higher premiums,according to UK insurers.  A spokesman for Royal Insurance plc, London,told WIR that an increased number of claims were coming in, but it wastoo early to estimate the total number.  Claims would be concentratedin Scotland and north east of England, unlike in 1991 and the 1980swhen cold weather affected the whole country, he added.  Royal expectsthe greatest number of claims from household damage, but commercialclaims to cost more.  Commercial Union plc, London, said it was tooearly for definite numbers, but claims were likely to be "more thanusual".  As of 3 January, the company had received 1,500 claims.  SunAlliance Group plc, London, said the number of claims would besignificantly "up, not under".Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996BUILDING CODE PROPOSEDInsurers in the Caribbean region have been reminded by the Council ofCaribbean Engineering Organisations (CCEO) of the need to improve riskmanagement methods if they wish to achieve better rates frominternational reinsurers.  One way, it suggested, is for insurers tothrow their weight behind the introduction of mandatory building codesas a means of minimising damage from natural hazards.  Only threeCaribbean countries, two of them British colonies (the Bahamas,Anguilla and Monserrat) have such codes.The Barbados-based CCEO is in the final phase of drawing up acomprehensive Caribbean Uniform Building Code (CUBIC), which it wouldlike adopted by all the other 12 members of CARICOM, the Caribbean freetrade area.  The code will outline the design and constructionparameters for all new buildings.  The organisation would like theinsurance industry to be more active in pressing governments to enforcethe Code, a spokesman said, and with the Caribbean just havingexperienced its worst hurricane season for 62 years and insurers stillcounting the costs, it feels the industry, with the prodding ofreinsurers, may now be ready to take notice.Tony Gibbs, a senior Caribbean engineer who has been one of the mostactive in promoting CUBIC, said Caribbean insurers would be doingthemselves a favour by supporting mandatory building standards, if onlybecause "it will remove an easy excuse for the high catastropheinsurance premiums the region must bear at the present time".One reason why most Caribbean governments have not moved to enforce theCode is a desire to avoid raising building costs.  Mr Gibbs said that arecent study showed that were CUBIC adopted, only between 0.24% and2.2% would be added to total costs.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 19961996 CAPACITYLloyd's underwriting capacity in 1996 will be #9.852m (US$15.3m), downfrom #10.195m in 1995,  according to provisional figures.

While previouslegislation referred only to injuries at work and employer's liability,the new law also covers loss prevention.  The main features of the newlegislation are- insurance is made compulsory, but employers may also choose to self-insure if they can demonstrate sufficient financial strength to paymonetary benefits and the ability to deliver required medical and otherservices (medical care and medication; prostheses and orthopaedics;rehabilitation; occupational retraining and funeral services).  Theability of employers to provide benefits in kind if uninsured iscurrently unsupervised- employers are relieved of civil liability unless there is proof of awrongful, intentional act.  Under existing legislation, workers canchoose between accepting the scheduled compensation or going to court,leading over the years to tens of thousands of cases with enormouslosses for insurers and reinsurers- a new type of specialised workers' compensation insurer, known asARTs, is to be created.  These must have a minimum paid-in capital ofPesos3m.  General insurers who write workers' comp may continue doingso if they provide the new services provided by the act.  ARTs andinsurers will choose which industrial sectors they will cover, butcannot turn down any request for cover from employers in those sectors- disability income to be based on a monthly income instead of lump sumpayments, expected current value of the periodic benefit being limitedto Pesos55,000 (US$55,000) during the first three years of the newsystem and Pesos110,000 thereafter- only enumerated occupational diseases and disabilities will becovered and the list of diseases regulated- loss prevention and worker rehabilitation and retraining, andcollective labour negotiations to improve prevention and benefits, areall encouraged- benefits will be financed with monthly contributions paid byemployers.

The National Consumer Commission(NCC), constituted under the CPA, ruled in April 1992 that theprovision of paid medical assistance by hospitals and medicalprofessionals fell within the scope of the term "service" as defined insection 2(1)(0) of the CPA.  In the event of any deficiency in theperformance of such services, the aggrieved party may file a complaintto the Consumer Forum under the CPA.  The NCC decision was challengedby the Medical Council of India.The Supreme Court (Justices Kuldip Singh, SC Agarwal and BL Hansaria)upheld the NCC ruling, excepting only services rendered by a doctorpractising free of charge to every patient under a contract of personalservice, by way of consultation, diagnosis or treatment.The judges commented that a contract of personal service must bedistinguished from a contract of professional service.  They alsoobserved that they were unable to support the view that merely becausemedical practitioners belong to the medical profession, they areoutside the purview of the provisions of the Act and the servicesrendered by them are not covered by it.  The normal tests of negligenceshould apply.  The court further observed that while immunity fromdamages could be granted on grounds of public interest, the trend wasfor restricting of such immunity.The verdict brings to an end years of controversy generated bydiffering decisions by various High Courts.  Among the possible reliefswhich could be granted plaintiffs are return of charges paid,compensation for loss or injury suffered due to negligence andremedying of the defective or deficient service.  The Supreme Courtdecision evoked a mixed reaction.  The Honorary General Secretary ofthe India Medical Association, Dr JC Sobti, pointed out that henceforthprivate doctors would increasingly seek insurance cover on the lines ofthe US system.A random survey of private nursing homes in Delhi revealed that themajority of doctors had already bought a professional indemnity policyor planned to do so, and many of those already covered planned toincrease the sum insured.  At one home, all 35 medical consultants hadbeen instructed by the hospital director to take out cover for Rs1m(US$28,230) each, while the director had already sought cover forhimself and paramedical staff at a cost of about Rs40,000 in annualpremium.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD INSURANCE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996PROPERTY AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION1.2.94-1.1.95, fire, statisticsUK:  London, Fire Protection Association (FPA), ests total loss from156 #250,000+ (US$400,000) fires at #179.7m (US$279m).1.3.94-28.2.95, fire, statisticsUK:  London, Fire Protection Association (FPA), ests total loss from152 #250,000+ (US$400,000) fires at #176.5m (US$274.1m).1.1-28.2.95, fire, statisticsUK:  London, Fire Protection Association (FPA) ests total loss from 12#250,000+ (US$400,000) fires at #8.6m (US$13.4m).

On 12 January 1996, Stanton Peabody, acting managing director of the "Daily Observer", was released after Press Union of Liberia attorneys, through the Justice & Peace Commission, filed a bill of habeus corpus on his behalf. Peabody was released on bail of $20,000 Liberian (US$ 400).    Peabody will return to court on 16 January, as will editor-in- chief of the "Daily Observer" James Seitua. However, the two journalists will be tried separately on charges of "criminal malevolence."    Immediately after the court ordered Peabody's release, Director of National Police Joseph Tate ordered seven police officers to re-arrest him in the courthouse. However, the presiding judge announced that any re-arrest would place Tate in contempt of court. Peabody plans to remain at home until the upcoming court date.   On 11 January 1996, representatives of the Press Union of Liberia and the management of the "Daily Observer" obtained a bill of release for James Seitua, editor-in-chief of the "Daily Observer". Bail in the amount of $25,000 Liberian dollars ($350 US) was paid. Under the conditions of his release, Seitua cannot travel outside of Monrovia, and must report daily to the police until the matter is resolved.   The charge against Seitua, as stated in his bill of release, is "criminal malevolence." No charges have been filed against him in a court of law. On 29 December 1995, the "Daily Observer" published an article that disputed the claim made by United Revolutionary Front of Sierra Leone spokesperson Eddie Hebron that he was interviewed in the Ivory Coast by the British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of America. The article claimed that Hebron was in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, during the interviews. James Seitua was subsequently arrested on 9 January and detained; he has since been released on bail. Stanton Peabody, in an attempt to intervene on Seitua's behalf, was also arrested on 10 January. He remains in detention.   On 8 January 1996, D. Sompon Weah II, reporter for "The News", and "The News" photographer Pewee S. Flomoku were attacked in Po River (northwestern Liberia), where they were covering skirmishes between West Africa peacekeeping forces (ECOMOG) and warring factions of the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO-J).   The attack occurred shortly after their arrival, as they were recording the state of security in the region. At the directive of the executive director of the Liberia Refugees Repatriation & Resettlement Commission, Mrs. Weade Kobbah Wreh, they were beaten by her personal bodyguards and some ECOMOG soldiers. Flomoku's camera was destroyed.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonpartisan advocate of press freedom, condemns the December 23 arrest of Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of best-selling Lagos-based "Tell" magazine, and the recent escalation of attacks against Nigeria's independent press.    Igiebor, the recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in 1993, was arrested by six members of the State Security Service (SSS) at his home in Lagos. SSS agents also confiscated 20,000 copies of "Tell" magazine's Christmas Day edition with the cover story "Abacha is Adamant: Terrorizes the Opposition." On December 27, SSS agents made a failed attempt to search his office for the company's tax records and staff pay records.   Authorities continue to hold Igiebor in solitary confinement without charge, and are demanding that he reveal his sources for articles published in Tell criticizing the military government. During interrogations at Lagos State Command of the SSS facility in Shangisha, Igiebor repeatedly stated that he receives financial support from neither outsiders nor Nigerian citizens, and that any information he receives arrives by mail.    CPJ also denounces the following attacks against the independent press during the last two weeks of 1995:   * On December 31, the office of the magazine division of the Independent Communications Network Limited, publishers of "The News," "Tempo," and "Tempofootball," was torched by arsonists using a petrol bomb. According to Dapo Olorunyomi, editor -in-chief of "The News," the fire destroyed property (including a new line of Gateway 2000 Pentium computers) worth millions of naira. The arsonists managed to escape.   The office, located on the first floor of Tejumola House in Ikeja, Lagos, houses the newsroom and production center of the three magazines. It was the only floor of the four-story building that was torched. Management expects publication of The News and Tempo to be suspended for approximately two weeks.    On December 19, photojournalists Peter Obe, Bayo Ewuoso, Abiodun Ajala and Segun Olakitan were assaulted and detained by police during the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) rally in Lagos. Their offense was photographing the confrontation between NADECO supporters and the over five hundred policemen who shot tear gas into the crowd to disperse the protesters.    Ewuoso, a senior photojournalist with "AM News" was severely beaten by over ten policemen who later transported him to the Surulere Police Station for interrogation. Ajala of "This Day" newspaper, Olakitan of "Tell" magazine, and veteran photojournalist Obe were also beaten and seriously injured by police. Ajala and Olakitan were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.   On December 16, ten security operatives lay siege to the "AM News" office, demanding to know the whereabouts of editor-in-chief Bayo Onanuga. They were seeking Onanuga to place him under arrest. Onanuga remains in hiding. The security operatives reportedly did the same at the offices of "Tell" magazine.    On December 16, all 55,000 copies of "Tell" were seized at the printing house. The seizure followed the magazine's publication of an article titled "The Release of [Chief Moshood] Abiola: The World Waits On [General Sani] Abacha."    On December 15, arsonists torched the circulation department of "The Guardian" newspaper. Damage was minimal because the fire was quickly brought under control.   On December 15, Adedisi Dejo, Emmanuel Piper, Yeni Oldwolabi and Iyi Isaac, reporters and contributors to the paper, were held for questioning by Lagos police.   Finally, CPJ intensified its call for the release of the four journalists (Christine Anyanwu, George Mbah, Ben Charles Obi and Kunle Ajibade) who were convicted to fifteen years in jail for their alleged participation in an alleged coup plot against the military regime.

"It will be very surprising if President Yoweri Museveni, is not returned to office next April as the elected president,: the just released 1995 4th quarter country report, says.   The report, however, doubts whether all sections of society will accept the legitimacy of his election.   At the same time it casts a shadow over the loyalty of the army towards any other person other than Museveni. "The army remains Mr. Museveni's trump card," it states, therefore disqualifying the possibilities of the army supporting any other democratically elected government.   It also suggests that the legislative elections in May 1996 will produce a better political balance in parliament, and thereby defuse some political tension.   According to the report, NRM is already confident of victories in Karamoja -- because NRM has allowed the K'jongs to keep their guns. Busoga--VP Kazibwe's home area, Bugisu, Kapchorwa and his traditional base the South-west.   The report further states that, "Mr Museveni is even trying to tempt former president, Idi Amin, back to Uganda in order to capitalise on his support in the North West.   The EIU report which briefly portrays the current political and economic state of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, cites the new constitution and the escalating military expenditure of the Uganda government as a possible source of disagreement between the donor community and the Government.   According to the report, "the USA clearly believes that a five-year wait before the issue of multi-partyism can again be tested is too long. It adds that European countries previously reluctant to show their resentment on the matter, have now formally joined the US in pressing for an early constitutional amendment.   "The government reduced the defence share of budget expenditure from 36% in 1990/91 to 13% in 1991/92, but then raised it again during the following two years and brought it up to 30% this year [1995}," the reports notes. The donor community is not at all happy with this trend regardless of the insecurity in the north and along the Sudan border.   The report says that the rift between president Moi of Kenya and Museveni which used to be portrayed as a largely personal matter, has developed into "a more substantial rift based on the different approaches to systems of government." It blames the failure to achieve regional cooperation on this cat and mouse relationship between these two leaders.   The strike by medical workers last September is cited in the report as a possible beginning of demands to be floated by the public sector workers. This, the report goes on, would result into an inflationary wage spiral that would threaten the climate of economic stability which has been achieved in recent years.   It is expected to be compounded by unfavourable economic prospects especially following the recent decline in coffee prices. The end of this coffee boom was marked by the October fall in the value of the shilling, after a two year spell of stability, the EIU report notes.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaForeign Trip Could Clear Constitutional Logjam Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Marion Edmunds   Johannesburg - Over drinks in hotel bars in Germany last week, new friendships were formed that bode well for the writing of the final constitution.   During a week-long, fact-finding tour to Germany, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), African National Congress (ANC) and National Party (NP) politicians were able, for the first time since the IFP walked out of the Constitutional Assembly last year, to talk to each other -- sometimes late into the night -- about South Africa's constitutional future.   Back home this week, the delegates were cautiously optimistic about the effect the mission would have on the constitution-writing process and, in particular, on the stand-off between the IFP and the ANC over international mediation.   At this stage -- and it is early days yet -- the signs of a new interparty rapport are good, with even the IFP delegates taking a more amiable line than usual.   IFP negotiator, Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela, said this week he had already briefed party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi about the trip and Buthelezi had been "positively surprised" at what he had to say.   Mzimela said of the trip: "I think we got the chance to interact across party lines ... if the group had had the power to make decisions, certainly there would have been movement on issues because we were able to understand a lot of things collectively."   Mzimela believed there would be follow-up talks between parties on what had been learnt, but would not commit himself on whether the IFP would return to the Constitutional Assembly to participate fully in the final, and most important, phases of the constitutional negotiations.   He said international mediation had not been mentioned during the visit, and in any case "the media have overplayed the whole issue".   "If we in South Africa could solve our problems, we would not need international mediation ... what we did realise abroad was that the international mediation was not just an IFP and ANC problem, it was a problem to be resolved by all the parties," he said.   A source in the German delegation said that a particularly good relationship had been established between the three M's -- Mzimela, National Party Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer, and his ANC deputy Valli Moosa -- the same trio who met to resolve the international mediation crisis last year, and abandoned the attempt in bad humour.   Democratic Party constitutional expert Colin Eglin said this week the trip could be intepreted as a "diluted form of international mediation", as it was away from home and because they learnt from the Germans.   A report on the tour is being drawn up by the three technical advisers who accompanied the team. It is possible that this report will form the basis of further discussions with the IFP and parties within the Constitutional Assembly.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaMoseneke To Lead PAC?  Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Vuyo Mvoko   Johannesburg - Former Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) deputy president and now chairman of Telkom, Advocate Dikgang Moseneke, has been approached to lead the party.    This was confirmed by PAC MP Patricia de Lille late this week. De Lille, however, said she did not yet know what his response has been.   This follows the resignation of general secretary Maxwell Nemadzivhanani early this week, which renewed attention to the troubled party.   Nemadzivhanani said he had received a lot of criticism from party members, and so felt he should hand over to other "capable" people. He told the Mail & Guardian he planned to look for work in the government, but he was keeping his options open.   Since its disastrous results in both the 1994 national elections and last year's local government elections, the PAC has been plagued by allegations of leadership ineptitude which were particularly directed at its dour president Clarence Makwetu.   Makwetu held on to the party's senior position by eight votes in 1994, against a last-minute challenge from Motsoko Pheko, who had arrived from overseas on the penultimate day of the party's four-day congress in Mmabatho. Pheko is now deputy president and most likely to be elected president.   Last month the PAC's student wing the Pan Africanist Students Organisation (Paso), declared the party was in an "anarchical state of affairs" and was experiencing a "leadership crisis".   Paso called for the ousting of Makwetu, Maxwell Nemadzivhanani (whom they described as "arrogant and devisive"), MP Gora Ibrahim, and former deputy president Johnson Mlambo.   Following Paso's call the PAC National Executive Committee decided to change the status of the party's annual general conference, scheduled for Easter weekend, to a congress where a new leadership can be elected.   De Lille confirmed there was a lot of agitation within the party, but denied it was crumbling to the ground.   Moseneke told the M&G: "No. I decline. It's great to know I'm still loved out there, but I have no interest in a political career." -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaReport takes WWF To 'Tusk' Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Eddie Koch and Rehana Rossouw   Johannesburg - The Department of Military Intelligence was heavily involved in the illegal sale of elephant tusks from Angola between 1978 and 1986 -- and a commission of inquiry, established by the South African Defence Force in 1988 to probe these deals, was a white-wash.   This is the main finding of the Kumbleben Commission which this week released a 200-page report about its inquiry into the smuggling of rhino horn and elephant tusks in South Africa. The commission was appointed by President Nelson Mandela in October 1994.   Justice ME Kumbleben also criticises Operation Lock, the controversial covert operation by former British special forces officers to combat poaching in Southern Africa in the late 1980s, and says the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the head of its South African branch must take some responsibility for the behaviour of this unit.   The Kumbleben report finds there was large-scale destruction of wildlife, including elephants and rhinos, in north-eastern Namibia and Angola as a result of the 1980s wars in those countries. Most of the ivory and rhino horn obtained by poachers during this period was illegally exported through South Africa by SADF military intelligence.   The Roos Commission, set up by the defence force in 1988 to probe press reports of military involvement in the illicit trade, claimed that only about 500 tusks captured by Unita from poachers were handled by the military from 1978 onwards.   Kumbleben describes this commission as a "charade" designed to exonerate the SADF.   The report lambasts a scheme hatched by conservationists in the late 1980s to use former British special forces officers to combat poaching in Southern Africa. It describes Operation Lock -- financed by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands and set up by John Hanks (then the WWF's project manager at its headquarters in Geneva) -- as being "accountable to no one".   Kumbleben also suggests that more than 100 rhino horns provided to these officers by the Natal Parks Board and conservation authorities in Namibia for supposed sting operations were later misappropriated by members of Operation Lock.   Sections of the report contain extracts from a secret document (called Q in the report) which shows that the anti-poaching operation was infiltrated by members of South African military intelligence after it set up headquarters in South Africa. This was apparently designed to ensure Operation Lock could be "put to good use by the necessary South African information collecting departments".   The document claims that Colonel Ian Crooke, the commander of Operation Lock, had offered to help in "the monitoring of anti-South African bodies which are situated overseas".   Evidence presented to the commission suggests that document Q -- which appears to be an internal Operation Lock memo -- was drawn up by a South African military intelligence officer called Mike Richards, who had managed to infiltrate the operation.   Kumbleben questions claims by Hanks that the WWF, the world's biggest conservation NGO, was not aware of Operation Lock's activities.    It goes on to stress, however, that "those responsible for putting Lock in place did not have the ulterior motive of Lock functioning as some sort of espionage or intelligence collecting agency for the RSA. It was intended by them to be an anti-poaching or anti-smuggling operation and nothing more. It may have later been contaminated by other objectives and considerations referred to in document Q."   Hanks said his involvement in purchasing rhino horn to entrap smugglers was a sincere attempt to save Africa's dwindling black rhino stocks.   "It was nothing to do with Operation Lock, it was a totally different project. The WWF had done nothing wrong in this regard."   With the assistance of Prince Bernhard, Hanks raised R250 000 to purchase rhino horn to trap smugglers. Although the horn was never again accounted for, Hanks believes it was money well spent. "There was a group of people tested to do the undercover work. They never reported to the WWF."   Hanks said he could not comment further until he had read the Kumbleben report.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaDe Kock Trial To Focus On Mlangeni Assassination Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Mail & Guardian reporter   Johannesburg - The Eugene de Kock trial reopens on Monday with a cross-examination of former Vlakplaas policeman Joe Mamasela who is expected to provide the court with details about police involvement in a number of political murders in the 1980s.   The trial will then focus on the assassination of human rights lawyer Bheki Mlangeni whose head was blown apart by a bomb planted in a cassette recorder.   A number of witnesses -- including the man who manufactured the Mlangeni bomb -- are likely to tell the court that De Kock, former commander of the notorious Vlakplaas unit, arranged for the deadly parcel to be sent to his old enemy, renegade policeman Dirk Coetzee, in London.   Coetzee was unable to pay demurrage costs in Lusaka and it was then sent back to lawyer Bheki Mlangeni who had been listed as the sender. When Mlangeni received the package, he placed a cassette in the recorder, put on the headphones and detonated the device.   The Transvaal Attorney General's office may interrupt the trial after it resumes in order to charge De Kock in connection with the smuggling of weapons to Inkatha Freedom Party paramilitary camps during the early 1990s.   Senior IFP officials -- including Themba Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu -- will be implicated in the gun-running operations while the name of Inkatha senator Phillip Powell is expected to feature prominently in the case.   The Mail & Guardian is aware that the AG's office is also working on prosecutions against three police generals mentioned by Judge Richard Goldstone as having been involved in dirty tricks operations. These are Krappies Engelbrecht, Basie Smit and Johan le Roux.   Officials in the AG's office declined to comment on the matter.   These cases are due to be finalised this year.Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaIs TV Relaunching ... Or Re-sinking? Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Jacquie Golding-Duffy and Justin Pearce    Johannesburg - The grand plan for a spectacular relaunch of the SABC to shake off the last vestiges of its heritage as a bastion of Afrikaner nationalism, has been dampened by a last-ditch bid by the language lobby.   When the Rapportryers and other bodies dedicated to the protection of the Afrikaans language signalled that they would fight -- through the courts, if necessary -- any downgrading of their language on the national broadcaster, the Independent Broadcasting Authority had to sit up and take note. In the interim Constitution, the Afrikaans language lobby has a powerful weapon, and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), which had been relaxed about the formalities of SABC's planned changes, would be vulnerable to legal attack if it did not follow the letter of the law and hold public hearings, which would allow the language lobby to pursue its objections.   That sparked off this week's power struggle between the two premier bodies of South African broadcasting, both of which are determined to show that they are in charge of reshaping the public broadcaster.   The SABC for the moment lacks IBA approval to amend its television broadcast licences in such a way as to allow the corporation to spread South African languages equitably across all three new channels as it had planned to do next month. The IBA is refusing to give this approval until public hearings have been held in terms of the Broadcasting Act.   The SABC is to press on with its plans to relaunch its TV services on February 4, but the still-unchanged broadcast licences mean the corporation now has two weeks to revise schedules which took months to compile.   The IBA and SABC accuse each other of provoking this crisis. The SABC said it had held discussions with the IBA as early as September and that the regulatory body was "well aware" of what was coming.   IBA sources in turn said the authority had repeatedly informed SABC top management of the need to make a formal application to amend its broadcast licence.   The SABC further alleges that, based on discussions held between the parties, there "did not seem to be a problem" until earlier this week when press reports alerted the SABC to the IBA's decision against granting an immediate amendment. The possibility of legal irregularities in the SABC's plans was first made public when Afrikaner organisations threatened the SABC with court action.   The Rapportryersbeweging said programme restructuring and language changes by the SABC were being done single-handedly by the corporation. The Rapportryers threatened to take the SABC to court and to make submissions to the IBA regarding the planned relaunch.   The IBA was alerted and the SABC was informed that it would have to comply by amending its licence and allowing for public scrutiny.   SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu said the launch on February 4 was not challenged by the IBA at the parties' last meeting in mid-December, adding that the corporation was "made to understand that the amendment would be a minor technicality". The IBA denied this.   Some sources see the IBA-SABC wrangle as a misunderstanding due to bad communication; others believe it is a power struggle over who has the greater authority, while others insinuate that were it not for the stir caused by the Afrikaner men-only movement, the stand-off between the parties would have been averted.   The question that remains is whether the two had agreed in principle on the amendment being granted as a mere formality and whether plans were upset by a small Afrikaans fringe group insisting on its democratic right to scrutinise the new SABC changes.   SABC communications head Ken Modise insisted that no individual was responsible for the misunderstanding, since each meeting between the parties was attended by at least three representatives from each organisation.   IBA spokesman Amos Vilakazi denied that there was a power struggle between them, adding that the IBA was merely doing its regulatory duty.   The SABC is adamant that it was complying with the Broadcasting Act by handing in its application for an amendment when it did. According to one SABC official, the IBA had dragged its heels in getting the application gazetted and this contributed to the delay in notifying the public of imminent changes within the SABC.   There is a feeling within the SABC that the IBA was whipping up a logistical storm in a teacup, and that it did not have the right to dictate the language preference used on the SABC.   The IBA, however, felt that the handing in of the application two months ago -- in early October rather than in mid-December -- would have been more acceptable and would have allowed for public scrutiny.   "The effect of the application is that it transforms public broadcasting in this country and, while we are not opposed to the SABC, we are opposed to the procedurally incorrect manner in which it has gone about doing it," an IBA source said. He stressed the IBA was merely doing its job as a media regulator.   In the wake of this week's fiasco, SABC management has asserted its commitment to public consultation, and has argued that going ahead with its revised plan was the best way to give the public an idea of what the changes involved.   "We believe the public will be better informed once they have seen what is offered," Modise said.   Modise confirmed that the corporation is to go ahead with its February 4 relaunch while still abiding by the terms of its existing licences. This will, however, involve a rearrangement of the schedules in order to keep the dominant languages on each channel the same as at present.   SABC sources suggest the corporation paid little attention to the need to seek a formal licence amendment, lulled into false security by the fact that the IBA had raised no objections when African languages were introduced into TV1's Good Morning South Africa.   However, licences stipulate the dominant languages for each channel. While the GMSA changes did not change the status of English and Afrikaans as the dominant languages on TV1, the changes that were planned for February 4 would have reached much further.   Briefing TV staff on Wednesday, Jill Chisholm, head of Television News Production and acting head of television, pointed out there was no precedent for a South African broadcaster applying for a licence amendment as opposed to a fresh licence, hence the lack of clarity over correct procedure.   Chisholm also expressed disappointment that changes which "are part of a root and branch transformation" of the SABC had been stymied by the problems raised by the IBA, when in fact the IBA and SABC were in agreement on the kind of transformation which the corporation needed to undergo.   Stressing the need for discretion, Chisholm expressed concern about "running into IBA sensitivities about power and authority".   Wednesday's briefing was the first time that staff who will be implementing the new programme format had been officially informed of the plans. Chisholm apologised to staff for the fact that they had heard about the changes in line-up in the press before being briefed by the SABC. The briefing was intended to take place earlier but had been delayed.   Staffers have in the meantime voiced frustration at what they see as the superficial nature of the changes planned at the SABC, at the confusion over the lines of managerial command, and at the corporation's tardiness in informing them about the changes.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaNews Viewers Vote With Their Remotes Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Jacquie Golding-Duffy   Johannesburg - The SABC's news and actuality coverage -- the mainstay of the broadcaster's operation -- has lost more than a quarter of a million viewers over the past year.   The corporation's eight o'clock English news slot has suffered a drop of a minimum of 100 000 viewers, while the equivalent 30-minute Afrikaans bulletin lost 200 000 viewers.   The new, "improved" Agenda Newsline also suffered a decline of about 100 000 viewers, but it is not clear from market research where the audience has moved to.   There has been a "steady decrease" in the number of people who watch news and actuality, said SABC news and actuality research manager, Dr. Stoffel Blaauw, adding that people either watch only half the news, change channels, or just switch off their television sets for the night.   Blaauw said the decline began when the SABC shifted from being a commercial broadcaster to becoming a public broadcaster, adding that the drop of 300 000 viewers was a "minimum average" of the total number of people lost to news and actuality.   "The drop began as early as September 1993, when the political agenda of the SABC changed and it had to adapt to a changing South Africa by ridding itself of the stereotyped black television channels -- the former TV2 and TV3 -- and market a television service that was more representative of the broader spectrum of South Africans," Blaauw said.   He said the SABC's top brass was trying its best to broadcast to all language groups but, because it was a mammoth task and one could not be all things to all people, certain local English and Afrikaans groups were becoming "increasingly annoyed" with the drop in standards of television, especially news and actuality.   With about 10,5-million households connected to television, a steady decline of this nature could see a drop of close to a million viewers by the time the next elections are due.   Blaauw predicted that people would be increasingly incensed to find that, with the relaunching of channels, the corporation was using material which was "currently on the shelf" because of time and budgetary constraints.   He said top management was, despite having its own agenda, open to suggestions gathered from research conducted and keen to improve the image of the SABC, but added that the "new look" SABC would be a case of "let's wait and see what happens". -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaRugby: Luyt Dynasty Expands Its Turf Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Nicole Fritz and Vuyo Mvoko    Johannesburg - Rian Oberholzer, Louis Luyt's son-in-law, has left his job as South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) tournament director to take up a permanent appointment in Australia as chief executive of Sanza -- the company which will control rugby broadcasts in the southern hemisphere.   Sanza came into being after a R2-billion deal Luyt, together with Australia's Leo Williams and New Zealand's Richie Guy, signed with media mogul Rupert Murdoch.   Effectively, this contract gives Murdoch exclusive television rights to all southern hemisphere provincial and international rugby for the next 10 years.   Oberholzer's appointment as head of Sanza is being seen in some circles as a transcontinental expansion of the Luyt dynasty -- which includes Luyt's son, Louis Luyt junior, who is general manager of Ellis Park and Luyt senior's personal assistant.   Oberholzer is also a trustee of the Transvaal Rugby Sports Trust. The trustees control voting rights and rights to dividends and interest in respect of the Transvaal Rugby Football Union's investment in Ellis Park.   Oberholzer's move and reports of Luyt's property sales have fuelled speculation that Luyt intends to leave the country. Two weeks ago the Mail & Guardian reported Luyt's house in the plush Johannesburg suburb of Saxonwold had been placed on the market, apparently for a staggering R7-million.   It has also been reported that Luyt's luxurious Ballito holiday-home was up for sale over the festive season, but was inexplicably withdrawn after a short period.-0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaEducation In Crisis: Teachers Face Cut-backs Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Philippa Garson and Vusi Mona   Johannesburg - TENS of thousands of teachers around the country will soon have to pack up their bags and move to under-resourced schools or be retrenched.   The government's commitment to equity in schools and the severe constraints on the education budget mean many schools will have to cut-back on the number of teachers they employ.   The squeeze on the education budget, and the fact that many provinces have already overspent on last year's budget, is forcing schools to cut back on the number of teachers they employ by increasing teacher/pupil ratios to 1:40 in primary schools and 1:35 in high schools over a period of five years and cutting back on subject choices.   Ironically, the subjects the country needs the most in terms of human resource development, like science, will be the first to go, because these are the smaller, and more expensive classes to run. So too will the better, more experienced teachers bear the brunt of the cut-backs, as they are the more expensive to employ.   But the only way that provinces can balance their books is by slashing back on teachers salaries -- which swallow 85% of the education budget. According to some, the number of teachers currently in employment is roughly adequate for the country as a whole. For others, no amount of redeployment will absorb the excess number of teachers generated by the new teacher/pupil ratios. The 1994 national teacher/pupil ratio was 1:34 in primary schools and 1:27 in high schools, implying that enforced new ratios will generate a surplus of teachers. There are already as many as 15 000 unemployed teachers.   Glaring inequities exist in terms of teacher distribution, with an abundance of teachers and small classes in most formerly white schools. It is in the many township schools, in peri-urban informal settlements and in rural areas, where teacher shortages exist.   Teachers wanting to keep their jobs will have no option but to relocate to the areas where they are needed. But moving teachers to poorer areas brings with it a host of legal, financial and social obstacles, said Peter Buckland of the National Business Initiative. In terms of the Educators' Employment Act, affecting state-aided or model C schools, schools have the right to choose which teachers to employ. To redeploy teachers would mean amending this legislation.   Moving teachers to other schools also implies the need for travel costs, relocation costs and in some cases, accommodation costs -- money which the government doesn't seem to have.   Then there is teachers' resistance to moving on the one hand, and communities' antagonism towards "outside" teachers coming to take up jobs when their own teachers are unemployed. Many white teachers would balk at moving to volatile informal settlements where they may not be welcome.   The South African Teachers Union has agreed in principle to redeployment, if it means that jobs can be saved. "We are backing redeployment in that we are backing teachers' jobs. But we need a strategy to attract teachers to impoverished areas," said general secretary Thulas Nxesi.   Issues such as housing arrangements and travel allowances would have to be negotiated, Nxesi added, warning that last-resort retrenchments would meet with resistance. "We don't believe there's an oversupply of teachers. If they talk retrenchments we will do whatever we can to protect our members' jobs."    Gauteng MEC Mary Metcalfe said travelling expenses could not be paid however. She said redeployment had already been negotiated with the teachers' unions for the moving of teachers "from the better-off to the more under-resourced schools to be phased in over the next two years. People will be offered redeployment to areas within reasonable distances from where they live.   "Educationally we'd agree that smaller class sizes are better but we are going through a period of massive reconstruction and we simply cannot afford smaller classroom sizes."   Metcalfe added however that even if the new ratios were complied with, the province could still not meet its budget. This would point towards inevitable retrenchments. Metcalfe refused to confirm this in the absence of a finalised budget or negotiations.   According to Jane Hofmeyr, also of the NBI, "teachers will have to be retrenched unless we relook at the teacher/pupil ratios and the education budget". In her view, it is time to consider loans from the World Bank. "We don't want a debt trap forever but there are few countries that don't use loans at some time or another. It is a critical time for us in terms of human resource development."-0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaRector Urges Universities To Share Apartheid's BacklogsMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Philippa Garson   Johannesburg - The call by the University of the Western Cape's new rector, Cecil Abrahams, for the province's three universities to take joint responsibility for its disadvantaged students has prompted mildly defensive attitudes from two wealthier sisters, the University of Cape Town and the University of Stellenbosch.   Abrahams has called for the three universities in the Western Cape to share the burden of disadvantaged students and take some of the load off his own university with a streamlined, common admissions centre.   Abrahams outlined his proposal in a graduation speech at UCT last month, calling for "universities as a collective (to) establish a common applications centre where we agree to divide among ourselves a pre-determined percentage of applicants who have been historically oppressed.   "I propose as well that we address together the difficult financial situation facing students. It is vitally important that the university sector in this region develop in an orderly and financially viable manner. This is not a time for any one of our universities to gloat at the struggles and misfortunes of a particular university," he said.   Abrahams told the Mail & Guardian the educational and financial poverty of disadvantaged students should be the responsibility of all three institutions. "This would reduce the responsibility of one university to deal with all the backlogs apartheid created."   He said he feared a repeat of last year's admissions saga at UWC which resulted in scores of students being turned away for non-payment of fees.   Abrahams said that UCT's response had been "polite", and Stellenbosch had not yet responded. He hoped however to schedule a meeting on the issue next month.   UCT acting Vice-Chancellor Wieland Gewers said he was "very interested" in the line taken by Abrahams, but suggested that many co-operative developments had taken place of which Abrahams had perhaps not been aware.   "We've been very active in inter-technikon and university co-operation in the Western Cape." A group of five institutions, namely the three Western Cape universities, Peninsula Technikon and Cape Technikon, has established a vice-rectors' group that meets frequently to promote co-operation on issues of common concern like staff development and sharing of libraries, said Gewers.   The Western Cape Tertiary Institutions Trust had already raised funds for all the institutions and a single mechanism for all five libraries was being implimented. Gewers hinted that Abrahams was "not fully conversant with the number of students we do have that are black (51%). "   He said that his university was flooded with 17 000 applications this year and had only 3 000 places.   The University of Stellenbosch was also keen to remind Abrahams of existing regional co-operation structures and of its own numbers of disadvantaged students, which the university was already battling to fund.   Stellensbosch Vice-Chancellor A Van Wyk said the university had been increasing its admission of disadvantaged students at an "exponential rate and 17% of 1995's intake of first year students were from that group." Van Wyk said Abrahams suggestions, which he noted with "interest", should be taken to the National Commission on Higher Education.    Abrahams said he was aware of the Committee of Five Tertiary Institutions but believed the issue was "urgent enough" to be dealt with by top leadership as soon as possible. -0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaIntelligence To Investigate Police Spy Scandal Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Gaye Davis   Johannesburg - Intelligence officials hope to have their own investigation into the police bugging scandal wrapped up as early as next week and will be forwarding a report to both President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.   "We will get to the bottom of this -- the who, the how and the why," deputy co-ordinator of intelligence Moe Shaik said this week of the spying row which saw police and intelligence chiefs all but accuse each other of lying.   The investigation by the National Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee (NICOC) centres on allegations that former security policeman Dirk Coetzee, now an National Intelligence Agency operative, told SAPS member Inspector H Moodley he had been assigned to spy on top-ranking policemen -- a charge Coetzee denies.   The probe also focuses on whether or not listening devices or equipment were found connected to top-ranking policemen's telephones.   Shaik refused to comment this week when asked whether an investigation by Telkom had thrown doubt on whether bugs were in fact found.   He did however concede a failure to properly assess the impact the allegations could have if made public. Shaik said he discussed "rumours circulating" with SAPS commissioner George Fivaz as soon as he heard of them. Fivaz "was aware of them and could put them in context". In what proved a serious miscalculation, they agreed to let the matter rest there.   Shaik said this week: "Our collective response was sluggish. A story we dismissed as media hype, that we thought was essentially a non-issue, threatened to become a national crisis.   "The lesson to be learned is that we need mechanisms to deal with any issue that -- whether deliberately or unintentionally -- could threaten the fragility of the transition."   The investigation, by the NICOC, is one of three launched in the wake of newspaper reports that the National Intelligence Agency was bugging top-ranking policemen. Coetzee, Moodley and his commander, the head of the National Priority Crimes Unit, Major-General Suiker Brits had all been interviewed, Shaik said.   A judge to head an independent inquiry announced by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki last week has yet to be appointed, although Minister of Justice Dullah Omar told the M&G he expected an announcement would be made during the course of next week.   Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence will be meeting on February 7 to consider reports it has called for from both the SAPS and NIA and to decide whether to call individuals to testify before it. Its inquiry begins officially on February 12.   Shaik said NICOC's report would first be discussed within the committee, which brings together the National Crime Intelligence Service of the SAPS, the NIA and the South African Secret Service, before being forwarded to President Mandela and Deputy President Mbeki for a decision on how to proceed.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaDe Klerk Aims for Nat Party Revival Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Gaye Davis   Johannesburg - National Party leader F. W. de Klerk has yet again had to insist that rumours of his party's imminent demise were exaggerated.   De Klerk's irritation was not so much with the "disgruntled individuals" who, by leaking a strategy document to the Afrikaans Sunday newspaper Rapport had set themselves "on a course of sabotage", but with the fact that the document had been interpreted as saying the NP was preparing to dissolve.   De Klerk faced having to correct this misinterpretation by saying what was really intended -- that far from dissolving, the NP meant to act like an alka-seltzer on the political digestive tract, saving it from the indigestibility of a one-party state threatened by the ANC's dominance.   But his ire was compounded at having to show more of his hand than he would have liked. The plan was for him to unveil the vision of a new, right-of-centre political movement, aimed at injecting fluidity into South Africa's democracy, on February 2.   Seeing De Klerk, flanked by NP executive director Fanus Schoeman, media head Marthinus Van Schalkwyk and Cape leader Dawie de Villiers, a question arose. How could they expect the public to have confidence in their ability to transform the political landscape when rearranging the furniture within their own party was proving so problematic?   In fact, De Klerk does not see the NP  as necessarily leading the movement it is proposing, which will need substantial black support to survive.   He has been engaged in intensive talks with business, religious and community leaders he wants to support the formation of a movement, founded on Christian values, that could draw support on issues like bringing back capital punishment, retaining anti-abortion laws, lowering taxes and limiting state power.   He wants to establish common ground with the other minority parties through "regular discussions", but an alliance is not necessarily going to emerge. Essentially, NP strategists are looking for growth to congregants in the ANC's church who might be encouraged, ahead of 1999 and a new general election, to cross the floor.   These are non-racial issues, around which De Klerk hopes to rally people on the basis of shared values as a way of shattering what NP strategists see as racially-based voting patterns.   A clause in the interim constitution demands that MPs crossing the floor resign their seats. It is not repeated in the draft new constitution, but may yet appear: the ANC would not want members elected by voters who backed the party, rather than voting for an individual, free to do political waltzes.   But members -- and supporters -- might just be tempted, if there was a viable opposition amounting to more than tiny parties relegated to being permanent opponents of the majority party without any hope of ever coming into power. To be viable, it would have to be non-racial and forward-looking, with no hint of being concerned with furthering narrow ethnic interests. -0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaSoccer: This Fish Is Poetry In Motion Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Mark Gevisser   Johannesburg - Monday afternoon at the Old Eds Health & Racquet Club in Houghton. It's only 48 hours after they were crowned national heroes, and the Bafana Bafana seem bemused, rather than irritated, by the fact that only a few autograph-hunting children recognise them. "Excuse me!" calls a fluorescent kugel, "what team are you?"   Doctor and Shoes have led an invasion of the aerobics class, pealing with laughter as they throw their gold around. Zane, meanwhile, is throwing indignant teenage girls off exercycles. Augie is primping his pecs down in freeweights. Coach Clive is gamely puffing his way through a circuit. The Feesh, it goes without saying, is in the water, doing laps.   Later, signature bird's-nest hair tamed by a back-to-front baseball cap, the youngest member of the South African squad  -- and the one most likely to hit the international big time -- lopes across the floor to laugh at his buddies in the aerobics class.   There's something mesmerising about Mark Fish. The gangly white boy's jerky, too-long limbs sometimes seem to be caught in adolescence (he is 21), beyond his control, until they snap, in a moment, into the machine-like precision which earned him the "Man of the Match" vote last Saturday when South Africa trounced Cameroon.   There's no white player black South Africans love more; there's no South African defender who gets as much attention from the crowd. "Feeeesh!" the supporters cried every time his boot tapped the ball on Saturday. "Feeeesh" they cry every time he plays for Orlando Pirates.   And it's not just because his name, like "Shhhhoooeees", rolls easily off the collective tongue of a stadium-full of people. It's not just because he is a defender who never loses a tackle, no matter how aggressive the striker, who is given to blazing lone storms across the length of the field into the other team's goal-box and who reads a game like no one else on the field. No, it's because he is raw, a rebel, easy to find (that hair!), easy to read.   There's something intimidating about the artistry of a Khumalo or a Mosheou, something inaccessible about the lofty Masinga; through Feesh, though, you can live the match, following the fortunes of your team as they ripple through his posture and register on his features.   Coach Clive Barker puts it best: "What impresses most people about Mark Fish is his body language. He's unpredictable, a character. A Jonty Rhodes, a James Small. He betrays to the crowds what we're trying to get across."   Barker clearly adores his youngest ward: "He's not my first choice for the national team! He's my first, second and third choice!" The bluff, no-nonsense coach plays his part so perfectly you wonder if he hasn't stepped off the pages of Whizzer & Chips. But Fish stirs even the coach to poesy: "If I were in the trenches of World War I and I had Mark Fish next to me, even if there were 1 000 soldiers storming us, I'd be convinced we'd still win. He's a fighter."   It's no secret there are talent scouts from the European clubs here for the African Cup of Nations, and they've got their eyes on Fish. There have been rumours about Manchester United, and it's believed the Italians are also showing interest. Soccer writers caution, though, that a star in malnourished South Africa might not even register a blip on the Italian or British landscape.   Barker believes that Fish "may have the potential to hit the jackpot, to make the big league if he manages things right. But he may yet go into the category of the George Bests." Fish, you see, is Party Animal Number One in the South African squad. He loves to drink and he can get unruly. The squad still chuckle at how he told Mike Atherton he was "ugly".   "He loves a good party," says Barker, "and his parties go on longer than anyone else's." As does his hair, even though Barker's caught wind of a rumour that, if the Bafana Bafana get to the finals, a certain Feesh might be sporting an "exotic, punk, short, blue do".   There's none of that Mark Fish sitting opposite me at the bar of the Sunnyside Hotel. He is the consummate Pretoria Boys High alumnus: well-spoken, very polite. He talks, for example, of "Mr Barker" and "Mr Mandela".   It's clear he doesn't really like the limelight, but he plays ball anyway, attempting to answer questions and admitting, sheepishly, that his mind is elsewhere. Despite his youth, he is one of the most popular members of the squad: it's hard not to like him.   He is not self-conscious about being a white boy in a black sport. His best buddy -- and room mate at the Sunnyside -- is Pirates captain and fellow Pretoria homeboy (and rabble-rouser) Edward Motale. "Fish," says Motale, "is not like other whites. I take him to Mamelodi, to Tembisa, and he'll get up and dance even though he's the only white. He won't give a damn, he'll just boogie and then others will join him. With other whites it's different. They need special attention one cannot afford."   After Saturday's victory, Fish chose to go with his mates to a bar, "Tings and Times" in Pretoria, rather than joining the team at the Randburg Waterfront. Johannesburg, he says, is "flashy and phoney and false, all these guys who dress to impress". Motale often accompanies him on his Pretoria sorties -- a place not known for its mixed venues -- where the pair has become known as "New South Africa".    Fish lives in one of our land's strange interstices, unrecognised by his home culture, but a folk hero to millions. "I'll go to a restaurant with a girlfriend and the only one who'll recognise me is the waiter, and he'll insist I go into the back and meet all the kitchen staff."   Perhaps his ease with this is a function of his youth: he was in nappies during the Soweto uprising. He is, truly, a post-apartheid babe. Although he is "not rushing to join the ANC", he acknowledges that, because soccer has taken him across the railway line, he does have an insight into the ravages of apartheid his white peers may not have. But there is something a little too defensive -- or perhaps just young -- in his comment: "I know about apartheid years, but I wasn't there. It's got nothing to do with me. I never hated blacks."    Fish, like Eddie Motale, spent most of his childhood playing soccer at Pretoria club, Arcadia Shepherds. But, while Fish remembers Arcadia with unqualified warmth, Motale's stories are full of the slights of petty apartheid. He was left behind in the showers when the white boys went to the pub, he was dropped from the Colts team even though he was clearly the best player and at rival Berea Park he was not allowed to use the facilities.   Fish -- like most white South Africans -- wants to erase race; Motale -- like most black South Africans -- can't. Motale lives with his parents in Mamelodi; Fish lives with his grandparents in Arcadia. Motale's mother is a cleaner at Pretoria University; Fish's mother is a sales manageress at Edgars. Motale had a hard time finishing school and, aged 29, lives for and through soccer. Fish is in the middle of a Unisa marketing degree and thinks he may want to move into sports psychology.   There are intimations that Fish had a difficult childhood -- his parents are divorced, and those who know him well say, elliptically, that his drive on the football field is related to his "background" -- but he does not talk about this. The greatest conflict of his youth seems to have been that timeworn one of white South African schools: soccer versus rugby.   Pretoria Boys High is a great rugby-playing school. They wanted him to play rugby, he wanted to play soccer. At primary school, he was head boy. But in white South African high schools, soccer -- the terrain of dagga-smoking rebels -- is positively unpatriotic, so at "Boys High" Fish assumed a more marginal existence. He speaks, now, with indignation, about how the school "did nothing for me, and now has the cheek to ask me to donate money to a new library. When Robbie Brink made the national rugby team, they said he was Boys High's first Springbok. Well what about me? I was already playing for the national soccer squad!"   He clearly doesn't like authority. Soccer administration in this country is "corrupt ... the administrators get all the money and the players don't get the respect they earn. I tell you, if I get picked for a European club, if it's Clive Barker as coach I might consider coming back to this country. Otherwise, forget it."   Right now he's listening to the group LIVE on his walkman, particularly "this one song, Lightning Crashes, about the world and how fucked up it is". It figures that his favourite movie is What's eating Gilbert Grape? Even though he is as gregarious as Johnny Depp is dark, there's something unmistakably teen-rebel about him. It's not nihilistic, wear-black, fuck-you or gangsta-rap rebellion; it's rather the indie-rock rebellion of vague social conscience, long sideburns and mellow attitude -- REM and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers are two of his favourite bands.   And yes, he is a poet. A promising one at that. Changes (see above) is filled with the nostalgic romanticism of an alienated Generation-X yearning for more essential times, when there was nothing to mediate our experience and we were mad bodies "dancing on the hillsides" rather than "pair[s] of eyes" staring, through the dark, at TV sets.   He wrote the poem for Clive Barker's wife, a ballet dancer, but it is clearly a meditation on his own career. We are no longer all "dancers", but now "cleaved" into "actor and spectators", soccer-stars and fans. "We are obsessed with heroes who live for us/ and whom we punish."   Mark Fish must know that he has now become one of those heroes.   CHANGES, by Mark Fish    Dancer    entertain with your    sweet dangerous flow.   I watched your body    Excite those eager minds    Now your mind    must excite these waiting bodies.

There are no longer "dancers" the possessed    The cleavage of men into actor and spectators    is the central feel of our time.   We are obsessed with heroes who live for us     and whom we punish.

The country has one of the poorest economies in the world and one of the lowest annual incomes per head for its 15-million people: $90 to $100 (about R315 to R360).   The row began when the IMF started negotiating a new agreement with the Mozambican government in September last year. The Mozambican government had just agreed to increase the minimum wage of $14 (about R50) a month by 37,5%.   The IMF responded by pointing out the post-election government had not met all its budget-cutting targets and issued a hard-line statement about the need to tighten up the fund's basic controls for Third World economies. These include cutbacks in state expenses, curbs on inflation and monetary circulation, financial reform and further privatisation.   Officials from the IMF have since softened their stance after a number of Mozambique's donor countries -- which usually back the organisation's medicine for ailing economies -- wrote a letter saying the Frelimo-led government, which won the election last year, was actually doing well in terms of economic reform and that the fund should relax its hard line.   However, IMF officials have indicated they will not relax monetary constraints and availability of investment capital until the government slashes the country's inflation levels, currently running at around 40%, down to 15%.   The fund has also been criticised for ignoring the informal sector in Mozambique. It says this accounts for 30% of the country's GDP, while senior government sources insist that it is as high as 60% -- and operates as the most important cushion against starvation, rampant crime and redistribution of resources.   Yet average wages for children on the dumbanengues (black markets) range from 30 000 to 75 000 meticais (R10 to R25) a month, plus one meal -- much less than the already abysmal R50 minimum in the formal sector.   The International Confederation of Trade Unions (ICFTU), which held a workshop in Maputo in November last year, urged the IMF to realise that the country's informal sector had mushroomed as a byproduct of the tough austerity programme.   "The government must begin to accord proper attention to the needs of workers in this sector, with a view to integrating them into the formal economy," says the ICFTU report.   The ICFTU also urges the fund to negotiate its new package of financial constraints for the next three years -- which is expected to be finalised in Maputo next month -- with organised labour and emerging civic organisations. The international union organisation also wants measures designed to ensure food security and social spending for vulnerable groups such as women, youth and the aged.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996MozambiqueUS Millionaire Plans Indian Ocean Dreampark Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Eddie Koch   Johannesburg - "Yo! You and you! Yo!" The big Texan is standing beneath the thudding turbine of a chopper in the middle of the Mozambican bush. He is whooping and yelling and pointing at a group of bewildered peasants who huddle behind a tree to protect themselves from a sandstorm whipped up by the helicopter as it swooped into their settlement.   Gradually, above the cacophony, the villagers realise the American is telling some of them to "stop fiddle fucking" (a phrase repeated so often it could be called his company's motto), get into the air and take a look at the natural beauty that surrounds them. This is John Perrott, general manager for flamboyant millionaire James Ulysses Blanchard III, and he is bringing his employer's version of rural development to one of the poorest countries in the world.   The vision of Blanchard Mozambique Enterprises is to create a massive wildlife and tourism mecca stretching from Inhaca Island off Maputo through the staggeringly beautiful Machangulo Peninsula, across the Maputo Elephant Park, where one of Africa's last free-ranging elephant herds lives, and then down to the South African border in the south.   The Machangulo Peninsula has the world's highest forested dunes which jut, south of the island, into a subtropical sea abounding with coral reefs, dolphins, rays, sharks, marine turtles and endangered dugongs (strange sea mammal which gave rise to the mermaid legend because it has breasts to suckle its young).   The $800-million masterplan, outlined in a book called the Black Bible by Blanchard's men, includes hovercrafts to ferry jetsetting tourists from Maputo to Inhaca; a Mississippi Steamer which will become a floating hotel and casino off the island; a chain of upmarket lodges on the beaches and inland lakes that dot the pensinsula; a national park that will be supplied with the big five and other animals in the biggest game restocking exercise ever undertaken in human history; scuba diving schools; game fishing expeditions; an aquarium; and a steam train to ferry tourists through this wonderland of wild game and marine life.   South African consultants have advised Perrott that his dream to import a group of Bushmen from the Kalahari into the Mozambican theme park is likely to discredit the project. So has he given up the idea? "Hell no! If I get my way, I'll bring some of them little guys out here. Can you imagine tourists on the steam train looking out of one window and seeing elephants and rhino? Then they'll look out of the other and see the little bastards running around with their loin clothes and poison-tipped arrows ... The way I see it we'll bring them rhino here and save them from going extinct so why not bring the little guys who are also going extinct?"   It is unlikely that either the Botswana or Mozambique governments will grant permission for Bushmen to be part of the scheme. But the masterplan is being taken seriously by the government in Maputo.   The biggest obstacle in Perrott's way is that in 1987, at the height of Renamo's civil war, the Frelimo-led government granted South African timber giant Sappi a concession to plant more than 30 000 hectares of land with a plantation of bluegum trees -- in partnership with two Mozambican firms.   The Maputo government's aim was to bring a big South African business into the area as a bulwark against bands of Renamo rebels, who waged a destructive civil war in the area, with clandestine support from elements in the South African military.   Little thought was given, at that stage, to the fact that the concession zone is part of an incredibly rich area of plant diversity, known as the Maputaland Centre of Endemism, and that the commercial plantation will destroy botanical species which occur no where else on Earth and also one of the last tropical grasslands left in southern Africa.   An environmental impact study commissioned by Sappi has recognised that the plantation could have serious negative impacts on the biodiversity and water resources of southern Maputo province and has recommended the planted area be reduced from 32 000 to 21 000 hectares so the bluegums can be kept away from rivers and inland lakes in the area. The study points out that the plantation, which could earn Mozambique some R80-million (about $23-million) a year and create 12 000 new jobs (not all of them full-time), does not prevent other companies from implementing ecotourism programmes in the Elephant Park and on the Machangulo Peninsula.   But Perrott will have none of this. The Blanchard proposal, he explains, could bring in an investment of $800-million and will create 20 000 jobs in the long run. However, it depends on "critical mass", a realisation of the grand plan, and it cannot have a patch of bluegums in the middle of it.   So James Ulysses Blanchard III has presented an ultimatum to the Mozambicans. He will not go ahead unless Sappi is out.   Perrott's job is to persuade the local population and the media that his boss is right, which is why he is now in the middle of the bush with a chopper and a convoy of four-by-fours conducting an exercise in what the newspaper contingent on the trip dubbed the Texas School of Community Communication.    While the local chief, his wife and two other volunteers from the village are taking a flip in the helicopter, the Texan begins dishing out colourful   T-shirts with a huge map of southern Mozambique on the front proclaiming that the area is now a national park. The logo on the back says -- in English even though the villagers speak only Shangaan or Portuguese -- "Nix to water guzzling bluegums".   Women, men and children scramble for the T-shirts while a group of men gather around Perrott and his Mozambican translator. "Tell them they gonna have shares in this project," says Perrott. "The elephants we bring here are gonna belong to them too. Now you tell them that in your best Shingaan (sic)."   Perrott insists that a democratic approach is vital for conservation to work and that his company will treat the local communities as equal partners. "We're gonna put a fence up and make this place a national park and they will be able to choose. We gonna come here and say: 'Okay, now you're in a national park. Your village can either get fenced in or you can have them wild animals walking right through your main street'."   Early in February the Cabinet will meet in Maputo to decide on the bluegum-plantation-versus-ecotheme-park row. The debate has become Mozambique's equivalent of the St Lucia controversy in South Africa and is likely to be the biggest and most complex economic decision the Mozambican government has ever had to make.   Cabinet members appear divided on the issue. The agriculture ministry favours the plantation because it is ready to proceed and will bring immediate jobs to the depressed area. The environment ministry wants the ecotourism plan because the plantation will cause irreversible damage to Mozambican wildlife while it provides raw materials for the South African paper industry.    Another source of concern in the Cabinet is that Blanchard -- a cold-war warrior from the 1980s with close links to far-right groups in the US --  has good friends in Renamo and also the Inkatha Freedom Party in KwaZulu-Natal.   For the time being though, it appears that opinion in Maputo's government and intellectual circles is swinging Blanchard's way. The government will insist on a proper land-use plan and assurances that the ecotourism project will not be used to benefit Renamo during the next elections, or link up with seccessionist movements in KwaZulu-Natal. It also plans to set up a group of monitors to ensure that the rhetorical commitment to a partnership with the local landowners is put into practise.   But it now seems that the man who once bankrolled a rebel army to wage a war of incredible destruction and brutality (the US State Department once described Renamo atrocities as worse than those of the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia) is likely to be rewarded with control over a huge chunk of Mozambique's richest province.   It is just one of the many paradoxes that pervade this poor country. "To understand it," says one of the officials who works with Perrott on the project, "you must realise that Mozambique in the past hasn't had bulldozers that work. Now we have one that does."-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Arts and Culture Madonna Of The MarginsMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Ricardo Dunn   Johannesburg -  Mexican artist Frida Kahlo appears on T- shirts, calendars and in stage plays. Why are we so fascinated by her?   Little Frida, a cafe catering to the lesbian and gay community in West Hollywood, is a shrine to the memory of Mexican cult-painter Frida Kahlo. Surrounded by neo-Mexican decor, inspired by Kahlo's house in Mexico City, you can even order a "Frida salad". Little Frida is but one outpost in a merchandising empire that churns out T-shirts, earrings, aprons, clocks, pins, calenders and posters bearing Kahlo's now world-famous images. You might even come upon such fetishistic objects as Frida Kahlo masks.   Kahlo's life has been documented in Spanish, English, German, French and Japanese. A number of serious biographies can be found on the shelves of bookshops and museums; one has even been written for children. She has been the subject of documentaries, feature films, stage plays -- a character becomes obsessed with her in Harry Kalmer's Frida Kahlo's Eyes, now running at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre -- numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing. In May 1989 Elle magazine ran a 16-page feature on Kahlo as embodying the "spirit of Mexico", while in Vogue of February 1990 there was a 10-page interpretation of the "romance of Frida Kahlo". It comes as no surprise that Madonna has invested a sizeable sum in the hopes of bringing the Kahlo myth to the silver screen.   So, who was Frida Kahlo? And what is it about this strikingly beautiful but tragically handicapped artist, who painted her life story on tin and masonite, that has inspired a huge cult following?   Kahlo began painting as a teenager in Mexico City in the 1920s, while recovering from a near-fatal bus accident in which she was impaled on a metal pole. At 21 she married renowned muralist Diego Rivera. Although she lived in a conservative, patriarchal culture, and in the heyday of murals, when a woman making small, highly personal paintings could not win much respect, she valued her idiosyncratic talent. Kahlo challenged and refashioned social codes, sometimes by cross- dressing -- appearing in photographs or paintings in men's clothing -- or by montaging her head on to the bodies of male patriarchs.   Her self-portraits express the burdens that weighed on her: unbearable physical pain, the grief that Rivera's affairs prompted, her homesickness when living abroad and her sorrow at not being able to bear a child.   It is tempting to draw parallels between the tragic life of Van Gogh, an artist recently made "sexy" by the media, and that of Kahlo. But Van Gogh is known primarily for his work. In the case of Kahlo, the popular image is of the artist herself: the characteristic eyebrows which she connected to create the illusion of masculinity, the elaborate hair, the light moustache which she darkened, and, of course, the dressy Mexican traditional costumes which she adopted to affirm her identity and to hide her broken body. It is her appearance, not her art, that has graced the pages of Elle and Vogue.   Despite Kahlo's larger-than-life standing, she painted less than 150 pictures in her brief career, with barely half of them considered top-notch. Admired by Picasso and adored by the Surrealists, she held only two shows during her lifetime. Today, prices for her works have skyrocketed to more than $3-million a piece.   The current fascination with Kahlo began in the 1970s, when her work generated excitement in the women's liberation movement. But it was Hayden Harera's 1983 biography of Kahlo, simply titled Frida, which elevated the painter to the level of superstar.    Looking at Kahlo's contemporary appeal, Harera writes that '"as a Hispanic woman, a bisexual, an invalid and an artist, Kahlo had all the qualifications for a cult figure; she embodied everything not straight, male and Anglo ... For a people preoccupied with psychological health, fearful of Aids and appalled by drug abuse, the gritty strength with which she endured her illness is salutory. Although her painting records specific moments in her life, all who look at them feel that Frida is speaking directly to them."   This, many say, has led to the representation of Kahlo as a kind of mascot of marginalisation. It is the portrayal of Kahlo as a victim that has encouraged the many myths that have been formulated around her. Stories of her childhood accident and her obsessive relationship with Rivera become more brutal and bizarre as they are retold. One story maintains that Kahlo's clothes were ripped from her body during the bus accident. As she lay naked, a bag of gold-dust that a fellow traveller was carrying split open and covered the artist's body. But it is not only devotees who have enjoyed fabricating fantastic twists to Kahlo's already unconventional life. The artist herself, although born in 1907, insisted she was born in 1910 -- the start of the Mexican Revolution.    So Kahlo herself contributed to her status as a symbol of cultural diversity -- a status some critics say has diluted the significance of her work. Yet by demystifying the work of Kahlo and other artists the privileged doors of the art world are opened to consumers of popular culture. In a 1992 travelling exhibition organised by the Studio Museum of Diego Rivera in Mexico City, a number of "Fridita" artists participated, while cross- dressing performance artists paid campy homage to Kahlo. Many gay artists find Kahlo, who paraded her liaisons with other women, a source of strength because of her unconventional approach to gender.   Parodoxically, although Kahlo is considered a populist, she was intensely annoyed when she noticed that some of her admirers were attempting to adopt her meticulously constructed image. As early as 1933 she was mocking: "... some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress _ la Mexicana but the poor souls only look like cabbages and to tell the truth they look absolutely impossible".

Few were aware that it is almost exactly 10 years ago that she was a prizewinner in the Unisa International Singing Competition in Pretoria.   Cassello took third place in what was arguably the best field ever assembled for this competition. Her fellow victors are also household names today: Sumi Jo is the queen of twittering coloratura sopranos, while Marilyn Mims is a regular at New York's Metropolitan Opera.   Cassello, an American whose family hails from Naples, won a string of vocal competitions during the 1980s. As the 1985 winner of the Pavarotti Competition in Modena, she sang Musetta in Puccini's La Boheme with Pavarotti as Rudolfo. After her European debut the same year, she travelled the globe, giving more than 200 performances as the Queen of the Night in Mozart's Die Zauberflste.    Today she sings a wide repertoire, including all the major Mozart roles and Verdi heroines such as Leonora in Il Trovatore, Gilda in Rigoletto and Violetta in La Traviata. Her Gilda has already proved to be rather special: she made her La Scala debut in this role under the baton of Riccardo Muti, and was acclaimed last year when she sang as Gilda opposite the current tenor heartthrob, Roberto Alagna.   On the evidence of her Pavarotti concert, Cassello (who, admirers will be sad to hear, has not yet made any recordings) is one of the most versatile sopranos around. In one evening she was a moving Mimi in Puccini's La Boheme, an agonising Violetta, and a powerful Lucia in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.   One can only hope someone from Pact Opera was there. A house that has been so unlucky in the repertoire in which Cassello excels will never be forgiven if it fails to secure the services of this exciting singer, in the early stages of what promises to be an astounding career.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Arts and Culture Pavarotti Against All OddsMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)   Johannesburg - They trampled through the dust in their droves to hear the rotund tenor from Modena: elderly matrons in bridesmaids' dresses, beautiful youngsters in cocktail minis and clumpy designer shoes, and sensible folk in gear more befitting the rugby stadium in which the concert was held. Inside, vendors of snacks and cold-drinks cried out their wares, seemingly oblivious to the occasion.   Not even a brief downpour could dampen the determination of the assembled throng to hear their idol. A pity, then, that the circumstances should have been so unfavourable. Over a woefully inadequate sound system Pavarotti sounded like he was singing on a scratchy 78 recording; bad acoustic planning had the singers' voices echoing around the stadium, and the odd sound balance had the orchestra playing far away. And the giant television screens which were supposed to allow one a close-up view of the singers mostly flickered and went blank.   How does one judge the quality of any performance under these circumstances? With great difficulty. What was clear was that, at 60, Pavarotti's voice is still in excellent condition when amplified and not subject to the strain of projecting without help in a big auditorium. One was struck by the ease of his delivery, by those hallmark top notes, and by his unique ability to sculpt the Italian texts exquisitely.   On the other hand, there was frustration at the sameness of his characterisations and at his predictable recipe for pleasing the masses: his matter-of-fact vocal delivery, slightly rushed, with top notes being belted out for all their worth and sustained far longer than required by the composers. And then there was the surprising memory lapse in the middle of Che gelida manina, an aria he must have sung literally hundreds of times around the world.   It was only in the closing Neapolitan songs and E lucevan le stelle from Puccini's Tosca that one heard a true artist at work.   Rightly, the greatest applause was reserved for soprano Kathleen Cassello, who outsang and outacted her mentor in their duets and her solo excerpts. Her heartfelt E strano from La Traviata and closely characterised Si, mi chiamano Mimi from La Boheme brought the house down.   Conductor Marco Armiliato impressed with his understanding of the various operatic styles on the programme. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the ragged National Symphony Orchestra and the surprisingly hopeless SABC Choir and the Bonisudumo Choristers. Why bother with this odd collection, so clearly unfamiliar with operatic style, when there was a superb opera chorus and orchestra just down the road? It was, perhaps, simply another instance of bad -- should that be arrogant? ---artistic judgment. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BusinessSouth Africa Reconsiders Exchange ControlsMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Simon Segal    Johannesburg - Perhaps the most tricky decision facing South Africa's monetary authorities is when to lift exchange controls.   It might be too slow for some, but South Africa has adopted a phased approach. The abolition of the financial rand system in March last year, the granting of limited permission for financial institutions to swap assets with foreign investors, and the Reserve Bank's (RB) phased withdrawal from the forward cover market all reconfirm the authorities' determination to liberalise South Africa's foreign exchange market and to create an investor-friendly environment for foreigners.   Some see the smooth transition from the dual to a single currency system as an argument for the quick abolition of all exchange controls.   But RB governor Chris Stals' firm conviction is that South Africa must first prepare the way and lead the country into a situation where the lifting of exchange controls is a non-event.   The million-dollar question is when does South Africa reach this situation. Some feel that reserves have improved sufficiently and the exchange rate stabilised satisfactorily that the time is now right to lift exchange controls.   Stals has said it will take to 1997 or 1998. He notes that backlogs have built-up for international diversification in the asset structure of South African investors and is concerned about the huge pent-up demand with institutional investors and managers of portfolio funds for some diversification into foreign assets.    As a start, since July last year, the RB is allowing insurance companies, pension funds, and unit trusts to invest abroad if the investment is swapped by a foreign investment in South Africa, thus leaving no net loss of foreign exchange reserves. By mid-November, the RB had approved asset swaps worth R5,6- billion.   The RB is also reducing its role in the forward foreign exchange market where it allows banks a greater role. The RB's share of forward transactions fell from 18,5% in July to 14,2% in September and its short-term forward book dropped by $5,7-billion from the end of March to the end of November.   Stals' cautious approach is based on the presumption that South Africa must first ensure greater stability in the underlying market forces before entrusting the determination of important prices to market forces.   The RB's exchange rate policy is still one of a floating exchange rate system operating within the constraints of certain foreign exchange controls. In this situation, it is extremely difficult to assess the rand's level.   Stals notes that in a new global environment, where exchange rates are determined by volatile capital movements, the conventional concepts of over/under-valued currencies, based on the principle of purchasing power parity, have little meaning. In today's world the rand can easily appreciate as a result of capital inflows despite a growing deficit on the current account.   Ultimately, net capital inflows and a stable exchange rate cannot be achieved or maintained through superficial intervention or controls. There is no alternative for sound monetary, fiscal and other macro-economic policies. International capital markets will be the adjudicators of these policies.   In this regard, South Africa has virtually fully normalised its international financial relations and cannot ignore the norms and standards for financial discipline.   Over the past year, South Africa has re- established normal relations with multi- national bodies such as the United Nations and the World Bank, and joined various international regional bodies such as the Organisation of African Unity and the African Development Bank. The country obtained various international credit ratings which enabled it to raise new funds on the international capital markets.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BusinessSouth African Currency on the RiseMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)   Johannesburg - The rand has stabilised remarkably compared to those heady days over 1985 to 1993 when it was in a free-fall against all the world's major currencies.   There are numerous ways of looking at a currency's value.   The best measure is to consider its nominal effective value. This is an index comprising a basket of currencies weighted according to the value of transactions South Africa does in that currency.   The Reserve Bank's index, with a base of 100 in 1990, averaged 81,25 in 1993, 73,71 in 1994 and 69,52 in 1995, a depreciation of six percent which is not that different from the gap in the inflation rate between South Africa and its major trading partners. The index is currently at 70.   The real effective exchange rate of the rand, which is the nominal value adjusted for producer price differentials between South Africa and its trading partners, has barely changed from 98,66 in January 1995 to 98,57 in September (the last available figure). In 1994, it averaged 97,18.   Over 1995, the rand depreciated by only two percent against the US dollar (nine percent in 1994), five percent against the British pound (10%), 11% against the Japanese yen (18%) and 16% against the German mark (11%).   Compared to May when the rand was at its year's low, the currency has actually appreciated against the dollar (from 3,7 to 3,64 this week), the pound (5,9 to 5,62) and the mark (2,66 to 2,51).   The average daily turnover rose from $4- billion in the last quarter of 1994 to $4,9- billion in the second quarter of 1995 and $5,2-billion in the third quarter.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BusinessSouth Africa Faces Public Sector Strikes in 1996Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Rowan Callaghan   Johannesburg - A report on strike action in 1995 has shown that, despite disastrous predictions, there were less strikes last year than in previous years.   Compiled by Andrew Levy and Associates, the report said that the 1995 level was the lowest since 1988. But the industrial relations consultancy does not expect the same to happen this year.   "With the new Labour Relations Act there will be a tendency to test its boundaries and this will cause an increase in strike action. It will become easier to go on strike," says Andrew Sparks of Andrew Levy & Associates.    According to the report an estimated 1,6- million mandays -- the number of workers multiplied by the number of days on strike -- - were lost to strikes in 1995. In 1994 the amount of mandays was 3,9-million while in 1993 it was 3,6-million mandays.    The main trigger causing strike action was found to be disputes over wages, "indicating the wide gap between expectations and delivery".   "I think the reason there have been fewer days lost is because it seems as if there is an increased maturity between both parties, management and unions," comments Sparks.   This maturity is not yet evident in the public sector and among state parastatals where the majority of strike action took place.    Sparks attributes this in part to the fact that strikes in these sectors were only allowed recently and "both management and workers are therefore relatively new to the negotiating process".    He is confident, however, that the maturity in the private sector would eventually spread to the public sector.   However, he predicts that most of the strike action this year will still take place in the public sector for some time to come.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BusinessSatellite Group Plans Pan-African LinksMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Leon Perlman   Johannesburg - South Africa recently hosted a special meeting for Rascom, a pan-African satellite organisation dedicated to providing Africa with its own satellite for relaying telephone, data and television signals.   African countries are paying up to R1,5- billion a year through obligatory routing of intra-African telephony traffic through Europe.    The 120-delegate meeting in Cape Town provided the first detailed implementation plan for pooling African satellite requirements, currently spread over some 11 Intelsat satellites.   With the substantial loss of first-world country business to high-capacity fibre optic cabling, Africa is seen by satellite companies as the next revenue growth point.    The first Afrocentric Rascom satellite, the R750-million Intelsat 804, is under construction by Lockheed and is scheduled to be launched in the first quarter of 1997.    This should be followed by the launch of the Intelsat 805. Both satellites are expected to be launched into orbit by Chinese Long March rockets.    The 804 will provide high-power coverage of the entire African continent, South America, parts of Europe and the Middle East, and even the east coast of the United States.    "We aim to pool African resources to create a network for 17 African countries for their domestic television, data and telephony needs. We believe that the best way for Africa to be developed is via a regional approach to be able to show a market big enough to attract regional as well as international players," Intelsat group director Hamadoun Toure told the delegates.   But while the 804 would pool the capacity needs of African nations currently served by some nine Intelsat spacecraft, Toure says that some services will not be moved -- primarily because of the need for costly upgrades to earth station equipment.    The capacity on the 804 -- which is still under construction -- is already swamped and another satellite will be ordered. The 805 will be the first dedicated land-mass African satellite, orbiting in geo-stationary orbit above Zaire.    Many of the Rascom delegates expressed concern about funding for the project. Intelsat requires a prepayment of more than US$200- million.    Telkom's presence at the meeting surprised many observers considering it is not an official Rascom signatory.    However, the three Telkom representatives all played an active part in the deliberations. Most of the capacity on the proposed 805 satellite has already been requested by Telkom.    This appears to dovetail with Telkom's plans to integrate its planned South Africa to Far East (SAFE) fibre cable with the intra-African Rascom 805 satellite network.    Telkom is likely to contribute handsomely in proportion to its usage of the 804 and 805 satellites. It is the largest Intelsat user in Africa by far.    Sources in Rascom say that South Africa's official entry into the organisation will occur within months, if not weeks. They say that these assurances have been already been given by Telkom chairman Dikgang Moseneke.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BeninVoodoo Receives Official NodAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)   BENIN - Africa's traditional ancestor worship and appeasement of the spirits is now officially fashionable in the small West African nation of Benin.   The government of President Nicephore Soglo declared January 11 a national holiday to mark the recognition of voodoo as a religion. Voodoo is a religion based on belief in witchcraft and magical rites.   Westerners still refer to voodoo variously as a "cult", "culture", "animistic" or "paganism".   The curtain-raiser to the installation of voodoo as an officially recognised religion was the "Ouidah 92", the first festival of voodoo culture and arts which took place from February 8 to 18, 1993 in Ouidah some 45 kilometers west of Benin's capital, Cotonou.   At the time, the organisers of the international event which was opened by President Soglo, took care to suppress the religious basis of voodoo.   He was accompanied by two high priests of voodoo - Sossa Guedehongue and Dagbo Hounon.  It was a carnival affair.   At the inauguration of the festival, President Soglo emphasised that voodoo was the common link between Benin -- indeed the whole of the west coast of Africa that had provided the slaves during the era of slave trade -- and the black diaspora of the Americas and the Caribbean.  Many of the guests came from Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago and West Africa.   The President pointed out that at least 4 million out of Benin's 7.5 million people worship ancestors or spirits at one time or another. Those are clearly staggering figures for a country that is regarded mainly Catholic, with Islam considered the second mainstream religion.   Benin is a poor country whose economy was ruined by the misguided marxist military dictatorship of former ruler Matthew Kerokou.   By 1990, 40,000 civil servants had not been paid their salaries for at least six months.  Yet by 1992/1993 so highly regarded was the voodoo festival that the government undertook to pay CFA francs 400 million (US dollars 800,000) of the CFA francs 800 million (US dollars 1.6 million) budget for the whole extravaganza.  France offered about CFA francs 100 million.  The rest of the money came from the diaspora.   Soglo claims 3 million Beninois or descendants of Beninois, migrated abroad either by the effects of slavery in the 18th Century or in later years.   Voodoo preceded slavery on the west coast of Africa by three centuries.  The practice thrived in West Africa by the 15th century.   Alan Anderson of the Centre for the Study of New religions in Birmingham, United Kingdom says Beninois are not alone in the practice of voodoo.   "Voodoo is the traditional religion of West Africa," he emphasised. It was suppressed in the colonial period when it was equated with witchcraft and it continued to be sensationalised by magazines and Western writers in modern times.   One of the prominent aspects of voodoo is appeasement of spirits through sacrificial offerings of children and domestic animals. Traditional liquor is offered as "libation" for the purpose.   It is not yet clear how the Catholic Church in Benin views the latest developments.  Officially it has the largest number of followers of any one religion in the country.   However it is interesting to note that the head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II, during his most recent visit to Africa last September, remarked about the similarity between the Communion with Saints in Catholicism and ancestor worship in African religions.   Indeed, at the Resurrection Gardens in Nairobi, the Pope received an African traditional priest who officially blessed him.   Dr. Anderson points out that African traditional religions are being revived in many places in Africa.  Very often, traditional religions and Christianity exist side by side in Africa.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996KenyaMilk Cooperative In Dire StraitsAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)   NAIROBI - The giant Kenya Co-operative Creameries (KCC), is broke and cannot pay farmers over Kshs.1.5 billion (US$.27 million) owed them for deliveries made since August 1994, the Minister for Agriculture, Livestock Development and Marketing Mr. Simeon Nyachae admitted in a press statement on January 16.   Minister Nyachae noted that a total restructuring was necessary if KCC was to be rescued.  "There is need to re-formulate the future role of KCC in the short and long-term," Nyachae said in the press statement.  "KCC continues to pay over Kshs.30 million (US$ 54,000) interest per month for its overdraft and farmers are not being paid," said the Minister.   The Agriculture Minister added; "In the short-term , this would mean immediate selling of stocks to pay farmers and clear the overdraft, overhaul the management, and introduce a new pricing system to take care of both domestic and external markets."   About the medium and long-term plans for saving KCC from imminent collapse Nyachae said that there was need to legally establish the status of KCC and "hand over the responsibility (of running it) to the original owners (farmers) who can decide to run it either as a co-operative or a company."   The giant dairy farmers' organisation is said to be holding rotting products worth Kshs.2.4 billion (US$50 million) in its store.  The items cannot be sold either locally or abroad due to "poor management and poor marketing strategies."   A section of the local press reported that the "cash strapped Kenya Co-operative Creameries has in the past sabotaged private individuals out to market the company's products out."  It further said that the organisation was receiving 800,000 litres of milk daily but was able to sell only 500,000 litres, with the rest going to waste.   Kenya Farmers Association (KFA) Chairman, Mr Mark Too also called for the immediate decentralization of the KCC.  He said that farmers and the public have been kept in the dark about the operations of KCC. "Previous directors used their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of farmers," he added.   Since its inception in 1925, the Kenya Co-operative Creameries has grown to become a monopoly in dairy processing and distribution in Kenya.  Today, KCC is the oldest and largest co-operative society with more than 40,000 members in the country.  It operates 11 collecting centres, 11 processing factories and has workforce of well over 4,000 employees.   In 1968 the Kenya government rationalised milk distribution by withdrawing operating licenses from KCC's main competitors thus giving it monopoly.   For the next decade KCC was rapidly expanded through provision of government loans and government guaranteed external loans.  In 1980, the company surplus reportedly started declining and in 1987 KCC started experiencing loses altogether.   Between May 25, 1989 and August 9, 1991 KCC was managed by a government appointed management commission, following an outcry from dairy farmers about mismanagement of their organisation and an appeal from them to save it from imminent collapse.  The commission was also enjoined to write a prescriptive report which is yet to be made public.   In the second half of 1994, KCC started experiencing serious financial and management problems and the government appointed a task force in May 1995 which has run the dairy firm to date under the parent Ministry of Co-operative Development.   Meanwhile dairy farmers across the country have added their voices to the nationwide condemnation of KCC's management.  Dairy farmers from the North Rift region, one of the leading milk producing parts of the country, are reported to have "called for the total overhaul of KCC management and disbanding of the appointed Task Force."   "The government should restructure KCC with the aim to streamline its operations to reduce overhead costs and have the current Task Force disbanded," Richard Barkoyet, one of the farmers' representatives said.   Commenting on the cash strapped KCC, the Chairman of the Kenya Farmers' Association Mr. Mark Too said; "I can only compare KCC to a vehicle which veers off into a ravine.  You need a broader perspective to rescue what remained of it than the usual cranes."-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996UgandaCardinal Attacks Tax SystemAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)   KAMPALA - The head of the Uganda Catholic Church Cardinal Emmanuel Wamala has attacked the country's tax authority saying it is "anti-people".   Speaking during the launching of the Catholic Church-owned Nsambya Hospital Development Fund in the Ugandan capital on January 15, Cardinal Wamala decried the "brutal high taxation of medicines and other essential Ugandan imports".   Cardinal Wamala told Christians at the function presided over by President Yoweri Museveni; "Taxation should be aimed at improving the well being of common people --- but to tax medicines meant to save their lives is not only making their lives difficult but condemning them to death."   Cardinal Wamala's remarks come at a time when the Ugandan business community is complaining about high tax rates in the basically import oriented economy of this East African country.   The Chairman of Uganda Importers, Exporters and Traders Association Captain Mike Mukula, told President Museveni during a meeting he held with the association on January 16 that the Anti-Smuggling Unit of Uganda's tax body is so high-handed that it confiscates a loaf of bread from a poor Ugandan simply because he has bought it from neighbouring Kenya, where 90 per cent of Uganda's manufactured goods are imported from.   But President Museveni defended his government's tax policy saying it is meant to protect up-coming Ugandan industries from foreign products.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996GhanaReligious Leaders Intervene in Presidential RowAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)   ACCRA - Religious leaders in Ghana announced on January 16 they had met Vice-President Kow Arkaah in a move to heal the deepening rift between him and President Jerry Rawlings.   The row between the two men, rooted in a split between the formerly allied political parties they respectively lead, came to a head when Arkaah accused Rawlings of punching him during a December 28 cabinet meeting.   Rawlings has since repeatedly and publicly suggested that Ghana's parliament should find a way to get rid of Arkaah, but Arkaah has said he would not bow out voluntarily under any circumstances since the president has no power to sack him.   But two dozen leaders from six religious bodies, including Ghana's Catholic Bishops' Conference, the Council of Independent Churches and the Federation  of Muslim Councils, met Arkaah on January 15 to work towards resolving the dispute.   The delegation's spokesman and general secretary of the Christian Council of Ghana, David Asante Dartey, said the six bodies were very concerned about the rift and wanted to ensure the prevailing peace in the country is not threatened.   Dartey commended Arkaah's prompt response to the delegation's request for an audience and said a similar request had been made to the president.   "It is because of my love for peace and conviction in finding a lasting solution to the country's problems that I consented to meet the religious bodies," Arkaah said of the meeting.   Before the alleged attack, Arkaah had claimed cabinet meetings were a focus for high-level corruption in Ghana.   According to the official version of events, Rawlings did not assault the Vice-President, but simply pushed him to encourage his departure from the meeting on account of the insults he had allegedly made.   The intervention by the religious leaders came shortly after Arkaah, who had accused Rawlings of punching him during the cabinet meeting, boycotted the opening of Parliament on January 12.   "It would appear as if I offer myself as a punching bag to offer someone political enhancement," Arkaah said, referring to "insults" from Rawlings and his supporters which followed Arkaah's allegation that the President had punched him in full view of ministers during the December 28 cabinet meeting.   "Today's occasion was one only for the president to make a statement, just like last January 8 parade. I attended the parade and was subjected to a tirade of insults without the opportunity to exercise the right of reply, so I wanted to avoid a repetition," Arkaah said.   During anniversary celebrations on January 8, Rawlings said of Arkaah:  "He tends to subvert the government from within."   During his 90-minute address on January 12, Rawlings repeated a suggestion made on January 8 that Parliament should find a way to sack the vice president.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BurundiTutsi Extremists Bring Capital To A StandstillAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)   BURUNDI - Extremists from Burundi's Tutsi minority brought business in the capital Bujumbura to a standstill on January 16, the second day of a strike launched to force President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya to resign.   Despite a major deployment by crack army troops, residents of the troubled city appeared unwilling to go to work for fear of ethnic clashes, and banks, many offices and public services did not open their doors.   The standstill was brought about without violence by a Tutsi movement, Youth Solidarity for the Defence of Minorities (SOJEDEM), led by Deo Niyonzima and Tutsi extremist organisations, which accuse Ntibantunganya, a Hutu in charge of a shaky coalition, of conniving with Hutu extremist gangs fighting a guerrilla war against the Tutsi- dominated army.   With its turnout early last week the army clearly distanced itself from the extremists, but it is frequently accused of collaborating with them in the small central African highland nation, where relief workers estimate that ethnic killings claim about 30 lives every day.   Hardliners in the main Tutsi opposition party, the Union for National Progress (UPRONA), had also planned to hold a demonstration in front of the party's headquarters, which were under tight military security.   UPRONA radicals want their party to withdraw confidence in Ntibantunganya and pull out of the coalition and the national assembly, formed in September 1994 in a bid to stave off mass bloodletting between Tutsis and Hutus.   Burundi, like neighbouring Rwanda, is a powderkeg where 50,000 people were massacred after the first elected Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, was killed in a foiled military coup in October 1993, which the then government survived.   On January 15, diplomats said the authorities had put up a remarkably united front against the Tutsis, but the extremists gained ground the next day despite an overnight warning from Defence Minister, Lieutenant-Colonel Firmin Sinzoyiheba, who said he put the Tutsi extremists in the same basket as "those who wreck bridges, sabotage power lines and water supplies -- all those whom we are fighting."   For three months, Bujumbura has been without electricity and has also seen water stoppages caused by sabotage.  The Defence Minister called on the security forces, which have taken a battering from Hutu extremists in attacks to "act with firmness, lucidity and serenity".-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996UgandaCommission To Probe Church DioceseAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)   UGANDA - The Church of Uganda has set up a commission to probe the alleged mismanagement of funds in the south western Anglican Diocese of Mityana.   The Bishop of the diocese, the Right Rev. Wilson Mutebi on January 16 announced that the commission will investigate failure by the diocese to meet its financial obligations during the past seven years.   "It will assist the church to find out whether the problem is with priests, Christians or the administration at the diocese" the Bishop said.   He also announced the suspension of his diocesan secretary Rev. Canon Samuel Kamya who allegedly failed to account for US dollars 7,000.   The bishop's revelations follow a recent declaration by Church of Uganda Archbishop Livingstone Nkoyoyo to the effect that the church would take action against "corrupt and inefficient bishops".   Church of Uganda officials say this announcement by the Anglican Archbishop was facilitated by the amendment of the church's constitution "empowering" the Anglican prelate to discipline bishops in the wrong and take overall charge of the Church affairs.   Anglican Christians here see the move as a result of widespread dissent in the church over alleged corruption and abuse of power by church officials.   Although Archbishop Nkoyoyo did not cite any concrete examples, it is generally believed that he was targeting the Church of Uganda eastern diocese of Busoga where some Christians have accused their Bishop Cyprian Bamwoze of mismanagement of funds and church affairs.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996EthiopiaRebels Broadcast From Former Soviet UnionAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)   NAIROBI -  A rebel Ethiopian group is using a radio transmitter in the former Soviet Union to broadcast propaganda against the Addis Ababa regime of Meles Zenawi.   The transmissions are on shortwave frequencies and appear to have started in early January. According to a spokesman for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) East African radio monitoring facility in Nairobi, Kenya, the Oromo Liberation Front started the evening transmission early this year after the apparent discontinuation of their broadcasts from transmitters in the United States where they were first monitored last year.  Such broadcasts are illegal in the US.   The BBC monitoring facility believes the radio station is based in the Ukraine "where there is a lot of spare transmission capacity at the moment."  The contact address for the station is given as Berlin, Germany.   The shortwave signal is described as "good though somewhat noisy."   The rebel station does not put out news broadcasts, though it carries strongly worded commentaries, critical of the government in Addis Ababa.  Despite the mid-1995 devolution of power to the provinces that allowed the various regions in Ethiopia to enjoy autonomy, the radio accuses the Tigrean people - the tribe of the executive Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, of taking the rest of the country for a ride.   Some correspondence is also read on the radio.  One letter asked why there are no battle reports on the broadcasts giving information about the war waged in Oromia by the Oromo Liberation Front.  The presenter promised that battle reports should be expected in the near future.   The Oromo people are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia (indeed in Africa) with a population of 30 million of Ethiopia's 55 million strong population.   The geographical location of Oromia, (homeland of the Oromo) is southern Ethiopia.  It covers more than 500,000 square kilometres of the territory - double the size of the United Kingdom.   Many Oromos say successive Ethiopian regimes dating back to Abyssinian King Menelik II, in the 1880s, looked down on or segregated Oromo people.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZimbabweCatholic Church Refuses To Register Its Own All Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)   HARARE - The Roman Catholic Church in Zimbabwe has refused to register its relief agency, the Catholic Development Commission (CADEC), under a controversial new law, the Zimbabwe News Agency (ZIANA) reported here on January 16.   Church spokesman Oskar Wermter told ZIANA that Catholic bishops were unhappy that the new act, which sailed through parliament last year gave a cabinet minister absolute powers over non-governmental organisations (NGOs) without providing any legal recourse.   "The bishops are unhappy with the act, which gives the minister enormous powers and there is no legal redress," Wermter said.   "Voluntary organisations cannot defend themselves even if the minister receives false information.  Natural justice demands that there is recourse to law," he added.   The church warned that if it is pressurised to register, it will challenge the matter in court to determine the constitutionality of the Private Voluntary Organisations Act, an amendment of the 1974 Welfare Act designed to monitor NGOs.   When the bill was  enacted, many NGOs were concerned but reacted cautiously, though of late some have openly criticised the act, which puts them under the direct scrutiny of the government.   The Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS) last month said that the act went far beyond legitimate oversight of NGOs by the government, threatening their independence and opening the way to governmental abuse and corruption.   ZIMRIGHTS said the new law allowed the Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister to take over the running of NGOs on a number of "vague and ill-defined" grounds.   The human rights organisation said that members of NGOs could now easily be "suppressed" for criticising actions taken by the government and the new law "is intended to serve as a club against outspoken NGOs in the future."   A number of international NGOs operate in Zimbabwe, providing relief and development programmes.   Meanwhile, Zimbabwe's former Prime Minister Bishop Abel Muzorewa launched his campaign for the March presidential elections on January 17 with a vitriolic attack on President Robert Mugabe, likening him to "a cruel, drunken father."   Muzorewa, 71, who was prime minister briefly before independence in 1980, said he had returned to active politics because he was "shocked and heartbroken by the abortion of our independent nationhood at the hands of Mugabe and his associates."   He accused Mugabe and his ruling Zimbabwe African National Union- Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party of "instilling fear among people of all races in Zimbabwe, so that they now live and behave like rats that have been chased by cats all day."   Muzorewa is one of only two challengers who have announced their intention to run against Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly 16 years.  The other is the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, who faces trial in February on charges of plotting to kill Mugabe and overthrow the government.   All three men, in their 70s, are veterans of the nationalist struggle that ousted the white-minority government of Ian Smith in the 1970s.   Sithole's ZANU-Ndonga party currently holds two seats in the 150-seat parliament, while Muzorewa will be standing as a candidate for the United Parties (UP), a coalition of opposition groups which has no MPs.   Muzorewa, a Methodist bishop and conservative politician, served in parliament for four years after independence but was arrested in 1984 on security charges.   He was released before elections in 1985, but after his party failed to secure a single seat he quit politics. Speaking on January 17 at a news conference here which was packed with his supporters but with government-controlled television noticeably absent, Muzorewa said corruption and mismanagement since independence had plunged Zimbabwe into the "worst poverty and worst unemployment ever experienced."   Muzorewa pointed to Mugabe's recent salary increase of 100 per cent at a time of economic hardships and steep rises in the cost of staple foodstuffs as a sign of the government's arrogance and insensitivity.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996KenyaMethodist Church Consecrates First Woman BishopAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)   NAIROBI - The Rev. Maureen Elizabeth Jones made history on January 14 by becoming the first woman bishop in the African continent.   She was consecrated Bishop of the Methodist Church in Kenya at St. Peter's Methodist Church, Langata, in the outskirts of Kenya's capital, Nairobi.  The ceremony was conducted by Presiding Bishop of the Methodist Church in Kenya, Bishop Zablon Nthamburi.   Bishop Jones, who was born in the small town of Stamford, Lincolnshire, England on May 24, 1939, arrived in Kenya in January 1969 as a lay woman worker.  She was initially based in the Tana River and Lamu Districts in the Coastal Province.   Rev. Jones recalls that she worked with women and children in that region "in the field of development, both physical and spiritual."   After five years of service she proceeded to St. Paul's United Theological College, Limuru, to help in the training of pastors' wives.  In 1976 she went for theological training "and preparation for the ordained ministry" at Bristol College in the United Kingdom.   Rev. Jones returned to Kenya at the invitation of the Methodist Church of Kenya in July 1979, served as a minister on probation for one year and was ordained in the "ministry of Word and Sacrament" in June 1980.   She served as a minister at the Kariokor Methodist Church up to 1985. In 1986 she was transferred to Kariji Circuit in Pwani (Coast) Synod where she worked for the next seven years.  In 1993 she was transferred to the Langata Circuit.   Asked what she felt after beating three other male contestants, Rev. Jones told APS; "To be honest, I did not expect it....I am very moved and very honoured."   A congregant pointed out that Rev. Jones garnered the 83 votes, half of all the votes cast because "she is very dedicated to her work and very sensitive to the needs of her congregation."   Rev. Jones said that working as a bishop, and particularly as a white female bishop among blacks does not make her feel discriminated against.  "I have lived with these people for many years and I have never felt discriminated against," she added.   The history of the Methodist Church in Kenya goes back 133 years when three missionaries of the United Methodist Free Churches arrived in the country.  Thomas Wakefield, James Woolner and Dr. Ludwig Krapf planted the first Methodist Church at Rabai, on Kenya's coast in July 1882.   Later, the church moved to the interior of Kenya arriving in Meru, Eastern province in 1910.  In 1967 the Methodist Church of Kenya became autonomous.  Soon after, it opened missions in Northern Kenya (1967), Western Kenya (1973) and Kwale-Coast- (1977).   In 1994 the church launched an insurance brokerage firm and is currently in the process of establishing a full fledged university. The Methodist Church in Kenya has a following of some 650,000 faithful.   Before coming to Kenya, Rev. Maureen Elizabeth Jones trained and worked as a social worker in the United Kingdom.  She says that she worked "with deprived and disabled children" for 11 years. "I have a great love for young people and this has very much influenced the shape of my ministry here in Kenya," she told APS.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ChadPeace Talks CollapseAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)   FRANCEVILLE, GABON - Round-table talks on the political future of Chad ended in failure here on January 9 after most of the armed rebel groups present refused to sign a framework document to end civil strife and install a democratic system in Chad.   Gabonese President Omar Bongo was forced to put an end to the meeting late on January 9 after the document failed to win enough backing.   "Since you say 'No' then I want the discussions to stop there," Bongo told participants at the meeting, which finally started on January 6, six hours late, with the aim of ending 30 years of civil war in Chad and bringing the Chadian rebels into the democratisation and election process now underway.   The meeting grouped representatives of the Chadian government, legal political parties, trade unions, various associations and armed opposition groups, plus mediators and international observers.   The final document was read out to the participants by Gabonese Foreign Minister Casimir Oye Mba, then signed by Bongo, Chadian President Idriss Deby and President Ange-Felix Patasse of the Central African Republic and Mahamane Ousmane of Niger.   Most of the 12 representatives of legalised parties signed the text, but some abstained along with several representatives of associations and trade unions.   But out of the 15 armed opposition groups present, 13 refused to sign, while the two groups which signed were a faction of the Movement for Democracy and Development represented by Moussa Medella and a recently-created group called AFUD, about which no information was available.   Most of the opposing groups wanted detailed discussions between them before a text could be agreed on and signed, contrary to signing a document followed by discussions.   But when some of the rebel participants called for the resignation of Chadian President Deby, Bongo accused them of coming to Franceville "to sabotage the round-table talks."   Bongo's text had called on all signatories to renounce use of force to conquer and keep power and appealed to them to uphold democratic processes as the only path to a lasting political settlement in Chad.   It also called for immediate ceasefire and amnesty, for armed groups to be transformed into political parties and for defence and security forces to be reorganised "along republican lines."   The meeting was originally scheduled for last December but had to be postponed amid disagreements over the participants from the Chadian side.  All 58 legal political parties in the country wanted to be represented as did the guerrilla groups, which total 15 according to Chadian Prime Minister Djimasta Koibla.  Chad has a population of some 5.5 million people.   Finally it was agreed that the political parties would be grouped, sharing a total of 10 representatives.  Some protested, demanding a greater role, but none refused to take part.   The Gabonese government sent envoys to Chad itself, to Benin, Libya and Algeria to involve the armed groups, while Djimasta Koibla visited Chad's neighbours, including the Central African Republic, Cameroon and Nigeria.   The Chadian Premier said the government's aim was to get the external opposition leaders to return to the country and take part in the normal political process.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Sierra LeoneOusted Leader Flown To GuineaAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)   FREETOWN - Military head of State Captain Valentine Strasser of Sierra Leone was ousted in a palace coup on January 16 and replaced by his deputy and armed forces chief.   Reports say the 29-year-old Strasser was immediately flown by helicopter to neighbouring Guinea (in handcuffs), together with his wife and children.  Captain Strasser now joins the man he overthrew at the end of April 1992, former President Joseph Momoh, who also lives in exile in Guinea.   Meanwhile, the Sierra Leonean government has asked Ghana to grant Captain Strasser political asylum and Ghanaian authorities say the request is under consideration.  Sierra Leone state radio announced that the new leader Brigadier Julius Maada Bio, has imposed a dusk to dawn curfew.   Another report says the new leader of the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) has sacked all government officials seen to be actively involved in party politics.   Director of Defence Information, Lieutenant Colonel Karifa Kargbo, who made the radio announcement, accused Strasser of wanting to cling to power.  "Captain Strasser has been removed from office and has safely left these shores due to his blatant attempts to implement legislation intended to be harmful to the democratic process," Kargbo was quoted saying.   Although diplomats remain sceptical of Brigadier Bio's motive, the new NPRC leader has announced in his first national radio broadcast that elections scheduled for February 26 will go ahead as planned to return the country to democratic civilian rule.   He also called on the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of Foday Sankoh, which has been fighting the government since 1991, to come to the negotiating table without pre-conditions.  Brigadier Bio promised the rebels a general amnesty and urged them to participate in the forthcoming elections.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaSociety Campaigns For Widow's RightsAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)by APS Correspondent   Nairobi - Most human beings are somehow familiar with the feeling of utter loss when a family loses a beloved member.  But not every bereaved family experiences the combined anguish of the absence of a breadwinner and disappearance of family property, thanks to practices that demand that relatives also "inherit" movable belongings left behind by the dead person.  Widows in Zambia, under the umbrella of the Methodist Episcopal Church have formed a society that is fighting for the rights of widows, widowers and their children.   For Charity Changwe, there was nothing wrong with the decision made by her in-laws to shift the funeral gathering of her late husband from her flatlet in Kamenza township to the residence of the deceased's elder brother in the mine township, about two kilometres away in the same Zambian town of Chililabombwe.   After  all, like other countries in Africa, it is a common tradition among Zambian communities to hold lugubrious meetings at the house of the eldest member of the surviving family in a given locality.  In addition, the company flatlet Changwe shared with her late husband, Chris, a surveyor with the giant Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) at the time of his death in hospital on June 26, 1993, was unsuitable for the funeral gathering which demands a log-fire in the yard.   But little did Changwe know she had been tricked.  For, on return to her flatlet a week after interring Chris at Kakoso Cemetery, she found all the goods missing from the house.  She could not believe the sight of her house which now resembled a playground.   Sofasets, dinning table and chairs, a fridge, two beds and mattresses, and other household goods were no longer there.  She was heart broken for the second time in a week.   "I learnt later that on June 29 while we were burying Chris,some men went to the house with a lorry and took all the goods.  My neighbours thought I was shifting from the flat since my husband had passed away," Changwe told a stunned seminar on the plight of widows and their children, held recently in Chililabombwe about 400 kilometres north of the Zambian capital, Lusaka.   To date, she has never seen the goods and efforts to recover anything including the fridge bought from her earnings as a ZCCM mine police constable, failed.   But this young widow is not alone in her predicament.  Many in this Southern African country continue to endure untold suffering at the hands of in-laws, despite the enactment by Parliament of the Laws of Intestate Succession Act and the Wills and Administration of Testate Estates Act, aimed at protecting widows, widowers and their surviving children after the death of their bread winner.   According to the Intestate Succession Act which deals with the distribution of property in a situation where the deceased left no will, the widow or widower is entitled to 20 per cent of the property, 50 per cent goes to the children, the other 20 per cent to the deceased's parents while the remaining ten per cent is given to the dependants, who in this case is the person or persons who are/were maintained by the deceased immediately before death.   The Wills and Administration of Testate simplifies the making of a will and provides for adequate financial and other provisions to be made in a will.   However, the continued suffering of widows and their children is the concern of many sympathisers in Zambia and more so fellow women who congregate under the Women Missionary Society of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Chililabombwe.   With funds from America's Southern University Democratic Governance Project, the women have launched a public awareness campaign "aimed at conscietising the general public and challenging every wing of society through seminars to join in the campaign to fight against wide-spread property grabbing and ill-treatment of widows and orphans," says campaign co-ordinator, Rev. Paul Bupe.   Rev. Bupe says no matter how some people might try to justify this scourge of ill-treatment of widows, the practice remains evil in the eyes of God.   "This cruel act is condemned from the religious point of view.  What the Bible has established let no culture or tradition change, says Bupe who supports his statement by quoting from Exodus 22:22:24 in which God disapproves the act:  "Do not ill-treat any widow or orphan, if you do, I, the Lord will answer them when they cry out to me for help and I will be angry and kill you.  Your wives will become widows and your children will be fatherless."   Ironically, according to Rev. Bupe's observations, Christians are in the forefront in disobeying God's ruling, in most cases on a woman- against-woman basis.   It is the women who make widows crawl on their knees on hard ground for a long distance and smear them with mud and mealie meal (paste from maize meal) on the eve of the burial of their late spouses. Helpless widows are abused in the name of cleansing, God forbid with HIV lurking.   Opening the seminar, Deputy - Mayor of Chililabombwe, Mr. Curp Mwaba said lack of public information on the law of succession is responsible for the suffering of widows.   "Property grabbing and other forms of ill-treatment of widows is as cancerous as AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and must also equally receive corresponding attention," Mr. Mwaba said.   Seminar participants had different views when they cited poverty as one of the causes of property grabbing.  "Many people have turned the death of a relative to be a means of gain.  Like vultures, relatives wait patiently for the demise of a wealthy kin in order to share all his property at the expense of the widow and orphans," a participant said.   Some said jealous sisters of the deceased often exhibit the most hostile attitude towards the widow because they think they are closer to their brother and regard the widow as a stranger.  Such sisters seize the opportunity at funerals to vent out their revenge on the hapless widow especially when she did not receive them well and cared for them when their brother was alive.   Another argued that the situation can be unpleasant in cases where marriages of the sisters were not stable whereas that of the deceased brother was smooth.  It is worse in strained marital relations whereby the widow ends up being blamed for the death of her husband. This is worsened by the belief that "culture demands" that the widow be mistreated.   However, the participants were unanimous that there is no specific yardstick for mistreating widows.  They singled out ignorance about the law of succession among the victims, perpetrators and the law enforcement officers as being major contributing factors to the problem.   As Changwe admits; "I had no idea at the time of my husband's death that laws exist in Zambia to protect widows.  Otherwise, I should have taken the matter to the magistrates court for redress after the police turned me away saying the issue was civil and that it should be dealt with domestically between my family and in-laws."   And, considering that she was five-months pregnant with her first born child, Changwe also feared she would prematurely lose this valuable gift from God in questionable circumstances.  She felt unsafe to antagonise her in-laws over her goods.   "Although I was neither physically harassed nor sexually abused, fear of witch-craft grew in intensity when my pregnancy went beyond nine months.  I gave birth to a baby girl in the eleventh month," she revealed.   In his contribution to the debate, Chililabombwe Magistrate, Mr. Kaengele Mulenga criticised the conduct of the law enforcement officers for displaying ignorance about the law of succession when they are supposed to be knowledgeable.   "In many cases, the police turn away victims reporting the loss of their property believing the matter is of civil nature.  This is not the case as this is a criminal offence which carries custodial sentences for the guilty," he said.   According to Mr. Mulenga, a person found guilty under the law of succession can either be fined a maximum of Kwacha 500,000 (about US dollars 590) or get a jail sentence of three years with hard labour or both fine and imprisonment as the court might determine.   He suggested that police officers under-go orientation courses on succession statutes in order for them to deal with widows' complaints fairly.   Seminar participants who included civil servants, mine and Zambia police officers, the clergy and widows also blamed weak and biased administrators in the distribution of property and corrupt local court justices for the disparities in the dispensation of cases of this nature.   "When a family has a principled and well respected person, very often the administration of property is done according to the law and the widow is protected and cared for," they observed.   Unlike other widows, Changwe's employment as a mine police constable, helped her recover from the shock of losing her property. She is now happily settled in a two-bedroomed ZCCM house in the mine township raising her daughter now aged over two years.   Her advice to potential widows is: "Be brave and have no fear of witch-craft.  Take property-grabbing in-laws to court if need be." Some timely advice indeed.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996AngolaCombatants Agree On Troop EncampmentAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)by APS Correspondent   Luanda - After two-months break in the Angolan peace process, coupled with several incidents of ceasefire violations, the Angolan government and UNITA rebels have taken a major step forward with an agreement on the new composition of the army and the encampment of their excess guerrilla forces.   More than 26,000 soldiers of the former rebel Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) movement will be integrated into a new Angolan defence force of some 90,000 men.  Of the 63,000 ex- guerrillas in Jonas Savimbi's UNITA, 26,000 will join the new army, 200 the air force and 100 the navy.   The figure, announced in the Angolan capital, Luanda on January 15, was decided on at meetings in the past week between members of the general staff of UNITA and the regular armed forces of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) government.   Both UNITA and MPLA, protagonists in Angola's civil war for almost two decades since independence from Portugal in 1975, agreed that other soldiers in their ranks -- some 180,000 men -- will not be demobilised immediately but assigned to a new force responsible for rebuilding civilian and military infrastructure destroyed during the bitter conflict.   The UNITA fighters named to the new defence force in line with a peace pact signed in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994, will be selected once all the former rebels have been disarmed and encamped in 15 sites prepared for them under the United Nations' supervision.   Negotiations on the structure of the future army and the distribution of posts will continue.  The Luanda government has offered UNITA six places on the general staff of the defence force, including that of deputy chief-of-staff, a government source said.   The UNITA representative on the joint peace commission established with the government, Isaias Samakuva, on January 15 went to Bailundo, the movement's headquarters town in central Angola, to consult with Savimbi on Luanda's proposals.   The resumption of military talks is expected to lead to progress in the encampment operation, although no timetable has been fixed.  "We are not yet in a position to confirm the beginning of this operation," a UNITA delegation member said.   On January 12, UNITA declared that it will free all prisoners of war (POWs) it is still holding, a joint commission for verifying peace in the southern African state said.   The release of the POWs -- both military and civilian -- was due to be supervised from this week by the International Committee of the Red Cross, (ICRC) sources said, but did not give the exact number involved.  The government has so far released 341 prisoners, while UNITA has freed 20.   A timetable aimed at putting the Angola peace effort back on a firm track was reached "formally" at a meeting on January 12 between representatives of the rebel group and the joint commission.  It requires   UNITA to bring back to their bases its combatants in three locations -- Negage and Quibaze, both in the north, and Londiibali, in the centre of the country -- by January 20.   The government, meanwhile, is to remove its troops to barracks in Uije and Bengo provinces, both in the north, according to the timetable which was proposed by the UN Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM).   The talks had gone on hold after clashes between fighters from both sides in the north, threatening the success of a peace plan signed in November 1994.  UN sources in Luanda said a list of UNITA officials who would be part of a new Angolan government of national unity would be discussed at the next meeting between President dos Santos and the UNITA  leader Jonas Savimbi.   The United Nations did not say when the meeting would take place, but Angolan radio said it could be held before January 20.  Since the Lusaka peace accord was signed in 1994, UNITA and MPLA have met three times in Zambia, Gabon and Belgium.   Under the Lusaka peace accord, which ended 20 years of civil war in the sprawling former Portuguese colony, the Ministers of Geology and Mines, Trade, Health and Tourism are to be UNITA officials.   Also reserved for the rebel group are seven vice-ministerial positions, including Defence, Interior, Finance and Agriculture, plus three provincial governorships and six ambassadorial posts.   The former rivals are also due to discuss the repatriation of mercenaries they employed during the war.  Last week, the government sent home 460 South Africans who had been fighting on its side, but UNITA claims that Luanda had employed a total of 5,000.   The move forward in the peace process comes as the head of the UN Security Council sought to boost the peace process in Angola by urging President dos Santos and the UNITA opposition leader to meet soon without conditions.   "I appeal strongly to you to build upon progress made in negotiations in the past few days and to do everything necessary to resolve the outstanding issues which are blocking the peace process in Angola," Britain's Sir John Weston wrote on behalf of the 15-member council.   The council expressed "serious concern about reports of continued violations of the ceasefire" as well as slow progress on practical implementation of obligations of peace agreements.   The council said it was expecting a response from the two men via United States ambassador to the Untied Nations Madeleine Albright who was about to set out on a visit to Africa.  That response as well as concrete actions will be "critical factors" as the council considers the possible renewal of the 6,400-man UN mission next month.   On January 4, 50 people were killed in southern Angola during a dawn attack by rebels from the UNITA movement, the governor of the province of Huila Kundi Payama announced in a statement carried by the official Angolan News Agency (ANGOP) monitored in Lisbon the same day.   In the statement, Kundi said that an unknown number of rebels from UNITA took part in the attack on the town of Chivulo, located in Huila province, where the military situation had escalated in recent weeks following the return to the area of a UNITA leader.   The incident came just as the Angolan government and former rebel leaders from the UNITA movement resumed negotiations a day earlier on setting up a national army in line with the November 1994 Lusaka peace accord.   The talks resumed following an emergency meeting in Luanda on January 2 between UN special envoy to Angola Alioune Blondin Beye and representatives from the government and UNITA.   UN officials said that during the meeting, the UN also denounced the Angolan government for allowing one of the army units to capture the town of Kitoke in Uije province during the Christmas holidays.   The incident neither claimed any victims nor sparked any clashes with UNITA soldiers, the officials added.   Clashes between the two sides in recent months had raised fears about the country's commitment to the Lusaka Peace Accord, under which rebels were to disarm and both sides were to quarter soldiers before merging into a new national army.   On December 8, US President Bill Clinton also warned President dos Santos, during a visit to Washington that ceasefire violations in the battle-scarred African nation could jeopardise its improving ties with the United States.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996UgandaNGOs Call For Donor PressureAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 19, 1996 (19960119)by Crespo Sebunya   Kampala - Much has been said about Uganda rising from ruins to become a showcase of a positive economic recovery programme.  But non- governmental organisations here say the same donors who are praising this East African country for its overall statistical progress, should now pressurize the government to address itself to the plight of millions of ordinary Ugandans who are wallowing in poverty.   Residents of Kyotera town some 160 km south of Uganda's capital, Kampala held their breath as tens of military tanks rumbled through their dusty town, wrecking the just tarmacked section of a highway that leads into neighbouring Tanzania.   Military authorities say that some 84 tanks were imported through Tanzania last November, a sign of increasing scale of Ugandan armament programme which is worrying donors who now say the programme accounts for more than 30 per cent of the country's budget.   The collision course between Ugandan government and the donors over defence is not very difficult to discern.  The government explains that security needs are back on the high table because the country feels besieged by hostile neighbours.   President Yoweri Museveni recently said that there are only two countries in the region he is on talking terms with -- Rwanda and Tanzania.  He suspects that other countries harbour rebel groups bent on destabilising Uganda.  "These countries fear a repeat of the type of revolution that happened in Uganda in their countries," Museveni has been quoted saying.   He also believes that beefed up security also guarantees the welfare of investors.  To date, Uganda's Investment Authority has recorded nearly US dollars 2.5 billion but only 10 per cent of the amount has been actually invested in the country.  Among the reasons given for holding back is the uncertainty of this East African country's political situation.   Uganda has however assured "doubting Thomases" that her demobilisation programme would result in a decline in defence spending.  When the National Resistance Movement (NRM) took power in 1986, it built up a force of nearly 130,000 soldiers.  Then, the government reasoned that it had many enemies to fight. At one time 14 rebel groups were operating in the country.  Thus the high defence spending was tolerated.  And as the number of rebel groups was scaled down and the government started demobilising its troops, there was a sigh of relief.   The troops were reduced down to 50,000 and correspondingly defence spending went down.  According to the latest parliamentary report covering the 94/95 financial year, defence spending had dropped to 8 per cent of the national budget.  But then it is picking up again and according to latest figures from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), spending on defence has gone back to 30 per cent.   But the government says there is need to modernise the army.  Mr. Amama Mbabazi, Uganda's Defence Minister is of the opinion that the army is now faced with well armed rebels and therefore needs to improve its efficiency.   He notes that the country has to be guarded against external threat, especially from Sudan where both former President Idi Amin's soldiers under the West Nile Bank Front and Joseph Kony's rebel Lord Resistance Army (LRA) are based.   But many concerned Ugandans believe defence is eating up resources which would otherwise have gone to the improvement of the people's welfare.  Both donors and non-governmental organisation are also worried about the trend in a country whose population is increasingly wallowing in poverty and disease, and want donors to do something about it.   At a poverty alleviation conference held last November in Uganda, the NGOs said that some form of pressure ought to be put on the government so that it responds to the needs of the people.   "The Ugandan government should be made to accept highest social conditionalities in form of higher budget allocation in health and education," Gary Bercker, one of the resource persons at the meeting said.   He said that out of the country's 18 million people, 13 million live below the poverty line.  About 76 per cent of the 2.2 million pupils who enter primary schools do not complete seven years of education and only three per cent make it to university.   Mr. Bercker said donors can prevail upon the government to address the increasing levels of poverty in the country.  "Poverty reduction is still an after-thought and not an integral part of the government policy formulation," he said.   Bercker's concern is shared by the 1400 NGOs operating in Uganda. They say there are many intangible causes of insecurity in the country, especially when the population is dissatisfied with what they get from the government.   NGOs, most of whom interact with one another and with the people, have proved to be spokespersons for the population.  They have served as an alternative to the government in availing the much needed services, a quality that puts them in a better position to understand what are likely to be causes of social conflicts.   Social disruptions and discontent have increasingly been demonstrated through industrial strikes, especially by government workers.  Most dramatic was the strike by doctors who felt that their demand for better pay among other conditions has not been met.  Railway workers and teachers too have expressed their grievances through similar demonstrations.   "The government should look into the issue of equity which requires that the distribution of benefits from growth must be addressed, if the poor are not to be further marginalised," Dr. Fred Opio, the Makerere University Executive Director for Economic Policy Research said.  His concern was that the government is yet to show commitment to the plight of the poor at a time when there are increasingly huge sums of money saved from the ongoing economic reform programmes.   A statistical bulletin released by the Ministry of Finance in June 1995 says Uganda saved up to US dollars 100 million in programmes such as the retrenchment of 148,000 civil servants.  The publication also notes that the privatisation programme allowed the country to collect nearly US dollars 90 million through privatisation receipts.   It was hoped that this money would be utilised in the improvement of much needed services.  For instance, the World Bank says that the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) is in great financial distress.  The board needs US dollars 100 million annually to be able to extend its services to the different areas of the country.   But then, this should have been possible if the monies saved from the privatisation were applied to improve these services.  But when the report on privatisation was read, it was discovered that some of the money has been lent to private investors who have bought some of the companies, much to the annoyance of the parliamentarians.   Nevertheless the government says that it has embarked on four measures to improve public resource expenditure.  The Minister for Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Joash Mayanja Nkangi says the government has already established a medium term expenditure framework where all sectors are involved in preparation of the budget.   He says the application of these measures will see the budget share of the health sector rise from the current 12.1 to 15.4 per cent in the next financial year (96/97) while that of education will move from 17.9 to 22.6 per cent in the same period.   He also points out that the government has redesigned its priority programmes to serve as many people as possible.  "Before 1991, health expenditure skewed towards high cost hospital services that tended to benefit the few, while education was skewed towards secondary and tertiary institutions," he explained.  Now special attention will be paid to primary health care, rural water supply and primary education.   Although these measures have taken hold, it would be long before tangible improvements are seen.  For instance, the per capita expenditure on health has risen to only US dollars 8 while the accepted standard is US dollars 12.  So far NGOs feel that pressure has to be put on the government so that it does not backslide.   And their prayers were partly answered when donors asked the government to use money saved from relief programmes in the social sector.   A debt management programme drawn by experts from the Bank of Uganda and an international team of experts from the newly created Eastern and Southern African Initiative in Debt and Reserves Management (ESAIDARM), World Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) introduced two new components in the debt management programme.  Through the programme, up to US dollars 20 million of the debt will be converted into local currency and be invested in social and environmental sectors.   At the same time, donors have agreed to establish a multi-lateral debt fund where donors will avail unspecified balance of payment support to the government to offset amounts owed to multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and African Development Bank (ADB).  The fund which is being supported by Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland among others, will release more funds to the social sector instead of having the same directed to servicing the external debt.   According to government estimates, multilateral debt servicing accounts for up to 30 per cent of the national budget.  But it is expected that the new measures will reduce this by half to between 11 and 12 per cent annually.  To ensure that the Ugandan government follows the plan, donors are expected to review the debt programme on a quarterly basis.   But then, this is only part of the answer.  There are strong feelings especially in Uganda, among government opponents that the authorities in Kampala need to be more reconciliatory to neighbours.   "It was wrong to sever diplomatic relationship with Sudan for this closed all avenues towards peaceful resolution of the conflict," said Mr. Paul Kawanga Semogerere, an aspiring presidential candidate.   This subject also elicits some form of sympathy among senior government officials.  Mrs Betty  Bigombe, the Minister in charge of Pacification of the north said that when all is said and done, negotiations are still part of the answer.   "It is very difficult to police our long stretch of the border we share with Sudan, thus it may be through negotiations that peace can be achieved," she emphasised.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaAfrica Cup Games Drug FreeThe Post of Zambia (Lusaka)January 22, 1996 (19960122)by Goodson Machona   Bloemfontein - Games being played at the Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa have been declared as drug free, ten days before the close of the competition. Organising committee  chairman Dr Peter Matsheke said on Friday in a press statement: "So far all players have been clean." He explained that each of the four venues has a centre where the tests are being carried.   "At half time, the match commissioners and team officials of the two competing teams randomly select two players from each team by drawing two numbers per team out of a bag," Dr Matsheke said, adding: "The players are identified 15 minutes from the centre by their team officials and doctors where the taking of samples is administered by a CAF appointed doctor." According to Dr. Matsheke, the players are allowed to choose the containers for their samples.   "These containers are coded and only the secretary general of CAF, Mustapha Fahmy, knows the identities of the players when he receives the results between 36 and 48 hours after the tests are carried out," explained Dr. Matsheke.   The samples are being tested at the University of Bloemfontein which according to Dr. Matsheke "is the only international Olympics committee (IOC) accredited laboratory in Africa."   During Zambia's game against Algeria, Zeddy Saileti and Harrison Chongo were picked for testing and have since been cleared.   Meanwhile, Zambia could still get in the quarter-finals with one point from the tie against Sierra Leone on Wednesday night in the Group B Africa Cup of Naions finals here.   But no such thought is being entertained by coach Roald Poulsen or his 22- man squad who says no chances were going to be taken and his players were going to go for the kill to top the group.   "Our aim is to win and end at the top of the group,"declared Poulsen. "We will put all our energies into the game." He added: "The boys know what is at stake. They will go out for an outright win."   Combative winger, Jonson Bwalya agreed.  " Our aim is to beat Sierra Leone convincingly so that we top the table in group B and stay in Bloemfontein," he said. "Sierra Leone is a good team. we have to respect them," warned Jonson. But team captain Kalusha Bwalya is confident his boys will pull off a win . "The boys are keyed up after the Burkina Faso match and are more determined than ever to make sure of a place in the last eight," Great Kalu said   Zambia's breath taking 5-1 win over Burkina Faso on Saturday night meant that they are now heading group B on goal difference.   The scoreline was too much for the Burkinabe that  coach, Idrissa Traore refused to attend the mandatory mixed post match press conference. But nearly everyone here in Bloemfontein is full of praise for the Zambian  team.   Former Aston Villa and Wimbledon stirker John Fashanu had this to say:  " This is the best team performance so far. Kulusha led by example, it makes me feel at 33 I am not too old to play soccer."-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaPresident's Actions Sow Seeds of AnarchyThe Post of Zambia (Lusaka)January 22, 1996 (19960122)by Fred M'membe (Column)   Lusaka - President Chiluba's position on the method of  adopting the constitution has nothing to do with respect for the sovereignty of Parliament but much with fear of losing power if clauses that level the play field and broaden political competition are put in the constitution.   The President's fear of losing the benefits of power, and not of  the opportunity to help create a better  Zambia for all, was made very clear at last month's MMD's extraordinary convention.   The President reminded his government officials of the deprivations they will have to endure if he and the MMD were voted out. He reminded them of the houses, the cars and offices they will lose. But he failed to acknow-ladge that he will be the greatest loser as he is the highest beneficiary.   This is what worries President Chiluba. This is what seems to propel him in all that he does. But the disastrous endings of people who pursue the goals of vanity in the world are many. And President Chiluba is pushing this country on that path. I beg all men and women of goodwill to go down on their knees to beg President Chiluba not to drag our country into chaos. A constitution that is not accepted and respected by a large section of society is a recipe for bloodshed. The President and his people, as defence minister Ben Mwila once remarked, have accumulated enough money to go and live abroad comfortably.   The government seems to be running out of arguments to justify its refusal to adopt the Constitution through a constituent assembly.   Opening the fifth session of the seventh National Assembly, President Frederick Chiluba warned that the government will not bow to pressure from some elements with axes to grind to adopt the constitution through a constituent assembly.   The President also cautioned that any other procedures dictated to by disgruntled elements would only entail the law of the jungle. This type of language is very familiar to most Zambians. It is not different to former president Kenneth Kaunda's language during the Second Republic.   But I fail to appreciate the link between one being disgruntled with President Chiluba and the method of adopting the constitution. What is personal about the Constitution? Can any reasonable person really personalise a Constitution? Is the Constitution of the Republic of Zambia a personal property of the President and his friends in the MMD club, which they can resolve to disband tomorrow?   Can a citizen's rights be measured on the basis of his or her disposition towards those in power? The plural society Zambians ushered in 1991 had at its core, the empowerment of those with axes to grind them and the disgruntled to be disgruntled. Dissent is a constitutional right that must be scrupulously respected. President Chiluba was at one time a 'disgruntled' person with 'an axe to grind' with former president Kaunda.    Our Constitution will, and should, not be an exclusive product of the friends and supporters of a president. It should be a product of all Zambians - whether friends and foes of President Chiluba. This is the depth to which the President has sunk the constitutional debate! And this being the case it is understandable why the 'disgruntled' and the 'axe grinders' are not comfortable with President Chiluba's method of adopting the Constitution.   The more President Chiluba opens his mouth over the Constitution the more I am convinced he is not being honest and forthright with the Zambian people. The President's argument that a constituent assembly takes away the powers of Parliament is not very convincing when the Constitution of the Republic of Zambia provides for a referendum whenever there are any amendments to the Bill of Rights.   The Constitutional Review Commission had proposed an extension of the Bill of Rights, in line with the MMD manifesto of 1991, which would have required subjecting the Constitution to a referendum. But President Chiluba, it appears, is not prepared to have anyone outside his control have any significant influence on the constitution, and he consequently got rid of all the proposed amendments to the Bill of Rights, in order to stay clear of a referendum, even if this meant breaking a written election promise.   The 1991 MMD manifesto, on which President Chiluba claims he was elected, on page 3 promised: "The MMD is committed to extending the Bill of Rights to embrace categories such as the rights of the press and children and rights against all forms of discriminations against women.  The MMD will uphold the Bill of Right with all its power."   But this is not the only promise that has been expediently abandoned. The MMD promised not to subordinate the rights of the minority to that of the majority. But today, over the constitution, the MMD wants to use its parliamentary majority to subject all Zambians, even those who are not members of the MMD, to a party constitution.     The MMD manifesto on page 11 promised:  "The MMD upholds the democratic principles such as ... non-subordinations of the minority to the majority and the right of the minority to defend its interests publicly if their interests are threatened." The Munyama Human Rights Commission, in its report, politely noted the party's departure from this position. But what is much more worrying with the commission's observations is that the MMD has negated on the extension of the Bill of Rights when there are concerns that the courts are not doing much to advance liberties.   "The judiciary was accused of being too timid and passing judgments that favoured the government, and were against the civil liberties of individuals," reads the Munyama Human Rights Commission report, adding: "It was then argued that fighting human rights  cases in court was an exercise in futility."   And even Nelson Mandela, a law-abiding attorney whose desire for the freedom of his people to live in dignity drove him to become a criminal, turned this family-loving husband into a man without a home, forced this life-loving man  to live like a monk for more than a quarter of a century in jail, when his 'hour' won, he did not want to single-handedly write a constitution of South Africa.   In his book, "Long Walk to Freedom", on page 743 Mandela writes: "We polled 62.6 per cent of national vote, slightly short of the two-thirds needed had we wished to push through a final constitution without support from other parties. Some in the ANC were disappointed that we did not cross the two-thirds threshold, but I was not one of them. In fact I was relieved; had we won two-thirds of the vote and been able to write a constitution unfettered by input from others, people would argue that we had created an ANC constitution, not a South African constitution. I wanted a true government of national unity."-0-   Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaYWCA Funds Small Scale EntrepreneursThe Post of Zambia (Lusaka)January 22, 1996 (19960122)by Masauso Lungu   Lusaka - About 400 small scale entrepreneurs would benefit from the US$240,000 budget for training set aside by the  Small Scale Business Development Centre at the Young Womens' Christian Association (YWCA) in Lusaka. Project Chief technical Advisor, Wendy Fitzgerald, said in an interview yesterday the programme will start on February 5, and run for a year.   "We have budgeted $240, 000 for 1996 programmes and we hope to run about 8 short courses in various areas in small scale businesses," said Fiztgerald. Last year the centre trained about 300 small scale entrepreneurs, and some of the participants who attended the courses say it was beneficial to train at the centre.   "I attended a three week course in small business development and I have improved very much in my operations and I think I am doing fine. I learnt a lot," said Evelyn Mwale of Lusaka's Longacres in an interview on Thursday.

Briefing pressmen and women on Tuesday, Morewa said the situation wasgetting out of hand and would meet Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) officials this week with the aim of reviewing gate charges.   Unreserved seats have been priced at R25 while reserved seats are going for R30.   Poor crowds were seen during the Zambia versus Algeria and Sierra Leone versus Burkina Faso matches here in Bloemfontein and also during a night game on Monday at the giant FNB stadium where fewer than 2,000 people watched the match.   "The poor attendence is worrying us. We are to hold meetings with CAF to review the situation," said Morewa.   Meanwhile, chairman of the organising committee here in Bloemfontein, Veli Mahlangu, has appealed to influntial local leaders to draw the attention of the community to the Africa Cup of Nations games being played at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein.+++His appeal comes in the wake of the poor crowds that attended the two matches so far played in Bloemfontein.   "This is very sad," said Mahlangu during a cocktail party hosted by Bloemfontein mayor, Jani Mohapi, in honour of the four competing teams and CAF officials.   "We accept that African teams are mainly a foreign entity to our fans," Mahlangu said. "But we had hoped local fans would appreciate the chance if seeing the teams in action and therefore support their games."   But some Bloemfontein residents interviewed say they are boycotting the games because of the exclusion of Bloemfontein-born local starand 1995 national soccer league Player of the Year, David "Lesilo" Modise to the South African national team.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaSoccer: Now Team Gets SeriousThe Post of Zambia (Lusaka)January 19, 1996 (19960119)by Goodson Machona   Bloemfontein - A serious mood engulfed the Zambian squad as they prepared for tomorrow's clash against Burkina Faso.   The situation was further compounded after Algeria took over the leadership of Group B when they beat Sierra Leone 2-0 last night.   Coach Roald Poulsen last night drilled his army in a gruelling two hours training session under floodlights.   Poulsen's emphasis was to make sure his players got used to playing under the floodlights. Zambia's two remaining preliminaries have been slated at 20.00 hours.   But Poulsen said he was not worried about Zambia playing their two remaining preliminary matches under flood lights.   "There is definitely no problem," Poulsen on Wednesday night adding "There is no difference playing under flood lights or during the day."   According to Poulsen, playing at night was a blessing in disguise because the temperatures here were stifling.   "You cannot expect the players to play soccer in temperatures in the region of 32 degrees centigrade. Naturally the heat will inhibit and stifle their type of play," Poulsen said.   But he admitted that it would have been better had the games been played during the day.   "In Zambia, we play soccer during the day. But the boys are adapting well and looking forward to the games," Poulsen said.   Camp manager Solly Pandor agreed. "I wouldn't say playing under flood lights is an advantage or disadvantage. But the morale in the camp is very high. There are no injuries and the boys are raring to go," Pandor said.   So determined and sharp were the players in their workout that one Burkinabe journalist remarked; "Our boys are in trouble."   Today is a rest day for the team. "We are taking them on a sight-seeing tour of Bloemfontein but training will continue tomorrow, with two sessions, one in the morning and one in the evening," Pandor said.   And Algeria yesterday beat a determined Sierra Leone side and immediately took over the leadership of Group B with four points from two games.   A goal in each half were enough to push Sierra Leone into second position ahead of Zambia and Burkina Faso.   Zambia plays Burkina Faso on Saturday while Algeria will have to wait for their last game against Burkina Faso.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaThree Quarters of Budget Donor FundedThe Post of Zambia (Lusaka)January 18, 1996 (19960118)by Anthony Mukwita   Lusaka - Seventy five per cent of Zambia's annual budget and development projects was donor funded in 1995, Finance Minister Ronald Penza disclosed in an interview yesterday in Chisamba.   Penza said only 25 per cent was contributed to the overall budget by the taxpayer.   "It's my intention to run Zambia at a profit but we have 70 per cent of theinvestment being foreign while 75 per cent of the so called budget is provided for by the donors, " Penza said. "It will take another 15 years to get out of the current debts."   And debt repayment obligations have also compounded Penza's headaches.   "It's unfortunate that the $1.3 billion we got from the donors will only be used to repay debts," Penza carped. "We will have to repay at 0. 05 per cent interest over a period of five and half years since now our credit worthiness is more enhanced."   And this week opposition Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) challenged in an open letter to the President for the government to explain where it was taking the money from tax collections since almost everything in the country is donor funded.   But Penza dismissed LPF's charges saying understanding of economics seemed to be a problem in the party.   "Twenty five per cent of Zambia's money went to the budget and Chongwe (LPFpresident) does not understand economics," Penza said.

Mulenga, said the exercise which had picked up towards the close of the initial deadline is now slowing down again.   He called on employers, NGO's, churches and other interested groups not to relax because of the extension but continue with publicity.   "We need a lot of publicity if we have to meet our target of 483,496 of eligible voters in Lusaka alone," Mulenga said. "We have only registered 79,965 as at January 10."   But public liaison officer at Elections Office, Joel Sikazwe, said in an interview yesterday that the statistics reported in the press and attributed to his office were incorrect.   "I am still compiling the data," Sikazwe said. "It will be communicated to the press when we are ready."   And Elections Office will pay the field polling officers their allowances for the initial part of the exercise tomorrow.

Opposition Party AsksThe Post of Zambia (Lusaka)January 17, 1996 (19960117)by Anthony Mukwita   Lusaka - Opposition Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) on Tuesday challenged President Frederick Chiluba in an open letter to explain where the taxpayer's money was going as most services government claimed to be providing were donor funded.   The LPF letter claimed money from taxes was not being spent on things the majority of the people were crying for.   "Government is not feeding the vulnerable groups," LPF claimed in its open letter to the President of Monday. "Donors are."   LPF further charged that government was not supplying medicines in hospitals as the drug kits too came from donors.   But neither State House nor the finance ministry or Ministry of Health wasprepared to respond to LPF's charges.   "I think the issue is really a ministry of finance one so you should try MrPenza," said President Chiluba's public relations and press aide, Richard Sakala, in an interview yesterday. " I don't want to answer it in general terms."   And health minister Michael Sata was also not in a position to defend hisministry, or the President, over the supply of medicines to hospitals.   "If the letter was addressed to me I would have commented but since it wasaddressed to the President I cant comment," Sata said in an interview yesterday.   And finance minister Ronald Penza and deputies could not be reached for comment as they were locked in a budget meeting.   LPF accused government of not providing services that matched up to the value of taxes collected.   "Government has not released money promised for maintenance from the Road Fund, despite fuel levies being increased in 1995," LPF's open letter to the President read, adding: "Government supplies of books and desks to schools have tickled to a halt. Government has not invested in water supply since the donors finished their drought relief programs."   LPF advised President Chiluba to take advantage of his address at the opening of Parliament on Friday to restore hope to the people of Zambia.   "We urge you to address how your government will reduce and re-target publicexpenditure in order to deliver the goods and services and what measures thegovernment will put in place to revive the economy and achieve growth in 1996," LPF urged.   LPF claimed there was ample evidence of "flagrant extravagance in higher levels of government".   "New cars, new offices, new furniture, and trips overseas," the letter stated.

In fact ZRA collected more money than budgeted for in 1995."-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996United States and Africa[DOCUMENT] Southern Africa Media Group Criticizes U.S. EmbassyAfrica News ServiceJanuary 15, 1996 (19960115)   Statement by the Media Institute of South African (MISA), December 15, 1995.   United States embassy in Maputo confirmed that they have banned a U.S. journalist, Joseph Hanlon, from speaking to the ambassador and any of his staff regarding Mozambique. Ambassador Dennis Jett, told MISA on December 15 saying: "Hanlon is an unprofessional journalist whose reporting is totally and consistently biased. It is a waste of time talking to him."   Hanlon is author of several books which focus on Mozambique. He also edited the "Peace Process Bulletin", put out by AWEPA (Association of European Parliamentarians for Southern Africa). In recent years, Hanlon covered, in detail, implementation of the 1992 peace accord between the government and the Renamo 'rebels'. And according to the Mozambique Information Agency (AIM), these credentials make Hanlon the best informed U.S. journalist on Mozambique.   AIM reported on November 6,1995 that Hanlon requested, as he had done many times before, interviews with the U.S. embassy staff but press attach=E9 Adrienne O'Neal told him that nobody had any time to talk to him. "I informed her that the embassy has been talking to me for the past 15 years", Hanlon told AIM. On October 25, AIM reported, Hanlon spoke to O'Neal again but she replied: "I have talked to people here in the embassy and explained your concern and they say that nobody in the US embassy or at USAID will have time to talk to you". AIM reported that when Hanlon asked why this ban had been put on him, O'Neal is quoted as saying she did not have to give any reasons. But she is further quoted as having added: "There is a history to this."   AIM reported that Hanlon had never had any problem in speaking to US officials during the pacification and election periods, even though what he wrote was frequently critical of US policy towards Mozambique. Hanlon said he did not understand the embassy's sudden change of the attitude. "Had the Mozambican government done this to me, the American embassy would have raised hell, and claimed that freedom of the press was under threat," Hanlon is quoted as saying. And added: "For a country that supposedly believes in freedom of information, the embassy's position is grotesque," and added, "it will be interesting to see whether the embassy's flagrant denial of freedom of information will figure in the next U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Mozambique."   However, Ambassador Jett argued that although the embassy has banned Hanlon, the action does not affect freedom of press. "The government will not prevent journalists investigating their findings. But if the government doesn't want to talk to you, you can't force them to. It is my choice to take up questions," Ambassador Jett said. He further said that he talked to Hanlon extensively in the past, but he finds "his information in the books not good. Hanlon is hopelessly biased."

Dear Editor of Mediafax:   Permit me to respond to your editorial of December 19. In that editorial you called the American Embassy's refusal to give Joe Hanlon interviews with Embassy and USAID personnel a "flagrant violation of freedom of the press, freedom of expression and the right of person to be informed." Mr. Hanlon, AIM and Domingo have all made similar accusations. You also said that I, as ambassador, have no right to ban any embassy employee from speaking to a journalist.   Clearly you do not understand the values behind the concepts you are so vigorously defending. I do not think this arises from different definitions of the terms involved, even though the American constitution and the Mozambican constitution are not identical on these points. The American constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom of expression by declaring that the Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of press, or of speech. It should therefore be obvious to anyone that an embassy cannot violate freedom of the press in the American sense of term, since only the parliament in a particular country can pass a law that would interfere with a journalist's ability to express or publish his opinions.   The Mozambican constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom of speech as well, but uses somewhat different words to accomplish this. Article 74 of the constitution states:   "1. All the citizens shall have the right to freedom of expression and to freedom of the press, as well as the right to information.   2. Freedom of expression, which includes the right to disseminate one's opinion by all legal means, and the right to information, shall not be limited by censorship.    3. Freedom of press shall include in particular the freedom of journalistic expression and creativity, access to sources of information, protection of professional independence and confidentiality, and the right to publish newspapers and other publications."    Since the Embassy has done nothing to prevent Mr. Hanlon from expressing his thoughts or publishing them, clearly the only question that arises is whether the embassy has violated Mr. Hanlon's right to information or his right to access to sources of information.   Mozambique's press law, law number 18/91, contains article 29 entitled "Access to sources of information." It states "Access to OFFICIAL (emphasis added) sources of information shall be granted to journalists in the course of their work." Would the distinguished editor of MediaFax have his readers believe that Article 29, which only mentions "official" sources of information, is referring to the information of all governments in the world and not just that of the Mozambican government?    In any case, I and other members of this Embassy have frequently made ourselves available to the press in those cases where we believed it was productive to do so. At the same time, Mr.Hanlon's request for interviews was not the first we have declined because we thought it would not be useful.   Since access to official sources of information obviously does not apply, that only leaves the question whether Mr. Hanlon's right to information could have been violated. Article 3 of law 18/91 entitled "right to information" states: "In the field of the press, the right to information means the ability of every citizen to inform himself and to be informed of facts and opinions of national and international consequence, as well as the right to release information, opinions and ideas through the press." The citizens of Mozambique therefore have the right to inform themselves and be infomed by journalists. Would the distinguished editor of Mediafax have his readers believe that this should be interpreted that any time anyone refuses to answer any question of any journalist, that the rights of all 16 million Mozambicans have just been violated?   Has the distinguished editor of MediaFax never heard in his professional career the response "no comment"? Has he never had a phone call that was not returned or never had a question he posed that was not fully answered? If this has happened in the past, why have you not informed the people of Mozambique in each and every instance in which their rights have been violated?    I think the above argument demonstrates the total absurdity of the assertion that the Embassy's decision regarding Mr. Hanlon violated freedom of the press, freedom of expression or the right of the people to be informed. You also made the point, however, that as ambassador, I did not have the right to ban anyone in the embassy from speaking to a journalist.   When it comes to expressing official government opinions during official working hours -- which is what Mr. Hanlon requested -- I not only have the right, but the obligation to ensure that official positions are expressed coherently and consistently. I also have the obligation to the taxpayers of the United States to see that their money is not wasted. We have spent many hours in the past answering Mr. Hanlon's questions, which failed to improve the quality of his reporting. Using more time of embassy personnel to respond to more of Mr. Hanlon's questions, given his ideological orientation and lack of objectivity, would therefore be a waste of such resources.   Would the distinguished editor of MediaFax have his readers believe that any journalist has the right to ask any question of any employee of any organization at any time and that no one in a position of authority, be it a manager, minister or ambassador, has the right to determine whether or how the question will be answered? If that is the case, Article 27 of law 18/91, which lists the rights of journalists, fails to include such a right and nowhere else in that law or in the constitution is such a right described.   I believe this is more than just a case of not understanding the letter of the law; it is also a fundamental lack of comprehension of the spirit of the law. This lack of understanding is not limited to this one occasion. When the Embassy's press attache wrote you in November regarding Mr. Hanlon, you took offense at her suggestion that an entity of the government like AIM perhaps doesn't understand freedom of the press. You termed this an insult to you and the other journalists who had worked at AIM and you pointed out "AIM journalists had to continue to struggle a great deal for this press freedom, sometimes without success."   While you may have struggled, I would agree that you did not succeed. When you were director of AIM, Renamo was never mentioned by name, but was always referred to as the "armed bandits." Today AIM only describes Renamo as "the former rebel movement." It never calls Renamo "the largest opposition political party" or even "an opposition party." Frelimo, on the other hand, is always referred to as the "ruling party" or the "governing party" which is an accurate description of the present without reference to the past. Do AIM's readers need to be reminded every day that Renamo was once a rebel movement? If it is AIM's intention to teach history, in view of its successful struggle for liberation from colonialism, why isn't Frelimo ever referred to as a "former rebel movement?"   This problem with nomenclature is perhaps a small example of bias, but I am not the only one who doubts AIM's impartiality. The following quote regarding AIM may interest you: "the service, however, causes some controversy, as many professionals are of the opinion that it is a service of governmental propaganda instead of being an information service with independence and objectivity guaranteed by law." The quote is from an article on page 5 of the August 28, 1995 issue of "Savana," an excellent newspaper that I recommend you read.   Some would argue that it is pointless to enter into a debate about freedom of press with those who do not understand it or choose to ignore the values that are its foundation. Others say that arguing with an editor is a no-win situation since he (or she) will always have the last word.   While I do not disagree with these arguments, I think it is an important debate nonetheless because the peace which Mozambique now enjoys is by no means assured. One academic study which I read recently concluded that during the last fifty years in countries where there had been civil wars that were ended through negotiation, in one half of them war broke out again.   Whether Mozambique is part of the half that succeeds in not repeating the tragedy of the past will depend, to a large degree, on whether democracy succeeds here. Democracy can function successfully only if the institutions that are its foundations can function. In addition to a strong legislature and an independent judiciary, a free press is one of those essential institutions. Can the press be free if it is owned by the government? Is AIM your argument that it can? As the editor of the oldest independent publication in Mozambique, your opinions in this regard should be taken seriously.   When reading the accounts of those who worked for two years to negotiate the General Peace Agreement in Rome, one theme is consistent. The mutual lack of confidence that the two parties had in each other repeatedly complicated the process. The climate created by a biased and unobjective press clearly contributed to this mutual lack of trust. The role played by the press therefore probably served to prolong the war and certainly served to make implementation of the peace more difficult.   Distinguished editor of Mediafax, perhaps you should spend less time complaining about your friend being denied an interview and more time worrying about the threat to continued peace in Mozambique posed by some of those who practice your profession.   Since article 33 of law 18/91 describes the right to reply, I trust you will not violate my rights and will publish this letter in its entirety.   Along with the hope that the New Year brings greater understanding of and appreciation for freedom of the press and freedom of expression, please accept assurances of my highest consideration. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Mozambique[DOCUMENT] Southern Africa Media Group Criticizes U.S. EmbassyAfrica News ServiceJanuary 15, 1996 (19960115)   Maputo - Statement by the Media Institute of South African (MISA), December 15, 1995.   United States embassy in Maputo confirmed that they have banned a U.S. journalist, Joseph Hanlon, from speaking to the ambassador and any of his staff regarding Mozambique. Ambassador Dennis Jett, told MISA on December 15 saying: "Hanlon is an unprofessional journalist whose reporting is totally and consistently biased. It is a waste of time talking to him."   Hanlon is author of several books which focus on Mozambique. He also edited the "Peace Process Bulletin", put out by AWEPA (Association of European Parliamentarians for Southern Africa). In recent years, Hanlon covered, in detail, implementation of the 1992 peace accord between the government and the Renamo 'rebels'. And according to the Mozambique Information Agency (AIM), these credentials make Hanlon the best informed U.S. journalist on Mozambique.   AIM reported on November 6,1995 that Hanlon requested, as he had done many times before, interviews with the U.S. embassy staff but press attach=E9 Adrienne O'Neal told him that nobody had any time to talk to him. "I informed her that the embassy has been talking to me for the past 15 years", Hanlon told AIM. On October 25, AIM reported, Hanlon spoke to O'Neal again but she replied: "I have talked to people here in the embassy and explained your concern and they say that nobody in the US embassy or at USAID will have time to talk to you". AIM reported that when Hanlon asked why this ban had been put on him, O'Neal is quoted as saying she did not have to give any reasons. But she is further quoted as having added: "There is a history to this."   AIM reported that Hanlon had never had any problem in speaking to US officials during the pacification and election periods, even though what he wrote was frequently critical of US policy towards Mozambique. Hanlon said he did not understand the embassy's sudden change of the attitude. "Had the Mozambican government done this to me, the American embassy would have raised hell, and claimed that freedom of the press was under threat," Hanlon is quoted as saying. And added: "For a country that supposedly believes in freedom of information, the embassy's position is grotesque," and added, "it will be interesting to see whether the embassy's flagrant denial of freedom of information will figure in the next U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Mozambique."   However, Ambassador Jett argued that although the embassy has banned Hanlon, the action does not affect freedom of press. "The government will not prevent journalists investigating their findings. But if the government doesn't want to talk to you, you can't force them to. It is my choice to take up questions," Ambassador Jett said. He further said that he talked to Hanlon extensively in the past, but he finds "his information in the books not good. Hanlon is hopelessly biased."

Dear Editor of Mediafax:   Permit me to respond to your editorial of December 19. In that editorial you called the American Embassy's refusal to give Joe Hanlon interviews with Embassy and USAID personnel a "flagrant violation of freedom of the press, freedom of expression and the right of person to be informed." Mr. Hanlon, AIM and Domingo have all made similar accusations. You also said that I, as ambassador, have no right to ban any embassy employee from speaking to a journalist.   Clearly you do not understand the values behind the concepts you are so vigorously defending. I do not think this arises from different definitions of the terms involved, even though the American constitution and the Mozambican constitution are not identical on these points. The American constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom of expression by declaring that the Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of press, or of speech. It should therefore be obvious to anyone that an embassy cannot violate freedom of the press in the American sense of term, since only the parliament in a particular country can pass a law that would interfere with a journalist's ability to express or publish his opinions.   The Mozambican constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom of speech as well, but uses somewhat different words to accomplish this. Article 74 of the constitution states:   "1. All the citizens shall have the right to freedom of expression and to freedom of the press, as well as the right to information.   2.

John Porter is submitting the following concurrent resolution this week; which will be referred to the House of Representatives Committee on International Relations, Africa Subcommittee.   CONCURRENT RESOLUTION: Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives concerning the political and human rights situation in the Republic of Kenya.   Whereas the Governments of the United States and the Republic of Kenya have enjoyed friendly relations as the Republic of Kenya has been an important and politically stable ally to the United States in Africa;   Whereas the Republic of Kenya is a major tourist destination in East Africa enhancing its economic and political importance to the United States;   Whereas the Republic of Kenya is one of the largest recipients of United States foreign assistance in sub-Saharan Africa;   Whereas such foreign assistance had been offered to encourage democratic freedoms, human rights, and political stability in the Republic of Kenya;   Whereas after nine years as a single-party state led by the Kenya Africa National Union, a 1991 constitutional amendment restored multi-party democracy;   Whereas the Kenyan Constitution guarantees the rights of assembly, association, conscience, and expression;   Whereas the Republic of Kenya, as a signatory to the United Nations Charter, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the African Charter, is obliged to adhere to its international legal obligations and to protect the fundamental human rights of all its citizens;   Whereas despite the 1991 Constitutional amendment restoring multi-party democracy, the Government of Kenya continues to wage a campaign of repression designed to eliminate criticism and dissent;   Whereas Government of Kenya security forces have harassed and detained government critics, including former cabinet members and other advocating multi-party democracy;   Whereas former member of Parliament from Nakuru, Koigi wa Wamwere, who has been recognized as a determined opponent to ethnic cleansing, brutality, and corruption in the Republic of Kenya, has been targeted by the Government of Kenya for his political beliefs and has spent the batter part of the last nine years in police detention;   Whereas numerous international human rights groups and independent international observers have concluded that the trial and sentencing of Mr. Wamwere and his two co-defendants, Charles Kuria Wamwere and G.G. Njuguna Ngengi, to four years in prison and six "strokes" (lashes with a cane), was conducted in a manner that was inconsistent with international legal standards, that the charges against the defendants were unsubstantiated by the evidence, that much of the evidence was fabricated, and that the trial was not conducted by an independent and impartial tribunal;   Whereas the Government of Kenya continues to intimidate and harass human rights attorneys, peaceful demonstrators, and human rights activists by regularly interfering with many civil liberties, including freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association;   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya, especially political prisoners, are detained in prison for indefinite periods of time without being charged with a crime;   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya charged with crimes remain in prison for excessively lengthy periods of time without being brought to trial;   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya are often subjected to various kinds of torture, including beating with sticks, fists, handles of hoes, and gun butts, often resulting in permanent disability;   Whereas life threatening prison conditions in the Republic of Kenya, including sexual abuse, severe over crowding, poor diet, inadequate health care, substandard bedding materials, and flooded or unheated cells led to several hundred deaths in prison in 1994;   Whereas despite constitutional provisions to the contrary and the Kenya Police Commissioner's June 1993 announcement that torture was prohibited and would not be tolerated, there continue to be credible reports that police and security forces resort to torture and brutality to break up licensed public assemblies;   Whereas the President of Kenya exerts overwhelming influence over the country's judiciary, including through the President's refusal to renew contracts of the three High Court Judges who have issued rulings adverse to the government; and   Whereas the Republic of Kenya's political stability is threatened by the Government of Kenya's repression of individual rights and democratic freedoms and its intolerance toward political dissent:   Now therefore be it resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring),   SECTION 1: STATEMENT OF POLICY:   It is the sense of the Congress that the Government of Kenya should:   1. Uphold the rights of assembly, association, conscience, and expression, which are guaranteed in the Kenyan Constitution;   2. Adhere to its international legal obligations under the United Nations Charter, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the African Charter;   3. End all intimidation and harassment of those who are critical of government policies and those working for democracy in Kenya, particularly individuals within the church, the press, and the legal and academic communities;   4. Either charge and try or release all prisoners, including persons detained for political reasons;   5. Cease all physical abuse or mistreatment of prisoners;   6. Release Mr. Koigi wa Wamwere and permit him to exercise his rights of free expression, association, and political participation in a multi-party democracy; and   7. Restore the independence of the judiciary.   SECTION 2. ASSISTANCE TO REPUBLIC OF KENYA: It is the sense of the Congress that the United States should consider reducing, and possibly suspending, military and economic assistance to the Republic of Kenya unless the Government of Kenya makes substantial progress in addressing the concerns set forth in Section 1.

This is despite the debacle surrounding the withdrawal of champions Nigeria.   Nigeria have the largest contingent of players plying their trade in Europe, but the 15 nations taking part in the tournament are packed with players who are playing for top overseas clubs.    As the world's leading clubs broaden their search for talent, Africa has become a good hunting ground for them, and stars from many poor African countries are now earning fortunes with the rich European clubs.    The most well known of these is George Weah, who is having a great season with Italy's AC Milan. Since re-admission, South Africa has also exported many local stars with John "Shoes" Moshoeu, playing in Turkey, being the most expensive player.   GEORGE WEAH (Liberia)   GEORGE APPONG WEAH is simply the best player on earth at the moment. World soccer's governing body, Fifa, confirmed that on Monday when Weah was voted World Player of the Year.   He has played much of his football outside his war-torn country, starring for a French club before moving to the Italian Serie A giants AC Milan. But Weah's love for Liberia has led him to contribute some of his earning towards the national team and he has inspired them to their first appearance in the African nations Cup.   National coach Wilfred Lardner knows that in Weah he has someone around whom he can build a strong team capable of upsetting the tournament's favourites. Liberian minister of sport Francois Massaquoi said: "He has shown the world that Liberians are not just killers, but also decent people with talent and mastery of certain crafts."    With Nigeria out of the finals and Weah leading their attack, Liberia have a good chance of advancing to the knockout stage of the tournament.   ANTHONY YEBOAH (Ghana)   ANTHONY YEBOAH has not lost the goal touch that prompted England's Leeds United to pay $3,4-million to Eintracht Frankfurt for his services. He was a prolific goalscorer in the German Bundesliga and Yeboah's continued appetite for what he is paid to do earned him the goal of the month award in September and October last year.    Asked about his much-publicised squabble with team captain Abedi "Pele" Ayew, he said: "Blown out of proportion". However, Ghana 's failure in Tunisia 94 was attributed to internal quarrels. Having failed in two previous tournaments, Yeboah knows that this may be his last chance. The 30-year-old striker has a lethal shot with both feet and if his 25-yard scorchers do not elude him, he may be the top goal scorer of the tournament.   DOCTOR KHUMALO (South Africa)   WAY back in 1992 in Zimbabwe, when South Africa were beaten 4-1 in a African Nations Cup qualifier, the most talked about player then was Doctor Khumalo (right), with the Zimbabweans dubbing him a "nurse". He has come a long way since then, and has put in some assured and skillful performances for the national team.    The Kaizer Chiefs idol always plays in patches but with a strong contingent around him he can rise to the occasion.   He spent the latter part of last year rueing a botched deal with a club in Argentina but  next season he is likely to play in the revamped American league. Khumalo will be looking to make a big impression at this tournament so that he can clinch himself a better deal in a more competitive league than the United States.    KALUSHA BWALYA (Zambia)   TEAM captain Kalusha Bwalya will best be remembered for leading Zambia to the finals of the 1994 tournament in Tunisia against Nigeria after he was one of the survivors of the 1993 plane crash in Gabon which killed all but three members of the national squad. "Great Lusha" is still with us today because he simply missed the flight.   Those who saw the 1994 finals will remember how close Bwalya came to equalising in the final against Nigeria, hitting the crossbar with a 40m drive.   The 33-year-old Bwaly is currently playing for Club America in Mexico and with Johnson Bwalya and Kenneth Malitoli alongside him, this left- footed midfielder could give goalkeepers a hard time. Having come that close in Tunisia with a makeshift squad, this time around they may hit the jackpot. -0-   Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaTask Force Looks at Government Info and Media OwnershipMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Jacquie Golding-Duffy   Johannesburg - The task team appointed by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to look at the media will be reviewing the South African Communications Services (SACS) -- government's current communications model -- in a bid to find new and more effective means of disseminating government information to the public.   A brief for Friday's meeting sent by Mbeki's office to all ten members of the task team urges participants to concentrate on investigating, among others issues, the relationship between SACS and those print and electronic media structures not linked to government.   Freedom of Expression Institute chairman Raymond Louw, who is a task team member, said the team would also be reviewing the government's existing policy on communication and placing "special emphasis" on re-assessing affirmative action policies.   "Ownership and control of the media, and how it affects government communications is also one of the key issues for the task team," Louw said.   Another member of the task team, the Sowetan's political editor, Mathatha Tsedu, said foreign control of the media by large conglomerates and monopolies should be a priority for the task team because foreign ownership impeded the process of ensuring a "diversity of voices" among the press.   "I believe that the large groups controlling the media should unbundle and relinquish shares. Sowetan staffers have appealed to the Independent Group to sell its stake in the Sowetan and allow them to buy shares. This displays the urgency with which our team has to discuss foreign control of the media," Tsedu said.   More than 80 percent of South African print media is controlled by four major players: namely, Times Media Limited, Independent Newspapers Holdings, Perskor and the Nasionale Pers.   Although members agreed on the issue of spurring affirmative action, some feared that government may resort to "undesirable means" of implementation such as using government advertising money to implement the policy.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaParliament Prepares Intelligence ProbeMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Gaye Davis   Johannesburg -   Parliament's watchdog over the intelligence community faces its most crucial test as it prepares to uncover the truth behind the police spying scandal.   The Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence thrashed out its terms of reference for its investigation into police claims that top members were being spied on by agents of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), which has denied the allegations, during a five-hour meeting behind closed doors this week.   "We have already had our battles with the intelligence services. How we deal with this case is a test for us as far as the public is concerned," committee chair, African National Congress MP Lindiwe Sisulu-Guma, told the Mail & Guardian.   The committee is responsible for monitoring the two national intelligence services -- the NIA, which deals with domestic threats, and the South African Secret Service, which deals with external threats -- as well as the intelligence arms of the police and defence force. Its power lies in its legislated right to approve or veto budgets: "We hold the purse-strings," said Sisulu-Guma.   Public interviews of seven nominees shortlisted for the post of Inspector General of Intelligence -- a civilian who will deal with complaints of abuses from the public and within the services themselves -- start on February 20.   The candidates have been drawn from a list of nominees submitted by all seven political parties and three nominated by members of the public.   The final choice must be approved by a 75 percent majority in Parliament -- more than the two-thirds required to amend the constitution, because of the nature of the job.   Since it started work four months ago, the committee has had to scrutinise intelligence budgets, learn about the services it is supposed to monitor, and find a balance between transparency and secrecy.    "It's the most difficult balancing act imaginable. We must do it properly or the concept of transparency will be destroyed." It will report to Parliament on its work during February. "Nothing will be excluded without our first consulting all the political parties and nothing will be included that jeopardises the national interest."   The committee meets on February 7 to consider reports on the spying scandal it has called for from the police and the NIA, and to decide whom to subpoena to give evidence. It will investigate the truth of allegations of the use of bugs and other surveillance of senior police officers and prepare a report, with recommendations, for parliament and the executive.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaMan Who Exposed Police Misdeeds Regrets Six-Year-Old ConfessionMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Peta Thornycroft   Johannesburg - It's been a long time coming, but Dirk Coetzee has had enough. He now regrets having spoken out in 1989 about killer squads in the South African Police.   His confession six years ago about his own role in sanctioned murders and his breathtaking exposure of the rot deep in the South African security police has brought him little but grief. When he first told Vrye Weekblad reporter Jacques Pauw his story, both he and his claims were ridiculed in much of the then mainstream media. He had to spend four years in uncomfortable exile, in constant fear of being assassinated.   And the propaganda machine within the South African Police, and the remnants of that machine which is still functioning, has pursued him relentlessly. This week was the final straw.   His old colleague, National Police Commissioner George Fivaz (who probably owes Coetzee at least a good lunch for alerting the African National Congress that he was "untainted" and therefore probably the best compromise to be the future National Commissioner), chose to ignore him and go public with another man's accusations against him   Fivaz decided to endorse a version of events given to him by another former security policeman Inspector HT Moodley: Moodley claims Dirk Coetzee told him he was under orders to bug senior policemen at a meeting at National Intelligence Agency headquarters six weeks ago.   Coetzee scoffs at this. His version is that Moodley, "a pleasant fellow," visited him at NIA HQ and asked him to make a statement about the assassination of ANC lawyer Griffiths Mxenge in Durban in 1981. Mxenge's brother had decided to ask the police to charge Coetzee after participating in a Yorkshire Television documentary in which Coetzee once again repeated his confession, that under orders from his superiors in the security police, he sent his men to kill Mxenge.   Coetzee says he told Moodley at the "relaxed" meeting he would not make a statement to the police, but he would be telling the Mxenge story, for the last time, to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.   Coetzee, uncomfortable in his NIA job as a "spook", says he has neither access to "bugging" devices, nor has he ever been involved in bugging operations in his life, and that he is in the wrong department at the NIA to do any bugging, even if he knew how. He also claims that nobody in the NIA asked him to do any bugging, ever.   According to Coetzee neither Fivaz nor anyone else, including his bosses at NIA, asked him his version of the bugging allegations contained in a report by Independent Newspapers' investigative unit, Spectrum.   Coetzee learned of Fivaz's statement early last Thursday morning when a friend phoned him to tell him the newspaper reports were being aired on radio news bulletins.   Coetzee is bewildered about why he was the last to find out, and said: "Let me and Moodley have a lie detector test." Moodley refused to talk to the M&G, and referred us to Fivaz.   Coetzee is not supposed to talk to the press. He would far prefer to be back in the police, which he left on "medical grounds" after a disciplinary hearing in 1986.   He's an unconventional, outspoken wild card for the new government. In an interview with Tribute magazine before the elections he accused the ANC intelligence community of incompetence, and that didn't do his career much good. And he's not sure, after this week and his outrage in the press, what his job prospects are like with the NIA.   And he's deeply hurt that some men who covered up and lied about the hit squads are generals in the police, while he is ill-placed in the state spy shop. Coetzee is not an angel, but so far he has never been caught in a lie.   Fivaz told the M&G late on Thursday he had at no stage commented on the veracity of the allegations against Coetzee. He said he had discussed the bugging with intelligence boss Mo Shaik, who had decided to let the matter rest.  -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaPolice Accused Over Christmas Day MassacreMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Eddie Koch and Mehlo Mvelase   Johannesburg - Police either colluded in the Christmas Day massacre at Shobashobane or are guilty of negligence in the run-up to the attack that left 19 people dead in the KwaZulu-Natal village, according to a television documentary to be broadcast by SABC's Agenda programme on Sunday night.   The documentary includes strong criticisms from Captain Shaun Vollenhoven, former commander of the police station near Shobashobane, of the co-ordination of the security operation in the area before the attack.   Vollenhoven, who has been transferred from the police station at his own request, feels that his efforts to introduce new and more community-friendly policing methods in the area had been consistently undermined.   "The old police structure which we are trying to change now is still not ready for change," says Vollenoven in response to queries from the film crew about lack of co-ordination in the way police behaved before and during the massacre.   The documentary, made by Mail & Guardian Television with the SABC, includes an in-depth examination of how the massacre took place and explores the possibilities for restoring order to the region.   One of Vollenhoven's key criticisms relates to the lack of communication between the police station and various other security operatives in the area. He was, he said, unable to provide an explanation for the fact that an Internal Stability Unit patrol, which was supposed to have been on duty in the area, was not present at the time of the attack in Shobashobane. He was also not informed about houses being searched and weapons allegedly being confiscated in Shobashobane on the day before the attack.   "I was not aware of the search by outside units," says Vollenhoven. "This creates a perception that police are siding with one party."   The documentary points out that these anomalies occurred even though African National Congress leaders and independent monitors had informed senior police officers that an attack on Shobashobane could be expected in the Christmas period.   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has asked Neville Melville, police reporting officer for KwaZulu-Natal and former advocate, to head up a special task force that will probe allegations of police complicity or negligence regarding the massacre. Members of the Investigative Task Unit, a crack team of detectives that reports directly to Mufamadi, will help with this probe.   Police Commissioner George Fivaz has also sent a top team of 34 detectives to Port Shepstone to investigate the massacre, headed by Pretoria detective Bushie Engelbrecht. Fivaz announced in a press statement that extra informers would be sent into the area and that the use of extra powers, granted to the provincial commissioner under the Police Act, was also possible.   Engelbrecht's men began interviewing eyewitnesses and survivors of the massacre on Tuesday this week. The team has issued warrants of arrest for four suspects believed to have been involved in the attack.    In addition, a National Public Order Policing (Pop) Unit will be set up in Natal under command of former ISU commander Vernon Hunter. The Pop teams will set up temporary bases in various hotspots of the province and will concentrate on the South Coast.   These moves represent an effort by the national police commissioner -- along with Mufamadi's office -- to stamp their authority on the province. The Inkatha Freedom Party has insisted policing is primarily a provincial matter and has already signaled its intention to oppose "unilateral" intervention by national authorities.    "We are worried by Fivaz's comment that more spies will be sent into the province as we have been victims of unlawful espionage on our officials by members of the intelligence agencies," said IFP secretary general Ziba Jiyane.   The Inkatha leader says the new measures on the South Coast could amount to anti-Inkatha intervention by central government in the province. "We are not saying the central government should not be involved in security matters in KwaZulu-Natal. But Schedule Six of the Constitution says policing is also a provincial issue and as long at it [national intervention] is done in a unilateral way this is invariably a partisan approach."   The action by the national police authorities and Jiyane's response indicates that the Shobashabane killings may have initiated a major conflict between the central and provincial governments over who will control the way KwaZulu-Natal is policed.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaMandela's Children Fund Corners DonationsMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Marion Edmunds   Johannesburg -  President Nelson Mandela's high-profile Children's Fund has netted more than R12- million since its inception last year, with a further R24-million pledged to it. while humbler non-government organisations (NGOs) are battling for money.     As a result, NGOs are frightened that Mandela's Midas touch is proving so successful that it is threatening their own ability to raise funds to care for South Africa's poor and homeless children.    These NGOs, many of which have lost foreign funders in post-apartheid South Africa, are desperate for larger donations from big business to help disadvantaged children, and are eyeing the millions in Mandela's fund with envy and reservations.    Mandela's Children's Fund has received R12- million, with a further R24-million pledged to it over the next five years. There are now 28 members in the President's Club --individuals, businesses and foreign governments that have matched Mandela's donation to the fund and whose members are giving R150 000 or more over five years. The club includes US actor Denzil Washington, the Norwegian government, Barlows, Coca-Cola, Pierre Cardin and M-Net.   The marketing director of the South African National Council for Child and Family Welfare, Hennie Oosthuizen, said this week: "I believe that the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund has the potential to take donors away from child welfare organisations because it can offer exposure to donors, and all we can offer is accountability. We need some of that money in our organisation and we could use it successfully."   The chief executive trustee of the Fund, Jeremy Ractliffe, responded by saying, "I do not know of any of our donors who have given to the Mandela's Children Fund through not funding some other NGO in the field we concentrate on ... I would welcome discussions with NGOs who feel that they have lost out to the Fund."   It cannot be disputed that Mandela's name sanctifies his Children's Fund, giving it a political and emotional appeal of international standing. (Those who become part of the President's Club receive a certificate signed by Mandela, as well as a photograph of the donor with Mandela.)   Smaller, humbler NGOs -- which have worked for decades in South Africa's forgotten communities -- are throwing up their hands in despair, saying that they just cannot compete with the Mandela name. This is ironic, given the fact that these NGOs were the unofficial conduit for foreign funds during apartheid years, funds which, in many instances, helped prepare South Africa and the African National Congress for the transition to democracy.   Chairperson of the Save the Children Fund, Mary Hanna, said this week that it was becoming increasingly difficult to raise money and that high-profile funds were attracting donations which had previously gone to Save the Children.    "The demands are increasing and the funds are not ... we have had to severely curtail our nutrition programmes in places like the Northern Province, for example, and as far as we know there is no other organisation working there to take our place."    Johannesburg Child Welfare has retrenched 22 social workers this year to cope with the drop in funding, according to Anne Bown, manager of funding and public relations.    Bown said people were much less generous than they used to be and that they were struggling to find donors, especially needed as the state had cut its subsidy by R1-million, and foreign governments were giving to the Reconstruction and Development Programme.    The funding and development manager of the Child Welfare Society in Cape Town, Jetty Botes, said that the society's 1996 to 1997 budget was short by more than a million rand and that it would have to cut projects unless saved by a windfall.   "Corporations provide 15 to 20 percent of our funding currently -- this is less than it used to be," she said.   Ractliffe said this week that information and application forms were freely available and that he had distributed R3 500 brochures about the Fund.   He said the Fund focused on organisations that were on the coal-face of development work and working directly with communities. The fund's brochure states that it assists organisations working with disadvantaged children, with a particular emphasis on children in detention, children who have had no formal education, who are handicapped, and homeless children.    Ractliffe said 92 grants had already been made, many to projects involving street children. Altogether R1,5-million had been disbursed and more than R5-million would be paid out in 1996, he said. The Fund intended to allocate not less than 75 percent of the interest from its capital base and 25 percent of its annual opening capital to projects every year, he said.   The Mandela Children's Fund has, in conjunction with other NGOs, helped to fund a Youth Development Centre at Leeuwkop Prison in Gauteng, a similar centre at Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal, and has donated R38 000 to the NGO Streetwise. The decisions about which NGOs and organisations to fund would be made at quarterly meetings by a committee of 14 managing trustees.   While the NGOs' official line is one of regret and restraint, their off-the-record comments tend to be resentful and, at time, vicious. "Nobody wants to say anything because it is politically incorrect to criticise the Mandela fund," said the source.    But Ractliffe is not exempt from criticism. He has been accused of trying to turn the Mandela fund into a personal empire, and of eluding telephone calls by NGOs attempting to establish information about the fund.    "Ractliffe is the fund," said a source. "You can't get past him."   Ractliffe said, "I have no desire to create a personal empire. All the information about the Fund is freely available. People who want to talk to me should keep trying, because I am always here."-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BusinessSouth African Mineworkers May Not Support Trade Union StrikeMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Jacquie Golding-Duffy   Johannesburg - The Congress of South African Trade Unions cannot count on the support of its main affiliate, the 300 000-strong National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), in its planned anti- privatisation strike on Tuesday.   Although, as a Cosatu affiliate, the NUM is bound to some degree by the federation's decision to strike, ambivalence is being displayed among some key NUM members.   The strike, aimed at what Cosatu terms the "unilateral restructuring of state assets", could fail, with one senior unionist, who wished to remain anonymous, describing Cosatu general secretary Sam Shilowa's militant stance as "mere posturing".   NUM general secretary Kgalema Motlanthe was tight-lipped about the strike, saying it was "inappropriate to comment", since talks between Cosatu and various other parties could "succeed in reconciling differences" and possibly reach agreement on the objectives of restructuring within the public and other sectors."   "All federation decisions are binding on affiliates,'' Motlanthe said.   However, should the NUM, as a backbone union of the federation, fail to render its support, Cosatu's "show of strength" will not make an impact.   Cosatu spokesperson Nowetu Mpati said she did not doubt the NUM would support the strike, especially as it participated in the decision- making process. "The strike will continue as planned, and we have distributed pamphlets in all the regions," Mpati said, adding Cosatu's affiliates had pledged "strong support" for the strike.   The strike is, however, ill-timed, with factory workers returning a day before Cosatu plans to show its "force of strength". The Federation of South African Labour Unions (Fedsal) also indicated last week that it had no intention of participating in the strike.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaTaxpayers to Pay Ex-Generals' Legal CostsMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Vuyo Mvoko   Johannesburg - The taxpayer is going to pay legal costs for former defence minister Magnus Malan and 10 senior officers in their murder trial which begins in early March in Durban.   General Malan and his co-accused, including former SADF chief General "Kat" Liebenberg, are accused of complicity in the massacre of 13 civilians at KwaMakhuta in KwaZulu-Natal in 1987.   The indictment against Malan and the others includes allegations about a secret sub- committee of the State Security Council which approved millions of rands for training Inkatha hit squads in the Caprivi from 1986.   Malan and others were arrested after the Durban-based Investigation Task Unit found secret documents linking them to the training of the hit-squads and the execution of the massacre.   Responding to a Mail & Guardian inquiry this week, Lieutenant-Colonel Damien de Lange, on behalf of the Minister of Defence, said defence costs of former SADF as well those of South African National Defence Force (SANDF) members involved in trials are and will be borne by the ministry. He would not explain how this decision had been reached beyond saying it was "at the instruction of the Treasury for Finance". He said he presumed the decision had been taken by the Cabinet.   De Lange said there was no provision to recover the money if the accused were found guilty. He said some would probably not be able to pay back the huge sums involved in their defence.    Office of the President spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the payment of the defence costs of the Malan 20 was never discussed in Cabinet.   The South African taxpayer has already paid out more than R3-million in legal costs for the defence of former policeman, Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock, in a trial which will probably end in March.   African National Congress spokesman Carl Niehaus said the organisation was "extremely uncomfortable" with the situation, but understood the dilemma facing the ministry, and that as long as there was a legal provision it was difficult for the ministry not to abide by it.   However M&G has learned there is some unhappiness about the government paying for the defence of Malan and his co-accused in the recently formed Secretariat for Defence. The Secretariat was established to ensure civilian accountability in the military.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Business BP Chooses First Black Exec to Lead Africa DivisionMail and Guardian (Johannesburg) January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Lynda Loxton   .TEXT  Johannesburg - Frederick Phaswana, the new chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum Southern Africa (BPSA) and head of BP's 13-country Africa Division, is no cosmetic, affirmative action appointee, but a BP man through and through.   This was borne out by the roar of approval that met the news of his appointment at the group's Cape Town offices from people he had worked with for more than 30 years.   Not only is he the first South African to run the Southern African operation, but he is the first black man appointed to head one of BP's five regional divisions.   The son of a tailor and a domestic worker, he was born in the Northern Transvaal town of Louis Trichardt in the heart of conservative white Afrikaners.   A bright pupil, Phaswana was sent to a Calvinist training college for primary school teachers at Bethesda near Pietersberg at the age of 13.   On completing Form Two, he went on to another church-run school, Emmarentia High School to complete his school leaving certificate.   But his stay at the school was prematurely halted when, three months before he was due to write his finals, he was expelled. The pupils had been protesting against the creation of the Republic of South Africa and some were woken up at two in the morning. Torches were shone in their faces and rifles poked in their ribs.   "They were only doing their job," Phaswana said without any bitterness.   "I wasn't hurt or anything like that. I was just rounded up with 10 others in my class, told to dress and put on a train back to Louis Trichardt.   "They told me that I would not be able to write my finals, even to finish school at all, unless I joined the police or the civil service, of course."   But Phaswana had registered to write his finals and had an examination number, which was all the examiners needed. So he was sent to a school in a rural area where he wrote his matric, obtaining a university exemption.   Because he was good at languages, Phaswana set his heart on a degree leading to a career in court interpreting. His brother agreed to help him finance his studies, but either forgot his promise or found it too difficult.   Anxious not to lose a good student, the university of the North contacted the then joint service company run by BP and Shell and arranged a bursary. The two companies set up in their own right in 1974.   He went on to study part-time for an Honours degree in energy economics through Unisa and for a Masters degree in Dutch literature through Rand Afrikaans University.    In the meantime, he needed a job and went to the oil company saying: "Listen here, you gave me a bursary, now give me a job." The company was somewhat taken aback, but agreed to take him on in its personnel department.   "I hadn't a clue about BP, personnel or anything else, so I asked what it was they did. When I gathered that they sat in an office and made plans for the chaps working at the bottom of the organisation, I said; 'Well, if that is what I am going to be doing, I think I had better go out there and work with the people on the ground. Then maybe I would become a better personnel officer.'"   Phaswana rolled drums in depots and filled rail tank cars for some years but by 1973 he was a personnel officer and identified as a fast tracker. By 1988, he was appointed a general manager responsible for various portfolios.   Phaswana was appointed to the board of BPSA in 1989, and in 1992 he became president of BP Nederland and BP Belgium, based in Amsterdam and Brussels.   On the question of black advancement, Phaswana said that whites had little to fear from their black colleagues. Rather than complain about the lack of black skills, they should acknowledge that they themselves had been living in a restricted business environment.   "In developing black staff, we have perhaps not applied ourselves as hard as we should," Phaswana said.   "It is a difficult problem, but we could have moved faster, more fundamentally. There is headroom for everyone to grow now and that is perhaps different from the past."   Phaswana takes over at a time when the South African oil industry is undergoing fundamental restructuring and he is under no illusions about the size of the task that faces him.   After years of tight secrecy and government regulations covering virtually every aspect of the business, deregulation and a greater openness have become the order of the day.   One of the most contentious issues in the industry is continued government subsidies to oil-from-coal producer Sasol. Even though these are being gradually scaled down, the fact that they continue to exist at all has been a bone of contention.   "We in BP do not have a problem in investing in the new refining capacity the market will soon demand," Phaswana said. "The caveat is how you do this when the playing field, set by government essentially, is uneven."-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaRain Water Economic GrowthMail and Guardian (Johannesburg) January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Simon Segal     Johannesburg - The South African Agricultural Union (SAAU) estimates that the good rains, should they continue into March could add 1,5 percentage points to South Africa's economic growth rate in 1996 (and 25 percent to South Africa's gross agricultural income of R30-billion in 1995).   This will account for around one-quarter of total economic growth in 1996. It will also raise agriculture's contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) from 4,6 percent in 1995 to more than six percent.   The only region in South Africa not to benefit from the rains are parts of the Northern Transvaal.   The main beneficiary of the rain is the maize industry which is now looking forward to a crop of seven to 10-million tons. Last year's crop was 4,4-million tons. Local consumption is around seven million tons, so South Africa should be able to export maize this year and restore its stockpile.   The wheat crop is estimated at 2,3-million tons (1,8-million last year) which should cover domestic consumption. Horticultural output is expected to grow 10 to 12 percent, while animal production should remain constant as herds are rebuilt.   Despite the rains, the SAAU does not expect food prices to drop over the year as demand picks up when world food stocks are at their lowest levels in 30 years.   Those foods that South Africa exports - mainly fruit and wine - could see price rises of over 10 percent. Other price rises should average around 10 percent.   The rains will also not reverse the narrowing trade gap between agricultural imports and exports. In 1994, when South Africa enjoyed a bumper agricultural season, agricultural exports totaled R8,3-billion and imports R4,9-billion. The Agricultural department reckons in 1995 exports were up 15 percent (to R9,5-billion) and imports 20 percent (to R6- billion). The rise in imports was largely due to loopholes in meat importation which has subsequently been tightened.   For 1996 the "guesstimate" is for exports to rise 10 percent (to R10,5-billion) and imports to increase by 15 percent (to R6,8-billion). The trend is clear - in a deregulating agricultural industry, imports are increasing at a more rapid rate than exports.   So the rains will bring more food, although not cheaper, and contribute favourably on a net basis to South Africa's balance of payments.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaExpensive Oil-from-Gas Plant Presents ConundrumMail and Guardian (Johannesburg) January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Aspasia Karras      Johannesburg - Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs, the old stalwart of the South African political theatre, Pik Botha openly concedes that Mossgas was a purely strategic investment that made absolutely no economic sense.    In fact, so categorical is he that he wryly points out, "If this had happened in a private company, the board of directors would have been fired."    Barring the irony, the statement about one more apartheid white elephant, is illustrative of the current privatisation debate.    The gas into oil conversion plant doubled its projected costs, so even though the plant is now producing a cash profit, it will never manage to put a dent in the R11-billion that it eventually cost the state. This, however, is history.    Botha concedes that he would never have taken that cabinet decision again; the question that now prevails is, what to do with it, and who should do it?   A brief summary of the "conundrum", as cabinet has characterised the issue, is difficult.    Mossgas and the Central Energy Fund (CEF) are pushing for an investment of R840-million in the Mossgas plant, in order to develop satellite fields and to introduce compression, from which they expect to yield a net income of about R2,5-billion in 26 months.    These figures have been challenged on the basis that the projected income was taking into account artificial elements, like tariff protection, and synfuel levy, which in light of the deregulation and rationalisation of government involvement in liquid fuels, is falsely premised.    The monitoring committee has opposed this, although it is prepared to contemplate limited compression, and has demanded that a survey of the marketability of Mossgas be undertaken.    The prospective buyer, or "invisible man", is being negotiated with the appointed consultants Rand Merchant Bank and international consultants Arthur D Little.   Some of the prospective buyers include: a troika composed of Sasol, Sentrachem and AECI, who plan to convert Mossgas into methanol production; an elusive Taiwanese option that brings into focus South Africa's continued flirtation with the wrong part of China; Sasol; Gencor; and even a recent suggestion from Deputy President Thabo Mbeki that Malaysia is willing to bid.    The deadline for the consultants to make a judgment call is the end of February, and while Botha is reluctant to estimate a price tag, what he does say is that a decision needs to be taken urgently on whether to invest, as the oil well is about to run dry.    The projected 25-year supply has dwindled to a mere five which means that the elephant will lose even more investment appeal, if production stops altogether in 1997 and Mossgas loses its cash-positive position. A decision on whether to invest the R840-million is of dire necessity   The question needs to be asked: why should the government privatise if there is an option of relative profitability? Neil Morrison of Rand Merchant Bank states that "To proceed with privatisation or changing the role of the state, it must demonstrably lead to tangible benefits for the various stakeholders, in particular labour and the historically disadvantaged."   Wielding his double-edged sword, Botha is the first to concede that oil is one of those strategic trump cards for any country, and yet questions the rationale of state involvement in industries in which it has very little expertise, resources and skill.    The much-slammed Moseneke report, as well as the upcoming Cosatu strike, bring the question into bold relief.    In determining the country's long-term interests, the urgency of certain decisions takes on tragic proportions. Botha attempts to resolve the conundrum with a typical rough and ready, diplomatic answer, "Prize number one, for me is to sell it but also to negotiate that the new owner produces a new product, so as to continue to generate economic stability and development in that part of the country."   He is full of those grand Rhodes-like visions, for development, eloquently conjuring up images of the Southern African Power Pool agreement to develop the Zaire rapids, solar power projects to be facilitated by the CEF, and tourist attractions in the Soutpan.    But most evidently the question of what is really in the country's good still troubles him. "Do you save on foreign exchange and earn income on fuel, or go for the jobsaving option that a conversion to methanol would provide? Perhaps a combination is more viable by retaining the state interest in part.   "The argument could also follow a different route, create long-term viability, but lose foreign exchange and suffer temporary job losses."   He is clear about electricity, though, "It is not in our interest to privatise, there needs to be centralisation, our status quo is a result of the fragmentation, there exist over 300 suppliers, and 2 000 tariffs, there is no clarity or security for potential investors. I have great faith in Dr Ian McRae (head of the National Electricity Forum) - he is a man of vision and imagination."   It is probably imagination that is needed in the question of privatisation. Morrison argues, "Government has to make the choice whether to squander the future as a competitive economy or to make hard adjustments right now. Policy matters, the decisions government makes, affects directly which shareholders benefit and which don't."   As to Mossgas, Rand Merchant Bank is still mum, arguing that it is premature to comment.    Botha, in a pithy allegory, sums it up by quoting a phrase that ex-cabinet minister Piet du Plessis has on his prison wall, "In die konsert van die lewe is daar geen program nie" which Botha then slyly adapts to "In die konsert van Mossgas is daar geen program nie."-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeSoccer: Cameroon Lion Meet Home Team in Cup OpenersMail and Guardian (Johannesburg) January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Lungile Madywabe     Johannesburg - South Africa opens the 20th African Nations Cup finals on Saturday with a tough clash against Cameroon at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, and in the Group of Death - the other teams are Egypt and Angola -- every point will be vital.   Because of the recent problems the Federation of Cameroon Football (Fecafoot) has had with Fifa over the government's interference with the election of Fecafoot members - coupled with the bad result on the field -- Cameroon come here as underdogs.    But it must not be forgotten that six years ago Cameroon stunned the world when they beat two-time world champions Argentina in the opening match of the World Cup in Italy. Cameroon sank Argentina with a first-half goal, and doggedly -- with nine men -- they defended until the final whistle to record a historic victory.    Rated as the "no hopers" in Italy, the west African country got the result that was to give African teams the respect they deserve on the international stage.    African champions in 1984 and 1988, and quarter-finalists in 1990 in Italy, the players of the Indomitable Lions will more than likely be able to withstand the pressure of the occasion on Saturday afternoon.    To use the words of one soccer official, 10 seconds before the game the South African players would have sweated three times more than their opponents. The simple reason is that Bafana Bafana have never played such an important match since their arrival back in the international arena.    But much has also changed since South Africa first took those first tentative steps back onto the international stage. South Africa can boast a run of seven unbeaten games this year and include in their line-up of seasoned strikers the likes of Wolverhampton Wanderers' Mark Williams and Philemon "Chippa" Masinga of Leeds United.    However both remain doubtful starters. Masinga will only arrive on Friday as Leeds played a cup game on Wednesday and Williams sustained an ankle injury doing duty for his team last weekend.    National coach Clive Barker seemed undisturbed, saying: "I am sure everyone will be fit for Saturday." Williams may be fit but Masinga playing after 10 hours on the plane would be asking too much.    Previously players and officials have used jet-lag as an excuse for bad performances, but with so much to play for one hopes that there will be no silly excuses.    Neil Tovey, the South African captain affectionately known as "mkhukhu", will have to marshal his defence against the likes of Francois Omam Biyick, Augustine Simo, Alphonse Tchami who now wears the famous number nine Roger Milla jersey.    Cameroon coach Jules Nyongha will pin his hopes on the dazzling midfielder Roger Feutumba to exploit any South African weaknesses. Feutumba played for Mamelodi Sundowns for most of this year so he has experience of local conditions and players.    With injury doubts about their forwards South Africa go into this game without too many attacking options and Daniel Mudau, who came in as a late replacement for Sean Dundee, is also suffering from an ankle injury.   Shaun Bartlett, who made his debut for South Africa in the recent Simba Four Nations Cup, will have to test his abilities against the big, strong Cameroon defence.    One thing that still baffles me is why the enterprising Umtata Bucks striker Brendon Augustine was left out. He last wore South African colours when he scored an equaliser against Mozambique in a friendly.   Comforting news is that Barker said he would call on him should the worst come to the worst. The winger Helman Mkhelele should be a constant menace down the line if he is played.     Their financial problems aside, Cameroon are sure to give South Africa and their supporters a run for their money. The two teams have met four times, sharing the spoils twice, with South Africa winning one and Cameroon taking the other.    The tournament is played in a round robin system, with three points for a win. The top two teams in each group will go through to the quarter-finals.    At this knockout stage, in the event of a draw after full time, 30 minutes extra time will be played followed by a penalty shootout if the two teams are still even.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeSailing: Yacht Rises To The OccasionMail and Guardian (Johannesburg) January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Jonathan Spencer Jones   Cape Town - CAPE TOWN put on her finest with an almost windless morning giving way to a fresh 20-knot south-easterly for the start of the Rothmans Cape to Rio on Saturday, and hundreds of well-wishers lining the seashore and on craft from jet skis to ocean-going tugs turned out to cheer the fleet on its way.   For the 46 entrants -- eight of the smaller yachts having taken the early start on January 2 -- the weeks and months, and in some cases years, of preparation came to fruition with the firing of the start gun by Deputy Minister of Defence Ronnie Kasrils at 3pm, and they were led off by the Whitbread 60 Corum Meteorite skippered by Frenchman Pierre Mas and German Hasso Plattner's hi-tech ILC 70 Fancourt's Morning Glory down to the first mark off Granger Bay.   Rounding just astern of Corum Meteorite, Fancourt's Morning Glory's spinnaker was the first to fly, however, and she surged ahead to lead round the second mark off Mouille Point -- and take the newly instituted Telkom Trophy as the first yacht to do so -- before setting a westerly course to clear Robben Island to seaward.   First of the South African entries round the second mark was the new Simonis 60 Warrior skippered by Rick Nankin, but opting instead to take full advantage of the south-easter, led the majority of the remainder of the fleet out of Table Bay on the "traditional" spinnaker run inshore of Robben Island.   The fleet soon started to spread, however, and by the end of the first day at sea, during which Fancourt's Morning Glory covered a 24- hour race record of 330 miles, some 150 miles separated the maxis from the smallest yachts at the rear, with Warrior marginally in the lead on handicap.   But day two belonged to the Lavranos-designed 77-foot maxi Daly's International Insurances skippered by Mike Daly sailing a more westerly course than the leaders and notching up 296 miles to put her into the lead on handicap, before reverting to the more north-westerly routing as her wind ran out.   By the end of the third day, Fancourt's Morning Glory had consolidated her lead to almost 40 miles ahead of a neck-and-neck Nicorette skippered by Swede Ludde Ingvall and Corum Meteorite following a slightly more southerly route, as well as moving into first place on handicap, four minutes ahead of Nicorette, while Warrior had slipped to fourth, behind third-placed Wizard with Jan Reuvers at the helm showing her form after a slow start.   In the cruiser monohull class, Durban yacht Dream Reach skippered by Colin Bryson held a marginal lead over Richard Holloway's Aquacoco, while in the multihull class, Colin Kenny's catamaran Manx -- sporting a revolutionary unstayed carbon fibre rig -- had moved into first place ahead of early leader Basic Instinct skippered by Kieran Draper.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeCricket: Winning Team Has Some Problems to SolveMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Jon Swift   Johannesburg - There is a time for reappraisal and reassessment in every sphere of diverse activity the universe has thankfully thrown our way. Such must surely be the case in the light of the truly heroic klap Hansie Cronje and his side gave the Poms over three glorious days of Cape sunshine.   And equally gratifying to finally break this country's one-day duck after four abortive attempts against England in a stirring victory at the same venue just five days later.   Right now, despite concerns about the brittle quality of the top order, there is the no doubt sage advice to the effect of the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" variety being applied. This unquestioning philosophy has some merit, but there are some areas which can be addressed immediately before it all gets broke faster than anyone can fix it.   The first is surely the question of a back-up wicketkeeper at national level. This is a priority both for the incumbent, Dave Richardson, and the future of the national team. Richardson has played every test since this country's readmission from the years of self-imposed darkness and, it must be added, played every one with distinction. He has borne an unenviable task with equanimity and taken the pressures which have so often been thrust unwillingly on him low down the order with dignity and calm.   But it also cannot be denied that at 36 he is getting very close to his sell-by date. It is time, perhaps, to use the lateral thinking that has so often been lacking in all this country's sporting endeavours to this particular problem which is fast closing in on the selectors.   We have had any number of pretenders to Richardson's crown. Erroll Stewart has come and gone. Steve Palframan has come and gone and then come again. Gerhardus Liebenberg was offered a brief flirtation, and youngsters like Nick Pothas and Paul Kirsten are waiting in the provincial wings.   Palframan is the heir apparent as the incumbent South Africa "A" - such an exercise in alphabetic semantics this name for a team - and among the 20 named for the initial World Cup squad. One must question his ability close to the stumps against a spinner like Paul Adams though. Adams is going to be around for a while. The man behind the stumps will have to grow with him.   And why, too, did Palframan not do exactly what Richardson did when Adams had him floundering and ask the teenage wrist spin wonder to explain what he was doing?   Richardson's perception of the Adams wiles improved dramatically after an on-pitch conflab at Newlands. For the reserve side against England at Kimberley, Palframan never quite seemed to get the hang of it.   Liebenberg, one feels, will never wear the wicketkeeping gloves with any real panache, although there can be little doubt that he has a fine future as a batsman.   Pothas is rapidly improving behind the stumps under the tutelage of Ray Jennings at Transvaal and has a maiden ton against the English to show that his batting is coming on in leaps and bounds.   Kirsten has all the pedigree and the competitive nature of his pedigree and one feels that he will one day take the step that the Kirsten family seem to regard as a natural progression.   But none of them look really ready to step in if Richardson decides to call it a day ... and yet there is an answer if the selectors look past the obvious.   Rudi Steyn has all the credentials even if it is a while since he has stood behind the stumps. He kept wicket with some distinction for South African Universities and has also been considered good enough to open the batting for this country. He also has the advantage of nine years on Richardson.   Steyn is, in perhaps a different light, the type of multi-discipline player coach Bob Woolmer is on record as saying he is looking for.   The multi-discipline approach has already thrown up Shaun Pollock, Jacques Kallis and - if you include his batting heroics with Dave Richardson in the 73-run last wicket stand which ultimately was a major factor in winning the test and series at Newlands - Paul Adams.   On Adams, several volumes have already been written about a man who has yet to reach his 19th birthday and play a hat-trick of test matches.    There are still some patently raw patches about him which a career slated to be a long one will surely iron out.    The unique strangulated action and a control far beyond his years are always going to give opposition batters problems.   But Adams, who has already learnt to disguise his grip, needs to concentrate on the speed of his run-up for the arm ball he bowls so well. His pace quickens perceptibly up to the wicket and makes it easy to pick.   The youngster also needs to learn that the simplest way to get the ball to loop up to the bat is to deliver from half a yard (it is after all an imperial game) short of the crease.    These fairly simplistic things he will learn. He is too good a player to ignore them.   Pollock, too, has been a revelation. He has a superb action and the fire to take the batsman on physically which makes a great fast bowler. Surely, this cannot be argued after his five- wicket haul at Newlands. Or his four for 34 in the opening one-day encounter against England at the same venue.   Grafted onto this is a growing confidence in his undoubted ability with the bat shown in the stand at Kingsmead with Allan Donald and the sparkling 66 off a like number of balls in the 50-overs match at Newlands.   Kallis, while he does not have the pace of a Pollock or a Donald or indeed the frustrating guile of Adams, is a more than useful medium pacer and will only grow in this department as his test experience is rounded out.   But there remains one point to consider. The pressure on Kallis with the bat is far more intense than the pressure on the Cape 20-year- old with the ball.    And one senses that while Pollock and Adams have been allowed to play their natural games, Kallis has operated under the severe restrictions of a preconceived game plan and his place in the batting line-up.   It returns us to the use of lateral thinking. Kallis is naturally aggressive with the bat and equally at home in the troublesome No 3 spot. Against England in the decider in Cape Town he was neither. And this with Hansie Cronje battling to find anything approaching the form he is capable of.   Talent, it is true, will come through eventually, but placing shackles on it either slows the growth or stunts it altogether. Giving Kallis a freer rein while impressing him with his responsibilities at the crease could have been one solution.    Moving him up an order which has stuttered and started at the top end is another.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaCape Town Presses Olympic BidMail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Julian Drew    Johannesburg - Eleven cities will go to the starting blocks in the race to host the 2004 Olympic Games, it was revealed in Lausanne on Wednesday. That was the deadline set by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the filing of candidatures at its headquarters in Switzerland.   Until Wednesday it was like trying to predict the outcome of a race without knowing who the runners would be but the contestants are now clear-cut in the bid to secure the IOC's nomination in September 1997. Besides Cape Town the other cities are: Athens, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, Lille, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, San Juan (Puerto Rico), Seville, St Petersburg and Stockholm.    Although there had been much speculation about a Chinese bid, either from Beijing, who lost out narrowly to Sydney in the bid for the 2000 Olympics, or Shanghai, they declined to file, much to the relief of South Africa.    Whether the mandarins in the politburo were too disheartened with the unfathomable workings of the IOC after losing with what they had incorrectly considered a winning ticket, or they were simply making way for their "comrades" in Africa, remains to be seen. But with China out of the way South Africa should have sole sway over the emotional and political votes. And, provided this country can deliver a competent technical bid, those votes should be enough to see the Games come to Africa for the first time.    Chris Ball, chief executive officer of the Cape Town 2004 Olympic Bid, was upbeat about Cape Town's chances, but he warned against complacency. "I believe every single candidate must be taken seriously. There are still 21 months of this process to go and a lot can still happen. There have been surprises in the past.   "For example, in the contest for the Winter Olympics when Lillehammer won it was not the favourite. Therefore one should never discount one's competitors, " said Ball.    Obviously it is prudent to avoid counting your chickens before they've hatched for past experience has shown that the only certainty is that there are no sure-fire favourites where the members of the world's most exclusive club are concerned.    For historical reasons Athens was considered to be a foregone conclusion to host the Centennial Olympic Games this year but lost out to Atlanta through what many believe was the Coca-Cola factor. Also, 1988 hosts Seoul were considered no match for Nagoya and Mexico City was thought to be the least likely of the four candidates for the 1968 Olympics because of its altitude.    South Africa has much going for it in terms of "the missing ring" factor which refers to Africa (represented by the black ring among the five Olympic rings) never having hosted the Games, together with the enormous amount of goodwill that exists towards this country at the moment.    But there are also issues which will favour some of the other cities. South America has never hosted the Games, which could favour Buenos Aires or Rio.    South Africa should be able to count on Africa's 19 members among the IOC's full complement of 106 but with Istanbul bidding for the second time, six of Africa's 19 votes could join an Islamic block if talk of block voting is to be believed.    Rome can be expected to mount a strong challenge with the powerful, although not necessarily popular, athletics supremo, Primo Nebiolo, leading the hunt for votes - something he has proved rather adept at when ensuring his own position.    But Rome has hosted the Games before, as has Stockholm. The Swedish capital will pose a threat with its superb array of infrastructure already in place together with a proven record of efficiency and a national environmental policy without equal. But providing South Africa does its homework properly it is difficult to see it losing.    "Our responsibility is to make sure that we submit a very professional technical plan. We must not rely on emotion. We must compete and be professional and that's what we intend to do," said Ball.   "We want our technical bid to be as competent as anybody's and I hope that we will then be able to persuade people not only that Cape Town is the best place to have the Olympic Games in 2004, but also that there is validity in the concept that an Olympics in Southern Africa can make a major impact on the socio- economic and socio-political future of this part of the world."   Socio-economic impact is perhaps the greatest worry for most South Africans, particularly the residents of the Western Cape. Many people believe that the Games will prove to be an economic extravaganza the country can ill afford and that the taxpayer and ratepayers will end up footing any deficit.   Ball and his committee are well aware of such perceptions. "We are starting a proactive approach in Cape Town which will be extended nationally to give more details of the real facts, our capability and the excitement of the bid. Until now we've tended to keep our heads down and deal with the preparation of the physical product. That was a policy decision. We felt that we couldn't go ahead and make a noise until we were satisfied we were on absolutely firm ground. We are now quite sure that we are on firm ground," said Ball.    What the South African public is going to want reassurance about is the cost of the bid, but if the preliminary operating budget is accurate there is no need for alarm. It is predicted that the total revenue for the Games from television rights, sponsorships and ticket sales will be R4,21-billion which will produce a net surplus of R94 million after the Games are over.   These revenues have made allowance for R504- million to go towards the provision of facilities in a total capital expenditure budget of R1,761-billion of which only R978- million will come from central government.    These funds from government are required to upgrade the road and rail system in Cape Town and would have to be spent at some time in the future anyway. The government is therefore only being asked to bring its funding forward to assist with the staging of the Games.    This means a shifting in the priorities of some of the government's transport budget but in terms of the benefits of staging the Games it will be more than worthwhile. The bottom line for the ratepayers of Cape Town is that the Games will not cost them anything and they will be left with an excellent set of sporting facilities and a much improved transport infrastructure.    Of course this scenario relies on the assumption that Ball and his team have got their sums right. But with R2,5-billion in television rights already guaranteed (more than was budgeted for) from NBC's television deal with the IOC late last year and a well tested IOC marketing programme, much of the revenue is assured irrespective of where the Games are held.    The trick is going to be in keeping the cost of sports facilities to a minimum while still meeting the requirements of the International Sports Federations. Cape Town's operating budget is lower than Atlanta's (R5,69-billion) but higher than Sydney's (R3,46-billion at the time of bidding). Such figures can be misleading though because they do not always include the same things and the viability of Cape Town's figures will only really be put to the test when they are reviewed by the IOC's Evaluation Commission.    On January 23 the bidding cities will be briefed by the IOC in Lausanne on the electoral procedure. They will then have to finalise their bid books containing the technical details covering 19 different themes relating to the staging of the Games.    These must be submitted to the IOC by August 15 and then towards the end of September the Evaluation Commission will begin its inspection visits to the candidate cities. The commission will present a report to the IOC next February and four of the 11 cities will be nominated as finalists for the bid.    These four cities will then be allowed to canvass the members of the IOC and the host city will be selected in a secret ballot at the IOC session in Lausanne on September 5 1997.    Ball and many others believe the Games are an economic opportunity South Africa simply cannot afford to miss. Certainly the staging of the Games provided a major boost to the economies of Japan and Korea which went on to become major world players. But by the same token Mexico also held the Games and has remained very much a Third-World economy. Only time will tell which route South Africa will take? -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Zambia U.S. Lawyers Advise on Constitution.TEXT The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)January 9, 1996 (19960109) by Masautso Phiri    Lusaka - Two American public lawyers have praised the preamble and provisions of the 1991 Zambian constitution on press freedom and freedom of speech which they say echoes similar sentiments in the American constitution.   But they have advised Zambians to debate openly if such provisions are to become a reality.   "I am speaking as an outsider but I see natural rights of the individual in the words in the preamble like inherent, inviolable," said US lawyer David Putter.   Speaking at the United States Information Service (USIS) centre yesterday  in a discussion organised jointly by the centre and the Law Association of Zambia, Paul Berch and Putter pointed to some 1991 provisions which they said were similar to those in the American constitution.   "It is the principles and analyses of the American constitution which we can apply to the Zambian constitution. There may be parallels," Berch advised. "The preamble to the 1991 constitution recognised the relationship between the people and the government."   Putter added: "The language of the 1991 constitution recognises the individual person as the source of power." According to Putter the 1991 Zambian constitution "makes a strong statement which you will find in the American constitution" on press freedom and speech.   "Where government is based on the individual the scale of justice is tilted in favour of the individual and government has to justify its actions,"  Putter said. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaPro-Democracy Group Calls for Independent Electoral Commission Post of Zambia (Lusaka)January 10, 1996 (19960110)by Reuben Phiri   Lusaka - The Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) yesterday called on the government to seriously consider de-linking the Electoral Commission from government to enhance democracy.   FODEP's call comes barely a week after opposition parties called for the resignation of chairman of the Electoral Commission Justice Weston Muzyamba for abdicating his constitutional and legal responsibilities to the government.    FODEP alluded to this view saying even matters of extension of the registration exercise are being referred to cabinet by the commission.  "Only cabinet can decide making the commission totally toothless," carped FODEP secretary Bishop John Mambo.   Mambo accused members of the ruling MMD of having a "short memory" because they had agreed during the Cathedral meeting in 1991 that the Elections Office would be autonomous.   "We agreed that whoever comes into power and forms government, the first step was to de-link the Elections Office from government," Mambo said. "But it seems people have short memories."   FODEP said that the commission has to be seen to be independent and this is paramount as people are identifying it with the ruling party.    Meanwhile, Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president Alfred Zulu said extension of the voters registration will not make any difference to the apathy that has rocked the month long exercise. He instead suggested the issue should be first taken to parliament to amend the act which he described as outdated.   "The government should amend all acts, rules and regulations that impede initiative in the registration of voters," Zulu said in an interview yesterday.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BusinessLusaka Stock Exchange Readies ZCCM SharesPost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 10, 1996 (19960110)by Sipo Kapumba   Lusaka - Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) is finalising details which would lead to the listing of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) "B" shares.   LuSE general manager Charles Mate said in an interview on Monday that a lot  of work had been done so far towards achieving that goal and what remained was "tidying up the loose ends which are too numerous to mention".   ZCCM released a prospectus in February last year in which it stated that it would like to float 35,470,620 of its "B" shares on the exchange but to date they have not. And these account for 39.7 per cent of ZCCM's total shares.   Anglo American Corporation, through its subsidiary company Zambia Copper Industries (ZCI) Holdings Limited, owns 27.3 per cent of these "B" shares while the rest are held by various sections of the public.    The government owns the remainder of the 60.3 per cent of ZCCM shares, classified as "A" shares.    Stock exchange analysts say the delay in listing the "B" shares was due to disagreements between ZCCM and LuSE about how the floatation should be done.   Last month discussions between the LuSE and ZCCM intensified and now there is speculation that the two have agreed on a date for the listing, but Mate  denies this. "We are working on it, but we have not finalised it. I can't give a date because I have not got one," Mate said on Monday.   He added that he was reluctant to give further details because any "careless and uncalculated statements could have global repercussions on stock markets".   But ZCCM insists all has been done on its part, and what remains is for LuSE to sort out."We applied for the listing so it is up to them to comment on the matter," public relations manager Francis Musonda said in an interview on Monday.   But some analysts have questioned the wisdom of listing the ZCCM "B" shares on the exchange given that the company is experiencing declining production  and if the government sticks to its plans, it will not be until next year before the mines are privatised.   Theo Bull, a member of the Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industries (ZACCI) said in an interview on Saturday that it would be unwise to invest in the shares before fundamental issues like privatisation were addressed.   In addition he said floating the "B" shares would not have much impact on ZCCM because the more important "A" shares would still be in government control.   Stock brokers, like Finance Securities' Nduba Namoonde, say the listing of ZCCM shares was welcome and it would make the LuSE the second largest  capitalised exchange in the region after the Johannesburg exchange and would lead to increased business on the exchange.    Namoonde said the prospects for the company were getting better especially that the government has indicated that it would like to recapitalise the mines with the involvement of Anglo American Corporation. He added that investing in ZCCM when the company is not doing very well at the moment means that people will buy the shares cheaply but would be able to sell them at a profit when the company's fortunes change.-0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaGovernment Extends Voter RegistrationPost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 11, 1996 (19960111)by Staff Reporter   Lusaka - THE government finally succumbed to opposition pressure yesterday and extended the voters registration exercise by another month effective today. But MMD national secretary, health minister Michael Sata, has advised that extensions will not be upheld forever.   "We can not keep on extending deadlines. What happens if again people don't register?" Sata asked in an interview yesterday. "Such extensions could derail our democracy because whatever register will be in place at the time of the deadline must be used."    And announcing the extension in Lusaka yesterday Electoral Commission chairman Justice Weston Muzyamba said the Elections Office needed K2 billion to pay the officers running the exercise.    "I have been informed by the Director of Elections that K1billion is needed for the work done so far and another K1billion for the period that has been extended, " Muzyamba said. "We have to raise this money as soon as possible because without it, this extension will be meaningless, the registration officers need to be paid."   The exercise will run until February 9.    Muzyamba, however, warned that the public should make good use of the  extension because there might "not be another after this one". And Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) has hailed the government's decision to extend the registration exercise saying it was a "healthy sign"    "It's very important to note that the government can at least adhere to people's demands because it would not have really augured well had they  ignored people's calls," FODEP secretary Bishop John Mambo said in an  interview yesterday.   Last week opposition parties piled pressure on the government urging it to extend the registration period. Mambo has also said "in the future, the commission must be made totally, independent so that decisions like those of extending should not await the  government approval."   He said the commission should be independent enough to look at all disputes arising from the elections in order to make the whole democratising process more meaningful.   President Frederick Chiluba almost missed the deadline for the exercise in Ndola yesterday when he was among the last people registering on the  scheduled final day of the exercise. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BusinessKLM Launches Direct Flights to ZambiaPost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 11, 1996 (19960111)by Masauso Lungu   Lusaka - KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' first flight to Zambia will touch down at Lusaka  International Airport at 14:20 hours today.The airline will fly twice-weekly, on Mondays and Wednesdays, into Lusaka using an MD 11 aircraft.

But Yewondwossen had some 'personal' worries about KLM's entry into the Zambian market.

The expert, Hendrick Van der Heijden, disclosed this during a State House-organised press briefing.    Heijden, however,  said the growth heavily depended on how swift the government moves in privatising Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).    "The current price of copper at the world market is $1.10 per pound and if Zambia increases to export well, the economy should be expected to be on track with our forecast," Heijden said.    He said with the availability of other exports at the export board of Zambia, no problem should be perceived in maintaining the growth rate.    "You will be surprised to find how much there is to export at the export board, flowers and other products, while if you visit the tobacco farmers, you will find them smiling because they are doing good business abroad," Heijden  said.    Zambia's graduation from SAP to ESAF is according to Heijden the largest contributor to the expected economic boom as it allows Zambia to borrow at  concessional rates.    But a press release by the World Bank shortly after Consultative Group meeting last December in Bournemouth said Zambia's external aid partners emphasised the vital link between good governance, economic growth, and improving the welfare of the Zambian people. The donors also registered concern on governance issues. In response, the Zambian government delegation reaffirmed its determination to continue on the path towards irreversible democratic change, including constitutional changes based on consensus. It also reiterated its strong commitment to free and fair elections.    But the government has continued to oppose and resist proposals by the opposition and civic organisations to adopt the constitution through a constituent assembly, insisting the parliament they dominate is the only legally empowered institution to do so.     "Everybody in Zambia is represented in parliament, and besides, only parliament can enact a Constitution while a constituent assembly can only vet some clauses," President Chiluba's public relations and press aide Richard Sakala reiterated the government's position at a press briefing at State House yesterday. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Arts and CultureZambians Urged to Take An Interest in ArtPost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Joe Kaunda      Lusaka - A 50-year-old traditional potter has called on Zambians to develop an interest in art if they are expected to help preserve culture in the country.    Malita Chanda, who has more than 40 years experience in traditional clay pot making, said this in an interview on Wednesday at a Visual Arts Council (VAC) women's art workshop.    She said there was a need to learn simple traditional works such as  clay pot making to help preserve our ailing cultural background.    "Tufwile ukusambilila ukub-umba ifya pala inongo ne fingi ifyaibela nga tu li no kusunga intambi shesu (We must try to learn activities like the moulding of clay pots and many other traditional works if we are to help  preserve our culture)," Chanda said in a local lunguage, Bemba.    Chanda, who is also a leading marriage counsellor in Lusaka, had been invited to teach women artists participating in the VAC women's art workshop skills in traditional pottery which she learnt while in her village in Kasama.    The workshop, which ends today, was organised to facilitate the exchange of ideas of women in the field of arts and attracted 22 women participants drawn from all provinces in the country.    At the same function veteran woman artist and VAC national treasurer, Agness Yombwe, on Wednesday revealed that the workshop concentrated on the exploitation of found materials (scrap material) which were inexpensive and readily available for use by the artist. It was  funded by the European Union/CICIBA at a cost of K3.1 million.    The workshop will be closed tomorrow by community development permanent secretary, Hellen Matanda with an exhibition of the artworks prepared during the 10-day duration of the workshop. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Business[Column] Market Economy Has Made Zambians More ProductivePost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Mwanachonga H Chipewo (Column)   Lusaka - Scientists have dug up theories about human behaviour and have rightly postulated about what can make persons become ingenious to achieve a predetermined goal. The democratic governance  and the market economic system are the panacea which unshackles man from the bondage of dependance and indolence to the freedoms of choice, creativity, resourcefulness and ingenuity.    The last four years of practicing democratic governance and market economic system have vindicated this postulate. The moment the economy was deregulated and all impediments to trade both local and foreign removed, the once seemingly unwitting populace and docile citizenry simply jettisoned and reverberated into the commercial activity totally unprecedented in the history of the nation. Under the stimuli of hunger and poverty, the most aggressive among the citizenry sauntered into the world and brought into this country anything conceivable from the mundane to the most sophisticated to the benefit of all. In the euphoria, however, confusion has reigned.    The elements that have been caught on the left and napping in all of this ecstasy are the authorities. From empirical evidence and so far as things are happening, it is evident that the governmental regulatory bodies were and are still not prepared and have lamentably failed to cope with the dictates of the performance of the market economic system. The market economic system, while priding itself on the ability to provide goods and services in abundance and efficiently, more often than not  is wrought with vices and unbecoming trade practices which can wreak havoc in the economy. Fair competition is healthy but unfair competition is not. Unfair competition utilises resources inefficiently and erodes profit margins which are essential to the growth of any business enterprise.    Players in the market are not capable of regulating themselves for optimum operations. This is where different governmental bodies dealing with commerce and trade come in to establish rules and regulations to ensure that unfair practices are eliminated.     What should be borne in mind is the fact that the market economy calls for greater responsibility on the part of both government and the players in the market.    The government acts as the referee and for as long as the referee plays  the part efficiently and effectively, the players in the market will respond accordingly.    As of now, these regulatory bodies in government are dormant and starting soon, this article will begin analysing them one by one to show what they should do in order to help build a vibrant commercial practice in the country. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeZambia Off to Slow Start in Davis CupPost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 12, 1996 (19960112)by Reuben Tonga   Lusaka - Zambia lost her first game but won the second in the on-going International Tennis Championship, the Davis Cup, in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. Zambia lost to Cyprus in all the three sets but managed to pull off a victory over Djibouti.

Zambia Tennis Association general secretary Austin Fuliwa has however hailed the performance of the Zambian team in the Davis Cup.    "This is the equivalent of the soccer world cup and beating some teams for our players  is a very great effort, considering also that none of these players play professional tennis," Fuliwa said in an interview yesterday    Zambia plays her next game against Ireland tomorrow. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Sao Tome and PrincipePresident Selects Unity CabinetAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)   Sao Tome - A national government of unity has taken over in Sao Tome and Principe after being appointed by President Miguel Trovoada to tackle the economic and social ills facing this former Portuguese territory off the coast of West Africa.   The 12-member team headed by Prime Minister Vaz d'Almeida took over on January 5 but was not expected to endure much beyond presidential elections scheduled for March 3, only a month before Trovoada's mandate expires in April.   The new government includes six members of the former Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP/PSD), which holds the majority in parliament and four ministers from the Independent Democratic Alliance (ADI) which backs Trovoada. One other minister is from the Democratic Opposition Coalition (CODO), which is not represented in parliament.   The main opposition Democratic Convergence Party (PCD) which came to power in the years after the country abandoned single-party rule in 1990, refused to join the national unity administration.   D'Almeida on January 6 asked for a "grace period of 45 days to carry through some urgent measures".   He said he would seek to "bring a new momentum to the administration to help the state restore its credibility" after the military coup which briefly unseated Trovoada last August.   He vowed to be "rigorous and firm and to tackle the indiscipline and breakdown in law and order affecting the country".   During his New Year message to the nation, Trovoada set March 3 as the date for presidential elections in the small Atlantic archipelago.   Trovoada also expressed satisfaction at the outcome of inter-party discussions aimed at forming a government of national unity and thereafter named Vaz d'Almeida prime minister in place of Carlos da Graca.   Vaz d'Almeida was deputy prime minister in Da Graca's outgoing government and is also deputy secretary general of the MLSTP/PSD liberation movement.   Sao Tome and Principe, situated off the West African coast, gained independence from Portugal in 1975.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996GhanaOpposition Says President Must Resign All Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)   Accra - Two major opposition parties in Ghana have called on President Jerry Rawlings to resign following accusations by Vice-President Kow Arkaah that Rawlings assaulted him during a cabinet meeting last month.   Peter Ala Adjetey and Alhaji Asuma Banda, respectively leaders of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the Peoples Convention Party (PCP) told a press conference on January 4 that the behaviour of the president, in full view of the December 28 cabinet meeting, was unprecedented in the history of Ghana.   Arkaah alleged that Rawlings kicked him in the groin, injured his left eye and tore his jacket in reaction to allegations of corruption.   Arkaah, 68, said the violence had broken out after the president, 48, had walked into the meeting and accused his Vice-President of stating that corrupt practices went on during the regular cabinet sessions. "Before one could say anything, he gave me a terrible blow on the shoulder which sent me falling," the police document said, quoting the vice president.   "I fell on my back. He began to pull me up but I would not allow him, so he tore up the shoulders of my jacket in the process. He then gave me a series of kicks in the groin," Arkaah said, adding that he never attempted to hit back "due to my respect for (Rawlings) as the President of the Republic of Ghana."   But reading from a prepared statement, Adjetey said "the gravity of the act required that the president, in the interest of the dignity and honour of the Republic, resign his high office now."   The incident was "not only unacceptable, but unpardonable in our social and cultural code of behaviour," he said.   Rawlings' resignation is "the only way by which the dispute into which the presidency has fallen can be repaired," he said, urging Ghana's parliament to initiate impeachment proceedings against Rawlings should he fail to heed the resignation call.   "The issue calls for a national, not partisan response as the matter goes to the very survival of the institutions of the Fourth Republic," it said.   "Members of Parliament should not forget that this is an election year and (if they do not act) they would be left with the task of explaining to their constituencies why they could not take this action to restore the dignity of the nation," said Adjetey.   Rawlings' National Democratic Conference currently holds 188 of the 200 seats in parliament.   On December 29, the cabinet confirmed that Rawlings confronted Arkaah on December 28 in reaction to allegations made by the vice-president that corrupt practices took place during ministers' meetings.   The cabinet statement also suggested that unless Arkaah could substantiate his allegations, his presence on the cabinet would be problematic, but Arkaah has since said he would not resign over the issue, because Rawlings has no power under the constitution to sack his vice-president.   But in his first reaction on January 8, Rawlings launched a scathing attack on Arkaah and asked: "How can a man who has formed an alliance with our opposition parties continue to be the vice-president of this government? He insists he can still sit in at cabinet meetings because the constitution says so, unless he tends to subvert the government from within."   In his address during the third anniversary celebrations, Rawlings said the allegations of assault had soured the atmosphere for the Ghanaian government, its friends and potential investors.   During the parade, watched by more than 15,000 people including diplomats, Arkaah sat passively beside his wife, Marian, and Rawlings and his wife, Nana Konadu, during the three-hour ceremony, during which the president took a military salute from 120 officers and 3,100 soldiers.   Arkaah, who had not been expected to attend, was greeted with cheers when his arrival was announced. Tension between the two men, who won elections on a joint ticket in 1992, has been common knowledge since early this year.   In May, Arkaah called on Rawlings to rescind a controversial value- added tax, which sparked a wave of social discontent.   A spokesman for the opposition Alliance For Change (AFC) said that Rawlings' behaviour was sufficient to merit his impeachment.   "Rawlings is a disgrace to Ghana. How can a president behave this way?" he said. Rawlings has ruled this West African state since coming to power in a coup in June 1979.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996KenyaGovernment Agrees to Register Muslim CollegeAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)   Nairobi - A directive by Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi that a Muslim teachers' training college be registered has brought to an amicable end a wrangle between the country's Muslims and the Ministry of Education.   The presidential order on January 9 came following a meeting between the Head of State and a delegation comprising prominent scholars of Islam, Imams and Members of Parliament at Moi's Harambee House office here.   The country's Muslim community, at loggerheads with Education Minister Mr. Joseph Kamotho over the registration of the shs. 20 million (US dollars 400,000) Mombasa (coast region)-based Islamic Teachers College in Mikindani area, had been warned by the ministry against establishing any academic programme. The Muslim community had earlier on expressed intentions to train 104 Islamic teachers annually.   Consequently, the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM) had threatened to sue the government alleging religious discrimination while some zealots of the unregistered Islamic Party of Kenya (IPK) had declared a fatwa (death sentence) on Education Minister Joseph Kamotho.   SUPKEM's argument was based on the fact that of the six private teacher training colleges in the country, five are run by Christian churches. They insisted that Muslims should also have their own colleges and charged that there is a serious shortage of trained muslims to teach Islamic Religious Education (RE) in schools. Most students are thus forced to opt for Christian Religious Education (CRE) which is more developed.   Education Director Mr. Ezra Njoka had dismissed the problem as statistical. "We have enough teachers and we do not have the capacity to absorb them all. We are just not registering any more colleges," he had said before Moi's intervention.   The delegation to the President's office last week was led by SUPKEM chairman, Prof. Al-Busaidy, who thanked the President on behalf of Kenya's Muslims and said there was no pre-condition for the Ministry of Education to employ graduates from the new college.   The Ministry of Education plans to convert some of the 20 teachers training colleges it runs into secondary schools and polytechnics.   Teachers remain some of the least paid Kenyan workers and often have their salaries delayed. Many Muslims however believe the government had blocked registration of the colleges - one at Mikindani, Coast Province, the other in Murang'a in Central Province - because it fears a connection with the IPK.   Since its founding in 1991, the IPK has campaigned against what it claims to be official neglect and marginalisation of Kenyan Muslims who comprise about 10 per cent of the national population of 25 million people. Muslims, although spread out all over the country are mainly concentrated in the coastal region and northern parts of the country.   On the whole, Christian-Muslim relations in Kenya have been peaceful but increasing suspicion seems to be rising between the two religious groups with the latter feeling the former are favoured by the State. President Moi is a Christian.   Muslims have consequently cultivated a high media profile by sponsoring several programmes a week especially on the national radio.   Although Christians have steered clear of the present controversy, there is no telling where the suspicion may end.   However, by the time of going to press various reactions had been registered regarding President Moi's directive on the Muslim college.   Opposition leaders and the unregistered IPK were of the opinion that Moi's move was merely a political ploy.   Mombasa Mayor Ahmed Mwidani, in whose region the teacher's training institution is situated, supported the registration of the college saying the Head of State was concerned about the welfare of Muslims in the country.   By January 10, students were reported arriving for enrolment for the 1996 academic year.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996UgandaAnglican Head Reshuffles LeadershipAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)    Kampala - The head of the Church of Uganda Archbishop Livingstone Nkoyoyo has announced sweeping changes in the church in a move to curb what he called "corruption and inefficiency in the church top circles."   The changes range from forced retirement of some of the Bishops whose terms have expired to forced transfer of some members of the laity.   "Those bishops who have refused transfer should either quit or accept transfer," Archbishop Nkoyoyo said on January 8 in his first major statement published in Kampala since he came to office last year.   In a pastoral letter entitled The Anglican Church of Uganda policy of work and guidelines, Nkoyoyo says the changes are meant to address "factors that have caused conflicts in the church leading to some followers quitting for emerging sects."   The Archbishop said; "Some church leaders aim at only amassing wealth I will have no mercy on them." Although the Archbishop neither said when he would effect the changes nor named the leaders in question his remarks were generally understood to be reaction to the ongoing row in the eastern church of Uganda Busoga diocese, the biggest controversy in the church so far.   Some Busoga Christians are locked up in a wrangle with their Bishop Cyprian Bamwoze whom they accuse of misuse of church funds.   Bishop Bamwoze has recently rejected an appeal by Archbishop Nkoyoyo to consider retiring or transfer as a means to solve the crisis.   Archbishop Nkoyoyo also said in his pastoral letter that the church of Uganda will soon issue its comprehensive position on general elections in the country scheduled for March this year.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996KenyaWater Pumps Delivered to Arid AreasAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)   Nairobi - About 15,000 people in the semi-arid Makueni and Kitui districts of Kenya's eastern province will benefit from 10 water hand pumps worth Ksh.500,000 (US dollars 10,000) donated by Nairobi District Round Table No.23.   Speaking during the handing-over ceremony, at the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) headquarters in Nairobi on January 10, Round Table No.23 Chairman, Mr. Raj Binder Singh said he was confident the hand pumps will be useful in providing clean drinking water for the rural people they were intended for.   Round Tablers, he said, are a non-political service association of young men between the ages of 18 and 40. Their objectives "are the encouragement of high ethical standards in commercial life, .. and service to the community."   Receiving the water hand pumps on behalf of Ambassador Development Agency (ADA) which was behind their procurrement for the Makueni and Kitui rural beneficiaries, ADA Chairman, Dr. J.K.

In his speech, ADA Programmes Director Mr. Francis Muthoga, said the agency "works closely with poor communities in their endeavour to respond to people's spiritual and physical needs."

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to condemn the sentence imposed yesterday, 11 January, on Freedom Neruda, deputy editor of the daily La Voie.   Neruda was sentenced to two years imprisonment and fined CFA6 million US$12,000) for "offenses against the head of state."    Before his arrest on 2 January, Neruda's colleagues, Abou Drahamane Sangare, director of publications of the Nouvel Horizon group which owns La Voie, and La Voie journalist Kore Emmanuel, were also each sentenced on 28 December to two years in prison for "offending the chief of state," and fined three million CFA (US$6,000).  La Voie was also banned for three months.   Their charges stem from the 18 December La Voie article which suggested that Your Excellency brought bad luck to the Ivorian soccer team ASEC by attending the 16 December African Champions Cup final, which the favored ASEC lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates.   CPJ contends that the sentences handed down against Neruda, Sangare and Emmanuel are excessive and unjustified.  Having previously written to Your Excellency on 4 January regarding this matter, we strengthen our call for the nullification of their convictions, and their immediate and unconditional release.

Orme, Jr., Executive Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists,  to President Konan Bedie of Cote D'Ivoire    The Committee to Protect Journalists writes to strongly protest the arrest of Freedom Neruda, deputy editor of the independent opposition daily, La Voie, and to condemn the sentencing of his two colleagues.   Neruda was arrested on January 2, 1996 and held for questioning. The next day, he was taken to an Abidjan correctional institution and charged with insulting the head of state.    Neruda was out of town when his colleagues, Abou Drahamane Sangare, director of publications of the Nouvel Horizon group which owns La Voie, and La Voie journalist Kore Emmanuel, were summoned by police on December 21. Upon his return on January 2, Neruda presented himself to authorities.   His charge stems from the December 18 La Voie article which suggested that Your Excellency brought bad luck to the Ivorian soccer team ASEC by attending the December 16 African Champions Cup final, which the favored ASEC lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates. On December 28, publisher Sangare and reporter Emmanuel were each sentenced to two years in prison for "offending the chief of state," and fined three million CFA (US$6,000). La Voie was also banned for three months.    As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ believes Freedom Neruda and his colleagues have been unjustifiably imprisoned, due solely to exercising their right to free expression. This right is guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, all to which, we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Cote d'Ivoire is a signatory.    CPJ strongly urges Your Excellency to immediately and unconditionally release Neruda. Moreover, we call for the reversal of the convictions of Sangare and Emmanuel, and their immediate release from prison. In light of Your Excellency's recent reelection to the Presidency, CPJ trusts that you will do your utmost to cease harassment of the independent press, and to ensure that journalists in Cote d'Ivoire may work free from intimidation and harm.

Orme, Jr., Executive Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, to Nigerian Head-of-State General Sani Abacha.   The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to strongly protest the December 23 arrest of Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of the Lagos-based Tell magazine, and to condemn the recent series of attacks on the independent weekly magazine.   Igiebor, recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in 1993, was arrested by six members of the State Security Service (SSS) at his home in Lagos. He was then transported to SSS Headquarters in Shangisha. Authorities continue to hold Igiebor in solitary confinement without charge, and are demanding that he reveal his sources for articles criticizing the military government. During interrogations, Igiebor has repeatedly stated that he receives no financial support outsiders or Nigerian citizens, and that any information he receives arrives by mail.   On the same date of Igiebor's arrest, SSS agents confiscated 20,000 copies of Tell magazine's Christmas Day edition. The week before, on December 16, 1995, 55,000 copies of Tell were seized from Academy Press, the magazine's printing house. Earlier this week, on January 1, Nigerian security agents unsuccessfully attempted to seize this week's issue of Tell, and subsequently resorted to seizing the publication from Lagos vendors.   Igiebor's arrest followed the December 23 raid of the home of Tell's managing editor, Onome Osifo-Whiskey, and the December 15 detention by Lagos police of Adedisi Dejo, Emmanuel Piper, Yeni Oldwolabi and Iyi Isaac, also reporters of Tell.   CPJ has also documented the December 15 arson of The Guardian; the December 16 siege of AM News; the December 19 police assault and detention of four photojournalists, Peter Obe, Segun Olakitan of Tell, Abiodun Ajala of This Day, and Bayo Ewuoso of AM News; and the December 20 arrest of Lagos vendor Olabisi Akintoye for possession of "unpatriotic magazines."   In addition, we note with alarm the New Year's eve bombing of the office of the Independent Communications Network-publishers of the The News, Tempo, and Tempofootball-which destroyed millions of naira worth of property, but thankfully caused no fatalities.   CPJ welcomes news of the release of Fred Eno, senior aide to Chief Moshood Abiola; Wariebe Agamene, president of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Senior Workers Union; Amos Idalemo, also a union official; and Sylvester Odion Akhaine of the Campaign for Democracy.   However, CPJ strongly urges you to immediately and unconditionally release Nosa Igiebor and to launch an independent investigation of the aforementioned attacks on the independent press.

Funding for aid, peacekeeping and other U.S. international obligations is sure to come under renewed attack in the second year of the 104th Congress. Many congressional advocates for African issues, Republican and Democratic, are scheduled to retire at the end of the 1996 session, notably Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Paul Simon (D-Ill.). And it is very unlikely that international issues, much less Africa, will figure prominently in the 1996 election campaigns.   In general, therefore--short of a catastrophe on the scale of the Rwandan genocide in 1994 or Somalia's disintegration in 1992-1993--it will not be easy to attract high-level attention to African issues, even when they do not involve significant funding commitments. The one African issue that seems likely to stay in the spotlight is the campaign for sanctions to promote democracy in Nigeria--if, that is, the late-1995 momentum of grassroots involvement and media coverage is maintained.   Nevertheless, the prospects are good for maintaining some level of constructive U.S. involvement in strengthening ongoing ties with South Africa. Washington will also likely play a role in selected peacekeeping operations such as Angola and Liberia, in promoting debt relief for African countries, and in a number of aid initiatives. The extent of active U.S. support for pro-democracy and human rights efforts in Nigeria and other countries, going beyond business-as-usual diplomacy, will depend above all on the level of public pressure and press attention.      Economies Grow, But So Does Debt Burden      Economic growth rates for Africa in 1995 and 1996 were projected to be in the 3% range, considerably higher than the 1.5% average of the early 1990s. But this still falls short of the rate necessary to keep pace with population growth, much less provide a basis for sustainable growth. Reductions in flows of external assistance, together with a still-mounting debt burden, pose additional obstacles. However, rising capital flows into South Africa and expectations of increased growth there and in several other countries somewhat offset these general trends.   A late 1995 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development highlighted prospects for foreign investment in Africa, which it termed potentially the most profitable world region. But long-term economic difficulties and new burdens imposed by economic austerity programs mean most of the continent's people face a grim year of renewed hardships.   Proposals for further action on debt reduction, including the more than $35 billion Africa owes to international financial institutions, will be under consideration in 1996. Congress may also try to shape an agenda for improving Africa's trade prospects. But both initiatives will have to overcome apathy as well as substantive opposition to new proposals.   The prospects for economic advance also depend fundamentally on resolving and averting violent conflicts and on building and strengthening democratic institutions. In terms of security, the most intractable and devastating conflict in 1996, as in 1995, is likely to be the war in southern Sudan. But implementation of peace settlements in Angola and Liberia was still problematic as the year began, and escalation of mass violence in Rwanda, Burundi or both was an ever-present danger. The struggle for democracy against the military regime in Nigeria is likely to be the most prominent African issue in 1996. Meanwhile, human rights activists and pro-democracy groups also face serious repression in a number of other countries.      Countries and Issues      Following are brief highlights of specific areas and issues on which U.S. involvement may make a difference this year.      Conflict (Sudan and other countries): War continues in southern Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are caught in conflict between the brutally repressive Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has gained military ground in recent months. The international community is engaged in relief efforts, but efforts at mediation have stalled. Regime opponents in the north as well as the south have called for increased international pressure against the Khartoum regime.   While on a smaller scale than in Sudan, ongoing or sporadic violent conflict or insecurity characterizes a number of other countries, including Algeria, Sierra Leone, Zaire, Somalia, the Tuareg area in northern Niger, and KwaZulu/Natal province in South Africa.      Peace agreements (Angola and Liberia): Observers are hopeful that implementation of the peace agreements in these two countries will move ahead in 1996, but further delays are almost certain and renewed conflict a constant threat. In Angola, the demobilization of Unita troops called for under the November 1994 accords has barely begun, and government forces are highly suspicious that the delay will be used to rebuild Unita military capacity. And in Liberia it is still doubtful whether the resources and political will are sufficient for the agreed disarmament of combatants.      Prevention of wider conflict (Rwanda and Burundi): The situation in these two countries continues tense and potentially explosive. Some 1.8 million Rwandan refugees remain outside Rwanda, mainly in Zaire, where officials of the former Rwandan government responsible for the 1994 genocide still hold sway over their army and most civilians. Delays in prosecutions for the genocide, and threats that the refugees might return or be returned home forcibly, are among factors making a new escalation of violence possible. In Burundi, ethnic violence will likely continue--and possibly escalate-- despite international mediators' efforts to maintain a delicate coalition between the predominantly Tutsi military and an elected multiethnic government.      Democratization (Nigeria and other countries): The campaign for democracy in Nigeria gained new international prominence in late 1995 after the Nigerian military regime executed enviromental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of his colleagues. Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth, and support for oil and other sanctions came from a wide range of groups around the world. Bills were introduced in the U.S. Congress which fell short of oil sanctions, but did include bans on new investment and a freeze on personal assets of top Nigerian officials. Governments were slow to move on more substantive measures, which were vigorously opposed by oil companies. The sanctions campaign will likely continue to grow in 1996, but it remains to be seen whether it can overcome excuses for inaction by governments.   Meanwhile, in many other countries, notably Zaire and Kenya, the pro-democracy momentum of the early 1990s has been difficult to maintain in the face of both repression and other ploys by incumbent regimes. In some countries that have recently held elections (for example, Ethiopia, Cote d'Ivoire), serious questions have been raised about the fairness of those polls. International donors, including the United States, have shown far more consistency in pressing for free-market economic policies than they have in demanding respect for human rights and political participation by diverse social groups.      South Africa and the continent: In 1996 South Africa is likely to confront increasing disagreements among labor, business and different political forces over how to craft social and economic policies that address the legacy of apartheid inequality. The Truth Commission, headed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, will begin its controversial work of investigating human rights abuses in the apartheid era. Conflict between the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party may escalate in KwaZulu-Natal, particularly around the local government elections now scheduled for May.   Meanwhile, South Africa will be forced to deal with the challenge of identifying appropriate roles for itself on wider African issues, such as Nigeria. In doing so it must avoid the twin dangers of narrow isolationism and condescending paternalism toward other African states. Like the U.S. outside the continent, South Africa neither can nor should attempt to resolve every crisis. Its stance on key issues, regardless, will be closely watched by African countries and outside powers alike.

In a statement read by its President, Sir John Weston (United Kingdom), the Council encouraged all States to take measures necessary to prevent such persons from travelling abroad and receiving any kind of support. It shared the deep concern of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the situation in the country and called on all concerned in Burundi to exercise maximum restraint and to refrain from all acts of violence.   The Council reiterated that all those who committed or authorized the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law were individually responsible and should be held accountable. It stressed the importance of the International Commission of Inquiry. The Council also reiterated its profound concern about radio stations which incited hatred and acts of genocide and encouraged Member States and others to cooperate in their identification and dismantling.   Expressing grave concern at recent attacks on international humanitarian personnel, the Council said such actions had led to the suspension of essential assistance to refugees and displaced persons and the temporary withdrawal of personnel. It underlined that the Government of Burundi was responsible for the security of international personnel, refugees and displaced persons there and called on it to provide security for food convoys and the humanitarian workers.   The Council welcomed the Secretary-General's decision to ask the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata to discuss with Burundi officials, steps which might be taken to defuse the situation and said it would consider his proposal for a deployment of guards in light of Mrs. Ogata's mission and reports reaching him from the field. It asked him to consider what role UN personnel in the region and other support personnel might play in Burundi.   Stressing the importance of continued attention by the international community as a whole to the situation, the Council encouraged Member States to intensify contacts and visits. It reaffirmed its support for the Convention of Government of 10 September 1994 -- the institutional framework for national reconciliation -- and again called on all parties, military forces and elements of civil society to fully respect and implement it.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996UgandaChurch Leaders Issue Warnings On General ElectionsAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)   Kampala - Leaders of Uganda's Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches have warned against intrigue, bribery and violence during this East African country's first election in over a decade early this year.   "If any evil people come to you with evil money, dismiss them like how Jesus did with Satan," the Archbishop of the Anglican Church of Uganda Livingstone Mpalanyi Nkoyoyo said in a stern warning against bribery.   The concern by the church leaders comes as both opposition candidates and those royal to the ruling Uganda National Resistance Movement liven up to Presidential and parliamentary elections expected to begin in March.   In his New Year address the Head of Uganda's Catholics, Cardinal Emmanuel Wamala noted with concern "the serious disagreement" on Uganda's new constitution which he says may lead some people to go to "the bush."   "Even (President) Museveni does not agree with some parts of the constitution like myself ... we should bury our differences and build a united Uganda," Cardinal Wamala said.   The Ugandan Constitution which was promulgated last November entrenches and extends Museveni's nine-year old no-party system for another five years.   Ousted Ugandan President Dr. Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress (UPC) and the opposition Democratic Party (DP) which have formed an Alliance under DP. leader Paul Semogerere say a constitution which imposes severe restrictions on political parties virtually banning them during the elections is "mockery of democracy".   "It is like two men competing in a 100-metre race. One of them starts 50 metres away a head of the other," Paul Semogerere told APS in a recent interview.   President Museveni however dismissed the Opposition which have received sympathy from Western donors particularly the United States as "Foreign Parrots".   "Although the basic underlined principles of democracy are Universal, the forms which democracies take must vary from one country to the other  ... parroting forms from elsewhere is a disservice to the development of democracy in our society," Museveni said in his New Year address to Ugandans.   Meanwhile President Yoweri Museveni has commended the people of Nyabubushozi county, Mbarara district, 270 kilometers south west of Kampala for embracing the "gospel of development". He was speaking at the area church where he attended the New Year's thanksgiving service.   He urged the church to get actively involved in programmes geared to motivate the people to work and improve household incomes in the social, political and economic sectors in the country.   The service was delivered by George Birungi who also reported on steps being taken by the church to encourage income generating activities.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996EgyptMuslim Militants Kill ChristiansAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)   Cairo - Armed Muslim militants killed two Coptic Christian agricultural workers and dumped their bodies on a nearby railway track where they were crushed by a train in southern Egypt, police said here on January 4.   Fundamentalists from the same group, the Jamaa Islamiyya, killed a third person and wounded five in an attack the same day in the same region of southern Egypt, a hotbed of extremists battling to overthrow the government of President Hosni Mubarak.   The attacks took place in Minya province near the town of Mallawi, 300 kilometres south of the capital, Cairo.   In the first attack at the village of Al-Idara, militants shot dead Jamil Saad Said and Issa Yussef Georgi, whose crushed bodies were found on railway tracks by villagers.   Police said the militants had killed the two farm workers because they suspected them of passing information to the security services about extremists hiding in nearby sugar cane fields   In the second attack, a municipal guard was killed and three of his colleagues as well as two civilians were injured when Jamaa Islamiyya activists opened fire on them in the village of Gelba near Mallawi.   On December 29, Islamic militants shot and critically wounded a doctor for raping a Muslim girl in a revenge attack on his clinic which left a Christian male nurse dead, police said.   A group of gunmen broke into Dr. Boutros Maxwell Boutros's clinic in Fikriya village, Minya province, and sprayed the clinic with bullets, critically injuring Boutros and killing Christian nurse Makram Subhi Said, 45, before escaping, police said.   Police said Boutros had previously received threats from armed extremists after he raped a 17-year-old Muslim girl from nearby Gemaliyya village, the hometown of a local militant leader, Farid Salim Kerdani.   The girl's family had agreed not to seek revenge against Boutros in exchange for a monetary sum, a common practice in southern Egypt, where violent clan feuds are frequent and "crimes of honour" are often solved far from the courts. But armed Muslim fundamentalists from the town had vowed to avenge the girl's rape, police said.   A day earlier, Muslim militants had also killed a tractor driver as he cleared sugar cane from a field in southern Egypt for police hunting fugitive extremists, police said.   Police had ordered a group of tractor drivers on January 4 to clear away parts of the cane field near Mahras village outside Mallawi town, after receiving reports that militants were hiding there.   Two extremists opened fire on the tractor drivers as they worked, killing Shahata Abdel Aziz Mohammed, 30. Police said officers returned fire but the two gunmen escaped.   Militants frequently use the high-growing sugar cane fields in southern Egypt as cover for ambushes and hideouts.   The latest deaths bring to 938 the number of people who have been killed since March 1992, when Muslim militants began a violent campaign to bring down Mubarak's government.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996MauritaniaNew Government Installed After Premier's SackingAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)   Nouakchott - Mauritanian President Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya dismissed Prime Minister Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubakar on January 2 and immediately named Shaikh Alavia Oulod Mohamed Khouna to replace him, officials announced in the capital Nouakchott.   The new premier has been Minister for Fishing and Economy since February last year.   A former Finance Minister, Boubacar had headed the government for four years and no reason was given for his sacking, although an informed source said his departure would pave way for "a more politically solid team" to prepare for elections.   Mauritania's opposition has been calling for the dissolution of parliament since the first multiparty elections in 1992, which it boycotted.   Among other demands, they want a new electoral code, an independent judiciary and an impartial administration.   And on January 3, Kouna announced his new government line-up, drafting in four new ministers and dismissing three others, a move political observers said suggested a continuation of Boubakar's liberal economic policies, which began four years ago.   With the exception of the Rural Development and Environment portfolio, given to Sow Demba, all of the key ministries -- Interior, Defence and Foreign Affairs -- did not change.   The new premier was replaced in his previous post as Minister for Fisheries and Maritime Economy by Baba Ould Sidi.   Entering the government for the first time were Kamara Ali Gueladio (Public Health and Social Affairs), Boidiel Ould Houmeid (Commerce, Handicrafts and Tourism) and Seniya mint Sidi Haiba (Secretary of State for Women's Affairs).   The three sacked ministers were Sgnoire Ould M'Barack (Public Health and Social Affairs Minister), Timera Boubou (Rural Development and Environment) and Mariem mint Ahmed Aiche (Women's Affairs).   The shakeup comes just two days before a national convention of the ruling Democratic and Socialist Republican Party (PRDS), which will be centred on key decisions related to upcoming legislative and presidential elections.   Reliable sources here said late December that general elections planned for February and March 1997 could be brought forward to the fourth quarter of 1996, but there was no official confirmation of the report.   Local newspapers said parliamentarians of the governing party had been told of the possibility by Boubakar at a meeting.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BurundiDespair Growing As Country Slides Into AnarchyAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)   Bujumbura - Fear has gripped Burundi as the country continues to slide into anarchy that threatens to lead to the eruption of the endemic ethnic bloodbath that has continued unabated in the two former Belgian colonies of Rwanda and Burundi.   Burundian politicians have expressed despair as they see their small central African nation sliding into anarchy, while gunmen call the shots at the risk of sparking ethnic bloodletting as savage as Rwanda's 1994 genocidal war.   "If we are not vigilant enough, our country runs the risk of total collapse," warned President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in his 1996 New Year message.   "The new year must be a year in which all these phenomena are swept away and defeated.   The institutions, the numerous state services and organisations have the capacity to agree to work together to overcome these phenomena of fear, violence and uncertainty which threaten our people's future."   He added: "I personally promise to do everything to root out of the state apparatus all those who are obstructing the state from operating normally and those who may try to sabotage it from within. The security forces and the administration must understand that they have no other raison d'etre than the protection of the interests of our people, whose primary interest is the right to life. In this struggle, the people must not be regarded as an object which can be manipulated to achieve whatever goals you want to attain, but as a partner, indeed the cardinal one," said the Burundian Head of State.   The government radio echoed that warning on January 4 with the report of yet another massacre, which left seven people dead and 20 wounded in an attack in a southwestern town by men, some in uniform --wielding assault rifles and machetes.   "The ideology of exclusion and genocide" is gaining ground and the economy is being destroyed, warned Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo in his own New Year message.   In New York, United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali resuscitated a proposal he made in 1994 for a UN standby force to be deployed in neighbouring Zaire, and for guards to protect relief agency workers in Burundi.   He warned of "a real danger of the situation in Burundi degenerating to the point where it might explode into ethnic violence on a massive scale.   But analysts say members of the UN Security Council are unlikely to heed his call, made public on January 2 and the idea of UN troops here is fiercely opposed by the commanders of Burundi's own armed forces.   That raises the prospect of an unhindered civil war on the scale of that in neighbouring Rwanda, where Hutu extremists killed more than half a million men, women and children in 1994 before being defeated by an army of rebel Tutsi. UN troops there failed to halt the genocide.   Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, UN special rapporteur for human rights in Burundi lashed out last December at the international community, saying the passivity of the rest of the world was largely responsible for the fostering civil war.   Most of the clashes here between Hutus, who make up 85 per cent of the population of 5.5 million, and Tutsis, who comprise 14 per cent but dominate the armed forces, go unreported. Diplomats and relief workers put the death toll at around 30 a day -- 10,000 to 15,000 last year, according to the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF - Doctors without Borders.)   Thousands of Hutus have fled to Zaire, and even Rwandan Tutsis who had lived in Bujumbura since they were children have fled the capital.   Eleven relief workers have been killed since August 1994, and a number of agencies, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the French-based International Action Against Famine, have recently suspended their operations or pulled out most of their expatriate staff.   The Organisation of African Unity has discussed the probability of a UN-backed African force to keep the peace in Burundi, but the idea has been opposed by a number of influential countries in the region, such as Kenya, and appears to have made little progress.   The government is a fragile coalition under Ntibantunganya, a 39-year- old Hutu, and Nduwayo, a Tutsi. But the armed forces answer to no one but their commanders, and politics are increasingly dominated by extremists on both sides, observers say.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996MalawiState Appeals Former President's AcquittalAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)    Blantyre - The Malawian government has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the acquittal of former president Hastings Kamuzu Banda and five others on murder charges, a verdict that was seen here as the most controversial since the country attained independence from British colonial rule more than 30 years ago.   Prosecutions Director Kamudoni Nyasulu, who led the prosecution against Banda over the deaths of four politicians, said January 4 he was appealing on points of law, pointing out that the High Court judge's summing up in the trial exceeded the proper bounds of judicial comment and made it difficult for the jury to convict the accused.   "The judge misdirected the jury. All he was doing is to present my case and find faults in it," Nyasulu said of the acquittal on December 23.   The judge had told the seven-member jury that much of the prosecution's case during the five-month trial was speculative and circumstantial.   Banda -- who ruled Malawi for 30 years before being ousted in elections in 1994 -- had been charged with conspiracy to murder along with his close aide John Tembo, constant companion Cecilia Kadzamira and three former police officers -- MacDonald Kalomba, Leston Kikaomba and MacWilliam Lunguzi.   But in his ruling, Judge Mackson Mkandawire found Banda, Tembo, Kadzamira, Kalomba and Leston not guilty of murder and also ruled that Kadzamira and Lunguzi were not guilty of conspiracy to obstruct the course of justice.   The jury's decision, which took just two hours to reach despite five months of trial, and the final verdict split the country along political lines, with supporters of Banda's opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) celebrating while many Malawians who have long been convinced of Banda's guilt were wondering how the jury arrived at its verdict.   Justice Minister Collins Chizumila said after the verdict: "I haven't changed my mind that they are guilty. I don't know what went wrong. It's either incompetence or bribery. I've also heard the judge misdirected the jury."   The judge had told the jury that most of the prosecution evidence was circumstantial and speculative. But the courtroom, packed with supporters of Banda's MCP, erupted with scenes of joy when the jury announced its verdicts and Tembo and the other accused leapt to their feet and gave the thumbs up sign, carrying shoulder high the senior British defence lawyer Clive Stanbrook.   Banda, who once threatened to feed his opponents to the crocodiles during 30 years of untrammelled power in the tiny southern African nation, was tried in absentia because of ill-health and senility, and was at his house in Blantyre under Kadzamira's care.   Tembo, believed to have been the power behind Banda as the former dictator became increasingly frail in recent years, told the crowd outside the courtroom that the verdict was "a reflection of the independence of the judiciary."   The charges stemmed from the deaths in 1983 of cabinet ministers Dick Matenje, Aaron Gadama, John Sangala and parliamentarian David Chiwanga.   It was officially announced at the time that they had died in a car accident, but an inquiry after Banda's ouster found that they had been battered to death, placed in a car and pushed over a cliff.   The prosecution said the men had been murdered because they had become outspoken in their opposition to the misuse of government funds and were suspected of harbouring ambitions for power.   A commission of inquiry after Banda's ouster had, however also established that they had in fact been murdered.   The families of the four murdered Malawian politicians have also vowed that they would continue pressing for justice despite the acquittal of Banda.   "We will continue to seek damages and find out who ordered the killings even if it means dying myself to find the truth," said a spokeswoman for the families, Mary Gadama, daughter of Aaron Gadama, one of the four politicians murdered in 1983. Mary leads a group of relatives fighting for compensation and for the murderers to be brought to justice.   "How do you free murderers like that? It means in Malawi anyone can kill a person and get away with it. Somebody must be guilty of ordering the murders," she asked after the verdict was announced.   Banda took power in impoverished Malawi after independence from Britain in 1964 and soon established a vice-like grip on the country, introducing a one-party state and ruling the country as a personal kingdom.   He was accused of widespread human rights abuses while remaining an ally of Western nations for his staunch anti-communist stance during the Cold War, receiving visiting British royalty in a red Rolls Royce convertible and entertaining them to lavish banquets in his Sanjika Palace outside Blantyre.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996GambiaJunta Leader Announces Elections For JuneAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)   Banjul - Gambian junta leader Captain Yahya Jameh has announced that presidential and general elections will be held next June to restore normal constitutional democracy in this West African country.   In his New Year's message broadcast on the night of December 31, Jameh said that the voting will be preceded by local council polls in May and that the Commonwealth would back Gambia in the electoral process.   The three elections will be supervised by an independent commission recently set up by the military regime, which plans to return to barracks after 23 months in power, Jameh said.   The military ousted civilian president Sr. Dawda Jawara in a coup in July 1994, prompting international donors, led by former colonial power Britain, to condemn the coup and suspend financial assistance.   Jameh presented an optimistic account of the achievements of his regime, speaking of progress in education, transport, energy production and television.   He said that tourists were flocking back after the "disaster of 1994". This year, Gambia expects to host some 70,000 tourists, as in 1992 and 1993.   The Head of State also declared that Nigerian and Cuban doctors would take over from Chinese medical workers, who withdrew their cooperation after Gambia recognised Taiwan in July last year. Beijing considers Taiwan to be part of China.   The presidential announcement came only three days after Captain Sana Babally, former vice-president of the tiny West African state of Gambia was jailed for nine years by a court martial here, after being accused of having plotted against President Jameh.   Sabally was said to have headed two attempted coups -- the first in November 1994 and the second in January 1995.   Jameh, who is chairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council, seized power in a bloodless coup on July 22, 1994 after toppling Dawda Jawara, who is in exile in Britain.   Sabally, the vice-chairman of the Council, was accused of having participated in the January 1995 plot involving a Captain Sadibu Hydara, former Interior Minister who has since died in prison.   Meanwhile, the military government is claiming more than US dollars 11 million from Jawara for alleged fraud in an oil deal.   In a statement published here on January 3, Jameh's government said it accepted the findings of a commission of inquiry into the deal set up in October 1994 under a Nigerian judge.   The inquiry dealt with financial transactions linked to the supply of 17.3 million barrels of oil supplied by Nigeria as aid to Gambia between 1984 and 1988.   Jawara, former Planning Minister Momodou Manneh, and a businessman of Lebanese origin, Jamil Said Mohamed, are accused of conspiring to resell the oil and pocket the proceeds.   The oil should have brought in US dollars 42 million to Gambia's treasury, but only 2.6 million was actually paid in, a reliable source said.   The statement said the government was demanding that Saidi Mohamed, a Sierra Leonean national, pay more than US dollars48 million to Nigerian national oil company.   Former Sierra Leonean vice-president Abdulai Conteh, who was said to have facilitated the deal, was arrested last October and expelled from Gambia, where he had lived for several years.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996KenyaPresident Bans Scout Family Life ManualAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)   Nairobi - President Daniel arap Moi has banned a family life education manual compiled by the Scout/Girl Guide Movement in Africa.   Announcing the ban on "Scouting Manual on Family Life Education in Africa", President Moi said on New Year's eve that the book contained foreign ideas and emphasised that not all things that have come to Africa are necessarily good for the continent.   Moi directed that the sales of the manual compiled as a collaborative effort with the Margaret Sanger Centre of Planned Parenthood in New York, USA, be stopped immediately.   The move is seen as placatory to the the Catholic Church in Kenya which particularly over the last two years, has campaigned consistently against the intended introduction in schools of secular sex/family education lessons which the Church claims would disrupt the moral fabric of the nation.   The Scouting Manual on "Family Life Education for Africa" has been available in Kenya over the last eight years, but it came into prominence last August when the head of the Catholic Church in Kenya, Maurice Cardinal Otunga, who is also the Archbishop of Nairobi, and the Imam of Jamia Mosque in Nairobi, Sheikh Ali Shee, jointly set alight a pile of sex education books, condoms and other birth control- related items in a public ceremony in the city's Uhuru Park.   But the African regional director of the Scouts movement Mr. Kieraithe Nyagah told APS he was apprehensive the negative publicity associated with the manual would cast the Scout/Girl Guide Movement in bad light.   Mr. Nyagah underscored that the manual had been produced "with all the best intention in the world."   "As scouts we have a duty to ensure that young people have a chance and access to materials that enable them to develop into wholesome citizens," he said.   Some critics have charged that some of the illustrations in the manual were too explicit and indecent. Nyagah says these were intended to show the changes in a young person's body.   While conceding that input came from all over the world, he emphasised that the bulk of the manual had been produced with local African expertise.   Nyagah observed that no other country in Africa including the regional ocean nations, had banned the book.   He observed, however, that like any other textbook that had been in use for sometime the manual was subject to review from time to time. "Where it has hurt the sensitivities of any community or religious affiliations, we are prepared to modify it accordingly," emphasised the Africa regional boss of the Scout's movement.   Meanwhile, the presidential directive to ban the manual has received widespread support among Catholic clergy and bishops. Praising President Moi for his decision, Cardinal Otunga promised that the Catholic Church in Kenya would re-dedicate itself to strengthening the family fabric.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeFinances Threaten Africa's Environmental ProgrammesAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)by Kafui Ameh   Nairobi - African countries have been urged to intensify efforts aimed at achieving sustainable development through adoption and implementation of sound environmental policies. But as it came out clearly at the Sixth Session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, last December, financial constraints are the root cause of the continent's environmental dilemma.    Although the programme of action on the environment which gave birth to the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) was launched in Cairo, Egypt in December 1985, no deliberate programme was set up to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the continental organisation in 1995.   At the Sixth Session of AMCEN held in the Kenyan capital from December 11 to 15, 1995, proceedings were dominated by discussions about the survival of the organisation and the source of resources to run it rather than achievements made in the last one decade.   The tone was set at the opening of the Expert Group Meeting which preceded the ministerial meeting when the representative and Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Africa Regional Office Mrs. Maria da Graca de Amorim called on African countries to focus properly on the situation confronting the continent.   Mrs Amorim conceded that the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment had scored a number of inspiring successes such as the development and adoption of the African Common Perspectives on Biological Diversity and the significant inputs made by AMCEN to the process leading to the Regional Annex and resolution on urgent action for Africa with respect to desertification control.   She however pointed out that the successful implementation of AMCEN programmes was being stifled by lack of financial resources and called for a discussion of modalities for fund mobilisation from member countries, bilateral and multilateral agencies.   "There is an urgent need for AMCEN to streamline its programmes to be focussed more on sensitising African governments on sustainable development issues especially with regard to ratification and implementation of international conventions, and to back up these programmes with financial support," de Amorim said.   She also called on the meeting to address the issue of formalising AMCEN by statutes as an intergovernmental body whose decision can be tabled at summit meetings of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the establishment of appropriate institutional arrangements and linkages to make the conference secretariat more effective. Currently there is an amorphous secretariat comprising the UNEP, OAU and Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) personnel.   "Do we want AMCEN to function independently or to remain an organisation that is permanently asking for charity?" That question posed later by the Senegalese Minister for Environment and Conservation of Natural Resources, Prof. Abdoulaye Battily reflected the mood of the ministerial meeting as participants considered the report of the group experts.   Delegates expressed great concern about the unsatisfactory response by member countries to financial contributions towards trust fund agreed upon at the Fourth Session of AMCEN in 1991. Only Egypt and Seychelles had contributed US dollars 679,700 and 500 respectively towards the fund.   The initial idea of the trust fund was that contributions would accrue over a five-year period (1992-96) after which interest yield would be used for the operational activities of AMCEN.   After lengthy debate on whether to make contributions to the Trust Fund mandatory or voluntary, the African ministers decided that an urgent appeal be sent to member states to contribute to the fund while examining the possibility of adopting new measures of raising additional resources in order to facilitate the implementation of AMCEN programmes.   The meeting also noted with concern the declining funding to the UNEP Environment Fund and urged all member states to honour their pledges to the fund.   Perhaps the most significant decision was one to formalise the institutionalization of AMCEN as an intergovernmental organisation, providing the legislative framework including a constitution and related rules and regulations which will certainly cover financial contributions.   The meeting also decided to continue with the 1994-95 programme of work into the biennium 1996-97 with some additional priorities. These would include sustainable industrial production, consumption and industrial development including aspects relating to the framework convention on change, environmentally sound management of all types of wastes including hazardous and potentially hazardous and toxic chemicals; as well as strengthening the African common perspective and position on the Convention of Biological Diversity through sensitization and awareness creation.   Other priority areas identified included the rational management of African forests through the establishment of mechanisms for sub- regional cooperation and support to the implementation of the Convention to Combat Desertification and Drought.   On the implications of major international events, the meeting agreed that AMCEN should fully participate in activities relating to environmental impacts within the framework of the UN agenda for peace and development and related programmes of action.   The major international events highlighted by the Group of Experts meeting included the World UN Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen last year, the 1995 World Summit for Women held in Beijing, China and the World Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II) scheduled for Istanbul, Turkey in June 1996.   The AMCEN meeting also agreed that full support should be given to the assessment of environmental impacts of conflict and the resultant suffering by refugees and displaced persons as well as host nations.   The session outlined five main areas of orientation that would form the focus of activities in the next two years. These comprise the sensitization and organisation of workshops, seminars and conventions within the available financial resources; support for the drawing up of national environmental plans of action and national Agenda 21 plans; the integration of the environmental impact assessment in development projects; capacity building, environmental education and public awareness; and the strengthening of sub-regional cooperation in environmental management.   As the UN Under-Secretary General and Executive Director of UNEP, Miss Elizabeth Dowdeswell said during the opening of the ministerial meeting, AMCEN has a major role to play in reversing the continent's decline by judiciously using its vast resources, traditional solidarity and cooperation and international support.   "The time has come for African countries to take their future into their own hands and not to allow their economies to be micro-managed by the international donor community. It is also incumbent on the donor community to listen more to Africa and seek partnerships as between equals, she said.   While commending AMCEN for its contribution towards Africa's gradual transition to sustainable development in collaboration with the OAU and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and other relevant regional and sub-regional institutions, Dowdeswell urged the Environment Ministers to press their governments to fulfil their financial obligations to the AMCEN Trust Fund to enable the organisation implement its laudable programmes.   In his intervention, Prof. Battily had decried the presentation of lengthy speeches and rhetoric which did not address the real issues. "Where do African countries expect to get Samaritans to cover the financial aspect of the fight against environmental degradation?" he asked.   Among the speakers who came up with some novel ideas was Samuel Nyambi, the Director of the New York-based UN office to combat desertification. Nyambi, a Cameroonian, suggested that AMCEN be renamed the African Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development (AMCED) to catch up with the spirit of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.   Others also proposed that the conference be named the African Ministerial Conference on Sustainable Development (AMCOSD). Still, Nyambi argued that whatever name is finally retained, there was need for greater participation in the 1997 evaluation of the implementation of the Rio Conference Agenda 21 on sustainable development. "We need to prepare adequately for that session as we did before the 1992 Earth Summit because the issues are so crucial to Africa," he noted.   In spite of the last minute shift of venue from Harare, Zimbabwe, to the Kenyan capital, the 20-plus Environment Ministers, more than 100 government representatives and experts from 45 African countries, as well as about 25 international organisations who attended the Sixth Session of AMCEN, had enough food for thought.   "We believe there should be greater inter-African consultation to ensure that we in Africa understand ourselves better and speak with a common voice at global fora on the environment," noted Dr. Farouk Brimah, Ghana's Deputy Minister for Environment, Science and Technology.   Organisations represented included among others, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), International Labour Organisation (ILO) the World Bank, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Southern African Development Corporation (SADC), and the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO).   The Seventh Session of AMCEN will take place in Senegal in January 1997.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeBlack And Beautiful But Skin Bleaching PersistsAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)by Sam Gonza   Nairobi - From time immemorial the enhancement of beauty has been a major preoccupation of the womenfolk. Not surprisingly, the beauty industry is among the ten largest industries in the world today. Unfortunately many products used in the pursuit of mostly "better" physical appearance have serious medical repercussions. This is true of skin bleaching creams, lotions, and soaps. In the Gambia, military ruler Captain Yahya Jameh has clamped down on skin lightening preparations, citing the medical dangers posed to the women in this West African country.   On New Year's Eve, Gambian military ruler Captain Yahya Jameh decreed a complete ban on skin bleaching creams, lotions and soaps used as cosmetics by women in the Gambia. Captain Jameh said he had instituted the measure "for the good of the Gambian woman".   But observers say the practice of bleaching the skin to obtain a lighter complexion is so widespread in Africa, banned items will simply be smuggled into the country. This is what has been happening in Nigeria for over 10 years now since skin bleaching products were officially banned in the mid-eighties.   In spite of the documentation of the dangers over the last 20 years, millions of women continue to bleach their skins to obtain a lighter skin. The best approach to the problem would thus include education, an option already adopted by the Medical Women's Association of Nigeria (Lagos Zone).   Among the main reasons cited by African women for lightening the skin, thus bleaching out the natural dark pigmentation that provides protection against the harsh rays of the sun - range from "men like fair complexioned women", "it is fashionable" to "purify the skin".   Over the last ten years, the Medical Women's Association of Nigeria has intensified its campaign efforts to make Nigerian women understand that the process of lightening the skin is very hazardous indeed. The association has produced a pamphlet, Bleaching the Skin - What Every Woman Should Know, in which Dr. Osinuppebi-Cole observes that paradoxically while black people were bleaching their skin to look more beautiful, whites were seeking to acquire a turn by exposing themselves foolishly to the sun. "So while the blacks are seeking to become white, the whites are seeking to become dark, both exchanging good skin for cancerous skins", she says.   In the 70s, skin bleaching creams containing as much as 7 per cent hydroquinone level - one of the main bleaching agents, were freely available in Africa. At the same time in America and Europe, creams containing one to two per cent level of hydroquinone were banned.   Dr. Osinupebi-Cole laments that there was keen competition among manufacturers of skin bleaching agents and women demanded ever stronger chemicals. "The most serious damage to our women was done during this period," she argues.   Today these soaps, creams and lotions originate in Asia, Europe, America and within Africa itself. One Irish woman Member of Parliament describes the trade in skin bleaching chemicals as "a scandal".   Dr. Yetunde-Olumide says the habit of bleaching the skin "started in racially morbid countries like the United States and apartheid era South Africa.   Hydroquinone and mercury in soaps are the main bleaching agents. Because mercury is absorbed through the skin it eventually leads to the development of various complications, notably kidney related.   Officially, mercury products were banned in Nigeria in the mid- eighties but the same continue to flow into the country under such names as "Drula bleaching wax", "Skinguard", "Tura", "Concorde", "Roberts", "Neko", "Sukkisa", "Bango", "Jeribu" and many more.   Dr. Yetunde-Olumide says the hydroquinone compound not only causes damage to the superficial skin cells, but has serious effects on the underlying connective tissues beneath.   "Hydroquinone causes an acid called "homogentisic" acid to be deposited in skin tissue, eventually damaging the elastic properties of the skin as well as the ability of the skin to recover from injuries like cuts or surgery.   Accordingly, long-term bleachers have serious complications when they go for surgery or even when they have minor cuts. "Wounds from even minor cuts become very difficult to heal. For the surgeon, it is a nightmare trying to stitch back the skin of chronic bleachers", says Olumide.   Moreover, by removing the natural pigmentation of the skin through bleaching, the African woman is also exposed more intensively to dangerous rays of the sun. She becomes more prone to cancer of the skin.   Dr. Olumide says at present there is no known cure for damage inflicted by skin bleaching. Having damaged their skin, some desperate women ask for a skin graft and feel terribly dejected when told that grafted skin cannot "take" because the entire associated structure had been damaged irretrievably.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeClergy Offers Solace To Pregnant TeenagersAll Africa Press ServiceJanuary 12, 1996 (19960112)by Dingaan Mpondah   Nairobi - Shunned and blamed by their families for being persons of loose morals, pregnant unmarried women in Zimbabwe can now find solace in a church-based local centre that nurtures both mother and child and offers a stepping stone for a future with a purpose.   Mwana Anokosha (local Shona language for "precious child") Home is the only centre of its kind in Zimbabwe and possibly Southern Africa. It offers temporary sanctuary to unmarried women, mostly teenagers with unwanted pregnancies who have been rejected by their boyfriends and families.   Situated in Westwood, on the outskirts of the capital, Harare, "Mwana Anokosha" was set up in 1988 by the Shelter Trust, which is made up of a group of clergymen. It now has a full-time social worker who counsels and "rehabilitates" the destitute young women.   When the women first come to the home, the social worker explained, most of them are so lonely, desperate and down-hearted that some have suicidal tendencies. A lot of time and effort is put into helping them overcome these feelings.   In response to public criticism, many of the women wrote a joint letter to Harare's Herald newspaper last year and spoke frankly about their experiences. "We have been kept in an atmosphere of trust and confidence where we may await the birth of our children in peaceful surroundings. After the delivery of our babies, when we have grown to love them, we are able to be reunited with our families.   "We are very upset to discover that some people feel we are young people of loose morals. This is not true, and can be confirmed by the people who know us. Most of us really believed in the proposals of love; we did not even think of using contraceptives ...," they wrote.   The number of illegitimate or one-parent children in Zimbabwe is high. Despite the difficulty in obtaining official statistics on this sensitive issue, it is believed that roughly one in every four teenage pregnancies is illegitimate. Several young women have been convicted and imprisoned for baby dumping over the years.   More than 1000 women have been offered temporary shelter at the Mwana Anokosha Home until such time that they were reunited with their families. However, besides offering refuge to these rejected pregnant women, Shelter Trust has now opened up a skills training centre called Mufandichimuka Training Centre in Harare, designed to offer a new lease of life to these women, most of whom could not support themselves and their babies when they left home.   The co-ordinator of Shelter Trust, Sister Theresa Mangieri, said the centre has been named "Mufandichimuka" meaning the home of the resurrected.   "When the girls come to us, they are always so desperate and without hope. But the moment they get skills they will then be able to live a new life. They are being resurrected hence the name Mufandichimuka," she said.   The majority of the women who end up at Mwana Anokosha Home are those who dropped out of school before sitting for a public examination, either Grade Seven, Form One or 'O' Level and have no formal skills at all.   Out of the more than 280 who visited Shelter Trust offices in 1995, 56 per cent dropped out of school before sitting for a public exam while eight per cent were illiterate. Those who had work experience had either worked as domestics or vendors. Only seven per cent had either done dressmaking, knitting, till operating or First Aid. There was one university graduate.   Sister Theresa told APS the number of under-age girls (13 to 17 years) becoming pregnant was also on the increase. The majority of the abandoned women came from intact families, only 4 per cent came from single-parent families.   "In practice, Shelter Trust has been approached by women, some of whom might have tried backstreet abortions and failed. With support and counsel, these women have developed a strong bonding with their children after delivery. Unjust social conditions and priorities of the parents and boyfriends encourage them to choose an option they are not comfortable with. The psychological damage of abortion for a woman cannot be measured. Women who have contemplated abortion, but have not acted, have a sense of well-being and joy after delivery," she said.   The majority of the men inolved with these women were single did not want any responsibilities. Casual sex was reported to be on the increase as the use of contraceptives, according to the women, was almost non-existent, despite concerted campaigns by the Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council.   "In line with the needs of the marginalised single mothers we are going to start a day skills training. The centre is expected to be officially opened in January 1996 but a pilot project involving 100 former clients was carried out from September 1995. We have sent out 500 newsletters to former clients telling them about the centre and whether they will be interested and the response has been overwhelming. So far 100 clients have said they would want to enrol.   "Firstly we are going to offer a course in home economics, housekeeping, knitting, sewing and cooking - and later we will introduce practical courses. We are starting off with the areas that are necessary to them now. We will later introduce such courses as hair braiding so that they can earn some income," she explained.   Apart from offering courses, the centre would, from time to time, invite public speakers on various topics including the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and maintenance to educate the mothers.   "In general, the women in our residential outreach programmes are in need of means of a livelihood after they give birth and are discharged. Their common cry is for employment. Our hope is that when the skills are acquired, the women will be able to earn a living either on their own or through employment," noted Sr. Theresa.   Researchers indicate that male reluctance to accept responsibility for pregnancy, coupled with limited psychological and financial support from the family are all seen as the crucial determinants in baby- dumping, infanticide and child abandonment. And, according to the World Bank, the chances of women dying from pregnancy-related causes are highest in Africa among all developing regions of the world.   This is largely due to the high population growth rate - now the world's highest at around 3.2 per cent a year - which is taking a severe toll on the health of the mothers.   As a result, some 150,000 maternal deaths are recorded each year in Africa as a whole, a figure representing 30 per cent of all maternal deaths world-wide.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Arts and Culture Mother Of All Jazz Festivals Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by Itumeleng oa Mahabane     Johanneburg - Not quite Montreux in July or April in Paris, Cape Town in February nonetheless promises a feast for lovers of jazz. Next month, Cape Town will play host to the largest jazz festival ever held in South Africa.    The line-up includes some impressive artists: trumpeter Maynard Ferguson, Brazilian-born vocalist Tania Maria, guitarist Earl Klugh, and Don Grusin. The festival also brings back to South Africa singer Randy Crawford, while lovers of the big-band sound will be given the opportunity to hear the most famous of the biggies -- the Count Basie Orchestra.    After last year's debacle, when two Americans promoting a jazz festival in the mother city did a duck shortly before it was due to open, South Africans might well feel cynical. The prevailing air of scepticism has also meant that little has been written about the upcoming festival. But organisers Esther Miller and Gerry Spencer (who, it should be pointed out, had nothing to do with the earlier ill-fated event) have been working towards this for three years and insist that no one will be taken for a ride.    The two, both local jazz musicians, say intensive planning has gone into the festival, and that their approach differs significantly from that of last year's organisers. Firstly, Miller and Spencer say, no names were announced until artists' attendance had been confirmed. Secondly, sponsors were secured well in advance. The financial and logistical support of a major airline and financial institution has been secured, with American Express in charge of bookings and accommodation, and KLM acting as official carrier for the festival.    Spencer and Miller hope the festival will bring in hard foreign currency in the form of tourism. The sponsors are putting together special tour packages, while Captour has promoted the event in overseas exhibitions. Apart from a lot of inquiries, there are no firm bookings by foreign tourists as yet.    Certainly, the festival will give Cape jazz a much-needed shot in the arm (a dose is also needed by Johannesburg) The festival will make use of a range of large venues, including the Good Hope Centre, the Nico complex, and the Waterfront Amphitheatre and Theatre; throughout the week, smaller gigs will also take place at various jazz clubs.    Jazz students will benefit from workshops and clinics -- two a day, throughout the week - -- some of which will be conducted by Klugh, who is a musical educator. The creation of a scholarship for young South African musicians to study overseas is also in the offing. There will be collaborations between local artists and visitors, and Miller herself will perform with the Jack Van Poll Trio.    Miller and Spencer say they tried to cater for classical as well as mainstream jazz-lovers by inviting Wynton Marsalis to play with the Cape Town Symphony Orchestra (CTSO). Unsuccessful negotiations over a fee and bad timing for the CTSO put paid to that. But South Africans may yet hear the flawless if sometimes passionless trumpet of Marsalis -- the organisers say they will try to bring him out either next year or the year after.    Hopefully the festival will be a success, because Capetonians can look forward to this becoming an annual event. Miller and Spencer have secured the sponsors' support for the next five years, and are negotiating to have the festival concerts televised.    The Cape Town jazz festival runs from February 26 to March 3. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Arts and Culture Of Patrons And Peers Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by Carol Brown     Johannesburg - Gerard Bhengu, forgotten KwaZulu-Natal artist, is now the subject of a retrospective.    One of my childhood memories is of attending an art exhibition at the Payne Bros store in Durban. The exhibitor was Tretchikoff -- the controversial, popular and very rich artist who held his road shows at the elegant art- deco store which housed a gallery. It was interesting, therefore, to learn that Gerard Bhengu was also one of the store's proteges. When one of Bhengu's other patrons, Phyllis Savory, considered producing a book on the artist's work, she stated that she wished it to be "on the same lines as the Tretchikoff book that Mr Timmins produced a few years earlier". The book on Bhengu did appear, but, unlike his contemporary, Bhengu became neither a household name nor a millionaire.    While comparisons between the two artists are spurious, it is worth noting that both were popular and promoted by the same gallery, which operated with a commercial bias. However, the art market during the Fifties and Sixties was not geared towards the payment of high prices for works by black artists. Bhengu's first patron, Dr Max Kohler, encouraged him to sign his name as "Bhenger" in the hope that its Germanic sound would be more acceptable to a white art-buying public.    The retrospective exhibition at the Tatham Gallery has been curated to bring these facts to the fore. Works are classified in sections to highlight patronage rather than style or subject matter -- an approach raising questions of influence, personal agendas and economic pressures. This curatorial method, while relatively unusual in a South African context, demonstrates a serious art-historical approach to the subject.    Bhengu was born in 1910 in the mission settlement of Centecow, attached to the Marianhill mission, in southern Natal. It was here that he encountered Kohler, who was an amateur ethnologist and commissioned Bhengu to produce illustrations for his ethnological texts. The discipline and accuracy necessary for this type of illustration suited Bhengu's talents and he produced detailed and meticulous images. These were contentious among his peers: attitudes towards ethnicity, nationhood and tribal identity were highly controversial, particularly following the Native Administration Bill of 1927, which made tribal chiefs the leaders of all black South Africans, and exerted control leading to the bantustans and apartheid.    But it was through his portrayal of ethnic types that Bhengu's art achieved its popularity, especially among the tourists who frequented the Payne Bros gallery. Seeing a number of his sepia portraits together makes it obvious that he perfected a slick technique which allowed mass production, although this doesn't detract from his ability as a draughtsman.    As well as portraiture he depicted the rural countryside of his youth, but his view differed from the early white artists such as Thomas Baines, Jacob Hendrik Pierneef and Clement Senque, who showed the land as majestically devoid of humanity and waiting for the white settler. Bhengu's landscapes were peopled, showing the black person inhabiting and working the land. As discussed in the catalogue by Leeb du Toit and Zaver Dinos, these images could be seen to express ideas of rightful ownership and perpetuation.    According to contemporary accounts, his freest and most creative work was that which no longer exists except through photographs, sketches and verbal descriptions. These were murals commissioned by the herbalist EG Tembe in 1959, and a mural for the Wesleyan Methodist Institute in Durban in 1942. They were both created for black audiences and the latter was said to be the earliest example of black protest art in South Africa. Both these murals have been destroyed, but written accounts seem to confirm that the fact of a different audience affected his work strongly.    Bhengu died, poverty stricken and unheralded, at the age of 80. This exhibition highlights his talent and the manner in which economic and educational pressures of his time influenced his art. It forms an important addition to South African art history, but unfortunately will only be viewed in KwaZulu- Natal. It deserves a wider audience.    The retrospective runs at the Tatham Gallery in Pietermaritzburg until January 7, and at Durban Art Gallery from January 28 to February 26. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Business and FinanceNot Nailed By Success Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by Vuyo Mvoko      Johannesburg - A levelling of the playing fields is necessary for black businesses to succeed, argues Dr Nthato Motlana.   Chairman of New Africa Investments Limited (Nail), Dr Nthato Motlana is not out of the running for industrial finance company Johnnic. He told the Mail & Guardian recently that he is planning to raise R6-billion for a stake in Johnnic, one of the three companies into which mining house Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI) has been unbundled.    Johnnic controls Times Media Limited and the South African Breweries among others. Motlana says R3-billion of the capital will come from Nail and its subsidiaries, one of which, Metropolitan -- which controls Methold -- has over R8-billion in net assets.    Motlana does not hide his political leanings which, over the past couple of weeks, saw him being accused of meddling with the editorial freedom of The Sowetan newspaper.    It was alleged that Motlana had been under pressure from the African National Congress to force Sowetan staff to "toe the ANC line".    While he admits to having been approached by President Nelson Mandela who raised problems with some of the Sowetan's articles, the man who says he was once seen as "the Trojan horse who acquired the paper on behalf of the ANC", denies any interference.    How do his ventures benefit the black community? Irate, he replies: "Whenever anybody goes into business, he goes for himself. Anyone who pretends to the contrary is a liar or a fool. Write that down, and go and tell them!"    He pauses, then bursts into laughter, apparently regretful at his cantankerous outburst. Then slowly, he continues: "Anyone who does not sleep, preparing and going from meeting to meeting, is doing it for himself. What happens to other people is as a result of your own personal empowerment."    Indeed, Motlana opposed a move by Anglo American to transfer 20 percent of The Sowetan shares to a black community trust with beneficiaries such as the Educational Opportunities Council, the Get Ahead Foundation and a host of homes for the mentally handicapped, arguing that black "entrepreneurs", like their white counterparts, should have the opportunity of real ownership.    Motlana denies purchasing the impoverished weekly New Nation, now a sister publication of the Sowetan, because of ANC pressure.    The losing gamble was owing to the role the paper played in the transformation of the country, he says, but if it does not recover in the next six months, "we'll forget it".    'You know," he says with a smile, "I've paid my dues to my community and my country. I cannot understand why they don't pick on (Real Africa Group chairman) Don Ncube, Thebe Investments, or the Kunene Brothers. Is it obscene to make money?    "There are others who make money but they don't go ask them what they do for the community, they do that only to Motlana. They must go to hell, man!    "I'm sick and tired of Sam Shilowa and Zwelinzima Vavi. Sick! Sick! Sick! When they get stuck in the middle of a speech they insert Motlana, whoaaa! Whether they do not have the intelligence to think further than Motlana, I can't understand."    Motlana had been foretold, he claims, by people like international businessman Tony O'Reilly, that he would be hated for his business acumen.    "Sometimes I get mad when people think I started being involved in business because the ANC was unbanned and Nelson Mandela got out of prison."    "My first company was called Phaphama Afrika Commercial Enterprises, formed in the 60s, when it was almost impossible to do so. You had to kick shins and push hard, there were no loans for black people and no premises in town.    "I'm chairman of Lesedi Clinic, the first black-owned private clinic in this country. I'm the founder chairman of the 80 000-member Sizwe Medical Aid Fund. We built the Takalani home for the mentally handicapped in Soweto.    "When people ask me, how do you benefit your community? I say look back at my record: I've been involved in politics since age 18; detained as secretary of the ANC Youth League; on the dock with Mandela in the 'Sisulu and 19 others' trial of 1952; once was chairman of 18 community organisations; formed the Get Ahead Foundation; went around the world and collected money to create a fund that helped people like Sakkie Macozoma get a Masters degree in Communication."    "Even before Black Like Me, we started Africare, the first black hair products manufacturing company. We did not succeed because banks would not give us money, our guys did not have MBAs, and we had no marketing."    Nail's hopes to raise the capital needed to purchase a stake at Johnnic were once dashed by capital constraints, he says. "I hope people will not say the Motlana group is being favoured. We have that critical mass.    If we don't do it, somebody else will".    Motlana says Nail was interested in buying a portion of Telkom, but was barred by Telkom's insistence that foreign companies must come, not in partnerships with local black companies in the name of black economic empowerment, but on their own.    He laments this, arguing no black company can provide "international connectivity, foreign capital, better management and new technology."    With regard to the pyramid control of businesses in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, he says it "has been the standard structure in South Africa. Look at Murray and Roberts, Sancorp, Sanlam, Anglo American. Then when a young black company like Nail goes to the stock exchange, they say No."    Talk of flattening the pyramids, he says, is not fair to the emerging black business, "there should first be a levelling of playing fields."    On Nail's plans for 1996: "We want to consolidate. We'd like to focus on telecommunications, obtain a TV licence, increase our stake in newspapers, and I won't tell you the rest."    "What people should be asking is, how did you get where you are. We can share ideas, form groups together and move forward." -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South Africa Cricket: Breathing New Life Into An Old Game Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by Jon Swift      Johannesburg - Paul Adams has brought unbridled enthusiasm and joy to a team which already has grit and courage    It is well as we move into a new year to savour some of the tragedies and failures of the 12 months just past. For the cricketers contesting the current series, the breaking of a savage countrywide drought has been an unwanted hindrance. For the squatters of Maritzburg it has meant total devastation and, in well over 100 cases, loss of life.    But on both admittedly widely different counts, one cannot but rejoice in the resilience of the human condition. The surviving squatters are hastily rebuilding their shattered lives and a nation mourns for them as they fight their way out of the morass of a catastrophic natural disaster.    And surely, no South African -- no matter how insensitive -- can see the lack of playing days the heavens have allowed against the touring English under Mike Atherton against any other backdrop.    Yes, the cricket is important and as lifegiving in its own way as the waters which have, in their overabundance after almost a decade of arid refusal, abruptly taken the lives of so many.    And yes, it is important to all of us in this emergent admix of peoples and tongues, cultures and conditioning, that the nation have success to show in the face of such adversities.    For as the flood-ravaged communities on the banks of the Umsunduzi tackle their devastated lives anew, cricket has been given a like chance to present a renewal of spirit to graft onto the courage and fortitude which has marked the ethos of this country's teams since our readmittance in 1992.    It has not been an easy series to quantify and certainly not an easy one for the players of both sides to contest. The disappointment of the rained-out first and third tests at Centurion Park and Kingsmead have been one factor.    The refusal of Atherton and his English batesman to bow to the raw pace of the South Africans has been another. Certainly, Atherton's unbeaten 185-run, 10-hour 44-minute stay at the crease to deny a result at the Wanderers in an innings of true cricketing integrity is not an individual effort which will be lightly discounted.    Neither can you lightly dismiss the maiden century by the gritty Gary Kirsten at the Wanderers or his two half-centuries which earned him the Man of the Match award in the drawn fourth Test at St George's Park last week.    But it was in the disappointment of Port Elizabeth with yet another Test without a result in a series which had rapidly been running out of steam that the essence of rebirth came to light. And fitting that St George's Park, the venue for the first international this country ever played when they took the field against CA Smith's English invaders back in 1889, should have provided it.    For two things made this meeting between South Africa and England different from any international played before. The first was a chubby-faced youngster from the humble environs of Grassy Park on the Cape Flats with the strangled action of a capsized terrapin.    The second was a muscular politician with thick spectacles, a voice like broken glass and a former postal address on an isolated island not far off the coast from the mountain which looms large over Newlands where the two teams are currently engaged in the series decider.    Paul Adams became the youngest player to wear cricket's green and gold at 18 years and 340 days. It was only his sixth first-class match, an honour he rightly earned and, many would argue, two tests overdue.    Coach Bob Woolmer summed it up in one succinct phrase: "He looked like he's played Test cricket for 15 years," he said. Indeed.    Adams took a modest four wickets on a flat and unresponsive pitch in his debut, but in this performance, there was the roots of a renaissance in the game. Adams plays the game with the unbridled enthusiasm and inner joy which its originators in the Vale of Hambledon surely intended for the world's most glorious game.    In this alone, Adams has something to give back to the team which the exposure to the professional pragmatism of the English and the cynical sledging of the Aussies have taken from it.    It would be both premature and unpardonable to heap all the responsibility for ensuring this new spirit follows through on his young shoulders, but the sight of captain Hansie Cronje's smile when Adams dismissed Graham Thorpe to register what we must believe will be the first of many Test victims was evidence enough that the young man has a special magic about him.    And, just for a moment review the new life Adams injected into the St George's Park brass ensemble. The music even had Jonty Rhodes turning Mapantsula in the field. If this is the new voice of South African cricket, long may that voice roar.    Which brings us to the second man in the equation, Minister of Sport Steve Tshwete. Tshwete has never been shy of tacking his flag to the mast. He cried openly at South Africa's early cricketing successes and, though an avowed rugby man, has been one of the great advocates of the game under the new dispensation.    Tshwete forsook the padded seats of the official enclave, shed his jacket and took to the stands to join the extended membership band, wave the flag and add his voice to the on-going celebration that was the very heart of this dull draw.    One shudders to think of the discord Tshwete's vocal cords engendered in his immediate surroundings. But in Tshwete doing what he did, there was the very embodiment of what Krish Mackerdhuj and Ali Bacher had claimed as administrators and Kepler Wessels, Cronje and the teams they have led have attempted so ardently and so well to put into practice as players.    It is well that Newlands -- incidentally the venue of this country's second Test against Smith's tourists before the turn of the century -- has become so vital in the equation of the current England tour.    No cricket lover would begrudge the fact that a ground which retains its beauty and majesty despite the ravages development has wrought, should be the place to settle matters once and for all.    It is home to Adams, Kirsten and Brian McMillan -- perhaps the only player alongside Donald who can claim true world class among the South Africans during this series -- although the young spin bowler can only claim a fleeting relationship.    The crux of the issue though is not that Kirsten and McMillan have got centuries. Or that Atherton and Graeme Hick -- a superb 141 at Centurion Park -- have managed their top scores in Test cricket.    Neither does it hinge on wicketkeeper Jack Russell's world record 11 dismissals behind the stumps to some wayward South African batting and his stubborn refusal to leave the crease after Meyrick Pringle had given him an early life in the same match. Or even that Shaun Pollock is developing into both a frighteningly dangerous new ball exponent and a polished lower middle order bat.    It all really hangs on a contrast of attitude.    England have always seemed to be playing not to lose.    The naggingly negative line adopted by Dominic Cork -- far and away the best of the England bowlers on tour -- and Richard Illingworth in the second innings at St George's is as much evidence of this as the way the tourists have packed their batting line-up and consistently refused to employ the erratic power and pace of Devon Malcolm.    Cronje and his side have played to win. That they have not yet managed this is proof of Woolmer's contention that they are not a collection of individual stars, but rather a cohesive, tough and sometimes uncompromising collective.    In this, perhaps Cronje and his men embody on the sportsfield, the refusal to lie down in adversity which has been shown by the sad spectre of the squatters on the banks of the Duzi.    For these are as much the people our current crop -- Hansie Cronje, Gary Kirsten, Andrew Hudson, Daryll Cullian, Jonty Rhodes, Brian McMillan, Dave Richardson, Shaun Pollock, Craig Matthews, Allan Donald, Jacques Kallis, Nicky Boje and Paul Adams -- are playing for as the 100 000-plus who bought tickets for Newlands before a ball was bowled.    And who all the future wearers of the national flag -- above whatever emblem the officials come up with next -- must strive to represent.    The advent of Adams has shown what is attainable. And that cricket in this country can truly be for all, politician or pleb. There is new life in the old game yet. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeSoccer: All The Nations For The Cup Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by Lungile Madywabe      Johannesburg - A host of Africa's top stars will converge on South Africa next week for the African Nations Cup finals    When Kenya's sports minister Hussein Maalinm Mohamed said that his country was withdrawing from hosting the African Nations Cup, because of a lack of funds, the Confederation of African Football (Caf) did not hesitate to appoint South Africa in their place.    If South Africa succeeds in its handling of the tournament, it may well be the recipe for hosting the 2006 World Cup. Caf president Issa Hayatou has already given his full backing to South Africa's bid to host the world's biggest soccer bonanza.    But for now the 20th African Nations Cup showdown starts next Saturday at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg, with South Africa against Cameroon, the two-time winners of this tournament and 1990 World Cup quarter- finalists against England. Cameroon won the tournament in 1984 and 1988.    South Africa will be hoping to increase to seven the number of countries to have won the tournament as hosts.    The Black Stars of Ghana, four-time winners, first won the championship in 1963 when it was held in Accra. They also hosted and won it in 1978. Together with Egypt they share the privilege of being the only countries that have defended the title.    The Black Stars will be looking to Leeds striker Tony Yeboah and captain Abedi Pele Ayew. They come to the tournament having last claimed it in 1982 when it was hosted by Libya.    Hoping to equal the winning ways of Ghana are the three-time winners the Pharoahs of Egypt who hosted the cup in 1959 and 1986, and made sure on both occasions that it stayed there. Egypt also won it on its inception in 1957 in Sudan.    Algeria won the cup in 1990, failed in Senegal in 1992, before a total nightmare in Tunisia 94 when they were banned for using an ineligible player.    Two other teams from Southern Africa have made it to the finals despite the politcal upheavals that have been taking place in their countries. Angola deserve all the support they can get from their fans. In the words of South African coach Clive Barker they "must surely be ranked the darkest horses of the tournament".    Mozambique will give a few of their opponents a run for their money, taking into account their recent performance against South Africa who beat them 3-2 after the visitors had taken the lead twice.    South Africa is once again surrounded by controversy with the chairman of the technical committee of the South African Football Association, Jomo Sono, who also serves as an adviser to Barker, not being informed of the final selection of the squad. The surprise exclusion of Brendon Augustine of Umtata Bucks was also a surprise to many. The insistence on including Lucas Radebe of Leeds United despite doubts about his fitness has also raised eyebrows. The Leeds coach has reservations about Radebe's ability to keep pace with the demands of the tournament.    Tunisia, who have been hosts twice and have never won the cup, will be hoping to put all the traumas of 1994 behind them. They are in the same group as Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, both of whom are favourites to finish first and second in the group forcing Tunisia to pack their bags early.    Gabon was the first team to pack their bags in Tunisia and the gods must surely have turned their backs on them. They are in the same group as the reigning champions Nigeria..    Protests over the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other activists in Nigeria have made their team's participation in the tournament doubtful. Nigeria is to make a decision on Friday whether they are coming or not and, if they decline, then Guinea will be the replacements    Most of the Ivory Coast players come from the Asec Mimosa club and one wonders how their coach Pierre Pleimelding will be able to mentally refocus some of the players whose guts and determination were tested to the full when they recently lost to Orlando Pirates in the Champions Cup.    The stars of the tournament may well be Liberia, inspired by the European and African footballer of the year George Weah. They nearly withdrew from the tournament because of finance, and Weah had to dig dip into his pocket to make sure that Liberia make the best of their first appearance at the finals.    After many of the team members had been killed in a plane crash in Gabon in 1993, Zambia nearly won the cup in Tunisia when they were beaten 2-1 by Nigeria in the finals. Having come so close to winning the cup in 1994, this may well be their chance to lift it.    Burkina Faso come to the finals as the only team with an unbeaten record in the qualifying matches and are the first team from Africa to have qualified for the World Cup in 1974 in Germany. They have eight foreign-based players in their team. They will be counting on Seydou Traore who plays for FC Bressuirein in France and Abdoulaye Kassoum Ouerdraogo who is based in Germany with FSV Franfurt.      Zaire has won the cup twice, in 1968 and 1974. They were booted out in the quarter- final stage by eventual winners Nigeria in 1994. In the qualifying stages they beat Morocco at home, before going on to draw with Ivory Coast. Among some of their foreign-based players are Ngole Kona of Genderbirligi in Turkey and Mbote Ndinga of Vitoria Guimaraes.     Sierra Leone will be coming to the finals for the second time. They also nearly withdrew from the tournament for financial reasons. Kewullay Conteh of Atalanta in Italy and Lamine Conteh of SV Meppen in Germany will lead their team. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeBoxing: Take Me To Atlanta Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by Julian Drew      Johannesburg - From humble beginnings in Venda, Ntsudzuluseni Ndou is heading for the Olympics in Atlanta.    In Venda Ntsudzuluseni means "take me to another place", and for Ntsudzuluseni Ndou boxing has done just that. The 18-year-old from Thoyandou is Atlanta-bound in July as a member of South Africa's Olympic team after winning the silver medal in the featherweight division at the All Africa Games in Harare last September.    Ndou is better known by his English name of Philip, which is easier on the tongue for most people. The tall matriculant is lean and mean and uses his long reach to stay out of trouble. He is confident about his prospects in Atlanta. "I think I will do well at the Olympics because I know there is nobody in Africa who is better than me," says Ndou.    A strange statement you might think for someone who was beaten to the gold medal at the All Africa Games, but for anyone who saw his final against Egypt's Saleh Abdelbary it is not surprising at all. To say he was cheated of victory is something of an understatement. "It was the worst decision I've seen in 45 years of amateur boxing," says national team manager Dan Bushney.    Ndou completely dominated the fight but when it came to adding the points from the scoring machines of the five judges it was clear that some of the North African judges were less than impartial in their observations. "It wasn't a hard fight for me. My hardest fight came in the semi-final against the Mauritian who was a very tough opponent. I found the final very easy in comparison but the judges robbed me. They said I was the loser but everyone else who saw the fight said I was the winner. The guys from Egypt and Tunisia just didn't want South Africa to win," says Ndou.    Such controversial decisions have long been part and parcel of amateur boxing. But internationally the situation has improved now with a wider spread of judges and fewer ideological divisions around the globe.    The new scoring system introduced at the Barcelona Olympics has also made it difficult to rig results. Now, for a scoring blow to count, three out of the five judges must hit the button on their scoring machines within one second. In Africa though there is a dominance of officials from North African countries and they are accused of helping each others' boxers at the expense of other countries.    According to Bushney, the only way to change this is to get more judges from the rest of Africa onto the African Boxing Confederation's panel which is an issue that South Africa intends addressing in the near future.    It was Ndou's victory over Josian Lebon of Mauritius in the semi-final which impressed observers though. The short, stocky Mauritian was a strong and experienced fighter but Ndou fought intelligently to turn the tables on him. Ndou used body blows and moved quickly to tire him and kept him at arm's length so he couldn't land too many telling blows. "It was a difficult fight because we both knew each other's styles after sparring together at our training camp in Kroonstad before the All Africa Games. But Bodo (national team coach Bodo Andreass) had watched him closely in Kroonstad and he altered my style a little to confuse him and I just fought to my strengths," says Ndou.    Ndou only got into the national team last year after winning the South African title as a 16- year-old in 1993 and retaining it in 1994. He puts much of his recent improvement down to the arrival of Andreass at the end of 1994. Andreass is a former East German amateur boxer who spent four years coaching the Nigerian national team which won two silver medals at the Barcelona Olympics.    He came to South Africa at the request of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa (Nocsa) which seconded him to the South African National Amateur Boxing Organisation (Sanabo) under its Operation Excellence programme. "He is a very experienced coach and he knows a lot about boxing. He has really taught me a lot and that is why I did well in Harare. I think Nocsa should keep him on after Atlanta because our results have really started to improve under him," says Ndou.    The lessons he has learnt from Andreass are also starting to pay off at the Makwarela Boxing Club in Thoyandou where he coaches the other boxers in a makeshift club house in one of the classrooms at his school. "I have improved so much with Bodo and everything he has taught me I also teach my boxers here in Venda. I show them how to train properly and now we have two juniors and six seniors who are the best in Venda. This year they will go to the South African championships and I know they are going to do well," says Ndou.    For now though Ndou's eyes are focused far beyond the national championships and on the Olympic Games which are now just over six months away. "It is a great honour to fight for your country at the Olympics and it is important not to let your country down. I must go to Atlanta and work hard to show people what it means to be a South African champion and make people respect this country," says Ndou.    If Ntsudzuluseni Ndou can do anything like as well as he did in Harare in the much more demanding Olympic arena he won't have to worry about being taken to another place. He will be made for life and have his name etched indelibly in the annals of local sporting legend. -0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-Large[DOCUMENT] Luba Art Exhibit OpensMuseum for African Art (New York)January 05, 1996 (19960105)   New York - MEMORY: Luba Art and the Making of History is the first American exhibition to present the art and cultureof the Luba of Zaire and the first ever to explore how Luba works of art function in the reconstruction of memory and history.   While Luba Sculpture is among the most beautiful of African arts, it also reveals astounding philosophical complexity.  The Luba, one of the most important kingdoms of central Africa (southeastern Zaire) from the 17th through 19th centuries, highly value the recounting of royal history, and encode its complexity on an array of stunning art objects created precisely to stimulate and guide memory.   MEMORY presents over 100 of these unique objects which enable the Luba to remember and re-interpret their collective past. Memory boards, beaded emblems, ornamented royal scepters and axes, thrones, divination instruments' wooden figures and body arts each have a particular visual, tactile and spatial vocabulary. It is this incised, symbolic coding system that helps the Luba remember the esoteric information, pivotal events, royal personages and political relationships that make up their collective history and individual identity.   The Museum for African art is located at 593 Broadway (between Houston and Prince). General Admission is $4; $2 for children, students and senior citizens. Museum hours are Tuesday through Friday 10:30-5:30 pm, Saturday and Sunday, 12-6 pm.

The tour , which traces the sights and sounds of Darrell James Roodt's new film starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris, was introduced to coincide with the film's release in the United States. "CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY", Miramax Films Release/Distant Horizon Film, is based on Alan Paton's book of the same title   Ken Hieber, CEO of 2AFRIKA, stated that "the remake of 'CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY' presented an unusual opportunity to design a tour that showcases both the culture and historical themes of South Africa as well as the incredible scenic beauty of the country. For 2AFRIKA, this is a natural extension of our best selling Madiba Tour, which has an historical focus as it follows in the extraordinary path of President Nelson Mandela."   The "CRY,The Beloved Country" itinerary begins in Johannesburg, taking you to locations depicted in the movie, such as Soweto, the city that replaced Sophietown, where much of the action in the movie takes place. Also included is a visit to Pretoria, the country's political capital. Then it is on to Pietermaritzburg, the capital of the province of Kwazulu Natal, including a drive through the rolling Natal Midlands to IXOPO and CARISBROOKE with some of the most beautiful scenery in the film. A Tour highlight is sure to be a hillside picnic lunch at the site of one of the most poignant scenes of the movie.   Of particular cultural interest will be an overnight in Shakaland, where visitors can experience the vivid rhythms and rituals of the Zulu people, whose culture and language figured prominently in the movie.   A three night stay in Cape Town' a city often compared in beauty to San Francisco, features a cruise around Robben Island where President Nelson Mandela was incarcerated, tours to the Cape Peninsula and the famous winelands; and of course a tour of Cape Town featuring the panoramic views from Table Mountain.   All tour participants will receive their own paperback copy of Alan Paton's book "CRY'THE BELOVED COUNTRY', and a personalized commemorative "CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY' Tour Certificate.   2AFRIKA is a New York based tour operator with headquarters in Pretoria, and associated offices in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, South Africa.

The United States of America is at the top of the list of Sudan's enemies, closely followed by Israel, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda and Egypt. Claiming that the SPLA had neither the means nor the technical know-how to carry out such an offensive, Khartoum has constructed an incredible conspiracy theory involving all of the above named states.   According to Khartoum, Eritrea supplied the SPLA with tanks and weapons which were transported from Massawa on the coast through Ethiopia and Uganda and into Southern Sudan. Egyptian Military transport planes were also used to carry weapons and equipment via Uganda. So far the regime's propaganda ministry has failed to produce any evidence to back up its bizarre theory. The regime claims to have captured tanks and other weapons with Eritrean and Ugandan markings on them, and also claims to have claims to have killed or captured Eritrean  and Ugandan officers and troops.  However, Khartooum refuses to produce this evidence for independent verification. This is not surprising because it is not beyond the regime's capacity to forge such evidence.  At some point the regime claimed that it had killed 263 Ugandan soldiers at Kit. The claim was easily ridiculed because a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) news team was at Kit with the (SPLA) forces and could testify to Khartoum's lies in a "Focus on Africa" programme the following day,   In Khartoum itself, the regime has tried to whip up a hate campaign against the few US nationals still resident there. The US embassy has countered this by issuing its own mimeographed statements and widely distributing them across the Three Towns capital. The US has denied providing any support for the SPLA or having any involvement with the opponents of the regime. The US regards Khartoum's allegations as being counter-productive to the ongoing dialogue designed to improve US-regime relations  The US has taken Khartoum's threats seriously enough to recall its ambassador from Sudan for consultation. It is believed that while the ambassador was in Washington, D.C., he suggested that a forthcoming visit to the US by SPLA leader Colonel John Garang be canceled. The ambassador argued that to receive Colonel Garang at a senior level would give credence to reports of clandestine US support for the SPLA and as such could enflame the problems in Khartoum. In the event, the SPLA leader arrived on schedule and was received at the same official level he is usually accorded. In spite of the ambassador's concerns, it would appear that the Clinton administration finally took the view that to cancel the visit would be tantamount to giving in to the regime's blackmail. That would be an inappropriate way to conduct UA foreign policy, considering the number of rogue regimes it has to deal with world-wide. Khartoum protested about the visit, but Washington ignored them.   The government of Uganda responded quite sharply to Khartoum's allegations and threats. In November, it had merely mentioned that it took Khartoum's threats to invade Uganda seriously and was on the alert to repel any such invasion. Last month, however, the Ugandans took a much stronger line and on 6 December a presidential statement demanded that Khartoum cease its support and assistance for the Lords Resistance Army (LRA) or Ugandan commandos would be dispatched into Southern Sudan to deal with the Ugandan rebel group.  "If Khartoum continues to send in these armed bandits to kill our farmers, women and children in Northern Uganda, and to plant anti-personnel mines in the countryside, we will have no choice but to send in our commandos to pursue, search and destroy the LRA bandits inside Sudan.   Unable to motivate or properly supply its ground forces in the South and the Nuba Mountains, the regime has begun to depend more heavily on aerial bombardment of civilian targets. The regime has increased the number of raids it makes each day. In late November and early December, reports claimed that the regime had begun to use chemical warfare in the Nuba Mountains. The chemicals are believed to have been supplied by the Iraqis who have used such weapons against their own internal opponents. The Iraqis have also provided planes and troops   The former Soviet republic of Belarus has sold ten planes to Khartoum. They are long range bombers and cost $150,000,000. The deal was a purely economic one rather than an ideological marriage between the two countries. As the regime is known to be strapped for cash, this deal begs the question of where the money to buy the planes actually came from. It is believed that Iran and the oil rich state of Qatar split the bill between them. The planes have already been delivered and have begun bombing raids over the South.  Belarus also supplied technicians and pilots.  Iran has recently supplied the regime with other military equipment and weapons. It is also the regime's main supplier of fuel for its military operations in the South.   The Islamic states of Indonesia and Malaysia have also supplied military equipment to the regime, having been swayed by the NIF's pleas that its Islamic system is under threat from the infidels and is therefore worthy of support   The injection of equipment and weapons has yet to have impact on the fortunes of the regime in the war. It is doubtful whether they will have any real impact because in order to utilize the regime needs to have trained personnel at the battlefront. The regimes forces are demoralized at present and those in outlying posts are suffering from a shortage of provisions. The regime's troops are ill fed, ill supplied, ill equipped and ill motivated whilst operating in the hostile environment of the South. The recent SPLA victories have only added to their problems and reduced the morale even further.   In Juba two battalions of troops have disobeyed orders to move out into the countryside by spinning out their requisition of necessary supplies for future operations. These troops were visited in December by a succession of the regime's leaders in a bid to build up their morale. Dr. Hussan Abdulla El Turabi and Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, the foreign minister, both visited Juba. In addition, first vice president General Zubeir Mohammed Salih led a number of senior military figures on a visit to the troops,   The regime's leaders are having to face up to the fact that troops on active duty in the South are less convinced by propaganda than the civilians in the North may be. These troops have experienced the reality of battle at first hand and know that the SPLA is a committed enemy fighting for a cause it believes in. They feel less enamored by their own cause and the brainwashing about angels and infidels they received before coming south.   Khartoum's forces have very good reasons for feeling demoralized. A conventional army used to regular supplies and meals is now having to make do on subsistence rations. Whereas their enemy, the SPLA is used to such hard conditions, Khartoum's forces are not.  In many outlying military posts, the regimes troops are surviving on bread and hot onion sauce served once a day.   The troops have also been immobilized by a fuel shortage and most of the transport vehicles are inactive. The troops have to carry out all their operations on foot. Ammunition is in short supply, replacement uniforms are non-existent and the conventional army now looks more like a poorly supplied guerrilla army than the SPLA does.   Reports last month have spoken of large scale desertion by the regime's forces around Juba and they are trying to make their way back to Northern Sudan by whatever means available. In November, seventy soldiers returning to Juba from a defeat at Pageri boarded a steamer bound for the North rather than report to the Army HQ. The steamer was halted down river at Bor, eighty miles north of Juga, where the soldiers were arrested and detained. The regime fears that is demoralized troops return to the North and publicize the true situation in the war, then the public will clamor for peace and recruits for the army will be even harder to find that they are already.   The regime has uncharacteristically issued a statement about the situation in both Kapoeta and Torit denying that there is any military confrontation with the SPLA around the two towns. The statement denounced the people who have been undermining the regime's war efforts. The denial was unsolicited and might shed further light on the situation if it is looked at in a more critical majjer. Why bother to deny something that has not been publicized by the enemy unless there is some truth in it? The SPLA has only reported on actual battle successes and has seen no need to make sweeping statements about the overall situation in the war. It is the regime which feels the need to do this and it is surely a sign of its own concern.    The battle fronts around Kaya, Kajokeji and Morobo have been quiet. Independent reports have revealed that the SPLA has put all three towns under siege together with the strategic town of Yei. Any SPLA victories in this sector would have positive repercussions on the situation in Western Equatoria and Bahr El Ghazal, as far as the guerrilla army is concerned.   Attempts by the regime to distract attention away from Eastern Equatoria by launching offensives in Bahr El Ghazal and against Western Equatoria have so far failed. The attempts to arrange, through bribery, bases in the Central African Republic and Zaire, in order to launch attacks on Western Equatoria, have so far proved fruitless. The local officials have noted Khartoum's generosity and have made higher demands for payment. Khartoum's financial resources are limited and each time its representatives return to Sudan for more money, they get back to the CAR and Zaire to be faced by new officials, all expecting some kind of payment. Bribery is proving to be an expensive and inefficient way of conducting the war.   The SPLA is still in control of Western Equatoria and its forces are ready for the regime's offensives from whatever direction. The most likely routes are from Wau across the Bo River, or from Rumbek, although the direct route from Juba via Rokon, Mundri and Maridi might also be targeted. There is an old hilly route from Yei to Maridi which the SPLA is also monitoring.   The schism in the SPLA in 1991 handed much of Upper Nile to the regime because the SPLA-United forces, later to be renamed the Southern Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM), chose to work with the regime against the mainstream SPLA. Commander Nyuon's forces have since April 1995 been controlling the overland route from Malakal to Bor and on to Kapoeta and Torit, by being in control of Ayot, Akobo and Watt. His forces are even siad to have reached as far North as the Zaraf Island of Panjak. In order to take advantage of this overland route in the dry season, the regime now has to fight its way for almost the entire 300 kilometers  from Malakal. Commander Nuyon's SSIM forces are reported to have reached Doleib Hill, some fifteen hundred kilometers from Malakal.   The regime's propaganda machine has released many stories in recent weeks reporting that 30,000 fresh troops have been airlifted to Juba, ready to take the battle to the SPLA.  The story made impressive reading for the Northern public but did little to threaten the SPLA in Eastern Equitoria because the truth is somewhat different.    In reality, the regime's press gangs in the North  have rounded up any male aged fourteen to twenty-one foolish enough to be seen in public. They have been dragged out of homes and schools or mearly rounded up off the streets. Instead of taking them to training camps in the North, they have been immediately airlifted to camps in Juba, from where there is little chance of escape. Forcibly enlisted into the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), they are being given rudimentary instruction on how to fire a rifle before being despatched to the battlefront. It is little wonder that the PDF's causality and mortality rates have been so high and its forces so ineffective. More than 3,000 youngsters died on the battlefield at Awingbul alone in October.   One of the unspoken tragedies of this press gang policy is that the relatives of the young men have no idea what has happened to them or where they actually are. Those lucky enough to go to a camp in the North rather than straight to the South are kept incommunicado from their parents and relatives who are not allowed to visit them. Inquisitive relatives are told that the young men have volunteered to train for the jihad. Parents of underage boys are told that they are undertaking their compulsory national military training in order to qualify them for their next stage of education.   Whilst the regime's policy is quite successful at getting the young men to the South, it is less adept at motivating them to fight, even for the jihad. Once the young men have been exposed to rotting corpses, badly wounded contemporaries and a highly motivated enemy, they become utterly demoralized.   Despite the regime's oft-quoted desire to send a one million strong militia force to the South, the SPLA continues to survive and fight back, leaving many observers to wonder why the regime even bothers to suggest it. mere numbers have proved to be insufficient in the heat of battle. Morale and motivation have proved to be far more significant  and on both counts the SPLA is leaps and bounds ahead of the regime's forces.     -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaTaxpayers' Money Being Used To Deny TruthsPost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by Lucy Sichone    Lusaka - In the past months, State House has been running continuous advertisements in the government-owned media, especially the Zambia Daily Mail to refute all "unpleasant" stories carried by The Post on the government and President Chiluba. The denials are supposedly meant to discredit The Post and project it as a newspaper on a "malicious campaign" against Chiluba and his government. In this edition, Zambia Civic Education Association chairperson Lucy Sichone (right) gives her view of the newspaper and the propaganda journalism being orchestrated by State House.   The Post was not my favourite newspaper.  Infact early in 1995 there was a period when in exercise of my right and freedom to speech, press and communication, I stopped buying The Post with one other independent newspaper which I still do not read.    I began buying and reading The Post when it came to my attention that a propaganda department in the tradition of UNIP's Ministry of National Guidance but renamed productivity department had been established at tax payers expense for the sole purpose of containing The Post Newspaper. A propaganda institution is always established as a desperate attempt to hide the truth. That is why propaganda journalism and information dissemination is a unique speciality of vicious dictatorship such as Hitler's propaganda ministry which marketed murder of the Jews in gas chambers as hot and refreshing showers for the victims.   Consequently, I considered it my duty to read The Post so that I could determine the reasons why Richard Sakala was spending scarce public money at a time when hospitals have no free medicines to give to under five children on rebutting Post stories especially if the said stories are not true and are therefore not worth the consideration of intelligent Zambians like myself.   Upon my resumption of reading The Post and upon close scrutiny of the "Kim  II Sung" adverts by the productivity department on the issues raised by The Post, it became transparently clear to me that the target of the propaganda is not the substance of The Post stories; the target is the managing director, Fred M'membe.   With all due respect to Fred, I should say that he does not posses all the awesome qualities and capacity for destruction of Zambia's integrity as a nation that are attributed to him by Richard Sakala and  Chiluba.  But I am aware that Fred possesses a huge ego that attract attacks from an individual who believes that he should be the sole source of power in an alpha/omega sense. That is why in my case Fred is not my friend, like the apostles of Jesus the two (2) of us would not agree who between us is the greatest and since I do not manage a newspaper and I have no money for productivity advertisements to enable me to settle the issue of who is the greatest between Fred and myself; it is better we are not friends or foes.   Coming back to the issue of Fred verses Fred, I was particularly intrigued by one of Sakala's advertisements which concerned a story in the International Herald Tribue which reported that the supremo of the Post Newspapers has been arraigned on so many criminal defamation suits that he may total up a record 100 years of imprisonment.    The international Herald Tribune is an "Establishment" paper whose unquestioned status in the press and media world is aristocratic.  It is the newspaper which I have observed is served with champagne in the first class cabin of British Airways as I make my measured and dignified way to the third class cabin.   I was concerned therefore that a newspaper of the Herald standard could devote space and money on a pedestrian story about the possible imprisonment of some small time editor of a small time newspaper in a third world country.   After much reflection and analysis of the issue, it dawned on me that the story was not about Fred M'membe and the possibility that he may be imprisoned for 100 years; the purpose of that international Herald story was about the current government of the Republic of Zambia and its loss of credibility, integrity, honest to an extent where the small time editor of a small time newspaper can rate a total of a 100 years imprisonment for alleging that the President's father is alive and well and was mistakenly asking for the fattened pig!!!   The international Herald could have produced massive copy about Zambia's loss of good governance by writing about KK's deportation to Malawi, corruption and drug trafficking, obtaining money by false pretences ostensibly to write a fictitious constitution to stand the test of MMD governance; that the Herald did not use any of these serious and substantive issues to demonstrate Zambia's regression to dictatorship but instead used copy on mere Fred M'membe is evidence of a satirical indictment of our governors in the mode and style of Animal Farm.   In short my dear Richard Sakala the enemy is not  M'membe but yourselves (reference Julius Caesar) The International Herald story, the non-aligned movement disgust with the intended deportation of KK, the not accepted constitution, our general loss of international credibility, voter registration apathy, the tunnels fiasco and M'membe's International Press Awards, which are irritating to all of us victims of press freedom are a consequence of government's misdeeds, dishonesty and incompetence.   Recently, I was horrified to be told by the President himself that his humiliation at the non-aligned movement conference over the deportation of KK was a set up by KK himself as it was not government's intention to consign the former President to Malawi. The reports on KK's deportation were issued through the government media by government spokesmen.  I only repeat what I have stated elsewhere that it will not be possible for this government to change without a true and honesty confession of its sins of commission  and omissions and as long as Richard Sakala and even Chiluba continues to attribute the consequences of their misdeeds to KK, M'membe, Sichone (never one to leave myself out) etc there can never be any salvation for themselves or MMD and we have KK and UNIP to prove the truism of this political fact.   The serious problem of the MMD government image as petty, vindictive and intolerant because of its incompetence will not be resolved by personal attacks on individual citizens their integrity and/or lack of it. After all news institutions such as the Herald Tribune , BBC do not use The Post  or Fred M'membe as the source of their copy. Any story which rates attention of reputable international media is based on proper research and collection of data on governance, press freedom, electoral systems and so forth. Personal attacks on individual citizens merely compound the problem and when the President becomes directly involved in the propaganda, the Presidency itself is brought into disrepute. In the circumstances, it becomes completely unacceptable, indeed it is criminal for the government to abuse tax payers money on the kind of advertisements that we have seen against The Post and M'membe when the culprits for our international disgrace are in cabinet, the police force, electoral commissioner and the public relations unit at State House.   The producer and director of productivity department propaganda should be reminded that misuse of public funds on personal issues is a criminal offence. And one of these days, sooner rather than later, there will be need to answer charges of theft by public servant involving millions of Kwacha for personal gain. The Nuremburg trials have laid down the principle that "I was only taking orders" is not an adequate defence to save the person so accused from imprisonment or capital punishment.    Those advertisements whose only achievements has been to vest Fred M'membe with abilities and capacities which even the President of the USA does not possess should come to an end. Attention should be given to addressing those issues of misgovernance that have given the government a bad name atinternational fora.   Further and at a personal level, the obssession by the productivity government and State House with Fred has given him an edge in the undeclared contest between him and myself as to who is the greatest. In the circumstances I would have no choice but to commence proceedings against the Attonery General in which I would pray for the following orders:    That the productivity department should begin immediate advertisements against me for tarnishing Zambian's Human Rights Record with my clandestine domestic relations, Sam Ngoma can be retained to do the necessary copy with his earnings paid directly to the Times of Zambia to ensure that honest journalists like Hicks Sikazwe continue to receive their salaries.    That the said productivity department should be ordered to arrange a Nightline programme and address to the nation by the President  FTJ Chiluba in which it can be stated that specially prepared sharp tooth will be used to sort out the same domestic relations which I am using to tarnish Zambia's human rights record abroad and traumatising leaders children like Prince William, Prince Harry, John Major Jnr., Castro etc.   I will need these orders in order to show Fred M'membe that he is not the greatest; that all of us ordinary citizens rate the same kind of attention from our government.I will stop here and once again find comfort in Byron "if I laugh at any mortal thing, it is that I may not weep".-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeSoccer: Nigeria Given A ChancePost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by Staff Reporters   Luaka - Nigeria has been given an ultimatum by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to reconsider pulling out of Africa's soccer tournament in South Africa or face sanctions.    The CAF gave the military government in Abuja until last evening to make it's final decision and threatened to suspend the country, which won the Africa Cup in Tunisia in 1994, from international competitions for up to six years.   The ultimatum was  communicated to the Nigerian government yesterday in Younde, Cameroun by CAF president Issa Hayatou and  that Guinea was being drafted to take the place of Nigeria if they did not respond to the ultimatum.   Nigeria announced last week that it was withdrawing from the Africa Cup of Nations on the grounds that South Africa could not gurantee the safety of the team in the tournament which starts this next week. Nigeria is favourite to win again this year.   It is believed the Nigerian government was nursing grudges against South Africa because of the attitude shown by President Nelson Mandela after nine political activists from the minority Ogoni group were executed in Nigeria on November 10 last year.   Mandela was at the forefront of a British Commonwealth campaign to isolate Nigeria after the executions. This led to a souring of relations between the two countries, both regarded as Africa's super powers. Officials in South Africa have said the tournament will go ahead with or without Nigeria. The games will be played in Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, Durban and Port Elizaberth.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeZambia Has No New Kit For Africa Cup GamesPost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by Reuben Tonga   Lusaka - Zambia has no new kit for the Africa Cup of Nations after their much publicised John Fashanu backed deal with Reebok flopped at the last minute when suppliers were reported to be on Christmas holiday. Instead Zambia has resorted to cheaply designed uniforms from Johannesburg to make up for the blow after efforts to get the London kit failed.   Fashanu's representative a Mace yesterday confirmed the absence of the uniform saying arrangements were being made to get it from South Africa.But FAZ treasurer Musa Kasonka denied that there was no kit for the teamsaying it would be picked in Bloemfontein, South Africa."It is not true to say we have no kit. Because arrangements have been madefor the kit. Instead of using the British Reebok we are going to use theSouth African one which is better kit than what we had in the lastfour-nations competitions," he said.Zambia had protested over the poor quality of the kit it had been given byReebok at the Simba four-nations tournament- yellow  and green sets.A Blue Orchid director Mace, currently in the country to finalise the kitarrangment to be used by Zambia at next week's Africa Cup of Nations,confirmed that the kit will be made in South Africa.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaHow Has Entertainment Scene Been In 1995?Post of Zambia (Lusaka)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by Goodson Machona   Lusaka - Let us continue with events of last year. Some dissatisfied musicians called for the dissolution of the Zambia Union of Musicians ( ZUM ) executive claiming it had mishandled cash and was not representing the musicians adequately.   ZUM general secretary, Webster Malama, was even accused of faking the death of the Sakala Brother so that he could obtain welfare money. However despite the brahuha, ZUM managed to open a music resource centre at the Evelyn Hone college to help musicians without instruments.   Shortly after, ZUM was given a short in the arm when it received a K4 million grant from the government. However, a planned gig to commemorate the death of the national team flopped after the organisers, Jah Entertainment, failed to secure a suitable set of musical instruments.   Lusaka-based playwright, Maurice Tembo formed a drama group called Forum For Drama ( FODA ) and lined up a series of programmes which, however, are yet to see the light of day.   This year, the Lusaka theatre club degenerated into some rough house catering for boozers. Club manager, Norris Malauzi admitted that there was a problem but attributed the lack of artistic activity to the fact that most of the time the auditorium was booked by outsiders.    And, as matters degenerated, the playhouse was gutted but members managed to raise K20 million to refurbish the joint. On a brighter note, playwright Maurice Tembo made an appearance on the British Broadcasting Corporation television programme "Great Railways Journey."   Tembo   And while Tembo was shining on BBC, a University of Zambia student, Anderson Ngulube was awarded $5,000 by an American organisation for his poetry but he was unable to go and receive the award as he could not raise money for an air ticket.   Another author, Beenwell Sinyangwe, had his book "Quills of Desire" mentioned in the coveted African Book Publishing Records ( ABPR ) while Zambian artist, Joe Muzala, was invited to the prestigious South African award exhibition which was held in South Africa sometime in June.   In August, artistes of all shades converged at the Star Market and held a two day bash to commemorate the passing of former radio dee jay, Timmy Mvula. New Generation front man, Frank Chitembwe, flew to the United Kingdom and recorded a self titled solo album featuring some Samba, fusion of Zambian rock and gospel.   About the same time too, emergent singer James Ngoma recorded a debut album entitled "Chamanyazi" which performed relatively well on the local market.      Amayenge   The Amayenge had to cut short their American tour after they encountered problems. According to band spokesman, Brian Chilala, their promoter made off with their earnings while the band leader Chris Chali had to return home to attend his wife's funeral.   Raggamufin don, Daddy Zemus, sold the rights to his "Salaula" LP to a newly formed promotion outfit Digital Network International but the move was condemned by most local musicians. For the first time, local musicians got together and petitioned the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation ( ZNBC ) to begin paying them copyright royalties for any song or video's played on ZNBC.   Shortly after, chairman of the Zambia Copyrights Society ( ZAMCOPS ) Jagari Chanda, was invited by the World Copyrights Organisation ( WBO ) to attend a copyright seminar in Switzerland.   Towards the end of the year, a white girl was picked to represent Zambia at the Miss World pageant but the move was not without controversy. But perhaps the saddest moment of the year was when veteran singer, Derek Mbao, passed away after an illness while in prison.   "Its the saddest moment in the history of Zambian music," ZUM general secretary, Webster Malama moaned. And before our tears could dry, the music fraternity lost yet another good musician in former Witch guitarist, Emmanuel Makulu.   Tshala Muana   Foreign singers made forays into the country.  Zairean sassy singer, Tshala Muana breezed in.  She was followed by another Zairean Yondo Sister.  A month later Le General, Dafao jetted in.  But his shows were far from impressive. Zambian singers based in foreign lands also paid a courtesy call to theirmother land.     Sweden-based singer Ken Simuyemba came into the country and so did the Ubale Girls and guitar virtuoso, Rikki Illilonga. The women ganged up and came up with a project called Women In Music  to promote women musicians.  Shortly after, they organised a talent show for emergent female musicians artistes at the Chainama hotel.   They have gone further and organised a tour of the Zimbabwe-based Zairean band, the Lubumbashi Stars which was be performing at various venues in Lusaka over the New Year period.   Ras Willie   Ras Willie who was facing a charge of trafficking in obscene material was acquitted by the Lusaka High court after the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against him. The Amayenge's planned tour of Zimbabwe fell through after the venues they had ear marked for their shows were booked by other people.   Last week saw the crowning of Tamara Kaluba as Miss Universe-Zambia but the choice did not go down well with most revellers. Lastly but definitely not the least, the Go Banana's night club and the former Kuku's night club were given  new leases of life after extensive renovations .   Hoping you have caught up with 1995, we look forward to taking you through 1996 with more and wider entertainment coverage.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaMembe Joins Presidential RacePost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by  Reuben  Phiri   Lusaka - Clergyman and human rights activist Reverend Franklin Membe yesterday declared he was joining the race for the Zambian presidency in the forthcoming elections during a press conference at Lusaka's Fairview Hotel.   Membe said that he had intended to contest for presidency in the year 2001 but has been compelled to do it this year  because  "the rate at which the MMD government is going is dangerous".   "I do not see any seriousness on the part of Chiluba to avert bloodshed in the country," Membe said. Asked what his chances were against MMD's  President Chiluba and UNIP's Kenneth Kaunda, Membe said with adequate funds and a fair election he could win.   "Its never too late," he said. " MMD came together in less than a year." Membe said he will stand on a political party whose name he will be announcing soon after completing consultations. And Membe accused President Chiluba, without adequate proof, of using undemocratic methods to hold on to power.   "He is recruiting more policemen and soldiers when people are suffering because he wants to use them to hold on to power,"Membe said."Because Kaunda has announced his intention to contest presidency, there is money for two thousand police officers."   Reverend Membe is the estranged husband to local government and housing deputy minister Wendy Sinkala Membe.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Science, Medicine and TechnologyZambia Has No Policy On Information TechnologyPost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 5, 1996 (19960105)by Nkandu Kapepula   Lusaka - If Kabunda Kayongo, the fourth minister in as many years at science and technology ministry, keeps her end of year promise to the information technology (IT), 1996 could be the dawn of a promising era.     On December 1, Kayongo used Computers Society of Zambia seventh computers communications fair as an excuse to declare she will roll out a national IT policy this year. Could this be another of those empty slogans?    That is not an uncharitable question to ask. Incidentally, this is not the first time government has gone public about the urgent need of an IT policy. Nor is it true to infer that there is no IT policy at the moment. It is there - a monumental patchwork of here-today-gone tomorrow guidelines.   As far as history of both Kaunda and Chiluba administration goes, the IT portfolio has never been distinctly delegated. The result is that today four ministers are directly involved with the IT enterprise and are ostensibly pulling in different directions.   Other than the science and technology ministry, communications and transport, information and broadcasting, and commerce, trade and industry, bureaucrats have separately courted the IT community with different agendas. Computer Society of Zambia, for one, gives the impression that there is no difference between the four. It collaborates with any of them as it deems convenient.   And there lies the critical problem of lack of focus and absence of unity of purpose. The knock-on effect is that the IT industry is on the back step. Witness the confusion on trade tariffs, legislation on intellectual property rights, the resistance to open the telecoms market and a discordant skills development effort.   As far as Penzanomics stretch, a compact disc (CD) bearing Yondo Sister's music is of the same value  as one with Micr-osoft's Office 95 groupware! That is not all. Information and broadcasting ministry sees no impropriety in lumping computer programmes with poetry and music in its copyright laws.     Enter communications and transport ministry. It hand-picks the board of directors of the Communication Authority, the nat-ion's telecoms industry regulator, without representation from the native computer industry. Either the ministry is not convinced computers, communications and electronic media are converging and that it needs well-versed advisors in these fields or it has time-warped.   When primary and pre-schools across the border in Mozambique and Namibia are being equipped with donated computer systems-thanks to their creative bureaucrats- God knows when the ever uncertain private initiatives of our universities will yield an IT prog-rammes.   Far more striking, the guys at SGS and Zambia Revenue Authority do not care whether our nascent IT industry swims or sinks. Never mind that there is absolutely no computer hardware manufacturing here to protect from imports, their business is to make Zambians pay more than even the manufacturers demand.     Yes, SGS has been instructed to ignore invoice prices demanded by manufacturers and substitute them with what is in its 'opinion' is the right value. The reason is that the treasury under Ronald Penza, whom even MMD vigilantes cannot entrust to lead their obscure finance and economic committee, must collect more taxes to pay its hopelessly bloated civil services, finance dubious jaunts etc.Surprisingly,  political rhetoric is heavily skewed towards hoodwinking a supposedly unassuming populace that this is the ideal climate to lure foreign investors. What is attractive about setting up a shop where one has to pay for receiving a call (not sending) on cellular phone? Not in an age where technology has improved so much that before long the cost of dialing Lusaka from New York would be the same as ringing one's next door neighbour, that is not science fiction but reality.   For inspiration, India is a ready reference point,. Its software industry grew more than 50 per cent last year posting a turnover of 850 million United States dollars. This is far much more than our export earnings from copper sales in thecorresponding period.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Science, Medicine and TechnologyZambians Used 7M Condoms In 1995Post of ZambiaJanuary 5, 1996 (19960105)by Masautso Lungu   Lusaka - About 7 million Maximum Condoms were used in Zambia in 1995 alone, racking in about K52.5 million of income to local maximum agents, the Zambia Social Marketing Projects (ZSMP).   And ZSMP has taken another step further to Reality, a female condom.  "We've six months in which to access the market for Reality , but it is selling well in our outlets," said ZSMP marketing manager, Chris Mukkuli in an interview yesterday. "For instance we sold about 1, 500 packets of Reality in December, and we  hope that it will improve though there are more men buying it than women."  Mukkuli also disclosed that there has been overwhelming response from the public in Maximum Condoms.   "We sold 6.7 million condoms in 1995. The level of acceptance and awareness is so high that every sexually active person would want to use the Maximum Condom," said Mukkuli. "That it is our business to see people using condoms to prevent the spread of the deadly diseases and promote family planning. "   And the stores manager at S.J Patel Supermarket, Henry Mangani, is delighted by the figure sold which is close to the national population ofabout 8 million people."We're proud that Zambia Social Marketing Project has sold 7 million condoms and I feel we've contributed to this figure as we've sold maximum condoms since they were introduced on the market," said Mangani.    Last year's figure accounts for over 50 per cent of all the sales ZSMP made between 1992 when it launched maximum and 1994. Between this period ZSMP sold only 12.2 million condoms.    Maximum is also changing the packaging of the condoms to make it even more appealing and convenient to carry. "We will this year change from the square shaped box to a pillow shaped package which will be more convenient for the consumer to carry," Mukkuli said.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Business and FinanceZambia Stock Trading Slowed by Small Number Of FirmsPost of ZambiaJanuary 5, 1996 (19960105)by Sipo Kapumba   Lusaka - Trade at the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) has been seriously affected by the low number of companies being floated there and the general poor state of the economy, experts have said.   LuSE general manager Charles Mate and Finance Securities general manager Nduba Namoonde said, in separate interviews, on Wednesday that an increase in the number of listed companies from the present two, Chilanga Cement and Rothmans of Pall Mall, and the stabilisation of the economy could boost the level of activity on the LuSE.And Mate said companies on the stock exchange could be likened to commodities and "the wider the variety on offer, the more likely the public was to being attracted to trade in them".   However, Mate said the stock exchange cannot dictate to the government through the Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund the pace at which companies should be floated to the public because this was their prerogative.   This year Zambia Oxygen, Zambia Sugar and Zambia Breweries shares are expected to be listed on the stock exchange but their timetables is yet to be announced.Mate also said the stabilisation of the economy through a reduction in inflation which in-turn could lead to a drop in interest rates would present shares as an attractive option to the traditional method of saving money in Zambia which is through maintaining bank accounts. "The wider participation of individuals in share ownership was an important objective of the privatisation programme which the LuSE was there to facilitate by enabling as many people as possible have access to shares in companies being privatised," Mate said.   Namoonde said there is need for tax concessions to companies go public if the stock exchange is to develop. "For the stock exchange to grow the government needs to create a conducive atmosphere through tax concessions for companies which want to float their shares to the public on the exchange," he said. "The government should give tax relief to companies floating their shares to the public so that more are willing to do so."   In addition, Namoonde said the government could help put public confidence into the exchange by stabilising the economy so that people do not simply concentrate on consumption but also start saving even by way of share ownership.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaControversy Slows Voter RegistrationPost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 3, 1996 (19960103)by Masautso Phiri   Lusaka - Lack of visible control, direction and coordination of the work of the Israeli firm, Nikuv, contracted by the government to prepare the voters' register and cards is said to be frustrating the work of the Electoral Commission.   And neither the government, through the office of the Vice-President, nor the Electoral Commission, through the Elections Office, seems to have discernible control over, or even knowledge of, the activities of Nikuv. And this apparent 'mystery' over Nikuv seems to be compounding the fears of the opposition that the ruling MMD wants to use the firm  to rig the elections.     This 'invisible' control of Nikuv also seems to be one of the major obstacles to the smooth completion of the exercise.   The Electoral Commission and Elections Office's lack of supervisory powers over Nikuv is said to have left the commissioners and officers frustrated. Issues of control of Nikuv, funding, cards distribution and registration appear to be the worrisome issue at play.   "We have nothing to do with either the contract to register voters or Nikuv," said chairman of the Electoral Commission, justice Weston Muzyamba in a telephone interview last week.   But it is not only the Electoral Commission and the Elections Office that knows little, or nothing, about Nikuv, the permanent secretary in the office of the Vice-President, to whom the firm is believed to be reporting, also seems to be uneasy about the firm's voters' registration business.    "I am not in a better position to discuss the subject. You have caught me off hand. I am not able to comment," said permanent secretary in the office of the Vice-President, Philip Daka, in a telephone interview last Friday. He was asked to comment, among other issues, on the government's ability to distribute the 4 million cards to voters who exercise estimates to registered by next week Wednesday. And the cards would only be available for distribution to the registered voters sometime in February.   Opposition parties have expressed worry that some voters may not return to registration centres to collect their cards and they fear for the security of those cards whose owners would either have died or are unable to collect them for one reason or another.   And the Electoral Commission, although appearing unhappy with this arrangement, is not prepared to criticise it.   "This is what has been decided by government. Find out from the government chief spokesman if the elections commission was involved in this," said Electoral Commission spokesman Joel Sikazwe said in an interview last week. The Electoral Commission and Elections Office's frustration were also noticed and observed by leaders of the opposition who they met last week.   "I noticed the difficult circumstances they are working under and it showed they were not happy about the arrangement," Zambia Democratic Congress deputy secretary Azwell Banda observed in an interview last week.    "They said they had recommended the issuance of cards immediately after registration but the government refused."    But not even Nikuv officials, based at Lusaka's Hotel Intercontinental, are willing to explain their activities.   "I am also a technician and I cannot say anything. I don't know what it has to do with you, anyway," said projects manager, Setton, in an interview last week when asked to explain his firm's role.

Secretaries of UNIP, Liberal Progressive Front and National Party have met three times to pave the way for today's meeting.    "The first meeting agreed on three issues - voter registration and Nikuv, constitutional reform and President Frederick Chiluba's citizenship," said special assistant for press to UNIP president Muhabi Lungu. "But we unanimously agreed to suspend discussion of President's citizenship because it might overshadow serious issues."    Today's meeting follows an earlier meeting between UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda and LPF president Rodger Chongwe at which an outline of common understanding was agreed. The two parties were later joined by the National Party and for today's meeting by the Zambia Democratic Congress.   And yesterday UNIP officials were tight-lipped about the venue of the meeting.   "We cannot announce the venue before the presidents agree," said  UNIP's vice secretary general Fenwick Chifunda.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZambiaState House Snubs GroupPost of Zambia (Lusaka)January 3, 1996 (19960103)by Goodson Machona    Lusaka - State House has thrown out an offer by the Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) to mediate in the on-going 'conflict' between President Chiluba and Post editor-in-chief Fred M'membe.   In a telephone interview yesterday, President Chiluba's public relations and press aide, Richard Sakala, said the issues raised by M'membe in his letter to Chiluba were criminal and only the courts can settle the matter.   "There is no question of reconciliation between President Chiluba and Fred M'membe," Sakala said.  "What is there is for the two parties to meet in court."   But Women for Change executive director, Emily Sikazwe, says that if what M'membe wrote in his letter  was criminal then the President's attacks on him, to which he was responding, should also be criminalised. "If what M'membe wrote to the President is criminal then the President's remarks on M'membe on the Night Line  programme is also criminal," Sikazwe said.   She said it was unfortunate that President Chiluba would like to take M'membe to court without waiving his own immunity so that he too can be prosecuted.   "The President has immunity and it would be grossly unfair to take M'membe to court without waiving his immunity," Sikazwe said.    But FODEP general secretary, Bishop John Mambo, has maintained that his organisation will still go ahead and mediate in the stand off.   "As FODEP we feel we should mediate in the conflict between  President Chiluba and Mr M'membe," Mambo said in an interview yesterday, adding: "This week we will be writing to President Chiluba so that we can arrange a meeting for these people."   He said going to court is not the best solution.   "Court proceedings take between three to five years to conclude and that will not help anybody," Mambo said, adding: "We don't have to wait until M'membe or Masautso Phiri (Post special projects editor) has an artificial accident for people to act."    He dispelled claims by UNIP chairman, Malimba Masheke, that  "FODEP and MMD are one".  "I am above a person that can be used by anybody," Mambo seethed and noted that it was President Chiluba's special assistant for press, Richard Sakala who is "not courageous enough to call M'membe to State House to discuss the issue. That is why we have decided to put a brake on this issue".   But ZIMT president, Alfred Zulu, said no Non Governmental Organisation has the right to mediate in the matter.   "If the President feels offended its up to the judiciary to take effect and not an NGO," Zulu said in an interview on Monday.   The 'conflict' between Chiluba and M'membe has generated a lot of interest among civic and political leaders who have criticised FODEP for the stand it took over the letter written to President Chiluba by M'membe soon after his Christmas eve ZNBC  Night Line Radio programme.   The Zambia Democratic Congress, the Zambia Civic Education Association, the National Party, the Liberal Progressive Party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP), the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team, the Inter African Network for Human Rights and Development (Afronet ) and the Catholic Commission for Peace and Justice have all come out in support of M'membe and criticised FODEP's stand which they described as "not neutral".   Meanwhile State House has continued to run full page articles in the government owned and controlled newspapers accusing M'membe of being unpatriotic and of waging an international "anti-Zambia campaign". -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Zambia and EgyptSoccer: Zambians Predict 2-1 Victory Against EgyptPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 26, 1996 (19960126)by Mildred Mulenga, PANA Staff Correspondent    LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambian soccer fans on Friday predicted their team will beat Egypt 2-1 in the quarter-finals of the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations to be played Saturday at Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein, South Africa.    Some 80 percent of Zambian soccer fans who called into a programme on national radio Friday morning said Zambia, runners-up in the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations played in Tunsia would the tough Egyptian side 2-1. Only one caller said Zambia would be beaten by Egypt. He predicted a 0-1 margin.    Zambia who qualified for the quarter-finals on Wednesday after beating Sierra Leone 4-0. The Zambian coach Roald Poulsen said Zambia's quarter final match against Egypt would be "tough". A local analyst Ponga Liwewe said Thursday evening that Zambia has to play a more attacking game because the Egyptians are good at holding the ball and are "solid" at the back. "We need other players to get to the scoring point to put in goals in the first half," Ponga said.    Another analyst Anthony Kasolo said Zambia has to cut the Egyptians wings were they are known to run the ball well. He said the Zambians should also avoid lettting the Egyptians to break their defense in counter attacks. The two also expressed concern at what was Zambia's relaxed style after scoring five goals and two goals against Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone in the first half.    Zambia, who during the opening match against Algeria drew 0-0 have so far scored nine goals in two games after beating Burkina Faso 5-1 and Sierra Leone 4-0 to qualify for the quarter-finals. With five golas to his credit, Zambia's skipper Kalusha Bwalya is currently the top scorer at the ongoing tournament.-0-    Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996MozambiqueOutrage Grows Over Interior Minister's RemarksPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 26, 1996 (19960126)   MAPUTO, Mozambique - In spite of growing public outrage at his remarks, Mozambican interior minister Manuel Antonio has defended his position that prisoners have only themselves to blame if they die of hunger in police cells.    Asked by the daily paper "Noticias" to clarify his position, Antonio simply repeated that his ministry does not have the money to buy food for prisoners, and that they are in jail because of the crimes they committed.    "I repeat my statements," said Antonio. "Who asked them to commit crimes ?"    Many of those incarcerated in prisons run by the police are in fact not convicted criminals but detainees awaiting trial. The minister did not seem to make a distinction between the two.    In an interview published on Monday, Antonio is reported to have said: "These men who die, it's really because there's no food to give them. They're not maltreated." But the minister added: "A man has to die, he has his limits. When his time's up, it's over. He goes. It's not because they've been maltreated by the police."    The Mozambican Human Rights League has sent a strong protest to President Joaquim Chissano, suggesting that Antonio be sacked. The minister told "Noticias" he did not care about the league's stance.    One of the country's leading lawyers, Carlos Cauio, head of the Mozambican Bar Association, described the minister's words as "an assault on human dignity".    The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Maputo, Cardinal Alexandre dos Santos, told the independent news sheet Mediafax, "I intend to speak with the minister of the interior. I think that by talking we can resolve a lot of things." He described the fate of prisoners as "worrying", and added "perhaps it's not just a food shortage -- it's because the food is being stolen." -0-   Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeWeekly Press ReviewPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 26, 1996 (19960126)by Olu Sarr, PANA Staff Correspondent   DAKAR, Senegal - War and soccer were the issues attracting the attention of the Africa Press this week.    Newspapers in Addis Ababa and Dakar commented on the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations.    The Monitor of Addis Ababa focused on Nigeria's absence from the 20th tournament. "Almost everyone is affected by the absence of the Super Eagles," it said. It wondered if this was not fatal: "To Mandela? To Nigerian strongman Sani Abacha and to African football? "The only losers are African soccer and the football crazy African fans who put soccer before politics," it said.    Nigeria, it continued, was "by all account" the best football nation in Africa. The country, it added, was "big in many ways": population, economy, oil and politics but for the average African, all these factors matter little. "Soccer comes first and here lies the big disappointment," it said. Recounting how Nigerian fans travelled worldwide to support the Super Eagles it concluded: "   The ultimate losers...will definitely be ordinary Nigerian fans who had nothing to do with Abacha's decision. "When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers most. What a fitting African adage," it said.    As the event moves closer to the final, Dakar's Le Soleil noted that after the initial surprise in the tournament "the entire tournament had become an affair for the favourites": Algeria, Egypt and Zambia. These countries, it said, "have logically bulldozed their way to the quarterfinal."    From soccer politics to real politik, several Nigerian papers condemned the coup d'etat in Sierra Leone which overthrew Capt. Valentine Strasser. This condemnation coincided with the visit to Nigeria of the new military leader in Freetown, Brig. Julius Bio.    The Daily Sketch, of Ibadan, noted wearily that coups used to be the business of colonels and their superiors in fairly backward countries. They struck in Greece in 1967, in Portugal in 1974 and Spain in 1981. "They were then the sick men of Europe, economically and politically. Though their economies are yet to become ruddy pink, their politics has firmly stablised, a democracy that works, that the military readily surbodinates itself to," it noted.    "In West Africa, young officers appear to see coup-making as a bit of mess fun," it said. The semi-official paper noted that Strasser had set general elections for Feb. 26. "Many important Sierra Leoneans took him seriously enough to put themselves forward as presidential candidates. The new rulers, former lieutenants of the deposed one, have said that they are all for a return to democratic rule. But they have not been as illuminating with regard to when this will be," it said.    But Kenya's largest circulation daily newspaper, the Daily Nation, noted that Bio had, in fact, been quick to assure the world he would not derail the elections. "How times have changed. A time was when those staging coups across Africa did not feel compelled to justify their action as swiftly as Brigadier Bio is trying to do," it said.    It wondered whether Bio's junta would follow through with elections as scheduled "or will they borrow a leaf from another West African nation to stay just within reach of another coup, another day?" it said in implicit reference to Nigeria's situation.    While Strasser alleged that he was ousted because he wanted to maintain the election schedule, Bio said that he overthrew Strasser precisely because the captain did not really want to hand over to a democratically elected civilian government. "   At the root of the confusion is the fact that members of the country's ruling military were not convinced that the military has had its fill of political leadership," the Nigerian Tribune, published in Ibadan, said. "The division within the hierarchy of the Sierra Leonean military epitomises the crisis and perhaps helplessness of African states which have been under military rule," it added.    For its part, The Vanguard of Lagos, noted that Africa had demonstrated its commitment to democracy but Sierra Leone was among the uneviable trio [the others being Gambia and Nigeria] still under military dictatorships. "We expect the new leaders to meet the people's quest for democracy so that the country's name could be deleted from the bad list. "   To this end, Brigadier-General Bio and his clique should do nothing that would lead to the postponement of the elections already slated for February 26 this year," it said.    The press in Burundi, Kenya and Zaire commented on the suggestion by United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali that UN troops be sent to neighbouring Zaire in readiness to intervene in Burundi to stem the genocide shaping up, it seems, in degree and fashion as had happened in neighbouring Rwanda.    Nairobi's "Daily Nation" castigated the U.N for dilly-dallying on whether or not to send the peacekeeping. However, it exonerated Boutros-Boutros Ghali and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, of blame. Despite its nasty experiences at peacekeeping, it said, "it would be an ironic tragedy" if, unwilling to preempt a tragedy now, "it later spends millions in a tribunal to investigate and indict murderers in what may well become the Burundi genocide."    The Burundi government-owned newspaper, Le Renouveau, said "foreign intervention will never solve Burundi's problems." Instead of a "foreign occupation force", it said, there should be "massive aid" to the country's millions of orphans.    Le Compatriote of Kinshasa said that the "international community and African countries should threaten the Burundi government with sanctions so as to force it to end the violance against civilians."    La Manchette, also a Kinshasa paper, said given the gravity of the situation, the United Nations seretary-general should again plea for the dispatch of UN troops to Zaire.    But La Nation, a Bujumbura privately-owned weekly, said that only Zaire's Mobuto Sese Seko would gain by this. "It would allow him to emerge from his world political isolation and gain centre stage." Rather than sending troops, it said, the U.N "should give the regular [Burundi] army the money it would have to spend maintaining the Blue Helmets, or help the Burundian judiciary arrest the putschists and masterminds of the October 1993 massacres."    Another tragedy discussed by Ibadan's Daily Sketch, was Liberia. It attacked ULIMO faction leader Roosevelt Johnson for acquiring weapons, ambushing West African peacekeeping troops and killing and capturing scores of them. It noted that many of the dead were Nigerians and that the peacekeeping commander, a Nigerian, said he would not send his men to incapacitate Johnson.    To add insult to injury, it said Johnson "sounded unrepentant, even exultant," during a radio interview. "An ant has painfully tweaked the tusk of an elephant and he appeared to be getting away with it," it said. This, it said, was "all very well" if one was dealing with an opponent that did not suffer from a superiority complex. "Mr. Johnson appears to," it said. "He should be given the Prince Johnson treatment. He should be made to beg to be taken out of Liberia," it said.    The World Bank representative in Nairobi, Steve O'Brien, last week warned that it was unlikely that donor countries would give funds to poor nations come July 1996 because no pledges had been forthcoming.    Against this forecast, the Kenya Times, the ruling party newspaper, said: "The bottom line is that African nations, which have hitherto heavily relied on donor assistance, must contrive ways of pulling themselves out of the economic hardships by their own bootstraps." Pinpointing one of Africa's problems as the lack of a sound technological base it advised thus: "All Africa ought to do is to learn how to benefit from international patents like they have done in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan and other countries who survived on borrowed technology. This will make Africa self-reliant." -0-   Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996KenyaShilling Hits Record LowPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 26, 1996 (19960126)   NAIROBI, Kenya - The Kenyan shilling hit its sharpest fall in almost a year Thursday when it plummeted to 59.1 from 55.50 to the US dollar.    The fall came as the World Bank announced it had suspended further disbursement of loans to the East African state after government over-expenditure and corruption in high places. The bank said it would review disbursement of funds to Kenya in a joint mission with the International Monetary Fund.    Kenya was to have presented two loan applications for USD 165 million to the bank's board in Washington Thursday. The loans were to finance to major road projects.

Speaking at the end of a meeting with employees at the National Oil Products Marketing Company (SONACOP), Soglo said he would be "obliged to use the mechanisms provided for by the institutions" if there was a "block" or "hindrance to the normal operation of the State".    Benin's parliament has demanded that the government renegotiate the terms of the structural adjustment programme with the World Bank. But Soglo has said this is "a rejection" of the programme which has already been approved by the bank's board.    A decision taken by the bank cannot be put into question, he added. "Our country needs foreign resources and a budget to meet the challenges of 1996," the president said. This programme has stirred differences between the government, on the one hand, and the unions and parliament on the other. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BurundiBujumbura Police Arrest Union Leaders, JournalistsPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 26, 1996 (19960126)   BUJUMBURA, Burundi - Police in Bujumbura have arrested several trade unionists, politicians and journalists suspected of being ringleaders in a recent one-week strike.    The strike, from Jan. 15 to 21, was called to force the resignation of the government of President Sylivestre Ntibantunya, on allegations that he has been secretly been backing Hutu guerrillas in their fight against the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army.    The latest arrests came a few days after that of Deo Niyonzima, who heads a Tutsi group known as "The Youth Solidarity for the Defence of Minorities", which spearheaded the work-stoppage. Niyomzima was arrested by the police after a James Bond-type chase in the streets of the Burundian capital.    A trade unionist at the National Institute of Public Security, Innocent Massunzu, was arrested Thursday evening for his alleged role in the strike. As part of a crackdown against the strike's leaders, the government has placed Hitimana Mathias and Cyrille Sigejeje under house arrest for the past 20 days.    Hitimana is Chairmen (People's Reconciliation Party while Sigejeje heads the Rally for Democracy and Social Development. The government has also detained two independent journalists,    Doweri Dismas of the weekly "La Balance" and Jean-Marie Bizimana of "La Nation", another weekly. Doweri allegedly wrote articles that insulted cabinet ministers while Bizimana is accused of trying to divide and demoralise the army during the strike.    The Tutsi-dominated army did not back the strike. Reliable sources in the justice ministry said arrest warrants had also been issued for secondary school teachers and university lecturers suspected of being behind the anti-government work stoppage.    At the beginning of the strike, the Tutsi Burundian Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo cautioned the organisers the government would take stern action. Burundi has been rocked by political instability and ethnic violence since October 1993, after the Hutu democratically elected President Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated in a failed coup d'etat by elements of the Tutsi-dominated army.-0-    Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996NigeriaPrisons Full of People Awaiting TrialPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 26, 1996 (19960126)by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent   LAGOS, Nigeria - Some 35,750 inmates are awaiting trial in Nigerian prisons, some for the past 10 years, according Internal Affairs Minister Baba Gana Kingibe.    These suspects represent about 65 percent of the total 55,000 inmates in the country's jail houses. At a briefing Thursday in Abuja, the nation's capital, the minister said "even convicts are human beings and are entitled to basic rights."    He said "it is hard enough being behind bars and harder still not to be accorded proper care and treatment whilst in prison." To decongest the prisons, Kingibe, Nigeria's Foreign Minister until early 1995, urged the police and courts to speed the judicial processes. He said the "principle of modern-day incarceration emphasises correction in preferecne to punishment.    Part of this principle is the entitlement of the prisoner to decent environment and decent feeding." To this end, the minister said government recently increased the inmates' feeding allowance by 100 percent from 30 to 60 Naira per head.

He told journalists in Freetown Thursday it was baseless to accuse Nigeria of involvement in the January 16 bloodless coup that toppled Capt. Valentine Strasser and swept his former deputy, Brig. Julius Maada Bio, to power.    Nigerian defence minister Brig.Gen. Fred Chijuka was the first to deny any nigerian involvement in the palace coup, which he described as an internal issue for Sierra Leone. Benjamin, who also served as secretary to the deposed Strasser regime, however, confirmed that Strasser's decision to vote against Nigeria in the last Commonwealth Summit in Aukland, New Zealand, had caused a big rift in Sierra Leone's former cabinet.    He was quoted as saying "Nigeria has done so much for us and there was no justification for antagonising her." The Commonwealth Summit suspended Nigeria over the November 10 execution of nine of its citizens convicted for murder. They included the author Ken Saro-Wiwa.    The Gambia was said to be the only African country that voted against the Commonwealth action on Nigeria.    Nigeria has troops in Sierra Leone, helping the government fight the four-year-old war against the rebel Revolutionary Front. Bio has visited Nigerian military ruler Gen.

Officials said here Friday the warning had been received by the Transport Ministry, which in turn directed the customs services to take action. All the area comptrollers have been instructed "to beef up surveillance and put officers on red alert" to foil the attempt to smuggle the waste into the country, the officials said.    The port health division is also said to be taking precautionary measures. Details of the alleged waste and the importer have not been given, for what officials called "diplomatic and security reasons."    Nigeria was a victim of toxic waste dump by an Italian firm in 1988. The dump in Koko, midwestern Nigeria, sensitised the country and put her in the forefront of international anti-dump campaign. Nigeria set up the Federal Environmental Protection Agency following the incident.   A year later, Abuja promulgated a tough decree, prescribing life jail for any person convicted of importing hazardous waste into the country. Collectively, African coutries also adopted the Bamako Convention forbidding the trans-boundary transportation of toxic wastes. -0-   Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996United States and AfricaClinton, Hussein Condole AbachaPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 26, 1996 (19960126)   LAGOS, Nigeria - President Bill Clinton and Sadam Hussein of Iraq are among world leaders that have condoled Nigeria's military ruler Gen.

Regional Magistrate William Cutler told Abraham Kinfe, 35, that his case was dragging for too long. Kinfe was charged in November 1995 on two counts of conspiracy to attempted murder and of illegal possession of arms of war, Kinfe, who is still looking for a lawyer to defend him, was remanded in custody to February 2.    Kinfe, an Ethiopian, wanted to assassinate Col Mengistu to revenge the alleged killing hundreds of people during his rule. There was tight security within and outside the court, with an armed policeman sitting inside.    Kinfe said his interpreter was not translating accurately what the magistrate was saying.    The trial was postponed for seven days in November 1995 after an application by Kinfe's lawyer, Tinofara Hove of T.K. Hove and Partners, that his client needed medical examination.

The new director of the immigration service, Sahabi Dange, spoke recently of an intensified drive to help curb the advance fee financial scam known as locally as "419." Nigerian and foreign businessmen have fallen victim of the practice, which has brought international disrepute to the already politically troubled West African country.    However, Nigerian officials say it normally takes the citizens and their foreign collaborators to commit the crime. Officials have urged diplomatic missions in Nigeria to advise their nationals to follow appropriate procedure when doing business in Nigeria.

Total foreign purchases since June 23 1993 totalled 2.15 billion ZD (239 million USD), while the net inflow was about 1.119 billion ZD (124 million USD), market analysts said on Friday. Quincor Stockbrokers said in their January bulletin the stock market, once dubbed the world's worst performer in 1992/93, had recovered during the past three years and was last year ranked third best performing stocks in emerging markets by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). "Over the past 12 months, the market has had its ups and downs.    In general, the mining index moved in sympathy with the industrial index. The first three months of 1995 were bad for Zimbabwean equities, but both sectors rallied from intra-year lows in march to reach all-time record levels in October," the company said.    However, the market was in 1995 affected by a rash of poor results released by quoted companies, particularly during the last quarter of the year, which showed the negative effects of the 1994/95 drought, Quincor said. "The last batch of poor results and announcements depressed sentiment, but none were a surprise to the market.    Overall, the market is looking fairly valued on the prospect of reasonable rains," it said. Quincor predicted the market will this year benefit from a good rainy season, which would see the key industrial index breaching the 4,800 level for the first time.    Meanwhile, the industrial index on Friday reached an all-time high of 4,257, having gained 24 points on the back of active trading during the morning.

The King was buried at the national mountaintop shrine of Thava Bosiu, outside the capital Maseru, at a ceremony attended by presidents Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Frederick Chiluba of Zambia and Sir Khetumile Masire of Botswana.    Masire, who spoke on behalf of the other leaders, described King Moshoeshoe as "an illustrious son of Africa", adding: "The whole of Africa, as well as the world at large, have suffered an enormous loss."    King Moshoeshoe, 57, and his driver were killed when his car went off a Maluti mountain road January 15 early in the morning. The vehicle rolled down the mountain for about 500 metres before coming to a halt. He had gone to inspect his cattle posts.    Pathologists who examined the King said he suffered multiple rib and head fractures. A member of the royal family dismissed rumours that the King Noshoeshoe had died because of foul play. "The royal family is satisfied that his majesty left to join his ancestors because his time had come. Any claims and counter-claims and questions are, therefore, not true," said Chief Masupha Seeiso, the King's brother.    King Moshoeshoe was a constitutional monarch who wielded no legal powers. He was enthroned in 1960, succeeding Queen Regent Mansebo Seeiso. He was dethroned in 1990 after a coup d'etat by Maj. Gen. Justine Lekhanya and replaced by his son, King Letsie III, under the orders of the military.    In turn, King Letsie staged a royal coup in 1994, ousting the government of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle and immediately suspending the constitution. However, the action received international condemnation and the coup was reversed in less than a month following the intervention of the leaders of Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe.    Letsie, however, only abdicated after promises that his father would be reinstated.    King Moshoeshoe returned from exile in Britain in 1993 when the military ruler at the time, Maj. Gen.

The return of the Comorian leader after several months in "forced exile" in the island of Reunion followed an agreement reached earlier this week between the country's political parties at a conference held in Madagascar under the auspices of the OAU.    He was taken to the island by French troops who put and end to a military take over of the Moroni government by mercenaries headed by Bod Denard in September 1995.    "Djohar and the OAU delegation headed by Assistant Secretary General Vijay S. Makhan, were welcomed on arrival in Moroni by Prime Minister Caabi El Yachroutu of the national unity government of Comoros and members of his government," the release said.    The OAU brokered an agreement with the Comorian parties at meetings held in Antananarivo on January 21 and 22, which provides for the holding of free and fair elections on March 6 and 16, under the supervision of the OAU and the United Nations. The OAU delegation currently in Moroni will hold a preliminary meeting of the follow-up committee with participants of the Antananarivo conference.    It will also be attended by observers from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and France who are currently in Moroni. "This Committee which is provided for in the Antananarivo agreement is responsible for the implementation of the clauses of the agreement", the OAU statement said.-0-    Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Nigeria and GambiaBilateral Pact To Set Up Youth SchemePanafrican News AgencyJanuary 26, 1996 (19960126)by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria is helping Gambia set up its youth service scheme under a new bilateral pact, officials said Friday in Abuja.    Six senior officials of Nigeria's National Youth Service Corps, set up in 1973, have been seconded to Banjul on the programme based on a 1994 request by the Gambia, the officials said. A director of Nigeria's corps, Grey Anegwea, now assumes that position of the Gambian Youth Service Scheme, which started last week.    Nigeria's corps, under which fresh university graduates serve one year in parts of the country other than their own, is designed to promote national unity and integration in the country of 100 million people with diverse ethnic groups. About 500,000 people have passed through the programme, launched under by former military ruler Gen. Yakubu Gowon, after Nigeria's civil war that ended in 1970.    Nigerian Youth Service Corps officials say the first intake of the Gambian service is expected to be mobilised at the end of the 1995/96 academic year. The director-general of Nigeria's service, Col. Soyemi Sofolufe, says Nigeria is prepared to assist other African countries that have an interest in setting up a similar programme.-0-    Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Liberia and United StatesU.S. Envoy Commends African Peace ForcePanafrican News AgencyJanuary 26, 1996 (19960126)by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent   UNITED NATIONS - United States Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright has called on the international community to support the African Peace Monitoring Group in Liberia, or ECOMOG, in its efforts to end years of civil war.    Speaking at a U.N. Security Council meeting on Liberia Thursday, Albright commended the force and its field commander, Brig. Gen. John Inienger of Nigeria, for his determination to carry out its mandate.    "Overall, at least for now, I found Ecomog performing well," she said. "They seem to be playing a neutral and constructive role now, as opposed to various times in the past."    ECOMOG was sent to Monrovia in 1990 by the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas). The peacekeepers were shelled on their ships in their first attempt to come ashore. The force was enlarged at one stage to include troops from the East African states of Tanzania and Uganda. They withdrew due to a delay in the peace process.    Albright said, "despite Ecomog's losses in recent weeks, I was impressed by Gen. Inienger's resolve to move forward in the face of adversity."    She added, "We [the U.S.] believe Ecomog deserves our support." However, she said that Ecomog's force structure should be more diversified among member states of the region if it is to constitute an authentic regional peacekeeping operation worthy of international support. "We also believe that Ecomog must enter into a status of forces agreement with the Liberian National Transitional Government so that Ecomog's operations in Liberia are appropriately regulated," she said. The deployment of Ecomog across Liberia in December 1995 was made possible by the 10-million-dollar pledge by the U.S. to assist the force logistically. "   The vehicles Ecomog desperately needs to facilitate disarmament and demobilisation have begun to arrive under the 10-million-dollar pledge," she said, and said other countries should help. Nigeria has the largest contingent in Ecomog. The force, along with the U.N. Observer Mission in Liberia is expected to monitor the implementation of the Abuja Agreement, signed by the Liberian warring factions in August.    The agreement is widely seen as a last-ditch effort to end the six-year civil war, which has claimed 150,000 lives and sent half of the country's 2.5 million people to seek refuge in other countries. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Zambia and RwandaTrial Preparations for Genocide SuspectsPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent    LUSAKA, Zambia -  The Rwandese government has trained more than 300 magistrates, prosecutors and other court staff to help try suspected perpetrators of the 1994 genocide in that country.   Rwanda Foreign Minister Anastase Gazana said in Lusaka Wednesday that his government will try some of the genocide suspects under a United Nations mandate which in 1995 set up the Rwanda International Genocide Tribunal to bring the culprits to book.   He said that under the tribunal's terms of reference governments, including Rwanda itself, had the powers to try anybody suspected of involvement in the genocide in which an estimated 1,000,000 Rwandese died and millions of others forced to flee for safety.   Gazana arrived in Lusaka Tuesday to brief Zambian government officials about the identity of some of the suspected authors of the genocide who are believed to be hiding in Zambia.   A team of experts have arrived in Arusha, Tanzania, to prepare for the trials by the tribunal chaired by South African Judge Richard Goldstone.   The tribunal is expected to start hearing evidence by March, according to Gazana.   Rwanda has appealed to the international community to turn over to the tribunal any suspects who might have taken refuge in foreign countries.   Gazana Wednesday handed the Zambian government a list of some 500 suspects including former Justice Minister Agnes Ntamabyaliro who is suspected to be in Zambia.   Lusaka said it detained some suspected Rwandese fugitives who would be handed over to the tribunal.   Gazana said his government was not particularly interested in securing death sentences for the suspects but that it was necessary that "justice" was done.   "We are not particularly looking for death for the perpetrators (of the genocide), we want justice to be done in order to reconcile those who had been wronged".   Victims of the genocide were mainly people of the minority Tutsi ethnic group and some liberal majority Hutus.   Gazana said the Kigali government recommended that foreign governments who imprisoned any of the genocide suspects should ensure that they were excluded from prerogatives of mercy so that they could serve the full terms according to international law on genocide.   Gazana who was accompanied by Zambian Justice Minister Mukabenzi Marthe returns to Kigali Thursday.   He has undertaken similar missions to several other African countries seeking to have suspects repatriated and handed over either to the tribunal in Tanzania or to his government.-0-    Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996RwandaGovernment Calls for International Support to RebuildPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent     LUSAKA, Zambia - Nearly two years after at least one million of its people were massacred in an organized genocide, Rwanda is appealing to African and other states to support her national reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts.   The appeal is contained in Kigali's foreign ministry memorandum entitled "The General Situation in Rwanda" after the genocide.   The document urges the international community to pledge to take joint concrete actions to advance peace, justice, reconciliation, stability and development in Rwanda and the rest of the Great Lakes Region.   " All the nations must be determined to prevent future genocide, ensure reconciliation with justice relating to the tragic genocide and massacres in Rwanda in 1994 and encourage the return of refugees to their home-countries," said the memorandum.   The memorandum was issued to PANA late Wednesday by visiting Rwandan Foreign Minister, Anastase Gasana.   It said that among the specific actions the world community could undertake to assist in rebuilding the country included mobilization of financial resources for social and economic rehabilitation.   Rwanda also called for the acceleration of the international tribunal's effort to try genocide suspects and urged all concerned governments to hand over suspects to the international court. Deliberations are expected to start next March in Arusha, northern Tanzanian.   A conference in Kigali last November on the "Genocide, impunity and accountability: A dialogue for national and international response" recommended that the rehabilitation process in Rwanda should include reconstituting the moral, physical, socio-economic and psychological values of the survivors of the genocide.   Kigali has set restoration of education, justice, agriculture, health and repatriation of refugees as among the priorities in the national reconstruction and rehabilitation process.   Rwanda also recommended to the international community to set up a genocide compensation fund for the genocide victims.   The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) government estimates that 1.5 million of the two million refugees who fled to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania and Zaire have returned to the country and were currently being rehabilitated.   But reports from the Burundi-Tanzania border indicate an outflow of Rwandan Hutu refugees from Burundi to escape attacks from Bujumbura's Tutsi-dominated army.   The Hutu refugees fled into exile fearing reprisals from the mostly Tutsi RPF, which took power in Kigali in July 1994.   The RPF, mainly composed of sons of Uganda-based Tutsi exiles, had been fighting the army of the late Rwandan President, Juvenal Habyarimana, since Oct. 1, 1990.-0-    Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996NigeriaPopulation Hits 100 MillionPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Paul Ejime PANA Staff Correspondent      LAGOS, Nigeria - The population of Nigeria, Africa's most populous state, has hit the 100 million mark, the country's National Population Commission has said.   A 1991 census by the commission put the country's population at 88.5 million with annual growth estimate of 2.83 percent.   Commission's spokesman Ahmed Hameed told journalists in Lagos that based on the growth rate Nigeria's population had reached 100 million by December 1995.   The World Bank and several United Nations agencies estimate the country's population at more than 100 million.   The 1991 figure stirred much controversy, with some states claiming they had been under-counted.   The commission has, however, said the protests could not invalidate the census, Nigeria's first in almost 20 years.   Censuses are a sensitive subject in Nigeria, a politically polarised federation of diverse ethnic groups.   Groups said to have larger populations often demand a greater share of the national cake.   Hameed said the population commision plans another head count in 2001, adding that at least three years of preparation would be needed to ensure reliable data is obtained. -0-   Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996LesothoThousands Pay Last Respects Lesotho KingPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Violet Maraisane    MASERU, Lesotho - Thousands of Basotho queued at the Royal Palace in Maseru to pay their last respects to late King Moshoeshoe II who was laid in state for public viewing Thursday morning.

In his latest report to the council on the U.N. Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), he recommended that the mandate, which expires at the end of this month, be extended until May 31.   The UN chief said "during this period, I expect the LTG (Liberian National Transitional Government) and faction leaders to provide their full cooperation to ECOMOG and UNOMIL in stabilizing the situation and in vigorously moving ahead with the implementation of the Abuja agreement."   He also called on the international community to reconsider urgently its current level of support to the Ecowas Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to enable it to carry out its responsibilities under the agreement.   Boutros-Ghali described as a setback the recent fighting in Tubmanburg and the delay in implementing key aspects of the Abuja agreement, signed in the Nigerian capital Aug. 19, 1995.   He said the "peace process suffered a setback when Gen. Roosevelt Johnson's wing of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO-J) attacked ECOMOG in Tubmanburg on Dec. 28 1995."   Under the schedule of implementation of the agreement, the disengagement of forces was to have been completed by Sept. 26 while disarmament was to have started Dec. 1.   Boutros-Ghali said "the peace process is now at a critical juncture and the full support of all concerned will be required to overcome the recent setbacks."   He warned faction leaders that ECOWAS (Economic community of West African States) and the international community could not support the Liberian peace process indefinitely.   Meanwhile, the UN chief has announced his intention to appoint a senior electoral officer to follow, on a full-time basis, the preparatory phases of the electoral process in Liberia.   He said he would also send a technical mission to Liberia to consult with the LNTG and ECOWAS, among others, in drafting a framework for the observation and verification of the electoral process.   Under the Abuja accord, legislative and presidential elections are scheduled for Aug. 20, 1996.   The agreement is widely regarded as the most-promising effort to end the six-year fighting in Liberia, which has claimed 150,000 lives and displaced a large percentage of the country's 2.5 million people.-0-    Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BeninAirline Has Financial WoesPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Ali Idrissou, PANA Correspondent      COTONOU, Benin - Air Afrique's board of governors holds its 87th session Thursday and Friday in Cotonou against a background of financial trouble at the airline.   The company is trying to raise 5.8 billion cfa, out of some 15 billion cfa (1 U.S. dollar = about 500 cfa), needed in new investment.   Sources close to the airline said France already had given the company, in which it is a major partner, 9.2 billion cfa in new financing.   Air Afrique in December disclosed it was in urgent need of new cash to sustain operations. Most of the money will go toward paying for four planes bought between 1991 and 1994.   The company has serious cash flow problems. Member states owe it some four billion cfa in unpaid flight tickets. Air Afrique's own debt is estimated at at 200 billion cfa.   According to the same sources, French and American experts have urged a radical restructuring of the company, including a "long term privatization of the company, with gradual state disengagement."   The changes are centered on cutting costs and making operations more efficient.   Foreign shareholders -- Air France, the French Development Fund, the West African Development Bank and DHL -- have a 49 percent of stake in Air Afrique.   Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Congo, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Togo own 51 percent of the company.-0-    Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeSoccer: Algeria's Desert Warriors In Quarter-FinalsPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Randy Zormelo,PANA Staff Correspondent      PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa - Striker Khaled Louncini led Algeria to a 2-1 victory over Burkina Faso in a Group 'B' clash in Port Elizabeth Wednesday, qualifying his side for the quarter finals of the 20th African Cup of Nations in South Africa.   Louncini rocked Burkina in the second minute with a lethal header off a left-footed cross from Sidi Ahmed Zerrouki.   The 'Stallions'  bounced back five minutes later but missed the target as Aboubabcary's close range shot went screaming centimetres over the bar. Half time score was 1-0 againt the stallions.   The Burkinabe's, rejuvinated by changes at the beginning of the second half, dominated proceedings, making several assaults towards the Algerian goal.   But Algeria struck again in the 76th minute when Louncini put midfielder Moussa Saib through to score the second goal.   The Stallions of Ouagadougou pulled one back when striker Boureima Zonga slotted in a header off a cross from Ibrahima Traore.   Meanwhile Zambia made mincemeat of Sierra Leone with a 4-0 drabbing in a wet Group 'B' match played Wednesday in Bloemfontein.   The 1994 vice-champions were in great form with skipper Kalusha Bwalya scoring a hat-trick (2nd, 9th and 84th minutes). Midfielder Modon Malitoli completed the rout in the 88th minute.   In Durban on the same day Angola held Cameroon to 3-3 draw in the Group A match. But the two sides are out of the competition.

RUF spokesman Fayia Musa said in an interview broadcast late Tuesday that the move was in response to the peace offer from Sierra Leone's new military rulers.    He said the group ordered its units to stop "all the ambushes and fighting" immediately.    This is not the first cease-fire in the civil war, which has defied several peace moves including the one initiated by the Organization of African Unity.    Musa said the latest RUF offer is to allow humanitarian relief reach civilians in the rebel-controlled area.    Sierra Leone's new military ruler, Brig. Julius Maada Bio, in one of his initial gestures since assuming power after the bloodless coup Jan. 16, invited the RUF to negotiate to end the war and the country's polititcal crisis.    Bio also promised amnesty for the rebels and renewed his commitment to democracy, saying the Feb. 26 national elections will proceed as planned by the man he overthrew, Capt. Valentine Strasser.    Musa said the group was committed to peace, but he reiterated the organization's demand to postpone the national elections.    Diplomatic sources in Freetown say both sides were to begin reconciliation talks that could signal the return of peace to Sierra Leone.    The diplomats say the government could agree to the rebels' request and postpone the polls, if only to be seen as accommodating all interests in the democratic process.    Bio heads a 17-member military ruling council.    Sierra Leone, with four million people, is rich in diamonds, gold and other prized minerals, but the civil was has devastated its economy, prompting successive governments in Freetown to seek foreign military assistance.  -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996SomaliaSecurity Council Still Committed to PeacePanafrican News AgencyJanuary 24, 1996 (19960124)by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent      UNITED NATIONS, New York - The Security Council, which voted in 1995 to end its mission in Somalia, pledged to remain involved in the peace efforts, saying it takes the situation there very seriously.    "We do not wish the implication to be given that somehow what is going on in Somalia is of no consequence to us, that Somalia has been abandoned," Council President John Weston of Britain said after a discussion of the secretary-general's latest report on Somalia.    He also said the council supported the efforts of the Nairobi-based United Nations Political Office for Somalia, which is "keeping a watching brief on that country."    Weston said the council had noted the "heroic efforts" of humanitarian and other agencies whose presence in Somalia was doing much to prevent the worst tragedies from happening in the country.    Weston expressed the hope the emergence of regional administration in various parts of Somalia would lead to "new possibilities for setting up a proper centralized government again in that country."    In the report, released on Monday, the Secretary-General said the current situation in Somalia was characterized by "political instability, inter-clan conflict, banditry and general lawlessness."    He said "the political situation in Somalia has been dominated by a debilitating stalemate for almost two years since the Somali faction leaders failed to honor their commitments in the Nairobi declaration of March 24, 1994."    However, the Secretary-General noted that an all-out civil war, which many feared would follow the withdrawal of U.N. forces from the country, had been averted despite its lack of progress toward national reconciliation.

The call was made Tuesday in Cairo by UAJ's President Mahfouz Elansary and Secretary-General George Odiko.    Speaking during the closure of a three-week seminar attended by 20 African journalists, the two said the envisaged legislation would only help to suppress the media industry "making it less productive."    "There  are already enough laws in Kenya to deal with individuals and organizations so the union sees no good reason for the country to introduce more restrictions on the press," Odiko said.    The two union leaders said the proposed laws were intended to create fear among individuals wishing to establish independent broadcasting stations and media publishing houses.    Elansary said if the bills are passed in parliament, Kenya risked joining the list of countries that had muzzled the press.    Meanwhile, the Association of Free and Independent Press (AFIP) has asked Kenya's attorney-general to withdraw the draft bills saying they were a betrayal of his commitment to the democratization process.    Recently, the attorney-general published the draft 'Kenya Press Council Bill'which, if passed, will lead to the creation of a council charged with the registration of journalists and the massa media.

ORSTOM entomologist Robert Vincent said the trap, fitted with a bulb, is similar to the one that his organization developed 20 years ago to catch tse-tse flies.    He said that a Dutch collegue, Bart Knols, has been studying for two years the effectiveness of the mosquito trap, which has also been tested in Tanzania for five years.    Among the study's goals is to find factors that make human blood attractive to mosquitoes.    So far, the researchers have found that people with smelly feet are more likely to attract mosquitoes at night, especially when it is hot.    "Heat is a physical attraction for the mosqitoes, especially when the human body attains 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The mosquitoes particularly like the feet," Vincent said.    The mosquito trap has an entrance but no exit. So when the malaria-carrying insect enters, it can't leave.    Scientists hope to eradicate vast areas of mosquitoes, as was the case with tse-tse flies.    Recent World Health Organization figures indicate that from 1985 to 1989, between 12 million and 22 million people suffered from malaria each year in sub-Saharan Africa.-0-     Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Nigeria More Illegal Health Centres ClosedPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 24, 1996 (19960124)by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent      LAGOS, Nigeria - The Nigerian government has closed some 15 more illegal private health centres in an effort to rid the country of quacks.

Mandela announced after the meeting that he would be making immediate contact with Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini to ask him to hold a meeting of Zulu traditional leaders as soon as possible to arrange for the holding of the imbizo.    Mandela and Chief Buthelezi would also atttend the meeting.    The South African president described the meeting of the Zulu nation as "a matter of urgency." He said neither the ANC nor the IFP could settle the matter through armed warfare.    "Only negotiations between the respective peoples can bring about a solution," Mandela added.    The imbizo is expected to be the largest meeting ever held as part of the peace process in Kwazulu-Natal.    Monday's meeting followed another bloody weekend in which at least 40 people were killed in Kwazulu-Natal.-0-     Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Zambia Donors Tie Aid to Good Governance Panafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent       LUSAKA, Zambia - Swedish ambassador to Zambia Anders Johnson Tuesday in Lusaka reiterated Western donor demands that the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government of President Frederick Chiluba maintain "good governance" as a condition for development aid.    Johnson said that Sweden considered that a succesful implementation of Zambia's economic and democratic reforms required "decisive, bold and skilful political management" and wide support of the people.    "To muster and maintain such support, burdens as well as benefits have to be shared among population groups in a reasonably balanced manner..." said Johnson when he signed for his country's 27 million dollars aid package to help Zambia's socio-economic and democratic reform process.    In a specific reference to the current wrangle between Chiluba's government on the one hand and the opposition and other pressure groups on the other on the best mode of adopting the country's draft constitution, Johnson said that Zambia deserved a constitution that could stand the test of time.    He also said Sweden expected the government would undertake orderly preparations for and implementation of the scheduled local government and general elections this year.    Johnson said that there was need to allow a "vibrant" civil society and a free press which he said were all vital to ensuring enhancement of democratic values.    Political analysts understood Johnson's remarks as an indirect and polite rebuff to Chiluba's government which has insisted on passing the draft constitution by a parliament it dominates. This is contrary to popular demands that it be submitted to a national constituent assembly.    The government has opposed a proposed march in the capital by civil society groups Friday to press for demands that the draft constitution be  passed by a constituent assembly.    Chiluba said last Friday while opening the 1996 session of his MMD-dominated parliament that those agitating for a constituent assembly had "an axe to grind" with the government and that acceding to their demands would be tantamount to resorting to "jungle law" in the managment of national affairs.    Critics of Chiluba's stand on the adoption of the constitution have charged that the president intends to "hijack" the constitution by getting MMD members of parliament to pass controversial clauses in his favor.    The MMD has recommended in the constitution that only second-generation Zambians should contest the republican presidency.    This has been widely condemned as an attempt to bar former president Kenneth Kaunda, who had Malawian parents, from the polls. Kaunda plans to challenge Chiluba for the presidency.    Some sources supporting the government recently accused Kaunda of prevailing on the donor community to deny Chiluba aid if he insisted on maligning political opponents.    The Paris Club donor community which last December granted Zambia some 800 million dollars in aid said the funds would be disbursed only if the community were satisfied there was a commitment to "good governance" on the part of Chiluba's government, among other conditions.-0-     Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996United Nations and Somalia Boutros-Ghali Decries Political StalematePanafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent        UNITED NATIONS - An all-out civil war, which many feared would follow the withdrawal of the United Nations forces from Somalia, has so far been averted but the country remains volatile, UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said.    He said the situation in the country has been characterized by "political instability, inter-clan conflict, banditry and general lawlessness."    "The political situation in Somalia has been dominated by a debilitating stalemate for almost two years since the Somali faction leaders failed to honour their commitments in the Nairobi declaration of 24 March 1994," Boutros-Ghali said in his latest report on the country.    He said the stalemate had caused political leaders to focus on the development of regional administrative structures and a peaceful climate in their regions.    "It is unclear at this point whether such regional authorities will be formed in most of the regions in Somalia," he said, adding that a central governing authority was urgently needed to take charge of the country.    Boutros-Ghali said some Somali leaders believe serious progress toward national reconciliation would only be possible if Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid of the Somali National Alliance withdraws from Baidoa, which he captured Sept. 17.    The warlord should also to rescind his "unilateral proclamation of himself as 'president' of Somalia."    "Durable peace cannot be achieved in Somalia without a process of sufficiently broad-based consultations among the Somalis themselves," Boutros-Ghali said.    He said the U.N. security council might wish to reiterate its call for Somali parties to adopt this approach.    The secretary-general promised he would continue to maintain the Nairobi-based U.N. political office for Somalia so that it could continue its efforts to maintain and expand contacts with all Somali parties.    On the humanitarian front, he said the most urgent needs were food and essential health systems support, particularly immunization and measures to control the spread of epidemic diseases such as cholera.    "The low level of food production, continued political instability and other factors combine to make international assistance to somalia essential," he said.    He said U.N. agencies would continue their current programs in the country.    The U.N. Security Council, citing lack of progress in the Somali peace process, pulled its multi-national forces out of the country on March 31, 1994.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996South AfricaFuture Of Government of National Unity UncertainPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Lionel Williams, PANA Correspondent      CAPE TOWN, South Africa - South African President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) has said it is opposed to the continuation of a government of national unity after 1999.    The ANC said Tuesdays such a government would become an obstacle to multi-party democracy if it became a permanent feature.    The ANC was reacting to the weekend call by National Party leader and Deputy President F.W. de Klerk for the continuation of governement of national unity after the 1999 general election.    The ANC statement said the government of national unity had been conceived as a necessary element in  South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy. It had served the country well, paving the way for smooth political transition and laying the foundation for reconciliation.    But, said the ANC, multi-party democracy needed various political parties representing different political persuasions. While inter-party cooperation was a positive element, a forced coalition denied the majority political party the right to decide freely on how to pursue the best interests of the majority of the people.-0-     Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996United States and Africa Phoenix Hosts Expo On African Business In AprilPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Felix Njoku, PANA Staff Correspondent      DAKAR, Senegal - The city of Phoenix, Arizona, in the Southern United States will host a major conference on business, trade, investment and exposition on Africa in April, organisers said Tuesday.    According to a statement released to PANA the event, billed to attract prominent Africans and African-Americans, will be held at the Phoenix Civic Plazza April 10-13.

Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Zimbabwe Tall Tales of A Failed Joint Venture Panafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Tawona Tavengwa. PANA Correspondent      KADOMA, Zimbabwe - A casual visitor to the giant National Glass Company plant in the Central Zimbabwean town of Kadoma would think that the noise coming from within is that of production machines in full swing.    That certainly is not the case. The noise is only that of local maintenance workers servicing the plant and oiling the wheels while awaiting the international chamber of commerce (ICC) in Paris, France, to decide the fate of the 70-million-Zimdollar (7.8 million-U.S.dollar) plant.    The factory is at the centre of a legal wrangle between the government of Zimbabwe through its investment arm, the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), and its partner in the failed glass production joint venture, Romania's ROMSIT.    The company, hailed as the first undertaking of its kind in the 12-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC), was commissioned in 1990 by President Robert Mugabe amid much publicity.    Soon after that, it began facing serious financial and operational problems which led to its closure in 1993.    Most of these handicaps were centred around the production of unusable sheet glass which occurred for several months in succession.    When the local construction industry rejected the glass, the company stopped production and switched over to marketing imported Chinese glass.    This was meant to be a temporary move aimed at meeting the basic overheads while solutions to its problems were being sought. But it was a short-lived effort.    During the 1992/93 financial year National Glass incurred a loss of 41.4 million Zimdollars (4.6 million U.S. dollars) up from 19.4 million Zimdollars (2.2 million U.S. dollars) the previous year.    When the Zimbabwe government asked the Romanians to finance repair costs of the plant and to write off some loans, they refused.    This refusal sparked a wrangle which was taken to the Paris-based ICC in 1994 for arbitration.    The manner in which the IDC and ROMSIT now regard each other is a direct contrast to the warm and open relationship which characterized the early days of the venture.    During the early stages, 30 Zimbabweans were sent to Romania for specialized training in glass making.    Romanian consultants also came to the country in large numbers in an effort to transfer their expertise in glass making to locals.    All in all, the company employed about 180 locals and it was expected to produce 13,000 tons of glass sheet every year when local demand for such glass at the time was just between 8,000 and 9,000 tons.    This left a reasonable amount for export to SADC states, most of which were, like Zimbabwe, very excited about the venture.    "This represents typical technology transfer from Romania to Zimbabwe. We have many friends around the world who give us fish, but they do not want to teach us how to catch the fish. You have taught us how to catch the fish. We are very grateful," said Kumbirai Kangai, then minister of industry and commerce.    Today, government and IDC officials do not want to say much about the plant or the impending case for fear that any ill-advised statements may get to the ears of the Romanians, who will then use them in court when the Paris hearings finally commence.    In the meantime, a small staff of six remains at the plant, working as facilitators to the IDC's legal team in Paris.    Guards at the place confirmed that at one point just after the plant's closure, their services were terminated, leaving the place vulnerable to thieves.    Vital machine components were stolen during this period, prompting IDC management to order the re-engangement of the guards.    The joint venture's other major investments included a housing estate in Kadoma which consisted mainly of garden flats which were meant for its workers.    The sprawling estate, although now leased to a real estate agent, is also rotting like the glass plant, with signs of neglect all over.    Until the case is resolved, the houses will likely remain as they are, uncared for.    Meanwhile, the company, though long closed with very little prospects of ever being re-opened, still owes several companies, including the local authority about 1.3 million Zimdollars (144,440 U.S.dollars).    The authority recently took the matter to its lawyers and another legal wrangle might soon be in the local courts, an action that may jeopardize efforts to settle the original case in Paris.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BusinessKenya Dominates East African Tea Market Panafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)      NAIROBI, Kenya - The amount of tea offered at the Mombasa auction registered a 17-percent increase in 1995 to reach 173.7 million kilograms (382.14 million pounds).    According to the annual tea purchases report issued by the Africa Tea Brokers Limited, the amount was 25.7 million kilograms (56.54 million pounds) higher than the 148 million kilograms (325.6 million pounds) kilograms sold by the action in 1994.    The report shows that Lipton Limited topped the list of buyers with purchases of 27.8 million kilograms (61.16 million pounds) followed closely by Vanrees limited with 20.9 million kilograms (45.98 million pounds).    Kenya continued to dominate the Mombasa auction with 155.3 million kilograms (341.66 million pounds) of tea sold last year. Uganda folowed with 8.6 million kilograms (18.92 million pounds) and Tanzania with 6.52 million kilograms (143.44 million pounds).    For Uganda, this represented a two-percent drop from the 1994 figures and seven percent for Tanzania. Brokers were not able to establish reasons for the drop for both countries.    War-torn Rwanda which performed poorly in the 1994 season surprisingly recorded a 566-per-cent increase with 733,084 kilograms (1612.88 pounds) offered, an indication that farmers in the country were back to work after the bloody ethnic violence rocked the country in 1993 and 1994.    Neighboring Burundi also afflicted with ethnic violence, recorded a 37-per-cent increase with 1.7 million kilograms (3.74 million pounds) up from 624,000 kilograms (1,372,800 pounds) in 1994.    The sharpest drop of 94 percent was recorded by Malawi.    During last week's tea auction in Mombasa, Egypt and Pakistan registered strong interest in Kenyan tea joining traditional buyers such as United Kingdom. Sudan, Yemen and the Middle East nations are also showing interest in the auction.    But the prices of tea in the international market have been low due to a glut.    Tea is also facing stiff competition from soft drinks and other beverages forcing products to seek new strategies for promoting tea drinking. -0-    Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Nigeria Highway Toll CommercializedPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Paul Ejime PANA Staff Correspondent      LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's military government has raised fees payable by motorists using federal highways and contracted 25 companies to handle the toll collection as part of privatization of inefficient government agencies.    Works and housing minister Brig.Gen. Abdulkarim Adisa said in Lagos Monday the 100 percent increase covering the nation's 28 toll plazas comes into effect Feb. 1.    Trucks and luxury buses pay 50 naira as against 25 naira previously, while smaller vehicles have had their fee reduced from 10 to five naira (85 naira = 1 U.S. dollar).    The minister said the privatization was aimed at stemming "the high level" fraud that had characterized toll collection since 1978.    The ministry also hopes to draw on the efficiency of the private sector in toll collection, he added.    Only vehicles belonging to the armed forces, the police, road safety corps and other force services are exempt from paying toll.    However, Adisa stressed "it must be borne in mind that govenment remains the owner of all toll plazas and will continue to regulate and control their operation in order to maintain a healthy balance between the interest of the contractor operators and the public.    Until now, some govenrment workers regarded deployment to tollgates as a source of self-enrichment.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeSoccer: Tunisian Barred For Vulgar Language Panafrican News AgencyJanuary 25, 1996 (19960125)by Randy Zormelo, PANA Staff Correspondent      PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa - Tunisian Football Association Chairman Nasser Benhassine was barred Monday from the touchline and changing rooms for using foul language as a referee at the African Cup of Nations games taking place in South Africa.    Benhassine will therefore match the final Groupe D match between Tunisia and Ivory Coast Thursday from the enclosed private suite of the Boet Erasmus Stadium in Port Elizabeth.    He is accusecd of directing "vulgar and offensive" remarks at both the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and South African referee Petros Mathabela.    The incident occurred during the Ghana-Tunisia clash last Thursday when Benhassine lost his temper because of some decision taken by Mathabela in the match won 2-1 by Ghana.    Benhassine, who heads the Tunisian delegation to the tournament, later apologized for his outburt but insisted he was right in objecting.    "I am sure the referee's mistakes were unintentional and I am sorry about the comments. But at least on two occasions, he should have given us a penalty for foul play and he didn't", Benhassine told journalists.    He denied having sworn at Mathaebla or CAF officials.    "I did not swear at any stage. I told the referee that it was a shame he had officiated the game so badly," Benhassine said.    "And I told CAF officials that I thought they had a duty to respect nations and appoint referees who are capable of handling important matches such as these. I still can't understand why they appointed him," he said.    Journalists covering the matches in Port Elizabeth have criticized the poor officiating by referees.

Sources within the Burkinabe team disclosed Traore and Kikiema had not seen eye to eye since their team arrived in South Africa on Jan. 9.

In an interview last week, Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) Vice-President Rob Webb said prices had been on the upward trend since 1992/93, when theyfell drastically due to over-production in the major growing countries.   "The ZTA's position is that we should see an increase in prices compared with those achieved in the 1994/95 season considering that world stocks hav ebalanced and demand for our crop is high," Webb said.   Tobacco auctions are expected to open in April and run for over 20 weeks.   Last year, an average price of 13.80 Zimdollars per kg (then 1.73 USD) was paid, realising 2.336 billion ZD (then 292 million USD).   Webb said market intelligence showed demand would come from China, a huge producer and buyer of tobacco, where 1.7 billion kg had just been produced, down from the original forecast of 2.3 billion kg.   "So there is a shortage and we can confirm that the Chinese have come here in the last two months and placed firm orders with all the merchants," hesaid.   This year, Zimbabwe was expected to produce about 210 million kg of flue-cured tobacco, slightly up from the 198 million kg sold last season.   Webb said the tobacco crop was looking good and growers were headed for a bumper season provided the current wet weather persists for another eight weeks.   Meanwhile, Webb said Brazil and Zimbabwe - the world's leading producers of flue-cured tobacco - were calling for a fair price for their crop,particularly from leading manufacturers.   He said although the two countries were the two most expensive producers, they nevertheless grew a quality crop without subsidies, unlike farmers in the United States and Europe.   "We are trying to talk to each other about the price we should be receiving from manufacturers and merchants. Our basic message to Brazilian growers is that we should not expect to be paid third world prices," Webb, who recentlY returned from a marketing trip to Brazil, said.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Science, Medicine and TechnologyGermany Agrees To Destroy Zambia's Toxic WastePanafrican News AgencyJanuary 15, 1996 (19960115)by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent   LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia and Germany have signed a one-million-U.S.-dollar contract for Germany to destroy 300 tonnes of expired pesticides that have been accumulating in an agricultural depot inthe Zambian capital, Lusaka, since 1984.   Environmental Council of Zambia Director James Phiri said Sunday that the agreement had also been sponsored by the local office of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, the FAO.   Zambia lacks the technology to clean up the mess and has sought Germany's help.   Phiri said that the consignment would be shipped through Tanzania. Zambia has already sought Tanzanian permission for the transportation of thechemicals.   The United Nations based Convention on Toxic Materials all but bans its transportation across borders. However, it allows countries without the appropriate technology to contract others to destroy the toxins.   Special conditions are needed for transport. These include tight packaging to avoid leakage. However, completely banded is the dumping of the waste by developed countries in undeveloped states.   Zambia is reported to have substantial amounts of dangerous agricultural waste pesticides, particularly in the countryside. The government said earlyi n 1996 that it would take an inventory of the materials and collect it for destruction outside the country.   Zambia's deputy agriculture minister, Gibson Nkausu, had estimated that thejob could cost some four miliion dollars.   Nkausu warned then that government would, in future, surcharge agricultura lchemical dealers and users, apart from imposing statutory fines for flouting environment laws in handling their merchandise.   The latest "state of the environment report" released last week by the Environment Council of Zambia said that commercial farmers in the country used more fertilisers, on average, than those in other sub-Sahara African countries.   According to the report, Zambian farmers used some 450,000 metric tonnes of agricultural chemicals during the 1992/93 farming season compared to 150,000 tonnes consumed two decades ago.   Environment officials attributed the increased consumption rate to government's own promotion campaign of the agricultural industry since the 1970s to help attain national food self-sufficiency.   The report noted that the use of chemicals had also contributed to soil acidity in areas and poisoning of some water catchments.   Zambia imports almost 90 percent of the country's chemical requirements for agricultural and health purposes and it is estimated that 200 different pesticide trade names are currently in use.   Zambia's environment council has said that lack of legislation on the importation of the chemicals had sometimes led banned pesticides coming into the country, thereby endangering environment, man and animal.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Science, Medicine and TechnologyDonors to Fund Africa's Anti-Onchocercosis ProjectPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 17, 1996 (19960117)by Mbakou, PANA Correspondent   BRAZZAVILLE, Congo - The Africa Regional Director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Ebrahim Samba says he has convinced donors to continue financing the continent's anti-onchocercosis programme until theyear 2007.

Health and Food Administration officials have issued a warning that Nigerians risk contracting cancer through eating bread.   At the centre of the controversy is a chemical known as "potassium bromate,"which bakers use in the treatment of flour.   Nigeria's Food and Drug Administration agency was the first to raise an alarm on the chemical. The health warning is now echoed by the standard organisation of nigeria.   Negotiations between the organisation and the Flour Millers Association is said to have broken down, with the warning from the organisation it might be forced to close down flour mills that fail to stop the use of the dangerous chemical.   The millers are asking for a grace period of between six months and one year to phase out the use of the chemical.   But the Director-General of the association Joseph Abalaka says this is too long and unacceptable, adding that an alternative, ascorbic acid, is available.   He says "we cannot afford to risk the lives of Nigerians by allowing another six months of grace for the injection of cancer-causing agent."   PANA has learnt that another round of negotiation has been called to end the deadlock.   Despite being more expensive, some Nigerians say they cannot do withoutb read. The mills closure would unleash scarcity and make the commodity even more expensive.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BusinessKenyan Government Reduces Share In National BankPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 16, 1996 (29960116)   NAIROBI, Kenya - The Kenya government is to offload another 20 percent of its shareholding in the National Bank of Kenya later in 1996.   The Government had in October 1994 sold 40 million shilings worth of its shares in a public share issue that was overubscribed three times.   The shares were sold for 10 shillings each for a minimum of 500. [56.02Shillings = 1 USD].   The share price has since appreciated reaching 31 shillings a share in the last 12 months.   After the floatation, the government will have 22 percent stake and the public 40 per cent.   The National Social Security Fund will have 37.5 percent stake in the bank.   The bank's Executive Chairman, John Simba, said its profit jumped from 429.2 million shillings in 1994 to 633.3 million shillings in 1995.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BusinessGabon Secures 77 million Dollars Loan from ADBPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 16, 1996 (19960116)   DAKAR, Senegal - The Board of Directors of the African Development Bank (ADB), has approved a loan amounting to 53 million UA (about 77 million dollars) for the funding of a major road project in the central African state of Gabon.   The amount, mobilised from the resources of the bank's soft loan affiliate, the African Development Fund (ADF), carries a variable interest rate and is repayable within 15 years after a 5-year grace period, the ADB said in a statement.   It involves rehabilitation of the Franceville-Laleyou road and the upgrading and surfacing of another stretch between Laleyou and Lastoursville in the south-eastern part of the country.   The project forms part of the bank's development strategy in Gabon which aims at diversification of the economic sector through promotion of agriculture, industry, commerce and tourism.   The ADB has so far undertaken 25 operations in Gabon at a total cost of 528.9 million UA (about 808 million dollars), in 21 projects, two structural adjustment schemes and studies.   Initiated in 1963, the resources of the Abidjan-based bank is currently estimated at some 33 million dollars.   The bank group is owned by 52 African governments and 25 non-African countries.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Science, Medicine and TechnologyTraditional Medicine Becoming Popular in ZimbabwePanafrican News AgencyJanuary 17, 1996 (19960117)   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - High medical fees and the rising cost of drugsare forcing many Zimbabweans to resort to traditional medicine, which in the past was regarded as primitive.   A combined traditional and conventional medical clinic, which started as a nexperiment soon after independence in 1980, reported an upsurge in the number of people seeking treatment in 1995.   In an interview here, founder member and co-ordinator of the clinic, Barbar aSibanda, said 1995 was a busy year as patients, whose ailments modern medicine would have failed to cure, took to the clinic whose charges were lower than other health institutions.   "Though I cannot give figures, the workload was more than what we expected.A lot more people are now aware of our services which have produced goodr esults," said Sibanda.   The clinic, which pioneered the use of traditional herbs and modern medicine under one roof, has since opened a 20-bed maternity wing and a rural clinic in Chief Sigola's area in Matebeleland, South Western Zimbabwe.   Patients have the choice of being treated by a medical doctor or traditional healers.   Sibanda said the experiment had over the years proved that the two systems could be integrated to treat difficult diseases like mental illness, cancer, infertility and reversal of symptoms of the deadly AIDS.   "Since we opened, we have never recorded any deaths of patients during the course of treatment. Our success rate rate is almost 100 percent," she said.   Dumezweni Sidambe, who heads the traditional section, which includes mid-wives, said infertility was a growing problem among young couples.   He attributed it to over use of contraceptives at an early age, saying by the time they decided to have children, damage would have set in.   "We have assisted hundreds of couples whose marriages were on the verge of breakdown to have children. Although we cannot claim to cure aids, we can safely reverse the symptoms," said sidambe.   Sibanda said the clinic also ran a spiritual/faith healing section to cater for Christian believers and a free health advisory service.   "We also have plans to open a herbal pharmacy and add a theatre to our maternity wing," said Sibanda.-0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeWeekly Press ReviewPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 5, 1996 (19960105)by Olu Sarr, PANA Staff Correspondent   DAKAR, Senegal - Nigeria's withdrawal from Africa Cup and Yemen's "war" with Eritrea were among the most important editorials in the African press since the New Year started.   The privately-owned Lagos newspaper, The Guardian, gave several reasons for Nigeria's demands for security guarantees for its players but also pointed to the path Abuja should take with regards to Nigeria's participation in the tournament.    "No responsible government would expose its citizens to clear and present dangers over which it has been forewarned,"itsaid.   For example, it said, since the Munich massacre of its athletes in 1972, Israel "has constantly"asked for such guarantee.    No government, it said, could legislate against snippers and going to South Africa would amount to taking risks.    "But what is wrong with that against the pledge by South Africa? We ought to take South Africa for her words for such guarantee would oblige her government to bend over backwards to guarantee the safety of Nigerians,"it said.    By withdrawing from South Africa '96, the government has also shown that "it no longer feels safe"in the world.     "That this is even happening to us in Africa makes itall the more shameful and worrisome. This is why South Africa '96 ought to provide an opportunity for some soul-searching,"itsaid.   It wondered why Nigeria had become so unwanted. Why this nation, which used to be touted as "The Giant of Africa,"now felt so unsafe even within the continent ?.    "The solution to all this is for the government to urgently take steps that will bring it back to the internationa lcommunity, it said.    "The government should consider rescinding the withdrawal because our participation offers opportunities for Nigeria and South Africa to move closer to understanding and rapprochement on the diplomatic front. The implications of ourwithdrawal are not in our interest."   This view was shared by another privately-owned Lagos daily, the Vanguard.    "If the point government wants to make is about the safety of our players, we believe it has been made and the South African authorities, CAF and FIFA have taken notices of it.    "The logical thing now is for us to be in South Africa,so that the Super Eagles can fly the nation's banner as the continent's defending champions,"it said.    In Addis Ababa The Monitor commented on the insecurity in the Horn of Africa, the most recent example being the two-day battle between Eritrean and Yemeni forces on the Hanish Islands.    "Unless urgently settled the recent Asmara-Sanaa controversy has the potential to degenerate into a large-scale crisis involving other intra as well as extra regional actors,"it said. "And this must not be allowed to happen under any circumstance."   It warned: "Once a minor conflict goes out of control,the price that would be paid to restore the equilibrium would be extremely painful. Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia should serve as living reminders that there is no dividend to be reaped from aconflict."   Dakar's Sud Quotidien focused its attention on the change of prime minister made by Mauritania President Maouya Ould Taya. He got rid of the youthful Sidi Mohammed Ould Boubacar for Cheikh Alavia Ould Mohamed Khouna.    Why?    "To prepare better for the next elections,"it said.    Another reason, it said, was because of the recent poor relations between Libya and Mauritania: Ould Boubacar is considered a Libyan sympathiser and an adherent of Kadaffi's Green Book.    Ould Boubacar's departure became imminent, it said, when his potential rival and former Interior Minister Lemrabott Ould Sidi Mahmoud, returned to government.    Behind all this, it said, was Taya's wish to balance the power among the regions of the country. The appointment of a native of the Eastern Region as prime minister replacing one from the Central Region, it said, was "a clear demonstration of this."   The Eastern Regions, the most populated parts of thecountry, voted largely for Taya during the 1992 presidential elections. But it noted that the electorate here, in part, joine dthe opposition during the municipal elections of 1995. This shift and the gains by the opposition in the strategic region, it said, explained Taya's choice.     Notwithstanding the effort to appease voters in the east, it said "few changes are expected in the current cabinet so as not to frustrate"other communities. Three months after being unbanned by Nigerian military rulers, the National Concord newspaper of detained millionaire-politician, Moshood Abiola, returned to the newsstands Tuesday.    In a front page editorial entitled "A New Start, A New Resolve,"the Concord said it was returning to the newsstands as a "beneficiary of an official reprieve of sorts." The daily said that it had been banned for 18 months along with other titles of the Concord Press "without reason and without recourse to the due process of law."   Saying it was glad to rejoin the "front ranks of the Nigerian press,"the Concord, however, said it did not "regard the unbanning as a special favour to be reciprocated with a show of remorse and contriction, but as belated undoing of what should not have been done in the first place."   In its 15 years of existence, the paper said, it had"consistently championed the ideals of a free and responsible press".    Nigeria, it said, needed to make rapid progress toward democracy.    "The fundamental truth,"it said "is that without democracy, there can be no self-actualisation of the citizens, no public accountability, no good government and, ultimately no meaningful development."-0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996BusinessInstitute Prepares Code for Zimbabwean CompaniesPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 2, 1996 (19960102)   HARARE, Zimbabwe - To improve corporate governance of Zimbabwean companies, the country's Institute of Directors (IOD) plans to introduce and enforce an acceptable code of conduct.     The IOD is a non-profit, voluntary body established to promote excellence, enterprise and integrity in directors of companies.   IOD's Executive Director, John Dittrich said Tuesday his group would work with such organisations as the Zimbabwe stock exchange to promote good business ethics in line with international trends.   "We want to promote the establishment of audit committees to ensure that management is cultivating good ethics," Dittrich told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency.     He said the IOD would study far-reaching recommendations made in the United Kingdom by the Cadbury report, which called for more transparency in the running of publicly quoted companies.     "As we progress, there is going to be greater awareness of the real responsibilities of a director: to make them understand that it's not just a question of sitting on a board of a company," Dittrich said.     Executive or non-executive directors, he said, had to appreciate the problems and future plans of the companies on whose boards they sat, and be seen to be making meaningful contributions.     Dittrich said among other strategies to improve corporate governance, the iod would hold a series of seminars and conferences where a wide range of issues about running a company would be discussed.     "We are not an examining body, but one of the features of our activities during 1996 will be in the area of training and seminars to inform people in business about their responsibilities."    He said the IOD would also during the year broaden its membership base so as to achieve a large and diversified membership of the institute and try to achieve effective representation of directors' views to government and other regulatory bodies as well as the business community.     "We want to demonstrate that we are providing members with the services that they need and, in that regard, developing our relationship with government ministries will encourage people to join the iod because they can derive some benefit from such membership,"Dittrich said.     The institute would also consult and make representations to government on matters affecting the Zimbabwean business companies particularly during annual pre-budget meetings with the Ministry of Finance.  -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996CameroonBiya Expresses HopePanafrican News AgencyJanuary 2, 1996 (19960102)   YAOUNDE, Cameroon - The Cameroonian President Paul Biya has expressed satisfaction over economic progress made by his country during the year 1995.     "After several years of recession, Cameroon is back on the road to growth"with a 3.3 per cent rate, Biya said in an address to the Cameroonian nation on national radio and television.     Cameroon, like the other countries in Africa's Franc Zone, had a 50 per cent devaluation of its currency in Januray 1994.     Biya said the devaluation had led to some recovery and state revenues had risen to 45 billion f cfa in 1995 as against 17 billion cfa the previous year (1$ US =480 cfa).     The liberalisation of the economy, he said, had made it possible for a positive trade balance.  Biya said there had also been a a 13 per cent increase in foreign investments in the country.     He reiterated his willingness to continue +the ruthless war"initiated in June 1995 against customs fraud and sabotage of the national economy.     "If recovery efforts proceed normally, the year 1996 will enable Cameroonians to see, at last, the end of the economic crisis,"Biya said.  -0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Africa-at-LargeLesotho Banker to Represent the World Bank at UNPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 2, 1996 (19960102)   DAKAR, Senegal - Lesotho's Timothy Thahane, a loser in the bid to succeed Babacar Ndiaye at the the African Development Bank (ADB) in Cote d'Ivoire, started work Monday as vice-president for the World Bank's relations with the United Nations.

According to Zambia's central bank statistics published Tuesday, Zambia had USD 257 million last October but this fell to USD 219.296 the following month.     Central bank officials said in Lusaka Tuesday that December figures were not yet computed.     Debt serving over the same period increased to USD 34.million for November from USD 16 million the previous month.     Zambia is to import an estimated 1,000,000 tonnes of famine relief maize to meet the shortfall caused by several dry seasons.     The country has an external debt of USD 6 billion dollars and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last December granted it some USD 850 million as balance of payments support, debt servicing and project and goods and services financing for 1996.   The Paris Club donors have said however that disbursement of the funds is dependent on Zambia's "good-governance"record and continued adherence to a harsh structural adjustment programme.   Most Zambians, whose standard of living has been adversely affected by a general economic decline, blame the programme for their current economic hardships.  -0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZimbabweIndustrialists Express Economic WorriesPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 2, 1996 (19960102)   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - Industrialists in western Zimbabwe on Tuesday said business confidence was at its lowest level in years and warned of job losses as companies struggle to survive the country's harsh economic climate.   "From an employment view point, its sheer gloom and despondency. There is so much de-industrialisation and I see more retrenchmenzs,"said Mr. Harding, a member of the Matabeleland Chamber of Industries (MCI's) labour committee. He said in an interview all of Zimbabwe's economic indicators were negative with many companies holding huge stocks because of depressed domestic demand and less competitive exports.     Several companies in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, were liquidated or forced to retrench staff last year due to a lack of export incentives, high interest rates and a decline in profitability.   At least 10 companies in the region had either closed down, downsized or relocated to other places, according to the MCI. Most companies which had seen their competitiveness eroded by high wage costs would continue retrenching, cutting part time jobs and overtime pay, compelling consumers to tighten their purse strings further to cope with negative growth in real incomes, Harding said.   He said it was unlikely retrenched workers would be rehired since companies would be trying to produce cost-effectively.     "The low corporate productivity thus reduces the government's revenue base," he said. He predicted a trend, by cash-strapped workers, to press demands for better wages and salaries commensurate with the high cost of living.     The problem was that current high rates of inflation were built into production costs, putting basic products beyond the reach of many people.   Harding said although Zimbabwe's rainfall pattern had been favourable, there was uncertainty on whether more rains would last for some time to sustain fragile recovery underway. "Besides, even if we have good rains, the economic effect would be felt around october or November,"he said.   The MCI warned that unless measures were undertaken to encourage both domestic and foreign investment, the country could be "turned into a nation of shopkeepers rather than manufacturers".  -0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996MozambiqueMore State Firms to be PrivatisedPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 2, 1996 (19960102)   MAPUTO, Mozambique - As part of the privatisation process in Mozambique, the government is selling 80 per cent of the share capital of a state company specialising in cold storage and air conditioning systems.     The company, Enafrio, has been valued at USD 1.6 million. It currently employs 144 workers and is the only company of its kind in Mozambique.     Among other state companies coming up for privatisation soon are the tea-processing company (Emocha), and the farm implement factory (Agro-Alfa).   The shipyard at the central port city of Beira and Hidraulica de Maputo, a company specialising in irrigation systems and civil construction, will also be sold in the near future.     However, the most important privatisation this year will be the sale of 51 per cent of the share capital of the national commercial bank. This will be the first privatisation of a state-owned bank in Mozambique and could happen in June.   Since 1992, the Mozambican state has sold nealy 550 companies. Forty-five of these were large companies and included the country's cement factory and brewerries.

Three decades of civil war, starting with the anti-colonial struggle, caused so much environmental degradation that no Angolan can claim to have escaped from its effects.    Angola's Director of Environment, Joao Da Costa Vintem, said in an interview with PANA recently that although the country is vast with a small population of about 10 million, many people have moved to urban centers, mostly located in fragile coastal lands.    "Most of the war-displaced people moved to Luanda, Benguela or Lobito, slashing trees in the surrounding areas for fuel or to create plots for cultivation," he added.    Vintem said these activities have further helped the northward advance of the Namib desert, which occupies a large portion of neighboring Namibia's territory.    The rural-urban exodus, Vintem said, has more than trippled the populations of Angolan towns including Luanda, the capital, which was originally meant to host 500,000 people.    "The huge population inflow has led to the destruction of most public amenities, especially urban water supply and sanitation systems. Solid and liquid wastes abound everywhere causing endemic diseases like diarrhea and cholera as well as malaria," he said.    Vintem hopes that the Nov. 20, 1994 Lusaka peace accord between the government and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, will soon be fully implemented "so that people can return to their natural sites after the removal of mines, the greatest environmental hazard in rural areas."    Enormous environmental degradation has also occured in diamond mining areas which are now full of pits.    "Mining companies also diverted water from rivers leaving the population without water, especially in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sud," he said.    The Angolan Environment director said discussions were underway to ensure that the mining companies involved take part in efforts to restore the environment.    "The government has to find a way of ending the anarchy reigning in the mining area since the removal of restrictions on people to enter the area which existed under the former one party rule," added the director.    As a major off-shore oil producer, Angola also suffers from oil spills in its coastal waters, endangering the once abundant fish there.    The shores off the oil-rich Cabinda enclave has been so polluted that government had to ask the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company to help in cleaning up operations. The oil company has appointed a Swiss firm, which has taken water samples from the polluted sea coast.    To reverse these dangerous trends, the Department of Environment has asked the government to include an environment national plan of action among its priorities when negotiating with aid donors, the first of whose meeting took place in Brussels last September.    Vintem said approaches had also been made to the World Bank to finance feasibilities for an environment protection code and the creation of an environment information center.    "I know that government's priority will be the reconstruction of destroyed cities like Huambo, Kuito and others. But locally sourcing environment funds is important because the environment forms the basis for sustainable development," he concluded. -0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Science, Medicine and TechnologyInternational Congress Set for March Panafrican News AgencyJanuary 1, 1996 (19960101)   DAKAR, Senegal - The International Association for Water Laws will hold its sixth Congress March  21-22 in Paris, France, during which a wide-ranging debate on the management of water resources is expected.

The Conservation News Service from the World Wildlife Fund has said "about 350 elephants destroyed 285 hectares of crops belonging to 516 families" in Cameroon in 1995.     Quoting Dourga Albert, a wildlife chief forest warden in Cameroon, the journal said the damage affected not less than 3 127 people, directly.     In a report for the WWF, John Nchami Tafor, said there were some 20 000 elephants in Cameroon.     About 2 000 elephants (Loxondonia Africana Africana) live in northern Cameroon's dry savannah. They are essentialy gathered in the Waza and Kalamaloue national parks. The others (Loxondonia Africana Cyclotis) spread into southern Cameroon's thick tropical forests.     Relations between human beings and elephants are particularly strained in the dry savannah, where the situation has worsened in the last five years, says the WWF.     In July 1992, said WWf, 320 marauding elephants destroyed 5 000 hectares of crops. This was at a time of drought and poor food security.     Some 22 000 people suffered from the starvation that followed.     Between May and November 1993, a large herd of some 850 elephants destroyed 1 700 hectares of millet and cotton in Mayor Kani and Mayor Louti districts in the north, leading to further harm to peasant incoomes.     Between May and September 1994, 400 to 500 elephants destroyed millet and cotton throughout the country.     A lack of food and water is the main source of the conflict between human settlements and the elephants, the WWF says.    It says a full grown elephant needs some 140 kgs of food (grasses, leaves, fruits, roots, bark) daily. It also drinks 100 litres of water daily and can move up to 30 kms just for a cold bath.     As farms and tourist camps take over their places, Cameroon's elephants are turning to crops to feed themselves.         Experts say the number of elephants in Cameroon has increased due to the country's adoption, reluctantly, of a global ban on trade in ivory in 1989.     "When they migrate, elephants follow a precise direction. If they find crops on their way they destroy them" says Hillaire Manga, a wildlife department head in northern Cameroon.  -0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire)Collaborative Study Launched on EbolaPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 3, 1996 (19960103)   DAKAR, Senegal - After the discovery of an Ebola patient in Cote d'Ivoire recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a two-year study aimed at identifying the natural host reservoir of the deadly virus in that country.   The study will involve representatives of virtually every laboratory facility in the world "that is capable to safely handling the Ebola virus for study," says the U.N health agency in a news release.    A team of researchers will concentrate their efforts on Tai forest where a new sub-type of the Ebola virus was isolated from a Swiss primate researcher thought to have been infected in late 1994 while performing an autopsy on a dead chimpanzee from which the same Ebola sub-type was isolated.   "The Tai forest of Cote d'Ivoire is considered to be a more conducive site for such investigation, as it is a well defined ecosystem that has been extensively studied and one where the disease is known to be present," the WHO release said.    The new study group will base their initial investigation on the research by the Swiss-Ivorian ethology team of which the infected researcher was a member.    "The focus of investigation is the relationship among primates, other vertebrates, anthropods and perhaps human beings in the region of the Tai forest," said the WHO press release.  Among the closest contacts of the chimpanzees are Colobus monkeys, which serve as a major food source for the chimpanzees, it added.    The 12-member informal working group involved in the study held its first meeting Dec. 15, 1995.The meeting was also attended by seven WHO professionals, including four from headquarters and three from the African region.   Among the Africans in the research team are Dr Deogratias Barakamfitiye and Dr Kadri Tankari from the Brazzaville-based Africa Regional Office. These were involved in another study on the Ebola virus, which killed at least 250 people in Kikwit, Zaire between April and June 1995.The findings are not yet out.    The Ebola virus is one of the most pathogenic viral agents known to man, causing death in 80 percent or more of infected cases.    The World Health Organization said last year that it wilL hold an international symposium in Kinshasa, Zaire in March on the Ebola virus and the haemorrhagic fever it causes. -0-Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996ZimbabweOver 150 People Regain SightPanafrican News AgencyJanuary 3, 1996 (19960103)   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Over 150 residents of Gokwe in Zimbabwe's Midlands Province suffering from various eye disorders had their eye sight restored during a Raleigh International expedition between October and December 1995.   In a report on Tuesday chronicling its 10-week programme of projects throughout Zimbabwe, Raleigh said one of the highlights of the expedition was organising an eye camp in the Gokwe area in which 156 patients with cataracts and other eye disorders had their eye sight restored, often after years of blindness.   A further 6,137 people in the area underwent tests to determine the degree of eye sight loss.    The free eye operations and tests were conducted in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, Council For The Blind and the American-based Charity See International.    The expedition, which was Raleigh International's 13th to Zimbabwe comprised 10 projects and 108 participants from Britain, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore and Zimbabwe.   Other projects undertaken included the building of a fire tower at the Chilojo cliffs, Gonarezhou national park, to provide early warning of damaging bush fires.   With funding from the British High Commission, Raleigh International started the construction of an accommodation block for 28 elderly residents of the Zimbabwe New Hope Home at Gatsi in the Honde valley.    The participants also built two new pans and repaired seven bore hole pump houses providing water supplies to wildlife in the Hwange National Park in Western Zimbabwe. -0- Back to Headline List CopyrightAFRICA NEWS ON-LINE via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996NigeriaDoctor Researching a Male ContraceptivePanafrican News AgencyJanuary 3, 1996 (19960103)by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent   LAGOS, Nigeria - A Nigerian doctor Nnaemeka Amobi and his British counterpart Christopher Smith, both of the London King's College, are on the threshold of a scientific breakthrough in the development of male contraceptive.   According to a recent issue of the "new scientist' magazine, the research of the two physiologists on the unusual side-effects associated with two drugs --phenoxybenzamine used in the treatment of high blood pressure and thioridazine for schizophrenia -- has proved beneficial.   It is common knowledge in medical circles that both drugs prevent ejaculation, although men who take them still experience orgasms.    But their side-effects such as drowsiness had made the drugs unsuitable for prescription as contraceptives for men.    The research by Amobi and Smith showed that the drugs prevent ejaculation by "temporarily paralysing the sperm duct muscles" responsible for transporting sperm from the testes to the penis," the magazine said.    The two doctors were quoted as saying the research finding could result in a safe male contraceptive pill.    They say unlike the female version, the male pill could be taken as and when required.    Smith believes the "discovery opens up a new category of contraceptive. It gives rise to the first chemical vasectomy because the drugs can control the duct using a pincer movement."    Amobi agrees, saying the discovery would be of great benefit to developing countries in their quest for effective population control measures.    Above all, he said, "vasectomies are regarded with great suspicion," in the this part of the world. -0- Back to Headline List WT03-B03-6IA086-000615-B046-22http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it112.html 205.156.212.5 19970122021726 text/html 39707HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:15:30 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:47 GMTContent-length: 39520Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it112.html Sample Issue Copyright ANDEAN GROUP REPORT via NewsNet August 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES PERU: PERUVIANS DISAPPOINTED BY THEIR LIMITED STAKE IN TELEFONICA SHARES placement (449 words) ECUADOR: POLITICS: BALANCING BANKERS AND INDIANS: BUCARAM WILL HAVE TO DEVELOP SKILFUL POLITICAL JUGGLING ACT (845 words) COLOMBIA: PRIVATISATION: FURTHER DELAYS FUEL DOUBTS: 'LACK OF POLITICAL WILL' HALTS US Dollars 731M ASSET SELL-OFF (745 words) REGION: FOCUS: HOW GOOD A GUIDE ARE 'THE MARKETS'?: HEADLINES CROWD OUT DEEPER ANDEAN TRENDS (987 words) VENEZUELA: PRIVATISATION: PETKOFF PLEDGES POLITICAL WILL: AFTER SEVERAL FALSE STARTS, SELL-OFF SHOULD SPEED UP (1388 words) COLOMBIA: VIOLENCE: POLICE ACCUSED OF EXECUTING SUSPECTS: AND CONTRACT KILLING RAISES 'COLOMBIANISATION' FEARS (505 words) REGION: POSTSCRIPT (898 words) CopyrightANDEAN GROUP REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 1, 1996 PERU: PERUVIANS DISAPPOINTED BY THEIR LIMITED STAKE IN TELEFONICA SHARES placement The Peruvian government had no hesitation in acclaiming the placement of Telefonica del Peru shares on the New York stock exchange at the beginning of the month as an unqualified success. The domestic sale of shares was also over-subscribed, though as an exercise in 'popular capitalism', it was a bit of a let-down. The 23.5% holding that the government put up for sale raised a total of US Dollars 1.1bn, US Dollars 918m of it in New York, snapped up by around 500 institutional investors. It was, as the Financial Times noted, the first big test for Latin American equities since the Mexican devaluation crisis at the end of 1994, and Peru came through it with flying colours. The international offering was oversubscribed by five times, even though the Peruvian economy had been faltering recently -presumably because prospects for second-half growth are generally reckoned to be good. The domestic offering was equally successful, with about 263,000 people applying for US Dollars 323m worth of shares, payable in instalments, under the much-hyped 'citizen's participation' scheme. But the international demand was so great that many small Peruvian applicants were cut out at the last minute, when it was decided to halve  their allocation, to only US Dollars 148m. So much for the aim of broadly-based, share-owning democracy. The ombudsman (defensor del pueblo), Jorge Santisteban, called for 'greater transparency' with future 'citizen's participation' offers. In an attempt to repair some of the damage, President Alberto Fujimori announced on 11 July the sale of 3% of the shares still in state hands on the domestic market. That will leave the government with only 2%. Like CANTV in Venezuela (see Page 6, inside), Telefonica has a monopoly of conventional telephony until the end of the century, and it has big expansion programmes under way, with investments totalling US Dollars 1.6bn by 1998. But, unlike its Venezuelan counterpart, Telefonica is the country's biggest company, and is likely to remain so until the Camisea natural gas project comes on stream. The Peruvian government hopes the Telefonica exercise, coming hard on the heels of the letter of intent accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will usher in a run of international successes for Peru. This should culminate in a Brady debt-rescheduling deal before the end of the year, which could reduce Peru's US Dollars 10bn commercial bank debt by about half. First come talks with the Paris Club on Peru's US Dollars 9.65bn bilateral debt, beginning in mid-July. The team led by economy minister Jorge Camet hopes that Peru will secure as favourable treatment as Russia earlier this year, including rescheduling of payments over 20-25 years.Back to Headline List CopyrightANDEAN GROUP REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 1, 1996 ECUADOR: POLITICS: BALANCING BANKERS AND INDIANS: BUCARAM WILL HAVE TO DEVELOP  SKILFUL POLITICAL JUGGLING ACT President-elect Abdala Bucaram announced a few days after his election on 7 July that he would be flying to New York before his inauguration (10 August) to reassure bankers and business leaders about his intentions. This was probably a wise move, as his pre-election rhetoric about smashing the oligarchy and governing for the poor had caused a certain amount of unease in those spheres. The presence of a trio of bankers in his economic team (see WR-96-28) was expected to reassure his US audiences. And Bucaram adviser Jose Miguel Salem promised laws to encourage foreign capital to stay in the country and to attract new investors. But all this courting of the private sector raises the problem of balancing reassurance, on the one hand, with the expectations of Bucaram's other supporters, and particularly the increasingly assertive Indian movement, on the other. Decisive factor. All observers agree that the active or tacit support of the Indian organisations that backed Freddy Ehlers' candidacy in the first round (see WR-96-19 & RA-96-04) was a decisive factor in Bucaram's run-off victory. Indian leaders such as Luis Macas, president of the Confederacion de Nacionalidades Indigenas del Ecuador (Conaie) and deputy-elect for Nuevo Pais-Pachakutik, have made clear their view that they have earned a voice in the new administration commensurate with their growing political importance. Both Bucaram and Jaime Nebot had seemed to favour the idea of Macas being elected chairman of the 82-seat congress, but that prospect appeared to recede in the wake of the second-round voting. 'We have decided not to make a pact with any party, but to wait and see what those parties will do and what their relations with the government will be, as we intend to maintain Nuevo Pais's independence,' said another Indian leader, Jose Maria Cabascango, on 11 July. Macas said just before the second round: 'Nebot and Bucaram represent two economic power groups disputing political power, to consolidate their hegemony. They have never identified with our struggles or our proposals in the past; on the contrary, they dismissed and suppressed them.' New political style. Conaie and other Indian organisations, such as the Organizacion de Pueblos Indigenas del Pastaza (Opip), have developed a distinctive political style, combining mainstream left-wing causes, such as state-ownership of 'strategic' sectors of the economy, with cultural and social aspirations, such as the preservation of local self-government and resistance to the impact of economic development in the Oriente jungles. This complex political articulation of highland and jungle interests adds to the instability of Ecuador's party structure, as it creates new possibilities for circumstantial alliances and splits with other organisations, and greatly increases the fragmentation of the centre-left segment of the Ecuadorean political spectrum, which accounts for about a third of the seats in the new congress (see box). Environmental issues. These factors were reflected in Ehlers' insistence on the importance of traditional Indian values in his election campaign, and particularly on environmental issues, which coincided with the viewpoints of middle-class ecological organisations. And the concepts of multi-culturalism and multi-ethnicity have become the common currency of political debate in Ecuador, with even the right-wing Nebot paying lip-service to such ideas. Two new oil-related projects have already met with fierce Indian resistance. Opip complained in late June that a contract with the US company Arco to build a 165km feeder pipeline through Indian lands had been signed behind their backs; and the Huaorani ethnic group protested in mid-July that the drilling by a three-company consortium of a well with potential production of 2,200 barrels per day in their territory would exacerbate the inflow of settlers on to their lands. The Huaoranis threatened to take the law into their own hands unless the government acted to remove the 5,000 colonos already there. SPECIAL REPORT ON INDIANS We predicted as long ago as 1994 that Ecuador's increasingly assertive Indian organisations would soon assume a more important political role, and would become a factor to reckon with in decisions on the Oriente oil industry. See our Special Report, Indians: New Factor on the Latin American Scene, June 1994. COSTING THE PLEDGES Economist Jaime Zeas has attempted to cost the various spending promises made by Bucaram during the election campaign. He concluded that they would imply expenditure of US Dollars 2.35bn, or almost two-thirds of the 1996 budget of US Dollars 3.7bn. The most expensive items would be: Construction of 6,000km of local roads (US Dollars 450m); Increases in teachers' salaries and in the health and police budgets (US Dollars 422m each); Extension of social security coverage to family members (US Dollars 407m); Creation of banks for coffee, cacao, handicrafts, small industries and foreign trade, plus a ministry for Indian affairs (US Dollars 170m); Subsidies for rice, milk, meat and petrol, and 50% reduction in agricultural products (US Dollars 55m); Cheap medicines and free maternity service (US Dollars 35m) Soft credits for house building (US Dollars 20m); School breakfasts (US Dollars 13m);Back to Headline List CopyrightANDEAN GROUP REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 1, 1996 COLOMBIA: PRIVATISATION: FURTHER DELAYS FUEL DOUBTS: 'LACK OF POLITICAL WILL' HALTS US Dollars 731M ASSET SELL-OFF Two more failed attempts to bring the private sector into the running of Colombia's public assets have added to the growing scepticism with which analysts regard the Samper administration's commitment to its privatisation programme. As neither Bogota's communications company (ETB) nor Medellin's public companies (EPM) are national, the government has not been blamed explicitly, but given its past record - in 1995 only US Dollars 6.5m of a planned US Dollars 333m was actually sold off - critics are hardly surprised at the latest setback. It was Samper's predecessor, Cesar Gaviria, who began the 'apertura' of Colombia's economy back in 1989. The ensuing programme of economic liberalisation relied partly on extensive privatisation to boost foreign investment, which has increased steadily since then to a record US Dollars 1.6bn last year, excluding petroleum. And even despite the recent political crisis, Colombia remains a 'stable economy' for investment, with steady growth and controlled inflation. So when Jose Antonio Ocampo, the current Director of National Planning, recently stated that US Dollars 30.2bn of investment was needed in Colombia's infrastructure between 1995 and 1998, and that 40% would come from the private sector, it seemed likely that privatisation or at least the selling of concessions in the transport, energy and telecommunications sectors was on the horizon. Reforms subsequently began in the Civil Aviation Authority, the electricity generators, parts of Ecopetrol and its gas subsidiaries,  and Telecom, as well as various financial institutions including the Banco Popular, to prepare them for privatisation. The government then scheduled for the end of 1996 the completed sell-offs of 4 airports, 5 companies created to transport and manage gas pipelines, a nickel production plant, the Banco Popular and two other financial corporations. In addition, the bidding processes for between 51% and 60% of 3 hydro-electric and 5 thermoelectric power stations, as well as for two telecommunications' licenses worth US Dollars 150m, were all to be completed. According to Confis calculations (see graphs), this impressive list of envisaged privatisations will net the government US Dollars 725m in 1996. So with over half the year gone, critics are becoming increasingly concerned as to why not a single peso has to date entered the government coffers. While officials put the endless delays down to technical hitches, some critics are more blunt. As one observer commented, 'this government has no intention of selling because the idea of promoting private participation is not in their philosophy.' Clemente del Valle from the Ministry of Finance denied this charge, arguing that irrespective of ideology, it was reality that would ultimately convince the doubters of the benefits of privatisation. And to be fair to the government, there have been many setbacks. Not least was a constitutional court ruling last year which halted the key Banco Popular privatisation until the 'sector solidario' -unions, active or pensioned workers, employees' funds- had been guaranteed a stake. The ruling stemmed from a law introduced as part of Samper's own social programme which sought to 'democratize' state sell-offs, effectively giving first refusal on share offers to the 'sector solidario' and thus delaying the whole process by up to three months. Having received the final go-ahead from the council of Ministers, the Banco Popular privatisation is now back on track. But as one hurdle is cleared, another appears on the horizon, for now investors are complaining that the asking price of US Dollars 318m is grossly inflated. Similar variations of to-ing and fro-ing dog most of the government's privatisation plans, feeding criticism that the required political will to find a way through the upsets is just not there. Only 15% of the US Dollars 1.5bn electricity sector sell-off is to go ahead this year, Rodrigo Villamizar, the Minister of mines, recently announced, because further 'sweeteners' are needed to make it an attractive offer for private investors. But why had this not been thought of before? One analyst told Semana that the government treated privatisation like a simple case of placing a classified ad in a newspaper to sell a house, and that it was therefore inevitable that all these 'technical hitches' kept arising. Whatever the reasons for the delays, the bottom line is that the government has no choice but to privatise as it desperately needs the proceeds to finance part of its social programme. And having staked his political future on this programme throughout his corruption trial, Samper would be well advised to succeed.Back to Headline List CopyrightANDEAN GROUP REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 1, 1996 REGION: FOCUS: HOW GOOD A GUIDE ARE 'THE MARKETS'?: HEADLINES CROWD OUT DEEPER ANDEAN TRENDS To judge from the performance of the stockmarkets, investors are having no easy task figuring out which way the Andean economies are heading. Colombia, which at first had seemed impervious to the 'Tequila Effect', began to slide last year, and by mid-1996 was the only country in Latin America to register a dollar-term decline. Peru, which last year was the only country to approximate the high yields of the 'pre-Tequila' years, was in 1996 showing a first-half gain of only 16%. Venezuela, whose three-year recession has only just bottomed out, was by end-June showing the best results in the hemisphere: a dollar-term gain of 56.5%. The Colombian decline can be attributed largely to the political uncertainty, now somewhat dispelled, about the threat to President Ernesto Samper's tenure of office. The other reactions seem linked to 'headline' developments: the big privatisation deals in Peru, the imminence of a deal between Venezuela and the IMF. Despite the proliferation of sources of information about the region, and the acceleration of its delivery, investment decisions continue to be affected by headlines and news flashes: the grasp of underlying trends appears to be weak --indeed a recent survey of 'market operators' conducted by our sister service, the on-line Latin American Network, showed an alarming number uninterested in anything but last-minute, deal-related news. The problem is compounded by the slow emergence of properly analysed information on the underlying trends --which in the case of the Andean countries continue to show Colombia in the most solid position. From a series of recently-published studies (some of them up to two years in the making), the following valuable insights emerge. The 1980s saw the rising relative cost of capital appear as a strong constraint on investment: Colombia is among the few Latin American countries where this did not discernibly affect investment. In common with most of Latin America, the Andean countries have seen the rewards taken by capital rise far more than those of labour. In Venezuela, labour's share fell by 10% in 1980-90 while that of capital increased 48%. In Bolivia both fell, but labour's fell 1.7 times more than that of capital. In Colombia both rose (as also happened in Ecuador). Another shared Latin American trend is the declining efficiency of the use of capital, as measured by capital-output ratios. But over the past decade Colombia's decline has been only half the average for six of the largest Latin American economies. Since its best period, in the mid-1970s, the fall in efficiency has been almost four times greater in Venezuela than in Colombia. Over the past decade, Colombia was the Andean country which most increased the share of its GDP devoted to research and development: a fivefold rise, compared with only 1.2 to 1.4 times in Ecuador, Bolivia and Venezuela, and a decline in Peru. One area where Colombia compares badly with its neighbours is that of the technological upgrading of its exports. Its ITS, an index which measures the share of medium- and high-technology products in exports to OECD countries, has fallen markedly since 1980, while those of Peru and Venezuela have increased. This, however, must be seen against the fact that Colombia's export trade has the highest share of manufactured goods in the Andean region (indeed, the fourth-highest in the whole of Latin America): almost twice as much as Peru, two-and-a-half times more than Bolivia, almost three times as much as Venezuela, and eight times more than Ecuador. Similarly, Colombia's exports are the most diversified in the Andean region. Seen from the opposite end of the scale, its 'concentration index' has more than halved over the past decade, while those of Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela have diminished only slightly, and Peru's has remained unchanged. NOTE ON SOURCES The list of the top 100 publicly traded companies in Latin America, ranked by sales, has been published by Latin Trade, a Miami-based magazine devoted mainly to company news.Other data for this article came from the following studies: Strengthening Development: The interplay of macro- and microeconomics (Eclac, 1996). The Manufacturing Sector in Latin America and the New Economic Model, by Professor John Weeks, in The New Economic Model in Latin America and its Impact on Income Distribution and Poverty, edited by Victor Bulmer-Thomas (institute of Latin American Studies, London, 1966). Sistemas de Innovacion y Especializacion Tecnologica en America Latina y el Caribe, by Ludovico Alcorta and Wilson Peres (Eclac, 1996). DO COMPANY RANKINGS HELP? Which Andean countries have publicly traded companies which rank among Latin America's top 100? The question was asked at a recent private meeting in London attended by a number of 'operators' in Latin American investments. No-one produced the correct answer --only one: Peru [Telefonica del Peru ranks 65th, Southern Peru Copper Corporation 72nd].This position in the overall ranking can be misleading as to the relative sizes of big concerns in the Andean region: apart from those two companies, no Peruvian firm is big enough to rank among Colombia's top five, and only three (La fabril/Pacifico, Peruano Suiza and Gloria) would make Colombia's top ten. By comparison, two Venezuelan companies (Sivensa and Elecar) are in the same range as Colombia's top five, and two more (Vencemos and Mavesa) are within the range of Colombia's top ten. Colombia's top tier, with sales of US Dollars 246m to US Dollars 665m, is roughly comparable to the second tier of big firms in Argentina. The inability to pick Peru as the correct answer is unsurprising, but not only because that country's top two are in a category of their own: when the list of top firms in all three countries was checked against a well-known guide to Latin American companies, the 'finds' included only two of Colombia's top ten, two of Peru's top 15, and three of Venezuela's top five.Back to Headline List CopyrightANDEAN GROUP REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 1, 1996 VENEZUELA: PRIVATISATION: PETKOFF PLEDGES POLITICAL WILL: AFTER SEVERAL FALSE STARTS, SELL-OFF SHOULD SPEED UP When the proposed sale of the state-owned Aeropostal airline was postponed for the sixth time at the end of June, it did not augur well for Venezuela's supposedly rejuvenated privatisation programme. Sell-offs peaked in 1992, when 10 companies were disposed of; since then the programme has been languishing, with only five, six and two sales in the past three years, respectively. Confidence growing. But the Caldera government is adamant that it is serious about giving a boost to the undertaking, now that a deal has been successfully struck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and prospects for the Venezuelan economy look more promising than for some time (see WR-96-292). It is ironic that this new departure should take place under the auspices of a former left-wing guerrilla. But Teodoro Petkoff, the planning minister, has left no doubt that privatisation is a fundamental element of the government's economic policies (see RA-96-04), and the political will is now there.  New York presentation. The privatisation minister, Alberto Poletto (whose formal title is president of the Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela), set out his stall in a presentation for potential investors in New York on 26 June. The biggest industrial conglomerate still in state hands is the 17-unit Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG); by the time the sell-off is completed, only three companies will still be run by CVG. The aluminium industry is the jewel in CVG's crown, and pre-qualification of bidders was to begin in July. Venezuela's is the world's seventh-largest aluminium producer, with an annual output of 630,000 tonnes and exports of 425,000 tonnes. The government hopes to raise at least US Dollars 2.5bn from the industry's sale. Aluminium export revenues average around US Dollars 800m. CVG owns four companies that take part in all stages of bauxite, alumina and aluminium production: Bauxilum, Carbonorca, Venalum (415,000 tonnes of aluminium a year) and Alcasa (210,000 tonnes). Carlos Ernesto Sanchez, president of Alcasa, said at the end of June that he expected the auctioning of all four to be completed by the first half of December. One of the biggest problems facing the government is to come up with an attractive formula for potential buyers, as the four companies have accumulated internal and foreign debts totalling more than US Dollars 1.2bn, about half of which is owed to the government itself in unpaid taxes. Merrill Lynch is advising on possible approaches to this conundrum. Sanchez noted that the four companies are now making an operating profit, and recent debts have been mainly the result of exchange losses. Reynolds of the US has an 8% stake in Alcasa, and a Japanese consortium led by Kobe Steel has 20% of Venalum. Iron and steel, too. The other CVG units that are being put up for sale, notably the Sidor integrated steel operation and the Fesilven iron plant, are expected to raise a further US Dollars 1bn, perhaps next year. The CVG units that will not be sold are Electrificacion del Caroni (Edelca), the power generating company that runs the massive (10,000MW, second largest in Latin America) Guri dam; the Ferrominera del Orinoco iron ore mine at Cerro Bolivar; and the Minerven gold-mining operation. Telephone auction. The government also has high hopes for the sale of the 49% of shares it still holds in the CANTV telephone company. Petkoff announced in mid-July that the auction would take place in November on both the Caracas and international stock exchanges -assuming that both the US authorities and the Venezuelan congress approve the arrangements. He said he expected the sale, which is being organised by the Lehman Brothers and S G Warburg investment banks, to bring in between US Dollars 1bn and US Dollars 1.5bn. Other government sources have put the estimate as high as US Dollars 2bn. The first 40% tranche of CANTV shares were sold during the administration of President Carlos Andres Perez in 1991. A consortium led by GTE of the United States bid US Dollars 1.88bn. The remaining 11% were reserved for CANTV's employees. CANTV has a number of attractive features, not the least of which is a monopoly on conventional telephony until the year 2000. The company's concession runs for 35 years, renewable for a further 20. It has 2.8m lines installed. Banks sale. Poletto was accompanied in New York by Ester de Margulis, head of the Fondo de Garantia de Depositos Bancarios (Fogade), the state agency that has been give the job of reorganising and selling-off the banks nationalised in the wake of the 1994 financial crisis. Margulis told her audience that the Banco de Venezuela would be the first bank to be reprivatised, probably in August. The book value of Venezuela's oldest bank is thought to be about US Dollars 60m. Banco Tequendama is to follow in September, Banco Consolidado in October, Banco Latino at the end of 1996 and Banco de la Republica early next year. Poletto said he hoped their sales would fetch between US Dollars 6bn and US Dollars 7bn. Among a long list of other assorted enterprises that the government proposes to sell off are three regional power companies (Nueva Esparta, Enelbar and Enelven-Enelco); the Dianca and Puerto Central shipyards; the Monay cement works, and a string of hotels (which includes the cable car from Caracas to the coast). The big exception to the privatisation rule is the state oil company, PDVSA, one of the biggest and most successful in the world, with annual sales in excess of US Dollars 26bn. The symbolic importance of PDVSA, created after the nationalisation of the oil industry in 1976, is so great that no government would dare to suggest it should be sold. PDVSA off the agenda. 'The privatisation of PDVSA is not on this government's agenda, and those who propose such a move are fundamentalists who think that its would solve all the country's problems,' said Petkoff on 12 July. PDVSA president Luis Giusti is among those who have suggested a half-way house, selling say 15% of the company's shares to help pay off the US Dollars 27bn foreign debt and give a boost to the non-oil sectors of the economy. But energy minister Erwin Arrieta made clear that even such a compromise was politically inconceivable. Over the past few years, however, PDVSA has entered into a number of contractual arrangements with foreign oil and gas companies, to attract much-needed capital into the industry. Earlier exercises included concessions to reactivate marginal fields and to help extract the extra-heavy oil of the Faja del Orinoco. The latest modality of the 'opening' of the oil industry was the signing of eight risk contracts with international consortia at the beginning of the year (see RA-96-01). The association agreements were finally signed on 10 July, giving the new PDVSA subsidiary Corporacion Venezolana de Petroleo (CPV) and the eight consortia 30 days to set up the operating companies. Petrochemicals opening. Petkoff also announced that foreign capital would soon be invited to invest directly in the petrochemicals industry, dominated by the PDVSA subsidiary Petroquimica de Venezuela (Pequiven). The state company turns out 3.2m tonnes of products a year, and a further 2m tonnes in a number of joint ventures with domestic and foreign private companies. Petrochemical exports are expected to total US Dollars 760m this year. Information minister Fernando Egana said on 10 July that up to 200 new companies could be created in this sector by the year 2005 -by which time exports could reach US Dollars 2.5bn. AEROPOSTAL SAGA GOES ON As for Aeropostal, a number of airlines, including Avianca of Colombia and Delta of the US, showed an interest, but when it came to the crunch none of them could put down the US Dollars 2m deposit by 2 July required to enable them to proceed to the next stage: an auction with a reserve price of US Dollars 28m. The airline, founded in 1929, ceased operations in 1994, after a strike, with losses of US Dollars 38m. At its peak it had 16 planes and 40% of the domestic market -as well as services to Atlanta, Orlando and the Caribbean. Its assets were valued at more than US Dollars 60m in 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightANDEAN GROUP REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 1, 1996 COLOMBIA: VIOLENCE: POLICE ACCUSED OF EXECUTING SUSPECTS: AND CONTRACT KILLING RAISES 'COLOMBIANISATION' FEARS Two events in mid-July summed up the alarming institutional breakdown in Venezuela. The Policia Tecnica Judicial (PTJ) published figures indicating that there had been 821 murders in Caracas in the first six months of the year, 747 of them with firearms; 630 of the victims were between the ages of 18 and 30. And President Rafael Caldera publicly rebuked his justice minister, Enrique Meier, for criticising his predecessor's running of the ministry, particularly the prison service. Fewer murders, but ... The murder rate in Caracas was actually down on the same period last year, when 936 people died violent deaths in the capital. But PTJ chief Jesus Lazo Ricardi noted that insecurity was very widespread in the city, largely as a result of the high levels of drug and alcohol consumption. Most of the killings were at weekends in the hillside barrios surrounding the capital, where the police presence is very low and armed gangs hold sway. Another consequence of the absence of police is that lynchings (eight in the first six months) and vigilante groups have become commonplace. The commander of the Policia Metropolitana (PM), General Rafael Damiani, estimates that he would need double the number of officers he has at his disposal to provide an adequate service to the capital's 4m inhabitants. 'Extra-judicial executions.' Not that the poorly trained and paid PM's reputation is very high. In mid-June the police managed to stop an armed robbery at an ice-cream parlour in the city centre, killing one of the attackers, and at the cost of the life of a young policewoman -the first to die on active service. But sympathy turned to outrage when the two surviving criminals were subsequently found dead in a hospital morgue, their bodies riddled with bullets. They had earlier been filmed by Radio Caracas Television being taken away in handcuffs by the police. Here was evidence that the PM were carrying out 'extra-judicial executions' -an increasingly frequent occurrence according to human rights organisations, such as Provea, which counted more than 270 in Venezuela in 1994-95. The PM was forced to hand over the officers involved in the operation to the PTJ, public prosecutor Ivan Dario Badell ordered an inquiry and seven policemen were later arrested. RCTV complained that it had received threatening phone calls and PM patrol cars had been seen passing in front of the building. Contract killing. Days later public opinion received a further shock when the son-in-law of former presidential candidate Jose Vicente Rangel (now a prominent TV commentator) was shot dead as he delivered his daughter to a Caracas kindergarten, in what appeared to be a contract killing. This, together with the growing frequency of kidnappings, is widely seen as a further step towards the 'Colombianisation' of Venezuelan society. Meier earned Caldera's wrath by accusing his predecessor, Ruben Creixems, of permitting human rights abuses in Venezuela's nightmarish prisons.

According to a report by the UN Population Fund, 94% of rural households live below the poverty line, and the rate for cities is 51%. The study identified exceptional poverty in the urban areas of El Alto, Trinidad, Oruro and Potosi.  Chagas clampdown. The government has requested funds from the World Health Organisation to help it implement a five-year, US Dollars 70m programme to eradicate Chagas disease and malaria, which are present in 60% of the country. The authorities currently spend US Dollars 3m annually on fumigation projects in the areas affected by Chagas disease, and coordinate activities with Argentina, Peru and Brazil to combat the presence of malaria-carrying mosquitoes in frontier regions. A larger proportion of the population is affected by the two diseases than anywhere else in the Americas. Forest protection. After two years of debate congress has passed a forestry law aimed at protecting remaining woodland areas, which are deforested at a rate of 1,400 square kilometres per year, according to conservation group estimates. Under the law the state will grant 40-year concessions on forests to the private sector at a cost of US Dollars 1 per hectare per year, on the condition that the companies replant new forests. The law has been attacked by timber companies, who say the price should be only US Dollars 0.30 per hectare, and by Indian groups and the opposition, who say the price is too low.  COLOMBIA/ Fuel reserves. Oil reserves will last for another 20 years, or for 30 if used in conjunction with natural gas, at the current rate of consumption, according to the state oil company Ecopetrol. It estimates reserves at 2.9bn barrels of oil and 7.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, though this does not include the fields discovered earlier this year in Piedemonte Llanero, whose potential has yet to be calculated.

Copper profits down. The mining sector expects to receive US Dollars 250m less than its projected total revenue of US Dollars 1.3bn for this year, as a result of the fall in international copper prices following the 'Sumitomo scandal'. The price of the metal has fallen to US cents 90/lb, compared with an average of US Dollars 1.33/lb in 1995.  Corruption charges. A Lima judge has begun proceedings against second Vice-President Cesar Paredes Canto, on extortion charges.

The property they may own were houses in resort areas,condominiums, luxury houses in real estates each worth at least Rp200 million with a 70-year lease.    Habibie said the decision was not a solution to the gloom in theproperty sector on Batam Island, but a follow up of GovernmentRegulation Number 41 of 1996 on the right of foreigners to own ahouse in Indonesia.    Developers on Batam island would become encouraged and enjoy thefruits of the regulation.    Meanwhile, First Assistant to the Batam Authority Chief GunawanHadisoesilo said on a separate occasion that the decision wasapplicable on Batam Island only, and the foreign nationals wishingto have such property did not necessarily have to be actuallystaying in Indonesia.    By owning a house in Batam, he added, a foreigner would come toBatam much more often, which may encourage growth of other sectors,while the government would receive one percent of the sale of eachhouse.    Habibie also said the Batam Authority would go on with its planto build infrastructure projects, including the Asia Port in Kabil.    Besides YTL from Malaysia, Indoport from the United Kingdomsigned a contract on the building of a US$ 900 million containerterminal in Kabil on the basis of the BOT (build, operate andtransfer) basis for 60 years.

The 20,000 hectares would be part of the government'sone-million-hectare peatland conversion project in CentralKalimantan province, the minister said.    Speaking to reporters  after attending  a seminar organised bythe Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB) here over the weekend,Moochtar said since work was begun on the project last February,2,000 hectares of the peatland had been cleared for rice planting.     He said  to meet the 20,000-hectare target in 1996/1997, anaverage of 70 hectares of the peatland per day had to be cleared,adding that the work required much manpower and heavy-dutyequipment.     The minister said the project also included the building of anirrigation system.  So far, 175 km of secondary and 500 km ofprimary irrigation canals had been  created.    The minister also said removing logs and roots from  thepeatland  was one of the most difficult parts of the clearing work.    "We want the farmers who will grow the rice to receive the landin ready-to-use state,"  he said, adding each farming family wouldbe given two hectares to cultivate.     The farmers would be people from outside Kalimantan who hadagreed to be resettled under the government's transmigration scheme.     But before being moved to the peatland project, they wouldreceive training in peatland farming methods since they had neverworked peatland before. IPB would contribute instructors for thetraining.

TIMOR ISSUE POSTPONED BECAUSE PORTUGAL IS AFRAID from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency     Dili, E Timor, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - East Timor Governor AbilioJose Osorio Soares said the postponement of the talks on the EastTimor issue in the 51st General Assembly session of the UnitedNations increasingly indicated that Portugal was afraid of solvingthe problem of the land that it has dominated for 450 years.    "It is actually in the interest of Portugal to postpone thetalks on the East Timor issue, otherwise 'he' would certainly lose,"the governor told the press on the postponement of the talks, afterclosing a Golkar working conference in Dili on Saturday.    "We can draw a conclusion that the postponement of the talks wasbecause Portugal was afraid it would lose in a voting in the UnitedNations," he said.    A solution to the issue at an international forum could bereached through other means, such as through a tripartite meetingbetween the Indonesian and Portuguese foreign ministers under theauspices of the United Nations Secretary General.    However, if some day all countries would force a discussion ofthe East Timor issue at the UN General Assembly, that would be thetime when Portugal can no longer refuse.    The countries which have always abstained, should urge Portugalto immediately accept the matter to be taken up at the UN GeneralAssembly for a solution, he said.    The postponement was announced by a Dutch diplomat, Aryan PHamburger, at the General Affairs Committee session on September 18discussing the agenda of the 51st UN General Assembly.    The idea on the postponement was supported by the PhilippinePermanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Felipe HMabilangan.  With no other delegates responding, the Committeedecided to postpone the talks on the East Timor issue and entered itin the interim agenda of next year's UN General Assembly.    Talks on the issue at the UN General Assembly have beenpostponed 14 times since the subject was raised in 1983.    Meanwhile, East Timor House Speaker Antonio Freitas Parada saidit would be useless to discuss the subject at the UN GeneralAssembly, because the integration of the former Portuguese colonyinto the Republic of Indonesia has become a reality.    Anti-integrationists abroad were only serving their sweet owninterest by using funds provided by non governmental organisationsin other countries to finance their activities, he said.    Antonio pointed out that the most important thing for the peopleof East Timor was to build the area with their own funds and forces.    Other countries have become fed up with talking about the EastTimor issue, because in the 20 years of integration vast progresshas been made in the area, and in the welfare of the localpopulation.    In the meantime, chairman of the East Timor chapter of theruling Golkar political party Armindo Soares Mariano said the partywanted  an early settlement of the issue.  It would depend on thePortuguese government, because it was them who made an issue out ofthe integration in the first place, he pointed out.================Copyright 1996 AntaraBack to Headline List CopyrightANTARA-THE INDONESIAN NAT'L NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 30, 1996TRADE WIND GROUP OF SAILBOATS EXPECTED IN KUPANG from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency    Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Some 40 foreignsailboats  participating in a round-the-world voyage organized bythe Trade Wind Committee are expected to arrive here on October 3for a three-day stop,  a spokesman for the local hosting committeesaid.

"It is therefore improper for a handful of people to ask for areview of the term "OTB" from the standpoint of grammar," he told ameeting  about the latent danger of communism among the youngergeneration.    If the term "OTB" was considered wrong from the standpoint ofgrammar, this would only be logical as PKI members never knew how touse the Indonesian language (Bahasa Indonesia) correctly andproperly, he said.    The PKI members only knew how to use force and opportunities aswell as to overthrow colleagues and enemies, he said.    The term "OTB" originated from the PKI members themselvesinstead of government apparatuses or ABRI members, he said.    "I seems that it is naive if some people have vilely respondedto the statement issued by the ABRI about the term "OTB" some timeago, by saying that it was the ABRI which is the "OTB" or OmongTanpa Bukti (speaking without evidence)," he said.    Quoting the ABRI's intelligence and socio-political analysis offinds in several regions, Tanjung said PKI had metamorphosed.    "To most experts in communist teachings, the metamorphosis isnot new because it is a built-in process. The built-in process andclassical style however have often made us inattentive and lesswatchful," he said.    The ABRI chief said the PKI members also knew well how to winthe public's sympathy through the so-called peaceful and humanpropaganda.    He said the former PKI members had neither permanent friends norpermanent enemies. They only thought of how to satisfy theirinterests.    "To satisfy their interests, the former PKI members can dowhatsoever by, for instance, adopting attitudes down fromdemocrat-like attitude to violent, radical, uncivilized and inhumanactions," he said.    "Through the peaceful propaganda the PKI members have made anumber of survival attempts or activities in the last 30 years," hesaid.================Copyright 1996 AntaraBack to Headline List CopyrightANTARA-THE INDONESIAN NAT'L NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 30, 1996BALI ADM STILL PONDERING FEASIBILTY OF JAA-BALI BRIDGE from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency    Denpasar, Bali, Sept 29 (ANTARA) - Bali's provincialadministration is still pondering the feasibility of  a Java-Balibridge and has yet to discuss the matter with the centralgovertment, Bali Deputy Governor Ida Bagus Ardhana said hereSaturday.    Ardhana, who is also chairman of Bali province's RegionalDevelopment Planning Board (Bappeda), said the provincialadministration was considering the proposed Java-Bali bridge fromvarious aspects, namely  economic, environmental, infrastructural,and also social and cultural.    He said Bali's House of Representatives (DPRD) was doinglikewise with the help of inputs from  non-governmentalorganisations (NGOs) , informal community leaders and variousconcerned agencies.    According to Ardhana, a preliminary study of the project'sfeasibility was already made by a technical agency. "The Baliadministration will discuss the results of the study with itscounterpart in Java," he added.    He said he believed a Java-Bali bridge would no doubt  smoothentransportation of people and goods between the two islands.    However, certain problems  needed to be resolved before thebridge could actually be constructed.    Among the problems was the fact that the capacity of Bali's landtransportation facilities were not matched to the normal trafficflow from Java.    "Road conditions in Bali should be improved to make them equalto those in Java," he said.    In Java, roads had already been made strong enough toaccommodate  containers which was not the case in Bali, he said.    He also said the flow of people from Java would  become aproblem to the Bali administration if the bridge was realized.    "Denpasar municipality and Badung district have a  highereconomic growth rate than Java because they have become touristdestinations. Migration from Java will burden the two regions inBali," he added.    If realised, the project on Bali's side would  be located inJembrana district, a region with a growth rate of only six percent,the lowest among Bali's districts.  Bali's overall economic growthrate was seven  percent per year during the last three five-yeardevelopment plans.    "The low economic growth rate of Jembrana district has causedsmall growth in jobs as well," he said, adding that the provincialadministration had had to enforce special  policies to help thedistrict's economic development.     For instance, the provincial administration decided to stopconstruction of new star-rated hotels in Badung district andDenpasar in an effort to divert investors in the hotel industry toJembrana district.    He said  the Bali administration had also developed five tourismdestinations in Jembrana. Jembrana, according Ardhana, had nowbecome a location for development of medium-scale industries.==================Copyright 1996 AntaraBack to Headline List CopyrightANTARA-THE INDONESIAN NAT'L NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 30, 1996INDONESIA, OVERALL WINNER IN 5TH ASEAN ROWING C"SHIP from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency    Jatiluhur, Sept 29 (ANTARA) - Indonesia came out as the overallwinner in the Southeast Asian Rowing Championship 1996 ending hereon Sunday.

A lawyer representing Megawati said the suit could be filed atthe State Administrative Court (PTUN) as early as Monday.    "The lawsuit could hopefully be filed at the PTUN by Monday,"said Pantas Nainggolan, one of Megawati's lawyers.    East Jakarta Mayor Sudarsono on Friday closed the newheadquarters of Megawati's faction of the PDI, citing violations onresidential zoning laws.    Meanwhile, Haryanto Taslam, a member of the party executiveboard, said they will continue with their daily activities inanother place.    "We will start looking for a new headquarters and we willannounce it as soon as we find one," he said.    The closure of the headquarters came exactly two months aftersupporters of new PDI chairman Soerjadi forcibly took over the mainparty headquarters in Central Jakarta on July 27.    Nainggolan also disclosed plans to demand the closure of theoffice of Soerjadi's faction in his residence.    "We will urge the government to be consistent and close downSoerjadi's office in his residence," Nainggolan said.    Megawati's lawyers and supporters argued that the closure wasdiscriminatory because many homes in the Indonesian capital havebeen converted into offices.    Megawati was ousted from the PDI leadership in June by a partycongress held by the rival faction which elected Soerjadi as newchairman.    Her ouster triggered widespread protests which led to the July27 riots after the raid on the PDI headquarters.================Copyright 1996 AntaraBack to Headline List CopyrightANTARA-THE INDONESIAN NAT'L NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 30, 1996INDONESIA WILL OPPOSE NEW ISSUES AT WTO MEETING from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency     Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia will reject new issuesraised by industrial countries at the WTO ministerial meeting inSingapore in December, Trade and Industry Minister Tunky Ariwibowosaid today.     "We will reject discussion on new issues which might be brougtby industrial nations, including multilateral agreement oninvestment, labour standard, government purchases and the problem ofcompetition," Tunky told reporters after a meeting with PresidentSuharto.     He said Indonesia will take a firm stand against discussingthese new issues, particularly when they are disfavouring thecountry's national interest.     Indonesia already has its own regulations on investment andlabour law which would not be sacrificed for the interest of theplanned multilateral agreement, he added.     But Indonesia will participate in the discussion of all issuesalready agreed upon at the Uruguay Round meeting in Marakesh twoyears ago, Tunky said.     He said Indonesian officials have been preparing necessarymaterials to be brought to the Singapore meeting scheduled for midDecember.     It would be the first WTO Ministerial meeting among trade andeconomic minsters to be held, he said.     He also reported to the President about his recent trip toLatin American countries including Argentina, Brazil and Mexico topromote Indonesia's industrial products to the region.     Tunky said Indonesia has been suffering a large trade deficitagainst Latin American countries over the years.     Last year Indonesia exported some US$525 million worth ofcommodities to 12 Latin American countries while its imports fromthat region reached about US$1 billion, he said.     Indonesia needs to intensify its trade promotion to LatinAmerican countries to win more direct trading because manyIndonesian goods and products have entered their market via a thirdcountries, he said.===============Copyright 1996 AntaraBack to Headline List CopyrightANTARA-THE INDONESIAN NAT'L NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 30, 1996SOLO LAUNCHES GREAT SALE TO ATTRACT TOURISTS from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency    Solo, C Java, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Minister of Tourism, Post andTelecommunications Joop Ave said Solo will soon launch a month-longgreat sale to attract more tourists to come to the Central Javatown.

The cassette tapes, received by school caretaker KH YusufHasyim, were meant to serve as a reminder of the atrocities of theIndonesian Communist Party (PKI) in their 1948 and 1965 revolts.    Hamid said the speeches, delivered by PRD chairman BudimanSudjatmiko and Dita Indah Sari who are both under detention, reflectthe group's communist ideology.    He called on the younger generations not to follow theirexamples and instead increase their awareness of communistactivities to protect the country from the latent dangers ofcommunism.    He noted that PKI remnants and the wide social gap in thecountry could still lead to the revival of communism.    Religious Affairs Minister Tarmizi Taher, who was also present,urged Indonesian moslems to be vigilant of communist elements whotry to infiltrate religious groups.    The government has blamed the PRD for inciting the July 27 riotswhich rocked Jakarta, killing at least five and injuring scores ofothers.===============Copyright 1996 AntaraBack to Headline List CopyrightANTARA-THE INDONESIAN NAT'L NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 30, 1996MPS CALLS FOR HALT TO OPENING OF TUNNEL NEAR AL AQSA MOSQUE from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - The House of Representatives (DPR)on Monday urged Israel to halt the opening of a new archaeologicaltunnel near Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, saying the move is hurtingthe world Moslem community.    "I am very concerned about the Israeli move because the Al AqsaMosque is sacred to Moslems.  That is why I call on Israel to scrapthe move to open the new tunnel," Abu Hasan Sazili of the FunctionalGroup (Golkar) at the DPR said.    He said Israel should be consistent with its previous commitmentto creating peace in the Middle East.    "The world community will respect Israel, if the BenjaminNetanyahu government refrains from such an arrogant and one-sidedaction," he said.    He also appealed to Arab countries to remain united in the faceof the Israeli move to open the new tunnel.    Meanwhile, chief of the House Commission on foreign affairs,information, defence and security, Aisyah Aminy, said the Israelimove is inseparable from Netanyahu's policy.    She said the Israeli prime minister has given priority to hispersonal and group interests, while ignoring the peace agreementreached by his predecessor and the Palestinian leadership.    If the Netanyahu government is serious in creating peace, itmust halt the opening of the new tunnel, she said.    She urged Israel to immediately take concrete steps to createpeace in the Middle East.    "Peace should become the goal, otherwise there will never bepeace between Palestine and Israel and in the Middle East," shesaid.    Abu Hasan Sazili also appealed to the United States not todefend Israeli interests.    "The United States should not adopt double standards, where onone hand it longs for peace in the Middle East, but on the otherhand continues to assist Israel in every international forum, suchas the United Nations," he said.    Meanwhile, H Imam Churmen said the opening of the new tunnel isnot only the problem of Palestinians but also the global Moslemcommunity.    "The Israeli government must know that the building is a sacredplace of worship for Moslems, Christians and other religiousfollowers.  It is only logical if the world community has seriouslyresponded to the opening of the tunnel and pressed for its halt,"Churmen said.    Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry on Friday issued a statementstrongly condemning the opening of the tunnel and the shooting ofPalestinians by Israeli troops.    At least 53 Palestinians and 11 Israelis were killed in theworst riots since the West Bank and Gaza came under Israelioccupation in 1967.    The statement calls for restraint from all sides in the conflictand respect for existing peace agreements.==================Copyright 1996 AntaraBack to Headline List CopyrightANTARA-THE INDONESIAN NAT'L NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 30, 1996RIAU"S COAL RESOURCES ABLE TO GENERATE 1000 MW OF POWER from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency    Pekanbaru, Riau, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Riau has not only oil butalso coal resources which can generate thousand megawatts ofelectricity, a Riau official has said.    The head of the provincial mines office, Gaffar Siddik, saidhere on Monday that survey results had revealed the presence of twomillion tonnes of coal reserves in the Cerent area, Indragiri Huludistrict, which so far had not been exploited.    "PT Tambang Batu Bara Bukit Asem (coal mining company) is atpresent conducting surveys in this area and according to an originalplan a powerplant will be set up with a total capacity of 2 x 600MW," Gaffar said.    But there is also a possibility that the coal will be processedfor marketing abroad and that depends on the processor's calculationwhether it is more profitable to use the coal for power generatingor for marketing abroad, he added.    According to the mines office chief, apart from PT Batu BaraBukit Asam, a Malaysian investor is also interested in utilizing thecoal in Cerenti for power generating.    If the Malaysian side as well as PT Tambang Batu Bara Bukit Asemare interested in conducting similar activities they can cooperate,because according to plan the projected power plant will have atotal capacity of 2 x 600 Mw, and part of its production can beexported to Malaysia, Gaffar said.==================Copyright 1996 AntaraBack to Headline List CopyrightANTARA-THE INDONESIAN NAT'L NEWS AGENCY via NewsNetSeptember 30, 1996PRES CALLS ON TAMAN SISWA TO FORM COOPS WITH OTHER BODIES from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - President Soeharto called on themanagement board of the 74-year old Taman Siswa educationalinstitution not to hesitate to set up cooperations with other bodiesto boost its development.

More Arab states will implement market-orientedliberalisation measures.Politically, 1996 will carry mixed blessings for the region, withgood and bad landmarks. Elections scheduled in the self-rule areasof Palestine, Israel and Iran bear various elements of uncertainty.Each of these polls will generate a different momentum, whetherpositive or negative will depend on the outcome. With talks movingforward on the Syrian-Israeli track, 1996 could mark the beginningof a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace. The six GCC states willcontinue to experience internal difficulties and tensions betweenfellow-members. The situation in Saudi Arabia has improved. Externalsecurity for the GCC is guaranteed by the US. The possibility of theUN lifting the embargo on Iraq - now in its fifth year - is remoteas US presidential electioneering gets into full swing in the autumn(see Oil Market & Downstream Trends in this week's APS Review).In North Africa, the struggle by governments against Islamicmilitancy will continue, but the intensity will be less than inrecent years. The militants do not have the financial, military orpopular support required to overthrow regimes. Turmoil in the RedSea region and East Africa will also continue, amid militaryhostilities between Yemen and Eritrea, while Sudan and Somalia sinkdeeper into internal chaos - with Ethiopia not far behind.Regional politics will become more complex. Questions such as borderdisputes, water-sharing and trade imbalances will lead to a new setof dynamics, some of which will be negative. The role of the US asthe main influence in the Middle East will remain unchanged, but notunchallenged. The European Union (EU) will expand its linkages withNorth Africa and the Mediterranean rim. Russia will be anunpredictable factor, as the Communist Party has re-establisheditself in that country; together with its leftist allies the partyis set to control 217 out of the 450 seats in the Duma following theDecember elections.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS DIPLOMAT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996The Turning Point1996 will be decisive for the peace process, mainly because of whatit holds in store for Israel. General elections in the Jewish stateare scheduled for October, but with the government led by the LabourParty having a majority of one in the Knesset, the polls may bebrought forward as early as May. A victory for the right-wing Likudwould mean disaster, with the party having pledged not to return theGolan Heights to Syria. On the other hand, Premier Shimon Peres hassaid he would not hold a referendum on returning the Golan, sayingthe people can show their opinion in the general elections. Peres,with strong US backing, wants to have a Declaration of Principleswith Syria before the elections. As an added incentive to the Arabside, Peres on Dec. 22 said: "Give us peace and we will give up thenuclear (option). If there is peace we would denuclearise the MiddleEast". Rewards for what has been achieved have begun pouring intoIsrael, which has seen a huge rise in foreign investment in 1995.Yet Israeli society remains deeply divided about peace and itsimplications as shown by the assassination of Premier Rabin in Nov.1995.Jordan now is a "most favoured" country in the Middle East for theUS and Israel. It is moving quickly to reap the rewards of peace.The economic aspects of peace will bear fruit as from 1996. Jordan'sgeo-strategic importance will increase as its shift away from theregime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq becomes clearer. Ties with Iran arestrained as well, with a recent tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats.Lebanon will be ready to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1996, ifthe latter is able to reach an agreement with Syria (see below).Beirut is prepared to ensure calm in South Lebanon, with Syrianhelp, and has said it is ready to deploy 25,000 soldiers there ifIsrael withdraws from the "security zone". Its businessmen are theones best poised to take on the opportunities and competition thatwould result from a peace treaty. Syria will continue to have aguiding role over all affairs of importance in the country, takinginto account concerns about Lebanon's sovereignty expressed byFrench Defence Minister Herve de Charette during a meeting withSyrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam in Paris on Dec. 19, 1995.Palestine, as a state, will not materialise in 1996 but key aspectsof statehood will be put in place. As self-rule spreads from theGaza Strip and Jericho to cover Tulkarem, Nablus, Qalqilya,Bethlehem, Ramallah and other towns, a legislative council will beelected on Jan. 20, 1996. Differences among Palestinian factionswill get narrower as the benefits of peace become more obvious (Vol.43, 187-188). However, Arafat has denounced donor nations forfailing to keep aid promises; on Dec.18, he said that of $720mpromised only $120m was delivered. He was speaking on a tour of theGCC states, which will boost funding to the Palestine NationalAuthority (PNA) in 1996, but not on the scale of the pre-Gulf crisisera.Syria holds the winning cards for 1996. With the latest initiativefor peace under a 10-point programme proposed by Peres, the US andIsrael have recognised Syrian control over Lebanon and Assad'sstatus as the key leader in the Arab World. In the small window ofopportunity available before Israeli elections, Assad would move toensure that Peres is re-elected premier in Israel. This could meanan Israeli-Syrian Declaration of Principles in 1996, if Israelagrees to pull out from the Golan in a limited time-frame. An Assad-Peres summit, which "could take place in three to four months"according to Israeli Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir,would mark the start of a definitive peace between Syria and Israel.Assad cannot afford to risk the alternative of peace in 1996, asthat would guarantee a Likud victory and isolation of Damascus byWashington - perhaps by expanding the "dual containment" of Iran andIraq into a "triple containment" to include Syria. The peace processwill not survive such a scenario. An important goal for Assad is"economic parity" with Israel.Iran, which opposes the peace process, will be squeezed tighter bythe US in 1996. Prospects for an improvement in its economicsituation are slim. Parliamentary elections set for April-May 1996appear likely to result in favour of hardline traditionalists whoare preparing a strong challenge against the pragmatists ofPresident Rafsanjani. The outcome of those elections will decide thefate of the presidential polls in 1997, when Rafsanjani's final termis to end. Tehran's regional ties are likely to get worse beforethey get better, as countries neighbouring Iran build stronger tieswith the US. But Tehran is betting on a strategic alliance withMoscow.Iraq has no chance of getting the UN embargo lifted in 1996.President Clinton will have no motivation to take such a risk in anelection year, and signs that Iraq has been trying to rebuild itsarsenal of long-range ballistic missiles will deter even those whowant sanctions lifted - like Russia, France, China and othercountries. The UN Special Commission's recent semi-annual reporttook the US and British position that the embargo must remain inforce, because Iraq had not revealed all its secrets. On Dec. 21, UNinvestigators found guidance systems for missiles of 3,000 km rangedumped in the Tigris River. US Ambassador to the UN MadeleineAlbright affirmed later that sanctions would be in place for a longtime to come. Yet chances of President Saddam Hussein beingoverthrown are slim, despite regular reports of defections by armyofficers. One way for Baghdad to get the embargo lifted would be toindicate readiness to make peace with Israel, but Saddam is yet totake this bait.Turkey, having reached a customs union agreement with the EU inDecember 1995, now faces a tough year ahead. The Islamic Refah Party(RP) of Necmettin Erbakan won 21.32% of the votes in generalelections on Dec. 24, 1995, getting 158 of parliament's 550 seats.Tansu Ciller, whose True Path Party came second with 135 seats,resigned as prime minister and was soon talking of a coalition withMesut Yilmaz's Motherland Party (ANAP), which won 132 seats, andother secular parties. Such a coalition would come under strongpressure from RP, which is opposed to the EU agreement and manyother things. The elements of uncertainty were underlined on Dec. 22when Chief of the General Staff, Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi warnedthe Islamists: "The Turkish armed forces has adopted a contemporary,democratic and secular outlook and is opposed to all kinds ofdogmatism and reactionary attitudes." In 1996, the next governmentwould have to deal with an estimated 100% inflation rate and strikethreats by public sector workers. Externally, such a governmentwould be less effective in dealing with Turkey's growing geo-strategic worries arising from its role as a bridge between "oil-rich" states in the Caspian Sea region and Europe. It will also haveto deal with the Arab League's Dec. 17 threat to take action againstAnkara if it refuses to discuss Euphrates water sharing with Syria.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS DIPLOMAT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996GCC ComplexitiesThat internal security is a big problem for the GCC was recognisedat their 16th annual summit in Muscat on Dec. 4-6, 1995. The summitwas marked by a rift between Qatar and other members which may widenin 1996. Bahrain, affected by unrest since December 1994, would haveto move fast to adjust to the implications of the peace process. Itsrole as an offshore banking centre is no longer secure, and anunderlying cause of the unrest was economic hardship faced byShiites in the emirate. Employment of locals is now a top priority.Alternative sources of income to boost the economy are beingpursued, such as tourism. Spending cuts slashed its budget defict bysome 40% in 1995 and a similar trend is expected for 1996.Kuwait, which has the most democratic system in the GCC, has so farbeen free of violent internal opposition. But on Dec. 15, 1995,Defence Minister Shaikh Ahmad Hammud Al Sabah revealed that an armscache was seized at a farm in the emirate, hidden by a group that"sought evil for Kuwait". Yet Kuwait has managed to overcome worst-case scenarios forecast after its parliamentary elections in October1992 gave Islamic parties a big number of seats in the NationalAssembly. The ruling Al Sabah family will find ways to co-exist withthe vocal National Assembly, despite more embarrassments likely in1996 as a result of corruption allegations against former oilminister Shaikh Ali Khalifa Al Sabah.Oman, having celebrated 25 years under Sultan Qaboos in 1995, willcontinue to function as a positive force in the region. Its moderateyet unique approach could become especially useful as subtle powergames within the GCC intensify. At the same time, it will boostlinks with Israel, further consolidating its importance as a key USally in the region. The sultanate is moving ahead fast in terms ofeconomic liberalisation, with priorities in 1996 to includeprivatisation and diversification away from oil.Qatar would find itself in an uncomfortable position in 1996, havingalienated the other GCC members at the Muscat summit. The youngQatari emir, Shaikh Hamad, and his delegation walked out in protestat the appointment of a Saudi, Jamil Hujailan, as GCC secretarygeneral. Shaikh Hamad also said he would boycott all GCC meetingsattended by Hujailan. But his position changed immediately asHamad's father Shaikh Khalifa, whom he had ousted on June 27, 1995,appeared in Abu Dhabi at the start of a GCC tour and vowed he willregain power in Doha.Saudi Arabia, for the first time in many years, recently experienceda combination of uncertainties related to the Riyadh bomb explosionin November and to the subsequent hospitalisation of King Fahd. Butthe issue of succession to the throne had been resolved prior toPresident Clinton's visit to the kingdom in October 1994. Now CrownPrince Abdullah is the acting head of state and, according to the1994 deal, he will be the next king. The more difficult powersharing arrangement between Abdullah's conservative camp and theprogressive camp of Fahd's "Sudairi Seven" is yet to materialise andcould prove to be a difficult objective. At the same time, thekingdom will have to deal with new external dynamics generated bythe peace process, the conflict between Eritrea and Yemen, strainedrelations with Iran, etc. On the positive side, "good results" wereannounced on Dec. 17 after talks between Riyadh and Sanaa onsettling their border dispute. Despite some inherent problems, theSaudi economy will fare better than it did in the past three years,marking a break with the difficulties faced from bearing the biggestburden of costs related to the Gulf crisis.The UAE will remain the most stable and relatively the wealthiestamong GCC states, unless its territorial dispute with Iran over theislands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa escalates intowar. This is not likely in 1996, but some fiery rhetoric can beexpected from hardliners during the parliamentary elections in Iran.Both sides want a peaceful solution but there are few prospects forthis as neither side would back down from its position. Iran hassaid it is ready to fight an 80-year war for the islands.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS DIPLOMAT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996North AfricaThe level of violence in Algeria has subsided somewhat, amid thevictory of President Liamine Zeroual in the November elections.Having strengthened his position by gaining legitimacy inside andoutside the country, in 1996 Zeroual will try to further isolate anddivide the violent Islamic groups, while trying to strike politicaldeals with those willing to renounce violence. These could includeFIS leader Abassi Madani, now living in a villa in suburban Algiersas a "detainee", as well as the FIS Executive Bureau's provisionalhead Abdelkader Hachani and FIS leader overseas Rabah Kebir.Egypt managed to crush Islamic militancy more effectively in 1995.Crackdowns will continue in 1996 both inside and outside thecountry. Cairo's insecurity about its regional leadership role willreflect on the way in which it relates to Israel and other states onissues such as (a) the hostilities between Yemen and Eritrea, inwhich it has charged Israel of playing a role; (b) the nuclearquestion, now that it is bound indefinitely by the NPT while Israelis not; and (c) Islamic militancy, having accused Sudan of fomentinginstability in Egypt and warned it of retaliation.Libya will remain isolated under limited UN sanctions, unless itsurrenders the two men wanted by Britain and the US for their rolein the Lockerbie bombing. That is not likely to happen. Addedexternal pressure may be applied in 1996, at the most perhapsthrough a limited embargo on Libyan oil. A full embargo like the oneon Iraq would not get support from Europe or the Arab World. Qadhafiwill come under stronger internal pressure, as the pain from thesanctions gets harder to bear.Morocco and Tunisia will move closer to the EU in 1996.

The Arab League accused Eritrea,which has close relations with Israel, of a premeditated attack.Eritrean forces used Israeli-supplied boats and telecommunicationsequipment, which according to Sanaa were provided in return for apledge by Eritrea to hand over one of the disputed islands to becomean Israeli military base. Asmara suggested arbitration by theInternational Court of Justice at The Hague while Sanaa warned itwill regain the Hanish Al Kabir island by force. Egypt has warned ofthe geo-strategic implications of the conflict - whoever has theislands controls the Bab El Mandeb straits and access to the Red Sea- while the Cairo newspaper 'Al Akhbar' accused Israel of backingEritrea. This was denied by Israel.Sudan, a pariah among most Arab countries and the West, willcontinue to deteriorate economically, while the political situationwould get worse. The military/Islamic regime has been unable todeliver victory against the rebels of the Sudan People's LiberationArmy (SPLA), or any real improvements in the economic situation. Asrelations with Egypt and other neighbours continue to worsen,support to the SPLA from external sources such as Uganda and Eritreawould rise. The regime will come under pressure from oppositiongroups based in Cairo.

This question hasbeen vexing me since the Central Council for Education, anadvisory panel to the education minister, submitted the summaryof its discussions on education reforms of the 21st century inJapan.Profession is defined in my dictionary as "any type of workwhich needs a special training or a particular skill, often onewhich is respected because it involves a high level ofeducation."Many dictionaries offer "teaching" as a typical example of aprofession. However, I wonder if this definition is takenseriously by those who advocate the introduction of English atthe elementary school level in Japan.With respect to the reforms in English education in Japan, thecouncil has proposed that English should be taught at elementaryschools throughout the country. Naturally, this proposal shouldbe accompanied by concrete administrative measures to implementit. The quality of teachers who teach English to elementaryschool children is the key to the success of the new proposal.When you read the education reform summary carefully to knowwhat the council thinks about this important issue, you will finda passage which goes like this: "For the purpose of providingprimary school children with the activities that will allow themget used to English and the life and culture in foreigncountries, it is hoped that the potential of native speakers ofEnglish and that of Japanese people who have had wide experienceliving in foreign countries are utilized."I think this is a great idea. However, it is surprising thatyou can find no mention of the roles of Japanese elementaryschool teachers who are "professionals" in elementary schooleducation. I wonder if the council does not expect Japaneseteachers to play an important role in the teaching of English inelementary school.A debate arose as to "professionalism" versus "amateurism"when the Japan Exchange and Teaching Program (JET) wasestablished about 10 years ago.In the debate, opponents of JET claimed that onlyprofessionals were qualified to instruct Japanese students, butthose people involved in the debate--from Japanese educators toassistant English teachers (AET) themselves--agreed that teamteaching of Japanese teachers of English and AETs would be thebest way to make the most of Japanese teachers of English.What interested me much in the debate was the point that noamount of theory or experience in an AET's native country wasnecessarily effective in a Japanese setting because of thesometimes conflicting teaching styles between Japanese teachersand AETs, but what interested me even more was the fact that noserious discussions were made about "professionalism" of theJapanese teachers.When it comes to the teaching at the elementary educationlevel, you need to pay much more attention to the psychology ofyour students, and the psychology is often ingrained in Japaneseculture. I believe that Japanese teachers' role is essential tothe teaching of English in elementary school because they knowtheir children's behavior, values and so on much better thanpeople from foreign countries and people who have lived inforeign countries for a long time.But the problem with Japanese teachers in elementary school isthat they are not necessarily speakers of English, and because ofthat they often have difficulties in communicating with nativespeakers of English to whom they should explain the psychology ofJapanese school children.I strongly believe that those people who advocate the teachingof English at the elementary level should propose the ways tosolve this problem.In team-taught English lessons in junior high schools it ispossible for Japanese teachers to give input about their studentsto AETs because they are specialized English teachers and cancommunicate in English. In team teaching, Japanese teachers canuse their knowledge and ability as "professional" teachers ofEnglish.Of course, I know quite well that there are communicationproblems between Japanese teachers of English and AETs. Buttheoretically, Japanese teachers can have the role of designingand managing their classes by using their professionalism.Bullying and violent behavior are now raging in schools inJapan, and it is essential that teachers of any subject as wellas teachers of English learn more about their students' minds.They should know more about how their students think, feel andbehave in their school life. They need to have more training as"professionals" who can read the psychology of their childrenmore than any other people.I wonder why advocates of the introduction of the teaching ofEnglish do not say anything about this important aspect ofeducation. Their endeavors to improve English education in Japanis epoch making. But that makes me wonder all the more why theywant to count so much on native speakers of English and Japanesewho have had the chance to live abroad. I want to know how theythink about Japanese teachers' professional expertise.The author is a professor of English language at MeikaiUniversity.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996EDUCATION: Sankhon grateful for strict upbringingfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996Ousmane Sankhon, the public-relations manager of theJapan-Guinea Association, has become a popular figure on TV talkshows. A former official with the foreign ministry of Guinea,Sankhon, 47, worked at the Guinean Embassy in Japan for eightyears beginning in 1972 before becoming a celebrity.Sankhon said his father, who ran a farm while serving as alocal official, kept strict discipline in his very large family,discipline he is grateful for.I was born to a very large family. Altogether it had about 45members--my father, three mothers, 22 brothers and sisters, andrelatives. In Guinea, such an extended family is not uncommon.Dad worked on the farm while doing a stint as a local publicservant. He knew everything about his family. He knew how manychickens we had, when the children got new shoes, how many dishesthere were in the kitchen, and so on.He was tough with his children, so I feared him very much.When he was angry he would thrust out his right forefinger. I wasvery scared.I got punished many times because I used to pick fights withsome of my brothers. I was also whipped on the leg or the hips.It hurt me awfully. Dad had 22 belt whips on the rack at thefront door--one for each of his childrenBut he was also kind to us. How sweet he looked when hesmiled. Every time I got a good grade report I showed it to him."Good boy," he said, and he always bought me a shirt and a pairof shoes. Dad and I went shopping together, walking hand in hand.I was very happy.My father taught me the importance of responsibility. Once,when I was taking care of the sheep, one of them went astray. Icouldn't have my supper until I found the animal and brought ithome. It was already dark, but I looked for it with the help ofmy brothers. I was desperate.I also worked on the farm. Dad told me to plow a plot of land,but he left me to do it my way. Sometimes I worked until 8 atnight. I remember the happy moments when I walked home, carryinga hoe on my shoulderIn Guinea, adults severely scold children for making mischiefeven if they are neighbors' children. When a kid has donesomething wrong, you take him to his parents, and they alwaysthank you.People in Guinea respect families that strictly disciplinetheir children. Parents with a spoiled child often take him tosuch a family so he can live there for a while and change his badhabits.My father died when I was in the third grade of middle school.I like the saying that goes something like this, "Parental adviceand cold sake have a slow effect." I am grateful that Dad wastough with me. I respected him. I still do.During a Japanese TV talk show I was on, the MC asked a seniorhigh school girl what she disliked most about her father. "Hestinks," she said. I was surprised.I like Japan very much, so let me offer a bit of advice. Themost important thing for children is their families. Workingfathers should go home early. And they should be in good shapewhen they get home.Imagine a father who gets home late every night, drunk and histie loose. I wonder what his children would think of him.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996EDUCATION: In language-school battle for students, a gentler successfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996By KAZUNAGA FUKUSHIMAAsahi Evening NewsAs large language schools successfully win more studentsthrough expensive advertising and by opening accessible branchesin expensive locations, more smaller schools are feeling thesqueeze. Some are even being pushed out of business.But one small English language school is finding a way tosurvive in this highly competitive environment by offeringsomething many of the larger, profit-oriented schoolsdon't--quality of education.Quest 21, which provides language courses designed to suitindividual needs, was opened near JR Kichijoji Station in Aprilby some former teachers of Sony Language Laboratory (SLL) afterthat school became one of the casualties of the fierce battle forstudents.SLL, which was a pioneer among language schools in thiscountry after it was started in 1962 by Sony Corp.'s subsidiarySony Enterprise, was sold to other schools in March. A SonyEnterprise spokesman said SLL faced ballooning deficits in recentyears as more students were wooed by new schools with bigadvertising campaigns.Teachers became concerned that the takeover of SLL by otherschools, which was announced in February, would mean a departurefrom the school's original teaching methods and materials.After unsuccessfully petitioning Sony Enterprise to continuerunning SLL, a group of the teachers decided to open Quest 21 tomaintain an education policy of placing priority on individualneeds.Quest 21 produces courses of study for individual students whohave specific purposes in mind when they want to learn English,said Duane Sturm, a former SLL teacher and now president of Quest21.For example, when a housewife said she wanted to masterEnglish in a short period of time in accordance with her specificneeds and ability, the school prepared lessons to meet herschedule.In another case, responding to a request by a mother who has adisabled son and who wants to attend international conferencesfor the disabled, the school held a lecture on words andexpressions that are often encountered in such occasions.Unlike most language schools, Quest 21 hasn't adopted aflex-time system, in which schools sell students a large numberof lessons in a package deal. As such deals usually requireadvanced payment, schools can secure longer-term financialstability. However, the advance payment system is often cause forconflicts when students want to quit the school and demandrefund.Quest 21 collects tuition fees based only on three-monthsemester. Kunitsugu Noritake, a former SLL student and one of thefounders of Quest 21, said financial stability is attainable evenwithout advance payments."If the human relationship between students and teachers issolid, students won't quit the school," he said.He said the school expects students who appreciate the schoolto bring in other students. Some come to take advantage of theexcellent teachers.For example, one student returned to the school because of theenthusiasm of her teacher, Patricia Sturm, wife of Duane andanother founding member of Quest 21."The reason why I come to Quest 21 is to want to be taught byMrs. Patricia," she said. "She has a technique which induces theattendants to spontaneously speak their opinion in English."The student said she likes the teacher's interest in usingnewspapers and magazines as teaching material.The students at Quest 21 have an opportunity to freelyexchange opinions with teachers during discussion class, forwhich students get to choose the theme.Then the teachers at Quest 21 clip the articles relating tothe themes from magazines and newspapers to encourage attendantsto aggressively discuss issues.For instance, in a recent class, eight housewives who arestudents selected euthanasia as the topic for discussion.Quest 21 is also well-known because its teaching method workswell for students who have returned from abroad. Returningstudents tend to lose their positive attitude toward speaking anddiscussing in English because of cultural conflicts, saidPatricia Sturm.She encourages returnees to maintain and improve theirpositive attitude through discussion with other students who havethe same experience of having lived overseas.But questions about whether such a cost-inefficient school cansustain itself remain.Noritake says Quest 21 needs 60 more students than the 90 itcurrently has for a stable operation."But," he said, "we don't insist on profits. Rather, we expectQuest 21 to be recognized as a non-profit educational foundationin the future."Duane Sturm agrees."Although it isn't easy to keep running Quest 21, we want tokeep providing student-oriented education," he said.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996Fake budget report wastes \13 millionfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996A statistics office in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestryand Fisheries submitted a false explanation in seeking a 13million yen budget allocation for a new machine, well-placedsources said.A funding request based on the false explanation has alreadybeen incorporated into the ministry's fiscal 1997 budget request.The office in the ministry's Economic Affairs Bureau'sStatistics and Information Department wants the new device toreplace one it now uses to enhance work efficiency in itstroublesome task of calculating the rice harvest index.But the 13 million yen request was made in the name of otherproducts, since the device sought by the statistics office hasnot yet been developed and thus the funding item was not likelyto pass muster. The office was planning to ask a manufacturer todevelop a pilot model after obtaining the 13 million yen.Officials in the office now admit that the request is aviolation of procurement rules, and said that they will use thefunds in the budget request to purchase the products specified.But those products are, in fact, not needed, representing awaste of public money. "We wanted to promote a plan as fast aspossible," said an official.in the office. "Because it came to light, we decided to buythe products that we requested, although taxpayers' money will bewasted."Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996BUSINESS: INTERVIEW: TAIKI SAITO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, YAMAICHI: RESEARCHINSTITUTEfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996Domestic economic ripples from the U.S. electionBy AMY SHIRATORIAsahi Evening NewsQ: Do you think U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposedeconomic policies would be effective?A: If the Republicans retain control of Congress, Clinton'sefforts would be blocked, and no policy change would come about.The budget deficit would inch down, but not disappear in 2002as Clinton says. The financial markets have already taken thisscenario into account.Q: How effective do you think Republican candidate Bob Dole'seconomic policies would be?A: Dole's proposed policies would work only if the Republicanshave full control of Congress. If the Democrats control Congress,Dole might compromise with them in a detrimental way, agreeing toaccept spending to protect low-income people because his proposedtax cuts would benefit the middle to upper class.I don't think Dole will get elected for proposing an incometax cut.Ordinary citizens did not look favorably on the debate tobalance the budget earlier this year, because they knew thatRepublican-proposed tax cuts benefit the rich mostly.Republicans and the supply-side economists always exaggeratethe scope of economic growth resulting from a tax cut, and thecut would not bring about a balanced budget by 2002.The capital gains tax cut proposed by both Clinton and Dole isnot looked on favorably either because people realize it needs tobe balanced by cuts in medical welfare.Q: Which candidate's becoming president will benefit Japan?A: It would be best if the status quo is maintained. It isuncertain what a Republican president would do. Republicans areproponents of free trade, but past Republican presidents havetaken a tough trade stance.Democrats espouse protectionist policies and press Japan toopen up its market, but Japan's trade balance is dropping, and itcan hardly be said anymore that the U.S. trade deficit is causedsolely by Japan.I think the trade surplus will continue to drop although therate of decline will slow down. The yen will average 105 yen to113 yen in six months.Q: Would the adoption of Clinton's proposals lead to slow U.S.growth?A: I estimate the economic growth between July and Septemberto be between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. But I project economicgrowth between October and December will dip below 2 percent, andthat for the first half of next year it will be under 1 percent.The U.S. economy shows both strength and underlying weakness.The strength is that corporations have completed their inventoryadjustments, so they can easily increase production.But consumption, particularly for durable goods and housing,will not increase further. This is because the long-term interestrate increased 1 percent from the beginning of the year, andexpansion has already lasted for 5! years.Another point is that past consumption was made by borrowingmoney, and households need to adjust their balance sheets.Finally, the layoff of people hired in conjunction with theAtlanta Olympics and the end of Olympic-related construction willsqueeze down on private demand. But I don't think the UnitedStates will enter a recession.The Fed can easily loosen its monetary policy because unlikein the past recovery phase, prices have not been rising.Expansion will pick up again in the latter half of next year.Q: Is it unlikely that the Fed will raise interest rates?A: That's not clear, because mixed indicators showing both astrong and weak economy will be reported. I think there is a 70percent chance that the Fed will not raise the federal funds ratethis year.But the Fed might raise the rate as a preventive measureagainst inflation at the next Federal Open Market Committeemeeting Sept. 24 if a strong index is reported. Fed Chairman AlanGreenspan is a Republican, so he does not have to feel reluctantto raise rates before the election.But Greenspan will not raise the federal fund rate in Octoberor November because that would be seen as a political move.Q: What will be the effect on the economy if the Democratstake charge of Congress?A: The Democrats are now becoming favorites to win in theHouse.The current economic growth has been brought about because ofcorporate restructuring. Corporations have been reinvigorated,but private individuals have not, and their dissatisfaction hasworked to the advantage of the Democratic Party, which haspatronized the middle and lower class.Democrats controlling Congress would tend to increase welfarespending for these people, and blunt efforts to reduce the budgetdeficit. The market has a deep distrust of a Democratic Congress.There will be a triple downward spiral of falling stocks, bondsand the dollar.Q: Should Japan raise interest rates or compile asupplementary budget for more fiscal stimulus?A: Japan will not raise interest rates in September or Octobereven if the U.S. Fed raises the rate, because of the weak Tankanreport on business confidence in an economic recovery last week.Japan should do no more than to increase the call rate late inthe year, if necessary, and provide another 2 trillion yenconstruction spending boost in a supplementary budget, which Ithink the government will do.This is necessary to offset a 5 trillion yen tax increase fromthe consumption tax hike next April.Taiki Saito became senior economist and deputy general managerof the economic research division at Yamaichi Research Instituteof Securities & Economics, Inc., in December 1994.

But he seems to have changed his mind for fear thatan extra session would lead to an immediate dissolution of theLower House.If the extraordinary session is called, the ruling coalitionwill face fierce attacks from opposition parties on next April'shike in the consumption tax from 3 percent to 5 percent, andallegations that Kato recieved a questionable donation fromnow-defunct steel maker Kyowa Co.The main opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) saysit will submit a bill in the extraordinary session to keep theconsumption tax rate at its current 3 percent.Shinshinto members also say that unless Kato resigns his postas LDP secretary-general they will boycott all deliberations inthe extraordinary Diet session.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996Sasebo dockyard row flares againfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996A six-month-old agreement that ended a heated dockyard disputebetween a Japanese shipbuilder and the U.S. Navy at the port ofSasebo in Nagasaki Prefecture is threatening to unravel becauseof ship repair regulations.SSK (Sasebo Heavy Industries Co.) agreed in February to endits opposition to the U.S. Navy's plan to use free-of-charge thecompany's No. 3 drydock to repair a warship after the navy hiredthe company to do the work.But negotiations over the terms of the contract for the workon Bellow Wood, an amphibious assault ship, broke down when thenavy insisted that the company follow Americanregulations--including those governing working conditions--whendoing the repairs."The U.S. forces have the mentality of the post-war OccupationForces," said SKK President Ryutaro Hasegawa. "No. 3 Dock will betaken away (from our control) little by little."On Thursday, hundreds of company union members held a rally atthe dockyard, surrounding the 900-meter circumference No. 3 dockin a human chain to protest the planned repair work on the BellowWood at the dock.A 1968 agreement between SSK, the Japanese government and theUnited States gives U.S. forces priority in using the drydock atno charge, on just seven days' notice. SKK assumed control of thedock from the Japanese government in the same year.Tension erupted between the company and the U.S. forces inmid-January when the navy requested the use of the drydock to doseven months' of repair work on the Bellow Wood.The company argued that it would lose about 36 billion yen ofits income if the dock was occupied for such a long period."I have always been pro-American. In emergencies, we will helpU.S. forces. But in normal times, we don't welcome something thatwill send the company into bankruptcy," said Hasegawa.The issue was considered settled when the U.S. Navy agreed tocontract the repair work on Bellow Wood to SSK, with the terms ofthe work to be decided by the company, Hasegawa said.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996Bacteria facilities barely copingfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996The nation's two storage facilities for bacilli samples are soancient and understaffed that future epidemics of bacterialinfection will be hard to contain, bacteriologists say.Bacteria samples are necessary for determining the cause ofinfection and studying methods of treatment, as well as forunderstanding their genetic composition.But they are stored at only two places in Japan--TokyoUniversity and Osaka University.Directors of these facilities complain that little has beendone over the years to improve these storage areas."There's been no progress so far," said professor TakeshiHonda, the director of the Osaka University facility. "If thepresent situation is allowed to continue, I must say that thenext time there is an outbreak, researchers may not be able tocome up with timely solutions to contain it."The two facilities are run on an Education Ministry budgetthat can hardly be called generous--a very lean 1.2 million yen ayear for Tokyo and slightly over 800,000 yen for Osaka, thebacteriologists say.And the ministry recognizes only one full-time researchereach.The Tokyo University storage facility occupies a corner of aresearch wing dating back to the late 1920s. The tiny,16.5-square-meter space holds refrigerators and freezers that arecrammed with test tubes containing 500 kinds of germs, includingO-157, salmonella, cholera, tuberculosis and dysentery bacteria.Following the massive O-157 food poisoning epidemic, thefacility provided about 10 research institutes of food makers inthe Kanto area with samples of this E. coli bacillus.But with its meager operating budget, inadequate equipment andthe barest skeleton staff, the outfit is a far cry from its muchmore developed British, German and American counterparts, thebacteriologists say.For this reason, many Japanese researchers send for samplesfrom overseas institutes."Unlike the American facility at Maryland, which publishes acatalogue of several thousand strains of bacteria and suppliessamples to researchers around the world, we are unable to evenmeet all domestic requests for samples," lamented professor ShiroKanegasaki, director of the Tokyo University facility."And our freezers are ancient, `vintage' affairs," he said."We have to haul in tons of dry ice whenever there is a poweroutage."The situation is no better at the Osaka University facilitywhich mainly stores E. coli bacilli."We've had to discard some samples for lack of storage space,"Honda said.Some researchers have appealed to the Health and WelfareMinistry to create bacteria sample storage facilities andpertinent information services of the European and Americancaliber, but the ministry has "no immediate plans for action," aministry official said.In addition, Honda of Osaka University has been trying topersuade the Education Ministry to upgrade the existingfacilities.In recent years, bacteriology has been steadily overtaken byvirology, according to Kanegasaki. In 1977, 56 of 80 medicalschools around the nation taught bacteriology. Today, the courseis offered at less than half of those schools."The declining status of bacteriology as a branch of medicalscience has definitely to do with the present plight of ourfacility and Osaka University's," Kanegasaki said.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996COMMENTARY: Politics lost for weordsfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996By YOICHI FUNABASHIAsahi ShimbunCHICAGO--After covering the Republican National Convention inSan Diego and the Democratic National Convention here, I am sickand tired of speeches. I feel as though I made the trips to coverspeech contests.The conventions were held to nominate the presidentialcandidates of the two parties but a succession of speakerspreceded the nominees, Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton, tothe rostrum. Most of their speeches were partisan, just batteringthe opposition. Could they really be called speeches?The speakers' words were packaged with audio-visual effects.During a speech on crime, a rape victim stepped onto the podiumand talked about the horrors she had experienced, interruptingthe speech like a television commercial.Other speakers waded into the audience like talk-show hosts.Giant screens made hilarious exchanges between speaker andaudience possible.At a time when music and videos are packaged to sell productsand people, it may not be strange that speeches are "packaged"like music videos. Does this mean that the karaoke machine is nowan essential part of giving a speech?These gimmicks, I suspect, are causing a qualitativedeterioration in speeches, weakening the power of words.In the interest of playing up the appearance of party unity,both parties scheduled speeches that deviated from the "scripted"party line only at times when the major national networks wouldnot air them.While shortened speeches were a welcome phenomenon, there wasa quid pro quo: a preponderance of slogans like bumper stickers.And there were too many tear-jerking stories.Yet some speeches were moving. Colin Powell, former chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urged Republicans to be magnanimousto those with whom they disagree. Based on his own experience,Senator John McCain portrayed Dole as a "quiet hero" who wentabout his work silently. Despite his disagreement with Clinton onwelfare, the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave a sermon on why he should besupported in his reelection bid.My overall impression is still that too many words were usedat the conventions. But I attribute the torrential verbiage tothe conviction that "politics are a matter of persuasion," andpersuasion primarily depends on words.Exactly the opposite is true of Japanese politics. But this isneither laudable nor tasteful. The Japanese machismo along thelines of the well-known TV commercial catchphrase--"A mansilently drinks such-and-such beer"--is nothing but an expressionof distrust in words and reason.During the Morihiro Hosokawa administration, Teiichi Tanigaki,a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, attacked the primeminister for his flip-flops over his proposal to replace theconsumption tax with a national welfare tax.Speaking in a Lower House plenary session, Tanigaki said,"When politicians are lost for words, power of speech, they haveno choice but to rely on muscles and money. Don't you think afascistic `muscle power' mode of politics is holding sway?"The accusation was to the point. But the same thing can besaid of the present coalition government of Liberal Democrats,Social Democrats, and Sakigake.Remarks made by government and coalition officials over theplanned 2-percent increase in the consumption tax to 5 percentnext April are so divergent that they make one wonder which ofthem is true. What strikes me is that the government and thecoalition are lost for words.It seems that in Japan, words lack even the frail lifespan ofice cream.The approach of the next Lower House election under thesingle-seat constituency system makes the political aphasia--theloss of ability to use or understand words-- all the moreworrying for party politics in Japan.The single-seat system has been adopted on the premise that itwill force voters to choose between parties, which will have tospell out their differences in policies and in the leadershipcapacity of their presidents. It is a system that works only whenparties vie with words.Japanese politicians should give more speeches. I do not carewhether they act like talk-show hosts or employ a karaokemachine.In fact, under the present circumstances, I cannot afford tocare for the quality of speeches. I call for--no, I plead for--aspeech contest among the parties in Japan.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996Matsumoto told to pay \790 million for gassingfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996The Tokyo District Court this morning ordered Aum Shinrikyofounder Chizuo Matsumoto and other two cult leaders to pay 790million yen in damage compensation to victims of the cult's Tokyosubway sarin attack last year and to their families.Presiding judge Hisashi Yamazaki said the three should beregarded as having tacitly admitted to their involvement in thegassing, because they failed to challenge the plaintiffs' claimthat they ordered and conducted the attack.Although Matsumoto, 41, known as Shoko Asahara, had refused toanswer whether he admitted the same allegation in a criminaltrial, the civil court today said that he was the mastermind ofthe subway attack.The sarin nerve gas attack on March 20, 1995, killed 12 andsickened 5,500.Those ordered to pay compensation along with Matsumoto wereIkuo Hayashi, 49, the former head of the sect's self-designed"Treatment Ministry," and Masami Tsuchiya, 31, the former head ofthe "Chemical Division."Hayashi has admitted his involvement in the gassing, whileTsuchiya opted to remain silent when accused.Twenty-two people who were sickened in the gassing and 16bereaved family members of seven who died filed the suit to seek790 million yen in damages from the three and 12 others.Matsumoto, Hayashi and Tsuchiya and 12 other Aum members.Three of the other 12 named in the suit are still fugitives.The civil suit will be considered settled when any of the 15accused pay the money.Matsumoto had already been ordered to pay over 360 million yenin compensation in other damage suits related to crimes allegedlycaused by the sect, and in refund of donations the sect hadaccepted from followers.Matsumoto is believed to have little private assets, and hasso far paid only 650,000 yen out of 10 million yen demanded byone group of plaintiffs in refund of their donations to Aum.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996Hurt Akebono at a crossroadsfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996By JOHN De BELLISAsahi Evening NewsIf you consider Akebono's 12-3 record at the Nagoya tournamentin July after six months of crippling injuries, you begin tounderstand that this is a man who is capable of beating the odds.The 27-year-old Hawaiian-born yokozuna defied probability byblazing through the ranks of Japan's most traditional sport. Butbecoming the first non-Japanese to reach the sport's pinnacle wasarduous, and now he suffers the pain to substantiate it.Injuries have put his longevity in doubt. His knees, on whichhe had surgery in 1993, are the main problem. Too often, theyhave given way beneath his 204-centimeter, 224-kilogram frame."When I was on the rise, I thought I was invincible," Akebonosaid, flashing a smile that seemed to fade with the realizationthat his career could be cut short. "I am also at the point thatif I get over this wall, it will decide my future, how long I dosumo," he said quietly. "I want to be yokozuna for 10 years."But as Akebono--formerly Chad Rowan and now a naturalizedJapanese citizen--prepares for the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament,which begins next Sunday, there are doubts as to whether his bodycan continue to endure the punishment it has absorbed during hiseight years in sumo.His Hawaiian-born stable master, Azumazeki--formerly JesseKuhaulua--has some concerns about his protege's training methods."He struggles because he doesn't work on his shiko (sumo-styleleg stomps for developing the lower body) more," Azumazeki said."If he does that, I think he can stay on top another four or fiveyears."You need shiko to succeed. It gives you balance and helps youdig. Look at Konishiki. His size is tremendous (274 kilograms),but he still does his shiko practice. That's why he's lasted solong."When Akebono pulled out of the January tournament on thefourth day, he began to realize his mortality. The explosivenesswas gone from his tachiai (charge), so he was unable to attainproper balance."When you get hurt in one place, you tend to favor that spot,and then other things begin to be affected," Akebono said.In March, he decided to skip the spring tournament because oflingering pain in his knees and ankles. And it was painful--bothfiguratively and literally--for him to watch his career slowingto a halt."Many athletes who are at the top of their sport go throughtrials," Akebono said, admitting that he has entertainedself-doubts and considered a world in which he could not wake upeach day and know he was the best. "I was doing so well after Ibecame yokozuna; I thought that nothing could stop me."But that perception was shattered. Now, questions swirl aroundhis mind. Is retirement near? "Sometimes I think about it, butnot every day," he said. "I'd get stressed out."If it weren't for the bad knees, it could be like it wasbefore--massive arms pumping and thrusting, opponents landing inthe third row."It frustrates me," Akebono said. "You think about things thatyou would never consider if you weren't hurt."But he said he believes he will overcome the injuries. Andeven get better. "When I was hurt, I studied my sumo on video. Istill watch videos. I watch them to improve my techniques."An avid Internet surfer, Akebono occasionally comes acrosssumo interviews and analyses, or reads them in newspapers. Someof them question his future."I don't really pay attention to that," Akebono said. "Whatpeople see, and the person doing it, are two different things. Ihaven't been shining like before, but I think, deep down inside,that if I keep pushing, it will come back."By the time Akebono entered the dohyo for the Tokyo summertournament in May, he was learning how to wrestle with pain. Heracked up a respectable 10-5 record and began to feel thatreturning to top form was truly possible.By Nagoya, Akebono was again dominating opponents. He went12-3. "I thought I was going to take the whole thing," he said."But on the 14th day I hurt my shoulder."He regards that injury as nothing more than a bump on the roadto recovery. "Right now my timing is off and I still feel pain inmy shoulder," Akebono said, "but if I keep practicing hard, Ishould be ready."Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996MY FAVORITE HOME PAGE: Motor Link Pagefrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996"Just like many other freelance writers, I use this home pagewhen I need to check some detailed facts about automobiles when Iface a deadline," said magazine columnist Kazuhisa Kimura.The Motor Link Page is divided into sections representing 18major car makers from all over the world--five Japanese and 13foreign.If you click, for example, on the Nissan section, you can seenot only the home page of the firm but also the home pages of itsoverseas subsidiaries.In the site for Mercedes Benz, visitors can seepersonally-produced pages on the manufacturer's vehicles as wellas its official Web site.Kimura, a great lover of cars, accesses the Motor Link Pagequite often to update his knowledge about Italian, German andother countries' cars.

Thebooks depicted the ruling family as the descendants ofmythological Shinto kami from heaven.In those days, the court's rulers doubled as the highestShinto priests. As such, they ruled over various clan leaders,village chieftains and grassroots villagers who believed in thevariety of kami. Clan leaders and village chieftains also hadsimilar double roles in their communities.In other words, the original Shinto was the backbone of theYamato Court's rule.But Yoshie points out in his book that a strange thinghappened from the eighth to ninth century--the mushrooming ofjingu-ji, or Buddhist temples in and around Shinto shrineprecincts.Why, according to Yoshie, has to do with the production ofrice.During the Nara era (710-794), the rice production increasedby leaps and bounds, thanks to fast expanding irrigation networksand newly reclaimed paddy fields.The change produced a wide economic gap between the localgovernment officials and country rulers and the villagers andfarm hands. The wealthy feared reprisals from the poor, and atthe same time they felt a strong sense of guilt.Against this backdrop, Yoshie says, the uneasy rich soughtcomfort and salvation from Buddhism, a religion of tolerance, bybuilding the jingu-ji.The central rulers, who were also the highest kami priests,had no choice but to leave Buddhism and the jingu-ji since theirown local heads were among the newly converted.According to Yoshie, this was the first stage in the curiousmixing of Shintoism and Buddhism.The second stage began with tales of ghosts and disasters thatstruck the imperial palace, killing noblemen and terrifyingemperors to death. These events during the early part of theHeian era (794-1195) were recorded in various documents in theninth and early 10th centuries.The most famous ghost was that of Sugawara-no-Michizane(845-903), a top nobleman-politician who lost in a power struggleand died in exile in Kyushu.Social unrest characterized this period as Emperor Uda(867-931) and Emperor Daigo (885-930) in particular tried toconsolidate the imperial dynasty again by reasserting imperialownership of the nation's land that had been mainly privatized acentury earlier.Bloody power strugglesThis and other maneuvers by the emperors triggered powerstruggles, sometimes bloody ones, in Kyoto. The social unrestcoincided with the burgeoning of the samurai who opposed to theimperial rule.That was where the Buddhist monks--especially, the esotericones who were steadily building up their influence--hopped in.They presided over one prayer session after another in manyparts of the country on the pretext of ridding the nation of theghosts and evils they blamed for the disasters. In reality,however, they were fanning the social unrest.At the peak of the disorder, Yoshie argues, Taira-no-Masakado(?-940), a samurai leader, seized power in the Kanto region andproclaimed himself an emperor in 939.The emperors reacted by trying to soothe and overcome theghost of Sugawara-no-Michizana, which they saw as the symbol andcause of the social unrest.They hosted their own prayer sessions. For almost 30 years,they also paid repeated tributes and contributions to theAnraku-ji Temple that took care of the exiled nobleman's tomb inKyushu and to Kyoto's Kitano Shrine which was dedicated to hissoul.During that time, samurai and Buddhist monks gradually changedtheir strategy, realizing that it was easier to expand theirinfluence by joining hands with the imperial palace rather thanrebelling against it. This concluded the second stage.In the third stage in the development of the religiouscoexistence, the imperial rulers and noblemen along with theircourtiers and ladies-in-waiting began to practice their ownreligion more vigorously, "sharpening their sense of purity"which is the overriding concern in Shinto.Ironically, however, the sharpened sense of purity paved theway for the ruling class to ardently subscribe to the Buddhistbelief in Jodo, or the utopian "Pure Land beyond the WesternOcean," by the end of the 10th century.The development, writes Yoshie, was a new stage of coexistenceor rather integration between Shintoism and Buddhism.In the further evolution of the integration or the fourthstage, Buddhist theologians tried to absorb Shintoism beginningin the late Heian era (the late 12th century) with a new theory.Under this theory, all Shinto deities were interpreted asincarnations of a variety of Buddhist deities, including Bosatsu(bodhisattva).Yoshie points out that the new theory turned out to be a greatsuccess. Most shrines throughout the country had accepted it bythe middle of the Kamakura era (1185-1333). Even the deities atthe Ise Shrine at the top of the imperial Shinto hierarchyfollowed suit.Why the success? Yoshie explains that the emerging samuraiclass (the Kamakura government was the first samurai regime)sought Buddhist theories that pardoned killing--the job of thesamurai--over the Shinto's emphasis on purity. The newly emergingmerchant class also preferred Buddhist theories that preachedequality for all since the controlling samurai class at the timebegan establishing a strictly hierarchical society.The book ends with what Yoshie calls the fourth stage of theintegration during which Buddhism gained the upper hand.But from where Yoshie's book leaves off, the relationshipcontinued to go through further twists, some violent.Nationalistic Shinto theories developed during the Edo era andultimately culminated during the Meiji Restoration in theestablishment of the State Shinto where the religion againcentered around the imperial family.Consequently, the Japanese today bow in front of many shrinesdedicated to original kami and not incarnations of the Buddhistdeities.Many questions remain about what happened to the complicatedmarriage of Shinto and Buddhism after Yoshie's so-called fourthstage.The author would do well to provide some answers with a sequelto this well-researched and informative book.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996FEATURE: Lack of water-safety education taking its tollfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996By LILY MATSUBARAAsahi Evening NewsEvery year, July first marks the beginning of the NationalPolice Agency's (NPA) annual ritual of tallying up the casualtiesof summer leisure.And every year, the Japanese newspapers' faithful devotion toa three-inch column on the death toll hardly raises an eyebrow.They pass for mere statistics. Nothing more, nothing less. Andtragically, nothing learned.Most of these leisure-activity accidents occur at sea, abouttwice as many as in the mountains. An average of 2,000 cases ofwater-related accidents are annually filed with the NPA (comparedto 1600 mountaineering accidents). Of these, 1300 result indeaths. And approximately 200 children die each summer.But despite these grim statistics, the Ministry of Education'sguidelines on physical education classes do not include practicallessons in water safety.While children are all taught to swim freestyle andbreaststroke for at least 25 meters by the time they reach juniorhigh school, they are not instructed on the fundamentalprinciples of water safety or told of the many dangers ofswimming in the sea."In elementary school, teachers brought us outside to the(public) roads to teach us about road safety," said MasahikoKobayashi, Secretary-General of the Japan Life-SavingAssociation. "There are no similar practical lessons in watersafety when it comes to swimming lessons in schools."According to the NPA, 45 percent of water related accidentsoccur in the sea while only 2.3 percent occur in swimming pools.Another 31 percent of the accidents occur in rivers."Those involved in accidents at sea are either swept away bythe tide and undercurrents or get caught in the wave and drown,"said Kobayashi. "There are even cases of people being swept awayby their floaters because of high winds."The NPA says most, if not all, accidents are avoidable."Even when bad weather causes an accident at sea, it is stillan avoidable problem," said a spokesman for the NPA. "There arealways announcements on weather conditions, and it is up to youto heed them or not."CarelessnessBoth Kobayashi and the NPA point out that ultimately, personalindiscretion is the cause of death. The rules are simple --if youdrink or feel unwell, don't swim; look out for coming waves; beaware of tides and undercurrents; don't use floaters at sea inhigh winds.But, as simple as they seem, the rules still need to betaught."Schools in close vicinity to the sea might have practicallessons in water safety. But for now, we do not have plans toinclude compulsory personal survival skills in our curriculaguideline," said Nobuyuki Ikeda at the Education Ministry'sPhysical Education Department.According to Kobayashi, this problem is compounded by the factthat there are only 2,500 accredited lifeguards--officiallycertified by the Japan Life-Saving Association--spread over just50 of Japan's 1,400 beaches. The rest of the lifeguards are madeup of uncertified high school students and local residentsworking at summer jobs.In Australia, where life-saving is well established, the ratioof lifeguards to the population is about 1:170; in Japan, theratio is 1:48,000."There are insufficient life-saving clubs in Japan," Kobayashisaid. "Only 40 clubs are registered with our association. Andalthough life-saving clubs at the local level and in universitieshave been increasing in the last five years, it is a sad factthat we have very few officially qualified life-savers inbeaches."Simply learning how to swim is not enough. Children must learnthat swimming in pools is drastically different from swimming inthe sea.Life-saving skillsAlthough 18 years is the minimum age required to learn actuallife-saving skills in Japan, Kobayashi attests that anybody ofany age can be taught how to read tides, currents and wavemovements--vital knowledge necessary for protection from theseemingly unpredictable sea."In Australia, children as young as 6 years old have theopportunity to learn about practical water safety," saidKobayashi. "Under the guidance of life-savers, children areactually made to feel the pull of tides and undercurrents. Andthey are taught ways to brace against them."But as yet, no system for ensuring water safety skills andknowledge exist in Japan, he said, blaming the dearth ofcertified life-saving trainers .Private swimming lessons available to the public normally donot offer such courses unless they belong to one of the 40registered life-saving clubs. And despite the EducationMinistry's keenness to have children learn how to swim, teachingtechniques on personal survival are absent from school curriculumguidelines.The NPA makes a yearly effort to give school children lectureson water safety and it increases its patrol around accident proneareas. But, even so, since the beginning of July, 382 deaths havealready occurred (some 21 others are still unaccounted for).Sixty of the victims were children."I personally wish that schools would someday include personalsurvival skills as part of their swimming lessons," saidKobayashi.A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Swimming is noexception.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996LIFE: How stressed are you?from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996By TOSHIO JOAsahi Evening NewsWhich would be more devastating, your wife's death or yourcompany's bankruptcy?A ridiculous question? Not for Japanese men in their 40s and50s, who are committing suicide in increasing numbers because ofrising work-related stress, experts say.Middle-aged men actually suffer the same amount of stress whenfaced with their company's failure as they do when a spouse dies,according to a survey by a group of Osaka-based psychotherapists.The survey recorded the results of a stress test designed andconducted by Makoto Natsume, director at the Mental HealthPromotion Division at the Osaka Prefectural Mental Health Center,and his colleagues.The 1988 test asked some 480 men between the ages of 40 and 59to rate the intensity of shock they would feel in the abovescenarios on a scale of zero to 100. Men in their 50s gave bothcrises the same average score 78. Men in their 40s scored theirwives' deaths at 80 and failure by their companies at 78.The survey's startling revelation of an all-consumingcorporate culture was clear when it was conducted during the peakof the economic boom in 1988.It has become tragically clearer in the last eight years.Restructuring bluesAs Japanese companies reel from the effects the deep economicrecession that began in 1991, middle-aged employees are facingstress from overwork, bullying and the once-unthinkablepossibility of losing their jobs.The result: More of them are killing themselves.According to the National Police Agency, 3,626 men in their50s committed suicide last year, up from 3,080 before therecession in 1991. Among these, 898 killed themselves because of"economic and livelihood related problems," leading all of theage groups in the number of suicides committed for similarreasons.While many say the economy is on the rebound--many pointing torising corporate earnings--companies are continuing unprecedentedrestructuring programs that are putting many long-time employeesout of work and generating more stress for those who watch theirjob security erode around them.In May, the nation's unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, itshighest since 1953 when the government first began providingjobless data."The number of patients being treated for stress-relatedproblems here at the Osaka center has increased over the past fewyears," said Natsume, a work stress specialist. "The number offemale patients has increased, too, as a logical consequence ofthe increase in working women.Suicidal tendencies"I estimate that about 60 percent of these patients haveexpressed a desire to die, and about 30 percent actually try tocommit suicide."In terms of personality, people who are diligent at work andfeel strong work responsibility are most prone to work-relateddepression, Natsume and other mental experts say.Toru Sekiya, head of the Sekiya Neuro-Psychiatric Clinic inTokyo's Shibuya Ward, agrees."I cannot help predicting that the number of suicides bypeople in these age groups (40 to 60) will further increase,"said Sekiya.In addition to the threat of job losses, corporaterestructuring has several other stressful effects, Sekiya said.One is that as companies reduce their employees, the remainingworkers have to work hard to take up the slack.Another effect is bullying."In some cases, computer workers or clerical workers arereassigned to become salesmen, which is a typical case ofbullying," Sekiya said.Sekiya described one patient who came to his clinic because ofthe stress he felt after an unfair transfer."He could not kill himself. He could not go to work. And hecould not tell his wife about what happened, feeling that shecould never understand his situation. In the end, he had nowhereelse to go but the clinic," he said.Natsume of the Osaka center shared a similar story about a48-year-old man who tried to commit suicide after a successful26-year career with a general trading house.Natsume said the man, who had a wife and son, was transferredto Europe to be vice president in charge of the company'sbranches in there. He was forced to live alone. As sales falteredand the company headquarters pressured him to improve them, theman became stressed.He started to have trouble sleeping at night and began feelinglonely without having anyone to talk to. Six months after he wastransferred to Europe, he tried to commit suicide by takingsleeping pills.Natsume said the man was found by a neighbor in a coma, buthis life was saved.The man and his wife turned to Natsume for professional help.After six months of resting and counseling, he got over hisdepression, and returned to work."He was lucky because his wife was very understanding andnever said anything negative even though he had to take monthsoff work," Natsume said, adding that good family relations andhobbies for relaxation purposes are two key elements in leading ahealthy life and helping deeply stressed people who have becomedepressed.Work-related suicides or karoshi (death caused by overwork)has drawn the attention of lawyers.In March, a landmark ruling was handed down when the TokyoDistrict Court ordered Dentsu Inc. to pay about 120 million yenin damages to the parents of an employee who killed himself inAugust 1991. The court attributed the suicide to depressioncaused by overwork and lack of sleep.Since the start of 1996, a Karoshi Hot Line Service, a legaladvice and counseling service provided by a nationwide group oflawyers, has received many calls from the relatives of men whohave killed themselves because of work-related depression.Feeling responsibilityOne of them was a 40-something middle manager for amanufacturing company. He committed suicide because of depressionbrought on by his sense of heavy responsibility at work, hisrelatives said. Before he died, he would come home around 11 p.m.and leave home 4:30 a.m.Another man in his 40s threw himself into the path of anoncoming train. He had to work long hours on weekdays and workeven on weekends. Before he took his own life, he oftencomplained to his family members that he could not sleep atnight."Japanese salaried men in their 40s and 50s should learn morefrom younger people, who do not see work as being everything inlife," said the Osaka center's Natsume."I believe that one of the darkest sides to the ongoingrestructuring within the Japanese business community is the factthat many of the people who have been let go contributed tobetter workplace human relations. Their departure has made theJapanese workplace atmosphere and environment cold and less humanat the expense of productivity."Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996National Briefsfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996Sex shop slaying investigatedTokyo police began questioning four employees of a chain ofsex-related businesses, arrested on suspicion of fraud, violationof the Stimulants Control Law and the Swords and Firearms Law,over the disappearance late last year of the owner of thebusiness and a manager, police said Friday.Police said they suspected the owner and the manager, both 33,were murdered for money and their bodies were dumped somewhere.Last Thursday, investigators raided four clubs belonging to thesex chain, police said.The four were arrested in separate cases.In January, the owner's father reported to police that his sonhad been missing from his condominium in Shibuya Ward sinceDecember last year, police said.

One of the keyresponsibilities of the metropolitan government during such acrisis would be to communicate with foreign victims and relevantorganizations, such as foreign embassies and consulates.However, while a disaster headquarters will be operated bysenior officials to rehearse command and communicationsprocedures, no member of the metropolitan government'sInternational Affairs Division will be included in theheadquarters team.This is despite the fact that the office's main task in theevent of an earthquake would be to coordinate programs to helpforeigners and communicate with organizations, embassies andconsulates."No specific programs involving foreigners have been includedin this year's drill," said Tetsuo Imasu, head of the division."But we hope we will be able to incorporate some measures nextyear."The division last week announced a program to hire 200language volunteers, both Japanese and non-Japanese, who can helpin the event of disasters. Their jobs will cover a wide range ofactivities, including providing information for foreigners andprinting foreign-language materials, helping foreigners atshelters and assisting foreign rescue teams.The division plans to train the volunteers and hopefullyinclude them in next year's drill.The Kobe Municipal Government says that it has not includedany special programs involving foreigners in its disasterprevention drills scheduled for Tuesday."We are still trying to put together a manual for foreignresidents on what to do in a disaster. Any plan to hold a specialdrill for foreign residents will have to come after that," saidTakashi Yokotani of the Kobe Citizen's Service Bureau.Yokotani said the manual should be completed by the end ofthis fiscal year and the bureau would possibly study plans on howto incorporate foreigners in drills in fiscal 1997."We have invited representatives of various community groups(to the drill), and if they have any contact with foreignresidents, I would assume that they would convey whatever knowhowis needed," said Yokotani.However, the head of a volunteer group in the Kansai regionquestions whether the city-run disaster drills are the best wayto help foreigners prepare for disasters."I don't think that it is such a good idea to have thegovernment set up everything," said Taro Tamura, head of theCenter for Multicultural Information and Assistance."What local governments should do is to nurture and answer theneeds of non-profit groups that are close to the foreignresidents. In the end, that should help foreign residents in adisaster situation," said Tamura.Tamura's group will today provide advice on how to prepare fordisasters in a special radio program to be aired on theKobe-based FM station Cocolo.The program will provide advice on where foreigners can go toget relief supplies and how to apply for gift money.The Kanagawa Prefectural Government also said it does not planany special programs for foreigners in its drill today, but willhold a joint communication exercise with the U.S. military forcesin the prefecture.The city government of Nagoya does not have any plans toinclude foreign residents in its drill, but the city office forinternational exchange will hold a lecture on Sept. 9 on how toprepare for an earthquake."We are aware that it is important to involve foreignresidents. But as many foreign residents are located in scatteredcommunities, it is difficult to get them all together," saidFumitaka Kito of the Nagoya International Center.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List CopyrightASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS               via NewsNetSeptember 2, 1996Conventions show chameleon side of U.S. politicsfrom ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996By YOICHI FUNABASHIAsahi ShimbunCHICAGO--Both Republicans and Democrats blurred theirtraditional party lines at presidential conventions last month towoo crucial floating voters for their candidates, Bob Dole andBill Clinton.In past presidential elections, Republicans made it a rule tounderscore patriotism, while Democrats used to give top priorityto standard of living.In an attempt to disguise their hawkish and dovish feathers,however, Republicans and Democrats presented strikingly similarstances in San Diego and Chicago on key policy issues such as therole of government, family ties and crime.It seems that Republicans and Democrats had better trade theirmascots, the elephant and the donkey, for the chameleon.Republicans and Democrats have also shed their traditionalimages as the stern father and the affectionate mother.Republicans selected Susan Molinari, a representative from NewYork, as the convention's keynote speaker to project a soft imageto win support from women--the lack of which is viewed as Dole'sAchilles' heel.The party election machine tactically focused TV cameras onher five-month-old daughter, held in the arms of Molinari'sfather.The Clinton administration, meanwhile, has taken a harder linesince Democrats suffered a devastating defeat in elections twoyears ago largely because male white voters expressed discontentwith the party's generous welfare spending, lax crime control,and liberal affirmative action programs.Democrats have recently attacked big government, even scalingdown welfare programs which had long been the core of theirplatform.In point of fact, huge fiscal deficits afford little policyleeway to either Republicans or Democrats other than to proposesmall government.While the two parties try to transform their images,traditionalists are shaking both camps.Jesse Jackson galvanized his Democrat audience by criticizing"fundamentalist" Republican elements seeking to minimize welfaresupport, restrict foreign imports, oust immigrants, and opposeabortion.But the Democratic Party, too, has been a patchwork of manyinterest groups. The disappearance of the old threat from theformer Soviet bloc has made this more evident, as it cast loosedivergent voices within both party folds.As rhetorical strategy, Republicans and Democrats havesimilarly labeled themselves as progressives, shunning suchRight-Left stereotypes as conservatives and liberals.Clinton is particularly adept at this, and he is often deridedas a "Republican Lite," like the beer, or in this sense apseudo-Republican.That is why Molinari pleased Republican audiences when shemade fun of the president's opportunism. She said her speech--like Clinton's campaign promises--will not last long and willsound just like a Republican's.At the same time, her words revealed the frustrations withinthe Grand Old Party, whose traditional policy strengths have beensuccessfully mimicked by the Democratic Party.In his showdown with the73-year-old Dole, Clinton, 50, portrays himself as the man whorepresents the interests of 77 million U.S. baby boomers.In his nomination acceptance speech, Dole said he wants toserve as a bridge to regain the U.S. values in the good old days--the values he himself represents.The patriotism voiced by someone like Dole, whose right handis handicapped from World War II injuries, exerts tremendouspressure on Democrats, particularly on Clinton, who has beenaccused of shirking military service during the Vietnam War.To fight back, Democrats mobilized young children--among themClinton's daughter Chelsea--at the convention, to symbolize theircontrary argument that the next president must serve as a bridgeto the future, not to the past.When he celebrated the 50th anniversary of his birthdayshortly before the convention, Clinton said yesterdays willoutnumber tomorrows from now on.His reference to yesterdays seems to suggest the hugepolitical clout that the U.S. baby boomer generations haveacquired to protect their interests.Clinton intentionally did not invite Jimmy Carter to theconvention. Carter ignominiously lost reelection in 1980, andClinton did not want his own nomination tarnished by associationwith the former Democratic president. The snub may also reflectClinton's own ego, his belief that he belongs to a generationcompletely different to Carter's.At the conventions, Dole and Clinton were evenly matched.If outward show is all that matters in politics, theRepublican Party might have taken a slight lead.In their speeches, Dole dwelt on his past and Clinton listedpolicy challenges. Dole may have better impressed voters withsincerity, whereas Clinton may have displayed greater politicaldexterity.But the booming economy and comfortable leads in opinion pollsare firmly supporting the Democrat incumbent. Clinton is contentto draw on his track record in office, and evades directengagement with Dole that might narrow the gap and lend morecredibility to the challenger.It is often a mistake, however, to judge the entire trend ofU.S. politics from the speakers and delegates at presidentialconventions.The consciousness of floating, middle-of-the-road voters--once described as the country's silent majority--is quitedifferent from those people who have recently occupied the TVscreens.Copyright 1996 Asahi ShimbunBack to Headline List WT03-B03-10IA086-000615-B047-21http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it185.html 205.156.212.5 19970122022006 text/html 126640HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:17:51 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:23 GMTContent-length: 126452Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it185.html Sample Issue Copyright ASIA TIMES via NewsNet October 23, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Bankruptcy considered a last, but viable, resort (812 words) Membership to OECD gives Seoul host of labor headaches (716 words) Opening floodgates of goodwill (588 words) Police put their feet down on no-hands truck drivers (355 words) Thailand pins down airwave bandits (703 words) It's extortion, claims News Corp (344 words) Daewoo scoffs at white knight talk (657 words) Hyundai defends plant in Poland (326 words) Copper trader faces long, slow procedure (791 words) Caught in a minefield (1609 words) US, Taiwan take stock of the future (853 words) Themes from the heart (736 words) In Japan, if you build it they will vote for you (1002 words) US public responds to Clinton-Riady scandal with a yawn (1502 words) Peace prizes and troublemakers (162 words) China hopes to clear the theater (177 words) What if we threw a party?

"Therewill not be massive bankruptcy," Li said. "There are issues ofsocial unrest [to consider] but more importantly effects on thebanking system need to be resolved."During the first nine months of this year more than 3,400 companiespetitioned for termination and the number could rise to 5,000 byyear-end. That would be about the same number of companies thathave filed for bankruptcy in the 10 years since the NationalPeople's Congress passed the first bankruptcy law in 1986.Ministry of Finance provisional regulations on the settlement offinancial issues call for further merging and bankruptcy of China'smost indebted state enterprises. The regulations apply to 58 largeand medium-sized pilot cities selected by the State Council(cabinet) earlier this year.Most importantly, the regulations for the first time identifyconcepts of senior and junior debt in Chinese bankruptcyproceedings. Wages owed, social security payments and other welfareprovisions will take priority over repayment of debt. Workers'housing, schools and hospitals cannot be liquidated to pay offdebts.Giving the welfare and resettlement of workers priority has beenthe practice in Chinese bankruptcy proceedings but there have beenno such regulations in the past.Even if state planners could resolve problems of employeeresettlement, the massive debts of state companies make bankerswary of any spate of bankruptcies.Earlier this month the State Statistics Bureau revealed that in1995 total debt in the state sector amounted to 3.36 trillionrenminbi (US$405 billion), outstripping total private bank depositsof Rmb2.97 billion. The bureau reported the asset-liability ratiofor the 148,000 state enterprises at 85 percent.Historically, debt owed to state banks is the last to be paid inany bankruptcy proceeding. Moreover, local officials have nevershied away from bankrupting enterprises so the companies can avoidrepaying large creditors, typically state banks.Even when state banks have been allowed to foreclose on factoriesholding mortgage-backed loans, the results often have beendisastrous.The Sichuan provincial city of Mianyang is one of the pilotlocations for the new bankruptcy regulations. When the city'sMiaoting Paper Mill declared bankruptcy in April 1995, the localcourt ruled that an Rmb11.22 million mortgage-backed debt owed tothe local branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China(ICBC) would be settled through foreclosure of the factory's walls,roads, toilets and sewers.The local courts also ordered five more factories bankrupt,creating total losses for ICBC's Mianyang branch of Rmb70 million.Total assets at the branch amounted to only Rmb110 million. Branchgeneral manager Li Yichun said it would take the bank 15 years towrite off the foreclosures.State bankers pointed out that overvaluation of state assets alsomade bankruptcy an unacceptable practice. Last week's unsuccessfulauction of land use rights at the bankrupt Shanghai No 4 PlasticProducts Factory is indicative of the problem.The land auction, which would have been Shanghai's first for abankrupt enterprise, was organized to raise funds to relocate andre-employ factory workers, as well as repay a company debt ofRmb11.26 million, much of which is owed to ICBC's Shanghai branch.But the Shanghai municipal land planning bureau attached a minimumvalue to the real estate of Rmb2,600 per square meter, well abovethe Rmb2,000 per square meter that developers were prepared to pay.When bids for the minimum price failed to materialize, the auctionwas canceled.A spokesman for Shanghai Light Industry Holding, the parent companyof Shanghai No 4 Plastic Products Factory, said the failure wouldcertainly influence the future auction of property rights for otherbankrupt state companies.Despite such setbacks, observers remain hopeful that recentdevelopments signal a new willingness to tackle the difficultiesfacing the state sector."It's significant that they're speaking about the process," saidGoldman Sach's Li. "If the austerity program should continue itwill create conditions for deterioration of state-owned enterpriseperformance. These new bankruptcyprovisions will give them an outlet to make better use of theirassets."Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Membership to OECD gives Seoul host of labor headachesfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 3by Elizabeth PisaniOnly a few days before South Korea is due to sign on the dottedline for membership of the OECD, the club for rich nations,international trade unionists are once again waving the flag ofworkers' rights, demanding that labor law reforms promised by Seoulbe speeded up.International activists tell tales of abuses in South Korean-ownedfactories around the world. "Anti-unionism and worker exploitationhas become another Korean export," said a forthcoming article inthe trade union magazine Free Labour World.Their voices form an unlikely chorus with those of the verycompanies they criticize. South Korea's giant conglomerates, too,want to see labor laws changed, but for very different reasons.While trade unionists complain that present law makes it too hardfor workers to organize, employers complain laws make it too hardto fire staff.The Brussels-based International Confederation of Free Trade Unions(ICFTU) had been lobbying hard for labor laws to be changed beforethe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development formallyinvited South Korea to join the body, which now groups 28 of theworld's leading economies.Unionists feared that once the invitation was issued, as it was onOctober 15, Seoul would have no incentive to change restrictivelabor laws. European Union Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan recentlyreminded South Korean legislators that OECD nations would continueto press for labor reforms. But when Seoul finally signs anagreement to join the largely Western group in Paris on Friday, theimpetus may well be lost."We have written again today to the labor minister to remind him ofthe commitments he has made," an ICFTU official said on Monday. Thetrade union grouping, working with two South Korean affiliates, isconcerned above all with a law which forbids unionists who do notwork in a given company to support or mediate in that company'slabor disputes.Ironically, this law is something of a headache for employers, too.While it does cut out the possibility of activists working acrossa whole industry, the present system puffs up wage bills. Employersfind they are picking up the paychecks for dozens of workers whospend all their time on union activities.Unionists would like, too, to see workers permitted to join any oneof a range of labor organizations - at present the law limitsworkers to one union per company. "Our third bone of contention isthe prohibition on public sector workers' union membership," theICFTU official said.None of the international trade union body's demands go beyondconventions promoted by the United Nations' International LaborOrganization (ILO) agency. As Asian governments fight to keepworkers rights off the agenda at world trade talks scheduled forDecember in Singapore, they are touting the ILO as the proper forumfor labor issues.Asian nations reason that elaborate social security systems thatprotect workers are inappropriate to their level of development.Labor activists counter that they are asking for the ILO minimum.They have also said that the "developing economy" argument did nothold water coming from South Korea, the OECD's second Asian memberafter Japan. South Korea exported US$3 billion in investments in1995 and half that amount again in only the first three months of1996.Every day the European media has stories of a new South Koreantriumph. Investment is promised in televisions, in semiconductors,in cars. Even European aircraft are on the block to South Koreanbidders.And yet, pointed out Free Labour World, papers around the worldwere also heaving with reports of labor unrest at Korean-ownedfactories. From Argentina to Vietnam, workers are reported to behumiliated or mistreated by their South Korean bosses. "Koreanmultinationals make very bad ambassadors in most countries," saidan article due to appear in the November issue of the magazine.Its bad reputation notwithstanding, Korea appears keen to passskills on to others. Several groups, finding they have lost seniorstaff in overseas companies after a takeover, have called for moretraining of foreign managers in Korea. And Seoul has promised topump US$10 million into a job training center in Beijing.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Opening floodgates of goodwillfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1by Francesco Lao Xi SisciSino-German relations are back on track after several months offriction, according to both sides, and China has welcomed Bonn'simportant backing for its Three Gorges dam project.Four months after Beijing angrily canceled his original visit,German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has been given a high-profilereception in Beijing. The welcome did not cool even when Kinkelraised the thorny issue of human rights."There had been bumps in Sino-German relations... but things arenow resolved," Kinkel said on Monday after meeting his Chinesecounterpart Qian Qichen. Qian also said relations were back tonormal.China has welcomed plans for a visit by German President RomanHerzog next month but was even more pleased by German support forThree Gorges.Bonn in recent weeks has agreed to guarantee German investment inthe project, the German side announced. It was a groundbreakingresult for China after the United States and Japan had refused todo likewise and the World Bank withheld support. The dam across theYangtze River, brainchild of late chairman Mao Zedong, andpersonally encouraged by Premier Li Peng, will cost US$30 billion.Opponents fear it will cause serious environmental damage forquestionable benefits.The Chinese believe the dam, which when completed would be theworld's largest, will end periodic floods along the Yangtze andincrease China's power capacity by 18,000 megawatts.German support is politically and economically very importantfollowing China's recent announcement of a US$1 billion bond issueto finance the project.The Chinese Financial Daily reported on Monday that 17 billionrenminbi (US$2 billion) had already been invested. On Tuesday theGuangming Daily reported that Li Peng had visited the site andspoke to people who will be forced to move.A total of 1.07 million people must be relocated from the area tobe flooded. The dam will be completed in the year 2009.Kinkel's July visit was postponed after the German parliamentpassed a resolution on Tibet critical of Beijing.Kinkel, who met Communist Party leader and State President JiangZemin and Li Peng on Tuesday, raised the cases of dissidents WeiJingsheng and Wang Dan during his meeting with Qian on Monday.Wang Dan, 27, a veteran of the Tiananmen Square protests, has beencharged with subversion and could receive a sentence ranging from10 years to life.Wei, sentenced in 1994 to a 14-year jail term for subversion, hasalready spent nearly 15 years in prison.Kinkel described his meeting with Qian, at which he raised theplight of the dissidents, as very cordial.Other foreign visitors who raised human rights issues, andspecifically individual cases, customarily received a frostyresponse.The German government has been accused by opposition parties inBonn of going soft on China over human rights for the sake oflucrative contracts. Engineering giant Siemens is bidding to supplygenerators to Three Gorges.Kinkel said on Tuesday Germany was considering opening anindustrial park in the central city of Wuxi. He said China was keento use German technology in the fields of transport,telecommunications and infrastructure."China and Germany complement each other in many ways, they ideallydovetail," he said.Germany is China's largest European trading partner and its fourthlargest global trading partner.

"That has greatly increasedthe risks of driving on the highway."Some were even spotted eating from lunch boxes or playing withtheir mobile phones while letting go of the wheel."Such maverick driving often occurs at night, when traffic is lightor drivers are tired after long hours on the road, or in trafficjams.But without a new rule police have no legal power to crack down.The rule will clearly specify that steering with one's feet ortaking both hands off the wheel is an offense.Offenders will face a fine of NT$3,000 (US$109) to NT$6,000.Enforcing the rule may, however, prove difficult. "Even the cameramight not be able to catch a clear picture of what's going oninside a truck," said Lin Wein-hsien, secretary-general of theTruck Cargo Transportation Association. "The police will havetechnical problems in coming up with solid evidence."But Lin said the passage of the rule could in itself serve as awarning to delinquent drivers.Truckers are currently among the most dangerous drivers on Taiwan'scrowded highways. According to the Taiwan Area National FreewayBureau, trucks and other large cargo vehicles made up only 22percent of the traffic flow on highways in 1995 but accounted for31 percent of accidents.The figure is alarming but still a distinct improvement on 1994when trucks accounted for 44 percent of accidents.Taiwan truckers are also notorious for forcing other vehicles outof their way by flashing their headlights immediately behind them.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Thailand pins down airwave banditsfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1by Jaruwan NgammanIn Bangkok's bustling Mahboonkrong shopping center, if you want tomake an international phone call the price charged is usually asteal - literally. Illegal cellular phone operators there let youcall using "stolen numbers" and the final bill winds up in thehands of some unsuspecting subscriber.After five years of rapid growth Thailand's cellular phonecompanies, who claim to provide first world technology in adeveloping economy, are now confronting what once used to be afirst world problem - air time theft.Worried by the way it is wreaking havoc on customers' bills andsiphoning away millions of baht in revenue each year, two of thecountry's biggest cellular phone operators, Advanced Info Service(AIS) and Total Access Communication (TAC), are teaming up to curbthe illegal business.The companies, which until recently held a duopoly over thecountry's lucrative cellular phone market, have launched a campaignaimed at alerting customers and warning off air time thieves.Last week Thai police arrested three illegal mobile phone operatorswho allegedly coordinated their business with employees of AIS."We are determined to send illegal air time operators to jail,"said AIS vice-president Vuthiporn Chaipayom.AIS plans to spend more than 200 million baht (US$7.8 million) toinstall the Subscriber Identity Security system at its 29 telecombase stations by year end. The SIS International Gateway Office, aninternational air time theft agency based in the Netherlands, willmonitor the system for an annual fee of 12 million baht.The key to preventing air time theft, said industry executives, wasto safeguard the passwords encrypted in signals emanating frommobile phones which enable access to the telecom network for makingdomestic and international calls.One way in which thieves - usually cellular phone repair shopowners - get their hands on the passwords is through handlinghandsets given to them for maintenance.Industry executives also blame the problem on those subscribers whoemploy repair shops to tune inexpensive handsets for other familymembers who want to use the same mobile phone number. In theprocess, they unwittingly give the repair shop access to theirpasswords.Passwords can also be deciphered through the use of specialdevices, such as those manufactured by one California-basedcompany, which intercepts and decodes signals between cellularphones and base stations.Each "stolen number" is usually used for only a couple of monthsbefore the original subscribers get wise to the fact that theirbills are being inflated by illicit calls.The price charged for such pirated cellular phones is often as lowas 10,000 baht, whereas normal subscribers pay twice as much forthe handset, a one-time registration fee of 4,000 baht and amonthly subscription fee of 500 baht."We will need the cooperation of our customers in preventing airtime theft," said TAC vice-president Somyot Woraprechapanich. TACexecutives said the company had set up shop at Mahboonkrong to keepan eye on illegal phone operators in coordination with the police.According to Somyot, the company has already spent more than 100million baht on the installation of a new security system for itsnetwork. TAC also has plans to impose a ceiling on the amount ofinternational calls next year, after consultations with itsclients.The crackdown stems in part from the prospect of growingcompetition in the sector, which makes maximizing revenues apriority for cellular operators.In July this year, a legal advisory body did away with themonopolies granted to AIS and TAC by state-owned telecom companiesin 1990.Another theory is that the present campaign is part of thecompanies' efforts to push sales of their digital mobile phoneservices, said to be less prone to air time theft than analogsystems.Both companies, after starting out with cellular phones usinganalog systems five years ago, have in recent years investedheavily in digital telecom networks and are finding it difficult toattract new subscribers, due to a number of reasons including theirhigher cost.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996It's extortion, claims News Corpfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16by Yaroslav TrofimovRupert Murdoch, probably the most powerful man in the global mediabusiness, would be ill-advised to come to Israel. If he does,Israeli tax authorities warn, he will be certainly "invited forquestioning" and maybe even arrested.According to accusations put forward by Israel's Income TaxAuthority (ITA), Murdoch's main concern in the Jewish state, NewsDatacom Research, a fully-owned subsidiary of Sydney-based NewsCorp, has "swindled" Israel's Treasury out of tens of millions ofdollars.In what is being described by the Israeli media as "the biggest taxfraud in Israeli history", the ITA claims that News Datacom did notreport as much as US$150 million of income between 1989 and 1996.The company's executives, accountants and attorneys have alreadybeen interrogated by ITA investigators.Murdoch has vehemently denied the accusations, blaming disgruntledformer employees for instigating the scandal."The company has filed all required tax returns and paid allapplicable taxes... statements to the media appear to be a resultof a continued extortion campaign by former employees who have beensued in the United Kingdom by News Datacom for defrauding it ofmillions of dollars," News Datacom said.The company employs 250 people at its research laboratory inJerusalem and manufacturing facility in Haifa. It produces theso-called "smart cards" used by Murdoch-owned satellite venturessuch as Hong Kong-based StarTV and London-based British SkyBroadcasting, which ensure that only paid-up subscribers can accessthe encrypted programming.The technology for the cards is based on an invention by Israelimathematician Adi Shamir, who until recently served as a NewsDatacom director. Shamir has already been questioned by the ITA.News Datacom allegedly reported only a fraction of paymentsreceived for the technology and software that it developed inIsrael and "smuggled" abroad.The bulk of the income it had earned was allegedly paid toMurdoch-owned companies in Hong Kong, where the tax rate is muchlower.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Daewoo scoffs at white knight talkfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16by Claude Albert and Philip Golub, Asia TimesThe chairman of South Korea's Daewoo Electronics on Tuesdaydismissed reports of a counter-offer for France's ThomsonMultimedia as a "joke", but sought to mollify French critics of thedeal with his firm."We have been working very seriously on the bid for the past sixmonths and I don't see any new global offer being presented at thislate stage," Bae Soon-hoon told a news conference.Thomson Multimedia is the consumer electronics arm of Thomson,which is due to be privatized by the end of the year. The Frenchgovernment announced last week it had selected an offer fromFrance's Lagardere and Daewoo for Thomson over a competing bid byAlcatel Alsthom.Daewoo Electronics is to take over 85 percent or more of ThomsonMultimedia, a world leader in digital technologies and the world'sfourth largest television maker. The partnership will create theworld's largest television producer.The French business press suggested this week that a rival Frenchbidder for Thomson Multimedia was about to be found. The Liberationdaily on Tuesday said Sagem, which fell out of the race earlier,was preparing such a bid. Sagem denied any bid and Bae dismissedthe idea.Daewoo's purchase has provoked intense criticism from an array ofbusiness interests, trade unions and political parties, all of whomdenounced the sell off of one of France's leading high-techcompanies to a foreign group.Discord spread within the government, with senior officials closeto National Assembly President Philippe Seguin voicing strongopposition to the deal."The government failed for years to recapitalize ThomsonMultimedia, forcing the company to pay exorbitant interest on itsoutstanding debt," said Elie Cohen of the French National Centerfor Scientific Research, one of the more articulate critics of thesale.As a result, said Cohen, it is being sold just when it is headingtowards profitability. "France would not sell Thomson Multimedia toa foreign company at this time if it still had an industrialambition of its own," he said.The critics are unlikely to deter the French government from itschosen course. La Tribune on Tuesday quoted sources close to thefinance minister as saying that even if the government received anew bid it could not consider it since Thomson as a whole and notany particular part was being privatized.Asked about one of the more contentious issues of the takeover -the amount of debt which Daewoo will assume - Bae said "we are notallowed to make it public". Out of a total debt of FF14 billion(US$2.69 billion), Daewoo Electronics is thought to have agreed topay FF4.8 billion. But, when asked whether his group would bewilling or able to take on the total debt, Bae said: "I think so,yes."Bae reiterated that Daewoo Electronics would stick to itscommitment to create 5,000 jobs at Thomson Multimedia in fiveyears. He said the firm's independence would be maintained bykeeping its headquarters in Paris.The statement is unlikely to mollify critics who have expressedconcern that Daewoo could radically revamp the managementstructure.Bae did not allay this concern but did say that most of the topmanagement would remain French, adding: "It is hard to imagine thatKoreans would come to live in Paris though they love to visit it astourists."Though it is unlikely to upset the deal, the political pressure hasalready pushed Lagardere and Daewoo to alter some prior agreements.Last week Jean-Luc Lagardere said the two groups would create acommon subsidiary for next-generation consumer electronic products,rather than simply ceding Thomson Multimedia's high-tech digitalactivities to Daewoo.French interests will thus retain a say in the more sensitivehigh-tech sectors.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Hyundai defends plant in Polandfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16by Andrea Thalemann, Asia TImesThe Polish government is expected to announce on Wednesday whetherSouth Korea's largest chaebol, Hyundai, had illegally establisheda car assembly plant in Poland only days before a new decree onimport duty waivers took effect.The Polish Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of ForeignEconomic Cooperation have questioned the legality of an officiallicence which permitted Hyundai and its Polish partner Universal inAugust to import car parts without paying 35 percent import duty.The licence was issued by the Ministry for Foreign EconomicCooperation and then suspended after a sudden change in importregulations for car parts.Hyundai and Universal said they were victims of intentionallyuntransparent government regulations.Last July, the companies agreed to assemble 15,000 models in thefirst year, taking into account Polish law which grants companiesthat assemble more than 1,000 cars a year in Poland, duty-freeimports of parts.The two companies received official permission for their venture onAugust 8, when Universal heard of an imminent change to theexisting regulations whereby duty waivers would be granted only tocar manufacturers already in operation.That sent the infant venture scrambling for proof of its existence.In a matter of days, Hyundai brought in assembly kits and a Koreantechnician to an unused factory north of Warsaw. By August 24, theyhad assembled the first batch of cars.Two days later, the new regulation was published in the LegalGazette. It required every foreign car maker to apply for newimport permits effective on August 24 - the day Hyundai hadinvoiced its first cars.There was, however, no official announcement before or on the daythe decree went into effect.Hyundai said without a duty waiver, its cars would be effectivelypriced out of the Polish car market.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Copper trader faces long, slow procedurefrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16by Richard HansonYasuo Hamanaka, the 48-year-old former Sumitomo Corp copper traderat the heart of one of history's most spectacular financial losses,was sent through the gates of the cream-colored Tokyo DetentionHouse on Tuesday, a journey made by some of Japan's most famouspoliticians and criminals.Prosecutors arrested the mild-mannered Hamanaka, after criminalcharges were filed by his former employer alleging that he had,over the past three years, forged hundreds of order forms and otherdocuments to cover up huge losses while he was in charge ofSumitomo's multibillion dollar global copper trading operations.Breach of trust charges are being prepared.In June, Hamanaka was fired when the company revealed copper tradelosses of US$1.8 billion. Last month, Sumitomo said the loss was aslarge as US$2.6 billion.In size, the loss eclipses that of Baring's US$1.3 billion stockindex futures debacle in Singapore two years ago, and Daiwa Bank'sUS$1.1 billion New York bond trading loss in September 1995.In all three cases, the seemingly loyal, profit-making employee wasgiven freedom to operate with loose management controls and eachone had hidden his losses for extended periods from both managementand the regulatory authorities.Sumitomo said Hamanaka's first losses in copper trading occurredabout 10 years ago on the London Metal Exchange. He had extensivedealings with companies in the United States and was able to borrowlarge amounts of funds from many of the top banks in the world,based on the supposed backing of the giant Sumitomo trading house.At the height of his fame, Hamanaka was dubbed within the market asMr Copper or Mr Five Percent - the share of the world copper marketthat Sumitomo controlled at one time.It was said that he accounted for half of the copper trades on theLondon Metal Exchange at one point.The Sumitomo copper scandal has prompted what is now described asclose cooperation among criminal-justice authorities in Britain,the US and Japan.In the US, where Sumitomo has closed its metals trading business,six lawsuits have been filed against the trading house bycustomers. A lawyer in Tokyo is preparing to file a suit on behalfof a group of Japanese shareholders against Sumitomo's management.Hamanaka has the distinction of being the first and, so far, theonly person to be charged in the copper scandal by the TokyoProsecutors Office.The office raided his house in a suburb of Tokyo on early Tuesdaymorning. Neither Sumitomo nor the prosecutors disclosed exactlywhere Hamanaka was arrested, although he was seen being taken bycar into the Tokyo Detention House at around 3.30pm.The wheels of criminal justice grind slowly and deliberately inJapan, as prosecutors build their case. Initially, suspects can bedetained for questioning in the sparsely-furnished cells of thedetention house for up to a month, and even longer if furthercharges are filed.The late former prime minister Kakuei Tanaka was so detained overtwo decades, and later convicted, in the famous Lockheed aircraftbribery scandal of the mid-1970s. A more recent example was ShokoAsahara, leader of the now-disbanded Aum Supreme Truth religiousgroup, who is on trial for masterminding a deadly 1995 poison gasattack on the Tokyo subway system.Hamanaka's alleged crimes involved no claims of personal gain, andwere certainly not heinous, but they were still surrounded byriddles over who else might have been involved and the role ofSumitomo's own management.At a news conference on Tuesday, a Sumitomo executive would notcomment on either the names of the clients that Hamanaka had tradedwith outside of Japan, or even the names of the countries in whichthey lived.Sakuo Nanba, general manager of Sumitomo's legal department, wasalso reported to have said that the company's internalinvestigation so far had not found evidence that Hamanaka wasmanipulating the world copper market - a key point in theinvestigation.Hamanaka's alleged forgery involved two types of documents, whichwere drawn up in the hundreds over the past three years whiletrying to conceal losses from management. One used falsifiedsignatures of two senior Sumitomo officials between January andMarch 1994 to place orders with customers. Another used inSeptember that year said Hamanaka had sole authority over the useof funds obtained overseas.The details over how Hamanaka managed to run up US$2.6 billion inlosses have not been disclosed. The scam was only unraveled earlierthis year when Hamanaka was about to be promoted and posted toIndonesia.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Caught in a minefieldfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 11by Karen Back, for Asia TimesLieutenant-Colonel Garth Barrett used to plant land mines as asoldier. Now he makes a living destroying them. An expert in minedetection and destruction, he has worked for the past several yearsas a consultant to defense contractors. He has also helped UnitedNations forces carry out peace-keeping operations in Mozambi queand Bosnia where he's helmed "nonmilitary operations torehabilitate countries" - clearing land mines, restoring powerlines and reopening roads."After a war is over, the mines are still in the ground and don'tcare who the enemy is," said Barrett. "They detonate wheneversomebody stands on them or runs over them with a vehicle. There'sno limitation on who they maim."If you step on a land mine, what should you do? "Once you step onthem, they go bang. You're going to lose part of a limb," he said."The Western mines don't do as much damage as the old Soviet-blocmines. The Western anti-personnel mines have far less explosives inthem - they will quite often take a foot off only up to your ankle.But with a Soviet anti-personnel mine, you'll quite often lose yourleg below the knee." He has seen colleagues die after stepping onmines because "you can't get medical aid to them quick enough. Theylose blood too quickly to be saved."Barrett works on contracts for companies such as ScienceApplications International Corporation. A mine clearance job couldrun from three weeks to three years. His longest stint so far wastwo-and-a-half years in Mozambique, where he and his crew de-minedapproximately 4,000km of road. Mine clearance is not cheap. Aproject can cost from US$2 million to US$50 million. A typical2,000km of road costs from US$5 million to US$10 million to clear,takes from four to six months and utilizes four mine-protectedvehicles. The mine-clearing contingent of 50 people live in eithertents or caravans using mobile showers, eating cooked breakfasts,cold lunch and a barbecued dinner. Nightly recreation on-siteincludes Rambo-type videos and books. Barrett likes to read authorsJohn Clancy and Darryl Brown.The mine detection system he uses, Checkmate, is unique, he said,because it only looked for the explosive vapor which every minehas. Other systems use metal detection and ground-penetratingradar. Samples of air are taken either manually or byremote-controlled miniature aircraft, about the size of modelplanes, which fly over suspected mine fields. The air vapor, a kindof a fingerprint, is captured on to an absorbent compound in asmall tube which is presented to a trained dog kept in a sterileenvironment who determines from the scent whether there's evidenceof a mine there. If the dog makes a positive ID, a specific area issearched.Born in Rhodesia, Barrett, who moved to southern California in theUnited States in 1994, learned his trade "purely by accident". Hesaid: "In Africa we had a land mine war engaged by the guerrillas,freedom fighters, whatever you want to call them, over the past25-odd years, so we developed a lot of techniques to protectvehicles transporting soldiers. After taking an advanceddemolitions course, I started to learn about mines."Explosives training was a requirement for Special Forces troops inRhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Barrett commanded a Special Forcesregiment, leading counter-terrorist/ counter-insurgency operations. "We killed guerrillas, terrorists outside our country," hesaid. He twice received Rhodesia's Legion of Merit for combatingterrorism. At the conclusion of the war in Rhodesia and "afterconsultation with Robert Mugabe, the new leader of Zimbabwe",Barrett and his contingent of the Special Air Service immigrated enmasse to South Africa and were inducted into the South Africandefense forces in 1980.He led that unit for a year, retired from the military in 1981 andbegan working in "bomb inhibition", eventually running SuppressionTechnology Systems in Johannesburg, South Africa. Described by acolleague as a "steely-eyed man with a hair-trigger temper", forthe past several years he has also specialized in explosivedetection and land mine clearance."If there are anti-personnel mines, we tramp them out using a 10tonne mine-protected armored vehicle which has a long bomb arm witha special steel wheel with disc rollers on it which digs the mineout of the ground," said Barrett. "We just drive over the mines,which explodes them."Driving over an exploding land mine sounds dangerous. "It's just acloud of dust," said Barrett. "You just carry on driving." Itdoesn't inflict damage on the vehicle because it can withstand 30pounds of explosives, and the mine only has a couple of ounces ofexplosives in it. Does he feel like Rambo driving over a mine in a10 tonne tank? "It's not fun," said Barrett. "Too much dirt anddust coming in."Barrett also told a story about men collecting mines in Kuwait. "Asthey extracted the mines, the men kept throwing them in theirtruck. They threw one too many in there and detonated the wholetruck. About 19 men were killed. But I've been very lucky. I've hadfriends blown up behind me and in front of me. But I've never hitone myself."Sometimes he puts mines in a holding place until he decides how todeal with them. "You don't want to blow a mine next to a roadotherwise you'll cause even more damage," he said. "Often, you'llmove it out of a vulnerable place, put it somewhere nearby andpossibly burn it up using thermit. But you have to be careful youdon't start a fire because thermit burns extremely hot." If thereare anti-tank mines that aren't blast-protected, they blow up."Modern mines have blast protection built into them which means atime-pressure impulse is required on the mine's detonation system,"he explained. "That doesn't exist on an older mine, so you put alight plastic bag inflated with special gas over it which thensends a blast of pressure into the mine and detonates it. Withblast-protected mines, you've got to put an explosive chargedirectly over the mine and blow it."There are two different kinds of mines: Anti-personnel andanti-vehicle. Each has 20 different derivatives. The mines causingmost of the world's problems today are anti-personnel mines,according to Barrett. "When undergrowth regrows it makes itextremely difficult to get to them and deal with them," he said."The biggest problem with anti-personnel mines is because they wereindiscriminately laid on unmarked mine fields. They were designedto affect the population as well as the forces that were fighting."Barrett doesn't wear any protective gear when doing land mineclearance - just khakis and a button-down shirt - and doesn'tconsider himself a risk-taker. "I'm a bit adventurous is aboutall," he said. As a colonel in both the Rhodesian and South Africanarmies, Barrett always regarded mines "as a double-edged sword...In Rhodesia, we were forced to put up a cordon sanitaire [ascreened off area] which included mines. We used mines sparinglyelsewhere but we did use them against our enemy [the guerrillaarmy]." Does Barrett feel differently about mines today? "Landmines will always be a double-edged sword," he said. "They're asbad for the user as they are for the enemy they're supposed todeter."The US government has led the way in trying to get modern mines tohave mechanical or electronic means of being deactivated, or todestroy themselves after a limited period of time to prevent thisdebacle in the future. A large portion of NATO has joined amoratorium on the sale and export of mines, but it is not worldwideyet. Indeed, the US has not agreed to completely cease mine use,citing its involvement on the Korean peninsula.Over the past 20 years land mines have killed more civilians thanmilitary personnel, and at one point in Cambodia they were killing600 people a month.The high toll mines take on civilians was one of the reasonsBarrett moved into mine clearance. "It was an area I knewintimately and it gave me enormous satisfaction to be able to tryto remove a serious menace. To be able to help civilian populationswas something I thought should be done. I believe sincerely thatunless countries, and they're mainly in the Third World, ridthemselves of mines, they will never get off financial aid. Thewealthy countries in the world cannot continue feeding themfinancial aid and it's an essential element for those countries toget back on their feet, get their own economy, their ownagriculture re-established. Without clearing mines, you're notgoing to do that."Unless he steps on a land mine himself, Barrett will not be out ofa job any time soon. The US State Department estimates that thereare 85 million mines in the ground in 68 countries and that nearly3,000 people are killed by unexploded land mines each year.While he enjoys cleaning mines, what he really likes, he said, is"playing golf".Isn't golf a little tame compared to the rest of his life? "You'replaying against yourself, so it's not tame," he said. "And you'vegot to control your own temper and frustration." He laughed."That's why golf is so good. It teaches you to do that."Karen Back is a contributing writer for Asia Times based in LosAngeles.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996US, Taiwan take stock of the futurefrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1by Gene KoprowskiThe United States and Taiwan may be nearing a futures market war asofficials in both countries approach a point-of-no-return in along-running dispute.Taiwanese stock market officials have rejected an offer from theChicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) that would have ended the growingcontroversy over the CME's proposed futures contract based on theTaiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) index.Accordingly, trading of the instrument may commence "before the endof the year", executives at the CME said in a document obtained byAsia Times.Industry insiders said Taiex and Taiwan's Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC) would prefer to pass a futures regulation law forthe country, and have their own futures market up and running,before they started working with the CME - the world's largestfinancial futures exchange.The rejection of the offer to share market data and delay thelaunch of the contract came in a letter from Taiex dated October 11and delivered to CME chairman Jack Sander and president BillBrodsky only last week.Shau-Dai Lin, who heads Taiex, expressed "continued concerns" aboutthe CME's plans to begin offering the futures, fearing they wouldincrease the volatility of the Taipei market, the sixth largeststock market in the world. Taiex also sent the letter about CME tothe US futures regulatory authority, the Commodity Futures TradingCommission (CFTC), headed by Brooksley Born. CME officials saidthey expected a similar letter to be delivered by the Taiwan SECvery shortly.The letter followed a visit in late September by Daung-Yen Lu,chairman of the Taiwan SEC, H W Chien, chairman of the TaipeiSecurities Dealers Association, and officials from Taiex who flewto Chicago to ask the CME to postpone the launch of the futurescontract for a year.Sander and Brodsky tried to address the concerns one week later ina memorandum to all the parties, which indicated that futures wouldnot increase volatility on the Taipei market. Sander and Brodskyalso said that they were quite willing to delay the launch of thecontract until the middle of January 1997 - not until next October,as the Taiwanese wished - but only if Taipei would share data ontrends in the market on demand with CME."The only written response we've gotten is from the Taiwan StockExchange, and it doesn't look like they're going to cooperate withan information-sharing agreement," said Ellen Resnick, aspokeswoman for the Chicago bourse."They expressed continued concerns. They did say that theyrecognized the importance of an information-sharing agreement, butit was worded in such a way that it did not seem like it wassomething they wanted to do. We expect to receive a letter from the[Taiwan] SEC as well. That's where things stand," she said.Sander and Brodsky last Friday sent a reply to the Taiwaneseindicating that if the proposal to share information was notaccepted by the government, the CME would launch the contract asearly as the end of the year."If our latest proposal is not accepted by the Taiwan SEC, we areprepared to launch these contracts upon approval of USauthorities," Sander and Brodsky wrote in a letter dated October18, obtained by Asia Times. "As far as the CME's application forthe contracts is concerned, the CFTC public comment period ended onOctober 10. The comment letters were overwhelmingly in favor of theCME's application. We expect the US authorities to make a decisionregarding our application within the next two months."Late last week, another bourse in the US, the Pacific StockExchange (PSE) - a regional market in San Francisco - announcedthat it too was considering launching its own options, based on theTaiex, with or without Taiwanese partners, officials said."When we launched the Mexican Stock Exchange index, we launchedfutures and the Chicago Board of Trade launched options. ThePacific Stock Exchange deal is similar in that way. We see this asa positive thing," Resnick said. "They did talk to us ahead oftime."The futures and options contract would be derived from the DowJones Taiwan Stock Index, a capitalization weighted, broad-basedindex of 113 Taiwanese stocks, representing more than 80 percent ofTaiwan's market capitalization.Last year, Taiwan traded 267 billion shares and handled more tradesthan the New York Stock Exchange.CME officials earlier this month held a meeting in Taipei with 300futures and securities industry representatives who indicated theywere interested in working with the Chicago bourse.The PSE had also been courting Taiwanese securities industryrepresentatives, and the PSE "plans to work closely" with Taiexofficials, Robert Greber, chairman and chief executive officer ofthe PSE, said. "By trading options on the index now, we'll generateadditional interest and credibility for the Taiwan market," Grebersaid. "We'll also offer the Taiwanese financial community theopportunity to gain invaluable experience before the market opens."Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Themes from the heartfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 10by Priya Tuli, for Asia TimesTake a balmy Jakarta evening, the haunting strains of the sitar,air fragrance mingling with incense and you have October 10 - theopening night of an exhibition of paintings by Parvathi NayarNarayan at the Koi Gallery. Titled The Art of a Woman, this was theIndian-born artist's debut show in Jakarta since moving toIndonesia a year ago.Represented at the exhibition were three distinctly differentstyles, providing an insight into the varied scope and range ofParvathi's work. The majority contained her experimental trademarkin mixed media - an exuberance of color and technique. These largeexpanses of expressive form and color are executed in ink, dye andacrylic, and employ a combination of techniques - pouring andtexturing to produce visual images that are complex andmultilayered.Most of these depict Rajasthani women from northwest India. Theywalk tall and stand proud; their beauty transcends mere featuresand form, and is evident in every step and every gesture. These arewomen who brave the fierce desert heat and walk kilometers each dayto the nearest water source. These are women who raise children andwork just as hard as their menfolk. And these are women who dancewith abandon at festival time in a spontaneous celebration of life.In a defiant response to the brazen desert sun and the drab desertsands, the clothes they wear are vibrant and blazing yellows,brilliant reds, dazzling greens and deep blues - sheer inspirationfor an artist. "The colors I've used are vivid, but never primary.You'll notice they have greater depth and variation than primaries.That's because I never use a color in its pure form. These arecolors I'm comfortable with right now."Part of the same group in terms of technique, the series titledWoman and her Emotions focuses on one dominant color to establishand enhance the depth of each emotion."It's true that color has emotional connections. Woman in Pain justhad to be in blue. I didn't even think about it, it just came sospontaneously. Amusement is in green - a young, frivolous, brightgreen. If I had done one on jealousy, it would have been green too,but a darker, heavier green.Lust had to be earthy brown, with hints of yellow and blue... Youknow, this series was completed in one continuous, intenselycreative spurt that lasted around three or four months. I didn'tfeel that I had come to the end of the series then. But for now, Ido. I might get back to it at a later stage. The strange thing isthat everybody thought they'd be slow to sell, but six of the sevenhave gone already. That just tells me to go on painting from theheart."The next series contained black-and-white, pen-and-ink drawings,where the faces of the women are left blank. This is an interestingdevice that draws upon the viewer to interpret the women'spersonalities subjectively. The last style on view was the moreacademic use of oils. One painting was, Noon Watch, in which alittle girl rocks the makeshift crib where her younger siblingsleeps - a common sight in India.As an artist who rejoices in exploring and experimenting,Parvathi's involvement with technique and texture is amply evidentin the content of this exhibition. As she pointed out: "I spendmore time looking at a painting than actually doing it. I look forthe rhythms, identify what I need to pull out and develop - what Ineed to suppress. I guess that's where the skill counts, indeciding."The effects I get are sometimes planned, sometimes accidental. ButI use the accidents as part of the process, so that carefullyplanned areas combine with the unplanned." That, in a nutshell, isreally what art is all about to Parvathi, a celebration of "being,exploring and becoming". Well traveled, she has lived and paintedin India, London and Singapore. But while her addresses mightchange, Parvathi's distinctive styles simply evolve as thisexhibition clearly demonstrates.The Art of a Woman exhibition at the the Koi Gallery in Jakartaruns until November 4, 1996.Priya Tuli is a freelance writer based in Jakarta.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996In Japan, if you build it they will vote for youfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 9by Bradley MartinThere is one message Japan's voters sent loud and clear in Sunday'selection: "Rev up the concrete mixers!"The pork barrel is the heart and soul of the politics that theLiberal Democratic Party (LDP), Sunday's big winner, practises inelection districts across the land.Critics may complain the result is the rapid despoliation of whatwas once a lovely countryside, as politicians and bureaucratsdevise ever more useless projects with which they can return tolocal communities some of the taxpayers' money filtered, of course,through construction companies, their suppliers and employees.Or foreign environmentalists may ad-vise that the concreteembankments being installed on once-scenic riverbanks, for example,will only have to be removed as the predictably dire effects ofthis destruction of nature become evident. Do voters care? App-arently not. With depressing ease, they are swayed to ignore thewider public interest and cast their ballots for the force they seeas most likely to keep the public works pipeline full. That usuallyis the LDP.Take Shimane prefecture's first district. More than three decadesago, the Agriculture Ministry began planning a massive project tofill in big parts of a large, beautiful lagoon, called Nakaumi,adjoining the Japan Sea coast. The reason: To provide additionalfarmland for the crowded country.It was not long before the government, to deal with excess riceproduction, started paying farmers to stop farming existingfarmland. At that point, naturally the project was dropped, right?Wrong. The Nakaumi project has proved to have a life of its own.The prefectural governor ardently supports its continuation, and sodoes Hiroyuki Hosoda, a politician who ran on the LDP ticket torepresent the district in the Lower House.The national and Shimane prefecture governments each year split thecost of some yen220 billion (US$1.96 billion) worth of public worksprojects. That makes the pork barrel a very major element in thelocal economy. A construction company owner told Asahi Shimbunbefore the election he expected a 40 percent loss in earnings if anon-LDP government should come to power. Hosoda faced nominees ofthe newly-formed Democratic Party and the Communist Party. Bothopposed the Nakaumi project, making it the big local issue in therace. But all the votes cast for those two other candidates puttogether did not equal the tally for the LDP man, who was handilyelected.The people spoke on Nakaumi, and what they said was: "Fill it in."To some extent this represents official and popular trust in theKeynesian notion that a "supplementary budget" of public worksfunds - such as the proposed yen5 trillion package the LDPannounced just before election day - can prime the pump and bringthe economy out of a slump. But some economists say this remedy hasproved less effective, to the point where any resulting positivebounce in the economy is over almost as soon as it has begun.The ill effects live on - notably an ever larger budget deficit forsucceeding generations to shoulder. Deregulation and cuttingbudgets and taxes to leave more money in the hands of consumerswould have far more positive effects.There are plenty more districts like Shimane's first district,where the LDP's construction mania carried the day with voters onSunday. For example, construction companies squarely backed theLDP's candidate in Saitama prefecture's 10th, a mixedbedroom-suburban and rural district that was the focus of an AsiaTimes front-page article last Friday. The LDP man squashed thecandidate of the newly-formed Democratic Party.In Toyama prefecture, the emcee at Tamisuke Watanuki's victorycelebration, before leading three cheers of "Banzai" (long life),enthused that the victory of the former LDP secretary-general meantthe central government would now give serious thought to buildingthe Hokuriku bullet train line. The area's pet scheme would be adreadfully expensive project whose costs, under the currentshare-the-misery policy, would force an increase in fares onprofitable bullet-train routes like Tokyo-Osaka.Construction's domination of politics could be seen in the raw inIbaraki prefecture, where former construction minister KishiroNakamura, awaiting a court ruling on a suspected yen10 millionbribe to put the quietus on a Fair Trade Commission investigationof construction industry collusion, was re-elected. Nakamura hadformally left the LDP after the allegation came to light, and wasrunning as an independent. He told voters he had accepted the moneybut it had been merely a campaign contribution. He boasted hispresence in office provided an important conduit from the centralgovernment to the district.At first glance, Kumamoto prefecture's second district may appearto be an exception to the general rule. There, a loudlypro-construction LDP candidate - a former Construction Ministrybureaucrat who vowed to snare central government funds for suchexpensive projects as a bullet-train line - went down to defeat atthe hands of a candidate who had attacked that traditional sort ofpork-barrel campaigning. So, were the Kumamoto voters finallywising up? Guess again. The winning candidate himself had served astint as construction minister. And in his brochure, where heattacked the pork barrel, he also included photos of a bridge, atrain station and other public works projects he took credit forhaving landed.All the parties in the election were talking about "administrativereform" and about cutting the bureaucracy down to size. PrimeMinister Ryutaro Hashi-moto, president of the LDP, even told votershe knew his place in history would be determined by his success orfailure in carrying out such reforms.But don't bet the farm that an LDP-led coalition government willseriously disrupt the comfortable partnership of bureaucrats withthe construction companies and the LDP lawmakers of the"construction tribe", who protect the ministries' public worksprograms in exchange for political funds and get-out-the-votebacking.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996US public responds to Clinton-Riady scandal with a yawnfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 9by Doug TsuruokaWith two weeks to go before the United States presidentialelection, conservative critics are hoping that a disclosure offinancial donations made to the White House by a prominentIndonesian family and South Korean business interests will throw alast-minute glitch into US President Bill Clinton's re-electioncampaign.Yet one puzzling question in the wake of a decision by theDemocratic National Committee (DNC) to suspend a top Asian-Americanaide pending a probe of his fund-raising activities with Asianbusinessmen is why the issue, so far, has generated only mildpublic attention in the 1996 US presidential race. In pastcampaigns, the taint of "foreign money" would have been enough toderail the aspirations of any candidate for the Oval Office.Many recall the press fallout on then-president Jimmy Carter whenit was divulged in the late 1970s that his brother, Billy, hadclose ties with Libyan diplomats and businessmen. But despite thebest efforts of leading US newspapers like the New York Times andthe Los Angeles Times, the Riady scandal is drawing only mutedoutrage from a bored US electorate.The DNC, the national organization of the Democratic Party which isbacking Clinton's re-election bid, announced last week that JohnHuang, a vice-chairman of its fund-raising arm, will step asidefollowing reports that he sought an illegal US$250,000 politicalcontribution for the Clinton campaign from a South Koreanindustrial conglomerate. The contribution - from the South Koreanelectronics company, Cheong Am - was returned after it wasuncovered by a local newspaper.Huang, a former employee of the Riadys and a Democratic fund-raiserin the key electoral state of California, is also under thespotlight for his ties to the Riadys - a family of Indonesianindustrialists who control the Lippo Group of companies and whomade a series of apparently legal campaign contributions to Clintonduring his 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns. Huang is also saidto have secured a top appointment to the US Commerce Departmentbecause of his relationship with the Riadys and US Democrats.The donations by the Riadys and suggestions of favoritism by theWhite House emerged against the backdrop of Clinton's efforts toarrange a billion-dollar sale of US F-16 fighter jets to Indonesia,a red-carpet reception for Indonesia's President Suharto inWashington last year and reports the Riadys once tried to enter thebanking industry in Clinton's home state of Arkansas.But US voters are so apathetic to the issue of foreign money inthis year's election that not one of the "typical" Americansselected to question Clinton and his Republican opponent RobertDole at a presidential debate in California on October 16 botheredto bring it up.Participants were so indifferent, in fact, that Dole, frustrated atthe lack of focus on foreign policy matters at the debate lastweek, was forced to volunteer a pointed reference to "rich people"in Indonesia and other foreign countries in a jibe at Clinton'scampaign ethics - though the question posed had nothing to do withthe Riadys or their alleged influence at the White House.Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to open aCongressional inquiry into the affair - which is laced with reportsthat James Riady, a scion of the Indonesian family, used hisfinancing clout with the Democrats to arrange a special audiencewith Clinton while the president was attending a meeting of topSoutheast Asian leaders in Jakarta in late 1995.But most Democratic and Republican analysts in Washington havealready concluded the scandal will not do irreparable harm toClinton's re-election bid. White House aides, moreover, appear tohave parried the bad publicity by insisting that all contributionsfrom the Riadys were "legal".How to explain this absence of interest on the part of the USelectorate? There are three factors which appear to havecontributed to the scandal's non-effect on Clinton.The first is simply that the flap over the Riadys pales before ahost of other scandals which have hit the White House over the lastfour years.With the president and First Lady Hillary Clinton still underscrutiny in the so-called Whitewater banking and influence scandaland its possible link to the still-mysterious suicide of a WhiteHouse counsel - the Indonesian-South Korean donations are hardlythe stuff which tabloid headlines are made of.The Riady affair hardly compares in entertainment value to theconfessions of alleged Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers in the1992 presidential race and this year's far juicier reports that topClinton tactician Dick Morris, the architect of the president's"family values" campaign pitch, allowed a call girl to listen froma hotel room to his telephone conversations with the president.A second factor is the Riady affair is not the first time big Asianmoney has been involved in a Washington influence-peddling scheme.Interestingly, the Riadys appear to have offended far fewerAmericans in the economic growth-obsessed US of the 1990s than wasthe case nearly 20 years ago.In January 1978, a Washington-based South Korean lobbyist, ParkTong-sun, admitted in Seoul that he had dispensed US$850,000 to anumber of US Congressmen in an affair laced with allegations ofsexual favors which came to be known as the Koreagate scandal.Former California congressman Rich-ard T Hanna was sentenced to aprison term for his role in the scandal, while five other houseDemocrats were reprimanded in the influence-peddling scheme whichwas intended to tilt US politicians in favor of Seoul following anabrupt US pullout from South Vietnam.The Koreagate affair stirred anti-foreign sentiment in the US at atime when the media was rife with reports of Saudi Arabianbusinessmen buying up US properties.But a change seems to have taken place in the US mentality in thelast two decades. A seemingly endless eruption of successorscandals to the famed Watergate scandal of the early 1970s hasimbued most US voters with a sense of cynical worldliness.Coupled with the globalization of the US economy since the 1980sand a renewed search for overseas profits following the recent USrecession, news that a US president cultivated allies and receivedlegal donations from a Southeast Asian country where the US isseeking to sell high-tech fighter planes, leaves most Americansyawning. The Riady affair just does not sound so bad at a time whenthe fate of many US firms depends on markets like China and the USCommerce Department scours the globe searching for contracts for UScompanies.The third factor tempering US political reaction to the Riadyscandal is the rising clout of the Asian-American community.Whereas two decades ago, Asian-Americans were still viewed as aninvisible minority in US elections, this is no longer the case.Surging birth rates, disposable incomes, voter registration levelsand improved political organization have made Asian-Americans aforce to be reckoned with on the US political scene - asillustrated by Huang's elevation to the key Democratic fund-raisingpost.Dole and other Republican critics of the Riady affair have alsometiculously avoided alluding to the scandal in ethnic termsfearful of alienating potent Asian-American constituencies inCalifornia - a state which Dole must wrest from Clinton if he is tohave any chance of winning the White House in November.Said Kim Young-kun, a professor of political science at theGraduate School of the City University of New York: "They cannotmake blanket attacks on Asians anymore with impunity."Another reason is that the issue of campaign contributions fromforeign sources is a Pandora's box for more than a few Republicans."The New York Times pointed out that the Republicans have beengetting money from many foreign companies," Kim noted.Democratic spokesmen, on the other hand, have played on thesentiment of minority voters in the US by explaining James Riady'sties to the Democrats in terms of his interest in civil rights asa member of Indonesia's ethnic-Chinese minority.With Asian-Americans assuming a critical role as swing voters in afragmented US electorate, it may well be that both Dole and Clintonwant to avoid biting the hand which holds crucial votes in this andfuture elections.According to US analysts, a number of key swing states in theupcoming presidential election already have sizable numbers ofpotential Asian-American voters.There are 600,000 Asian-Americans in Texas and another 200,000 inFlorida. Asian-Americans also constitute at least one-tenth of theoverall population of California and are growing in numbers instates like New York, Massachusetts and Illinois.Julian Weiss, a spokesman for the non-partisan Heritage Foundationin Washington, said: "In the aftermath of this election, there willbe a far more vigorous attempt by both major parties to mobilizethe Asian-American vote."Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Peace prizes and troublemakersfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8On Sunday, Philippine President Fidel Ramos ordered the country'sBureau of Immigration and Deportation to ban the entry ofindividuals suspected of wishing to disrupt the APEC Summit,scheduled to be held in Manila next month.Although no direct reference was made, it was believed that thepresident's directive included the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize awardeeJose Ramos Horta.

First, "The so-called TMDwhich certain countries are going all-out to develop will in factpossess the capacity to intercept strategic missiles, thus breakingthe limits imposed by the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty andrendering the treaty virtually meaningless", he said.The second reason is that the TMD will lead to the proliferation ofadvanced missile systems and the related technologies, thus posinga threat to regional and even global security and stability."In a word, there is nothing to gain but everything to lose fromthe development of the TMD system," he said.TMDs in the region are mainly being produced by the United Statesfor use by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996What if we threw a party?from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8It was supposed to be a gala party. On the occasion of the fifthanniversary of the Paris Peace Accords, which technically ended thecountry's civil war, the Cambodian government hoped to attractministers or senior officials from all 19 of the accords'signatories to a massive celebration outside the royal palace.The festivities, which were to be held on Wednesday in Phnom Penh,were likely intended to confirm the legitimacy of the governmentthat arose from the 1993 United Nations-sponsored elections, head-ed by royalist First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh andSecond Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had led the Vietnamese-backedPhnom Penh government at the time of the signing.But alas, it was not to be. For some reason, nobody seems to be allthat interested in Cambodia these days. Of the signatories, onlyMalaysia and Laos are sending ministers to the celebration. Sixother countries are offering lower-ranking or retired officials.The other countries are content to be represented by theirambassadors to Phnom Penh or not at all.The United Nations, which presided over the Cambodian elections ina high-profile mission led by Japan, does not seem particularlyprepared to crow to the world about its success. The organizationwill have a presence at the celebrations, but only in the form ofits special representative in Cambodia.King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia was originally slated to presideover the festivities, but because of the disappointing turnout, hehas apparently decided to defer that responsibility to thecountry's parliamentary chairman, Chea Sim, who usually acts as theking's regent in his absence from Cambodia.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Japan's father and son actsfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8Rare is the Japanese politician who does not want to build adynasty. It has been commonplace for sons of lawmakers to inherittheir fathers' support organizations and as a result, in manycases, their seats in the parliament. (Where no adult sons areavailable, wives are the next choice.)One dramatic example occurred during the recent campaign in Kobe,where former health and welfare minister Saburo Toida died just oneweek before the election - but five days after he had filed as acandidate. His son Tooru was chosen as the Liberal Democratic Partycandidate, and went on to win against a strong campaigner from theopposition Shinshin-to.But in a macabre twist, the late minister's promotional video,which he had recorded before his death, was repeatedly broadcastover NHK Television during the campaign. The reason: Officialcampaign regulations prohibit the substitution of a candidate'sfilm footage after his party has submitted it to the authorities.All NHK could do was attach an announcement that the senior Toidahad died.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Hard time for ex-bureaucratsfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8Only 14 out of the 41 first-time candidates in this past Sunday'sJapanese parliamentary elections who were formerly bureaucratscould claim the right to put the much-coveted gold pins on theirjackets when the votes were tallied.Only one out of eight ex-Finance Ministry officials running for thefirst time won in this year's race and no former Health and WelfareMinistry worker was able to succeed in a maiden campaign.In a general campaign atmosphere of bureaucrat-bashing, with mostparties pledging to make administrative reform an importantpriority, many such candidates were unable to take full advantageof their illustrious career backgrounds in drumming up support,even from related private sector organizations, according to NihonKeizai Shimbun.In the past few years, it had become a pattern for at least 60percent of such ex-bureaucrat candidates to win their debut races.This year's reversals can be directly traced to the variousrecently-unveiled scandals involving a number of previouslysacrosanct government ministries.The Finance Ministry's solid reputation has been shattered by lastyear's financial scandals - specifically the collapse of the sevenjusen housing loan companies and the coverup of US$1.1 billion inlosses resulting from improper bond deals by a Daiwa Bank trader inNew York.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has come under harshcriticism for allegedly approving the sale of blood products thatministry officials knew might be contaminated with HIV, the virusthat causes AIDS.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996It's time for Britain to rethink its military trade-offs in Asiafrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8by Damon Bristow, for Asia TimesBehind the pomp and circumstance of British monarch Queen ElizabethII's visit to Thailand at the end of this month is a moredown-to-earth business proposition.The centerpiece of her stay will be a banquet to celebrate the 50thanniversary of the accession to the throne by His Majesty KingBhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. And Prince Philip will also becomethe first senior member of the British royal family to go to thesite of the infamous "death railway", where 13,000 prisoners ofwar, many of them British and Commonwealth citizens, were internedby the Japanese during World War II.Behind the scenes, however, the British royals will also be workinghard to promote British trade relations with Thailand. For a start,the queen will attend a lunch at the Bank of Thailand. After thatshe will visit a major exhibition on commercial links betweenBritain and Thailand.The queen's newfound role as roving ambassador for "United Kingdomplc" is indicative of the broader change that has occurred inrelations between the United Kingdom and Asia since she lastvisited Thailand way back in 1972. At that time, Britain hadeffectively withdrawn from the region.And although the country retained political, economic and militaryties with the region - largely through the Commonwealth - thesewere pretty much symbolic.It's obviously a very different story today. After 25 years ofaverage economic growth across the region topping six percent ayear, a somewhat previously dormant Europe has finally woken up toAsia.In the meantime, many Asian countries are starting to make theirvoices heard in the international arena, particularly in the UnitedNations and the World Trade Organization.Add to that the sprouting of regional political and economicarchitecture in the years since the end of the Cold War: The ASEANRegional Forum (ARF), which looks at security matters, and itstrade-related sidekick, the Asia- Pacific Economic Co-operation(APEC) forum.Britain has not been able to ignore these developments. In anacknowledgement of this fact, British Prime Minister John Majorannounced in 1994 that every effort would be made to reinvigoratethe country's long-standing relations with the region.This year a stream of senior British politicians have been doingthe rounds in Asia, talking about trade, politics and securityties.British exports to the Asia-Pacific region, as a percentage ofthose outside Europe rose from 11.7 percent in 1991 to a littleover 25 percent in 1993. The following year they increased by over27 percent to a little over £14 billion (US$22.3 billion).Britain is also the largest European Union investor in the region.The economic benefits, however, have not only been one way: 41percent of all Japanese and 47 percent of all South Koreaninvestments in Europe are in the United Kingdom.Britain has also moved to underpin this growing economicrelationship by improving political ties. At an institutionallevel, for example, every effort is being made to exploit linkswith its partners in the Commonwealth and its membership of the EU,which has had relations with the Association of Southeast AsianNations since the 1970s.Bilateral relations, too, have been strengthened. To its credit,London has been successful in building links with all the mostinfluential countries in Asia. Group of Seven member Japan has beenthe major recipient of Britain's attentions.The relationship with Tokyo is now so strong that last month,British Foreign Secretary Malcom Rifkind visited Japan and signeda groundbreaking Action Agenda for a Special Partnership with hisJapanese counterparts.The document committed both countries to unprecedented levels ofcooperation in world affairs, economic issues and in fosteringcloser links between the UK and Europe.Relations with South Korea are progressing down a similar track.And, as the deadline for the handover of Hong Kong approaches, tieswith China have also improved markedly, even though Britain hasmade clear its intention to stand up for the territory for afurther 50 years after that.And although the British government doesn't like to flaunt it,relations with Indonesia are also pretty close.With the Hong Kong withdrawal just around the corner, Britain hasstepped up its efforts to convince its partners in the region thatthe British armed forces will continue to take an active interestin Asia's security - unlike its competitors in the EU, Britain hassecurity links with the region through the Five Power DefenseArrangement (FPDA), which brings Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand,Singapore and the United Kingdom together for exercises twice ayear. The country also has historical links due to itsparticipation in the Korean War.Recently, British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo announced thatthe biggest task force to leave the United Kingdom since theFalklands War would take part in an upgraded FPDA exercise off thecoast of Malaysia in April next year with the Aircraft carrierIllustrious at its head. This was followed by a speech in Australiaduring which Portillo expressed his belief thatthe UK should be made a member of ARF independent of the EU.Furthermore, when South Korean President Kim Young-sam was inLondon, Britain made clear its support of the 1994 OctoberDeclaration between the United States and North Korea, which wasdesigned to freeze Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. It evenagreed to contribute money to the Korean Peninsula EconomicDevelopment Organization (KEDO) and provided the North with£150,000 in disaster aid after last year's devastatingfloods.Britain usually justifies its desire to continue playing a securityrole in Asia by referring to the fact that the country has largeinvestments and "long-standing ties" in the region.In a slightly more roundabout way, it is hoped that showing theflag might also help the United Kingdom to carve out a larger pieceof Asia's growing markets. The question of whether or not Britainactually has the ability to deal with a crisis in Asia - say in theSouth China Sea or the Korean peninsula - is, however, a mootpoint.According to current British military thinking, after Hong Kongreverts back to Chinese sovereignty, any military emergency in theregion would be met by the using of the newly-established JointRapid Deployment Force (JRDF), which is specifically designed todeal with distant regional contingencies. At the core of this forcewill be the 3 Commando and 5 Airborne brigades. They, in turn,would be able to draw on resources from the rest of the armedforces if required.The problem is that the British Armed Services are stretched to thelimit at the moment. The total strength of the military has beenreduced steadily from 292,000 in 1992/93, to 250,000 last year. Ontop of this, existing commitments mean that Britain has around17,000 troops in Northern Ireland and just short of 10,500 inBosnia. That's not to mention long-standing commitments to securityin the Gulf.Bearing in mind these constraints, the physical distance betweenAsia and the UK and the cost of sending and sustaining a force along way from British shores, the chances are that Britain wouldnot only find it pretty difficult to send a few navy vessels topatrol the South China Sea, let alone commit ground troops to amajor conflict on the Korean peninsula, but would think twicebefore it made such a commitment. Even if they did get there, atcurrent levels, the chances are any force would be little more thansymbolic.To the current generation of policy makers in the region that doesnot seem to matter: For them, the country's continued securitycommitment to the region is essential to justify its position as amajor power with an international reach and global interests aswell as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.That's fine in the short term. In the next few years, however,Britain will have to decide whether or not it makes sense to retainits military commitment to the region, even in its current, anemicform.To this end, the country might do well to take a leaf out of thebook of its European partners, who have been almost as successfulin securing business in Asia and exercising their influence asBritain has without making halfhearted commit-ments that they wouldbe hard pressed to keep. Perhaps the time has finally come forBritain to follow them down the same route.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Japan: That empty feelingfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8A senior Japanese journalist posted a note to an Internetdiscussion group on Monday which constituted the most poignantcommentary on Sunday's election and is worth summarizing.He was watching the television election programs on Sunday night,he wrote, and was struck by the historically low voter turnout. Itwas beyond his comprehension, given that Japan in the past coupleof years had experienced everything unprecedented, from the nearcollapse of its banking system to a major earthquake to a religiouscult's terrorist attack on the Tokyo subway.The biggest question for him was not how the coalition was going tobe formed, but simply the voters' attitude, which he would not evencall apathy, as that still connoted the existence of individualdecision-making. They just don't care about anything, he suggested,be it about Ijime in public school systems or about Rodong missilesthat North Korea was reportedly about to launch. How had Japangotten this empty, precisely as described in Yukio Mishima's oftencited predictions?We don't know if the journalist wrote a similar commentary for hisown - one of Japan's biggest - newspapers. If he didn't, he shouldhave.It is important not to misunderstand his reference to the novelistMishima, the man whose desperate nationalism drove him to publiclydisembowel himself with his samurai sword to rouse his nation. Thereference was surely not intended as an endorsement of Mishima'seccentric existentialist nationalism. But as C P Snow once wrote,"Mishima's characters are observed with the sharpest of eyes...clear, eloquent, visual". His characterization of an "empty Japan"had that same element of precision.Just consider some of today's lead news stories out of Tokyo:l A Japanese finance company filed for liquidation with massivedebt liabilities of more than US$8.8 billion, spurring worriesabout the health of other finance companies. The liability figuremakes Nichiei Finance the largest such insolvency case in post-warJapan.l United States Central Intelligence Agency director John Deutchhas discussed with Japanese leaders North Korea's reported move totest-launch the Rodong-1 missile. The missile has a target range of1,000km, is capable of reaching Japan, and can be fitted withnuclear or chemical warheads.l The Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said itsindex of economic indicators for August fell below the "boom orbust" mark for the first time in five months.l The Liberal Democratic Party said Japan's government would likelybe on hold for at least two weeks until a coalition is stitchedtogether.How, in light of such acute and simmering problems, could more than40 percent of Japanese voters have chosen to spend election daywith such favorite pastimes as autumn leaf viewing or watching abaseball game, rather than participate in the election of apolitical leadership capable of addressing the country's woes.The unnamed journalist's commentary on his fellow Japanese's stateof mindlessness and his pessimism about the future appearwell-justified.The Finance Ministry will now roll out the fire brigade and dousethe Nichiei problem, likely at the voters' - or non-voters' -expense. Japan's Defense Agency chief told reporters he was closelywatching the Rodong test situation, but that none of theinformation obtained was "solid". And whatever coalition ends upbeing stitched together will likely respond to the bad economicdata with yet another supplementary pork-barrel budget.On this last issue, one man not re-elected, outgoing EPAdirector-general Shusei Tanaka, urged that Japan must press aheadwith economic reform and avoid the easy option of trying to spendits way out of trouble. But as we said, he was defeated.One last bit of news: After a year of intense lobbying againstrival India, Japan on Tuesday was given a nonpermanent seat at theUN Security Council. One wonders what, if anything, the Japaneserepresentative filling that seat might have to say to the world.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Hyundai wins vote of confidence in Israelfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 7by Yaroslav TrofimovSouth Korea's Hyundai Group is poised to become a major supplier inthe Israeli telecommunications market in the wake of its US$12.5million deal with the Jewish state's telephone monopoly Bezeq.Bezeq, whose 1996 annual purchasing budget is roughly US$1 billion,has ordered from Hyundai 130,000 kilometers of optic fiber for itscable network modernization program.The deal was finalized at a meeting between Bezeq's president IsaacKaul and Hyundai's manager of planning and electronics departments,Park Hyeong-sun.The Korean fiber, which is scheduled to be produced within twoweeks, will be tested on Bezeq's request by the US-based BellcoreCorporation. Bezeq said that, should these tests be satisfactory,the company will sign by late 1998 an additional contract for anundisclosed sum that industry analysts estimated could reach overUS$100 million annually.Currently, Bezeq buys most of its cable from two Israeli companies,Cvalim and Kavlei Zion. Only about 15 percent of Bezeq suppliescome from foreign manufacturers, such as Alcatel, Motorola andNorthern Telecom. Hyundai is the first Asian company to makesignificant sales to Bezeq.After opening an office in Tel Aviv in 1994, the Korean giantracked up more than US$100 million in sales last year to the Jewishstate. The bulk of these exports were Accent and Lantra passengercars.Bezeq's spokesman, Roni Mandelbaum, explained that considerationsof both quality and price prompted his company to turn to Hyundai."We have no advantage buying outside of Israel if the product isnot better. Korea is a very long distance away, and if we decidedto go for it, this means that there is an advantage for us there,"Mandelbaum said.He added that Hyundai's optic fiber will be used for Bezeqoperations inside Israel and not in its foreign ventures, such asthe troubled Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited(HFCL)-Bezeq consortium in India.As Bezeq officials explained, the Hyundai deal is part of thecompany's new overall strategy of searching for more cost-effectivesuppliers in nontraditional markets, such as Asia.In accordance with Israel's deregulation program, Bezeq is expectedto lose as early as next year its lucrative monopoly onlong-distance telephone services - which means that it has toundergo immediate cost-cutting in order to survive the newcompetition."In the framework of Bezeq's preparation to deal with thecompetition, the company must become more efficient in allsectors," said Kaul."One of the central items in company expenses is purchasing costs.Bezeq will do everything possible to reduce purchasing costs andtariffs while, of course, preserving the high standard of productquality," Kaul added.Several international consortiums, including one led by KoreaTelecom, are bidding for the two licences to run Israel'salternative long-distance networks.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Asian investors buying into South American bread basketfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 6by Andrea Mandel-CampbellAfter years of neglect, Argentina's agricultural sector isbeginning to grow and Asian countries are among those setting theirsights on the South American country as a potential source of foodfor their growing populations.A handful of Asian countries have quietly begun making tentativeland purchases in Argentina's agriculturally rich interior,according to Argentine government sources.Since direct foreign investment is not officially registered inArgentina it is almost impossible to track the investments, butsources said Taiwanese investors had acquired farmland near thecapital of Buenos Aires while South Korean interests had chosen thenearby province of Entre Rios to launch large-scale grainproduction.South Korean conglomerates, including the Daewoo Group and HyundaiGroup, were also taking a serious look at adding farming to theirArgentine investment portfolio, said South Korean sources.But perhaps the greatest interest is coming from China, wherepresent direct investment in Argentina is estimated at only US$20million. About 10 Chinese corporations, including grainimport-export concern Ceroil Foods, were looking at investmentbetween US$10 million and US$15 million each in farmland, saidErnesto Fernandez Taboada, executive director of the ArgentineChamber of Commerce for Southeast Asia.The Chinese were studying Argentine agricultural regulations andtechnology with the aim of harvesting and processing crops inArgentina for later export to China, said Taboada. To date, theyhave acquired "experimental" plots ranging from 300 to 600 hectaresin three provinces to grow grain and cotton Argentina's leadingexports to China along with vegetable and animal-based oils."China has decided to make investment in Latin America a priority.The Chinese know that in the future Latin America is going to beone of the great food providers while China is going to need a lotmore foodstuffs," said Taboada."The living standards of China's growing middle class are risingevery year and with that increase they want to eat moresophisticated things and a greater variety of them. So the demandfor more and better food is continually increasing and thatobligates China to look outside its borders for reliable providersof food, among which is Latin America."The Chinese were also interested in agro-industry, with severalcompanies looking to establish grain processing plants andvegetable oil plants, he said.It is a move the Taiwanese, importers of Argentine grain, soya,corn and cotton, have already made. Taipei's Winluck Industries,owned by entrepreneur Sheng Hsiung Ho, is getting set to build asecond processing plant in Argentina for US$35 million that willprocess corn, soya and peanuts. And the Chaintech Group recentlysaid it signed an accord with the Argentine province of Tucuman tobuild a US$50 million fruit plant."A lot of Taiwanese see the potential of the food industry here anda lot of people are looking for investment opportunities," saidAlfonso Yio-Yih Tao, director of the economic division of theTaipei commercial and cultural office.Grain and other foodstuffs are also high on the list of Argentina'slargest Asian trading partner, Japan. Also, Argentina's mostimportant Asian investor, the Japanese, who have so far focused oncar plants, are beginning to turn their attention to agriculture.During the last meeting of the business-based Argentine-JapaneseMixed Committee, the Japanese concluded that Argentina "was areliable provider of high-quality products, had become aparticularly attractive site for agricultural and agro-industryinvestment, especially in view of Mercosur [Southern CommonMarket]".Being the largest grain supplier to Mercosur, the customs zone madeup of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Argentina held amajor attraction as well for investment mogul George Soros.In 1994 Soros' Quantum Industrial Partners bought a 40 percentshare in Cresud, a commodities producer based in Argentina.Since then, Cresud has increased its holdings from 20,000 to346,000 hectares of croplands and forests, and more than doubledits livestock to become the country's leading commodities producer.The influx of market capital and investment in technology hashelped trigger a rebirth of the long-neglected industry which hassuffered from years of over taxation and hyper-inflation."Last year Argentine GDP fell 4.4 percent whereas agriculture grewmore than nine percent - it's a sector in full expansion. We'reseeing 100 percent growth in all areas, from fertilizers andirrigation systems to tractor sales," said Cresud directorAlejandro Elsztain."We had many bad years and for many years we have been behind, butnow we are beginning to see a turnaround. We are rediscovering whatwe have."And what Argentina has is a distinct comparative advantage,according to Elsztain, when it comes to land. The country stillpossesses vast tracts of undeveloped land at cheap prices, sellingfor half to one-fifth the price of equivalent quality land in NorthAmerica and Europe. And with few countries in a position toincrease production levels as global consumption rises, Elsztainpredicts Argentina will once again become a leading global exporterof grains and milk."Asia, along with Russia, are going to be the markets that willmake us into major exporters and will become very rich markets forus," said Elsztain.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996Innovation the key to sporting goods empirefrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 6by M ShankarJagdev Singh was distraught on the day he opened his first shop inSingapore. By early afternoon, not a single thing had been sold."I was a dead man," he said.Not quite. That store was the first of 218 outlets that, 17 yearslater, sprawl across Southeast Asia and are part of a S$300 million(US$210 million) sporting goods empire.Singh, or J S Gill as he prefers to be called, introduced a numberof innovations to Singapore retailers, including the concept offixed pricing instead of bargaining individually with eachcustomer.He reckons half of the sporting goods now sold on the island comefrom his Royal Sporting House outlets.The family-owned business of this 42-year-old, who dreamed as a boyof owning a pair of Adidas shoes, is the exclusive distributor forReebok products in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippinesand Brunei, and retails 27 other top-of-the-line brands, rangingfrom Wilson and Spalding to Speedo and Lacoste.The Indian entrepreneur left home at the age of 24, with plans tobecome an engineer. His family did not approve."My father thought that I would come back," he said.Indeed, Gill's career plans did not work out, and he fell back onthe only thing he knew well - sporting goods, in which he hadworked for his father.But rather than return to the family business, he struck out on hisown.He was aided early on by the reputation of his father, whoseIndonesia-based business bought sporting goods in Singapore.Gill had no money to stock his first store, but wholesalers anddistributors who knew his father agreed to accept checks post-datedby 30 days.So he opened a checking account with S$100 and bought aboutS$60,000 in sporting goods to stock his 30 square meter shop atLucky Plaza, on Singapore's fashionable Orchard Road."I had the best merchandise," said Gill. "The shop was beautifullydone. On November 23, 1979, I opened the business thinking I woulddo the sales and deposit the money and the thing would startrolling."But by 1.00pm on the first day of business he had not sold a thing."I said: 'Bloody hell, I am dead now. What am I going to do? Thechecks will not be honored'." He added: "Anyhow, when you are atthat stage, you've got nothing to lose. The guy can't hang you -basically he would have taken back the goods."At any rate, it was not a problem, the moribund morning wasfollowed by a robust afternoon with sales totaling S$3,500."That was my first day collection. I said to myself: 'Now, there isno looking back'."Over the next nine years he gradually expanded his business into 15outlets."He spearheaded a lot of retail concepts that were new to theindustry [in Singapore], like fixed prices and visually-appealingin-store merchandising," said Jeffrey Bose, president of Sing-apore's Sports Goods Dealers Association and managing director ofHwa Kay Thai, a regional group that licenses the Puma brand inseven countries."That was groundbreaking. Today 75 percent of sports good retailerssell on fixed price and a lot of people have a lot to thank Gillfor."But big-time success came in 1988, when Gill was granted theregional distributorship for Reebok.Gill was up against such heavyweights as Britain's Inchcape,Malaysia-based Sime Darby and others. But he was resolute. "I waschasing them, especially during the big trade shows held everyyear," Gill said.He also had the dream, harking back to his childhood love for theirshoes, of acquiring the Adidas franchise.Gill drew up a business plan in 1987. He made one copy for Adidasand another for Reebok. He then went with a member of his staff toGermany to attend the Ispo trade fair, near Munich.He saw a long queue of people eager to meet Reebok executives."Reebok then was the hottest thing going. Adidas was a 50-year-oldcompany - stable but sliding down," said Gill.When his turn came, Gill went into a room with the Reebok exportdirector."He saw my face, he said: 'Okay this is your plan? Fine, put ithere, we will contact you'. He took my plan, there was a big box,and he just dumped it there," said Gill.Next he visited Adidas.Gill, who was already doing some business with the German-basedsporting goods maker, said the company gave him a patient hearingand told him they were not happy with their franchise arrangementsin Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.Three months later, Adidas told Gill they would like to talk withhim further, at the upcoming trade fair in Atlanta, about aproposal to grant him the distributorship for the region.As about the same time the letter from Adidas arrived in Singapore,so did Reebok president Joe Foster.Royal Sporting House was already a key player in Singapore'supscale sporting goods market. Walking through the city's retaildistrict, Foster was impressed with the displays and merchandise inGill's stores, and telephoned him."He was staying at the Raffles Hotel, I still remember. He calledme and I went running to see him," said Gill with a laugh.Foster had not even seen the plan Gill had submitted at the Ispofair, but having seen his stores, he asked if Gill was interestedin becoming Reebok's distributor, and they agreed to discuss itfurther in Atlanta.Arriving in the United States, Gill met an Adidas representative inAtlanta's Mariott Hotel the day before the trade show was to begin,and was offered a distributorship.Walking back across the street to his own room in the Hilton,Adidas' letter of intent in hand, he ran into Reebok's president.Foster told Gill he wanted to meet him the following morning. "'But more or less I have made up my mind. We want to go with you',"Gill recalled Foster saying."When I was putting the two plans [together], my staff member hadwarned me: 'Mr Gill... what happens if both of them come back toyou?' I said: 'That will never be possible. We are so small, theyare giants'."Back in Singapore with two letters of intent, Gill called for avote among his staff to decide which franchise to accept. Theyvoted for the more established company - Adidas.But Gill's heart was in Reebok: "I said, this is hot, it will growand it will help us to grow faster."Two months later, he was still in a quandary. Finally, he wrote thenames of the companies on two pieces of paper and told hissix-year-old daughter to pick one."I told her, whatever is your luck, let it be so. So she picked up;it was Reebok. I said, okay we go with Reebok. That is a decisionmade, and it was destiny."And the business took off. Spreading across Southeast Asia, RoyalSporting House now has 153 outlets outside Singapore, as well asmanufacturing facilities making swimwear and other sports apparelin Banting in the Malaysian state of Selangor.Two years ago, he launched his own footwear brand, Ogaan, inIndonesia.Along the way, Gill won the Singapore Enterprise of the Year Awardin 1993, the International Sports Retailer of the Year Award in1994 and the Speciality Store of the Year Award in 1995.Gill still does not have any partners or shareholders. He managesthe business with his wife and a team of professionals and neverinvolves himself in joint ventures in which he does not have acontrolling stake. Even in a sporting-good distribution jointventure with Indonesia's multibillion dollar Gajahtunggal group, heowns a majority stake."J S Gill has a general feel and gut instinct about the sportinggoods industry and his entrepreneurial instincts are very strong,"said Bill Sweeney, vice-president for Reebok Inter- national.Sweeney explained that there was no conflict in the fact that Gillsells brands made by Reebok's competitors."There is a difference between a retail stockist and a distributor.It is also a challenge for us [Reebok] to make our brand moreattractive vis-a-vis other brands displayed in a sellingenvironment.Gill added: "I cannot distribute any other brand except Reebok, butI can stock all the other brands, including Nike [Reebok's maincompetitor], in my retail stores."But Gill has also suffered setbacks. About seven years ago heopened a specialty 12-outlet chain called Big Foot Little Foot,selling fashionable and trendy footwear for Singaporeans andIndonesians of all ages. It closed two years later."I think you have to take failure in life and move on," said Gill.Indeed, in the past two years he has begun diversifying into thefashion industry once again.Other innovations may not be paying off now, but Gill said he wastaking a long-term view and did not cling to demands for immediatecommercial viability.One such venture is his Golf House mobile workshop, which willpolish and repair golf clubs right on the golf course."One of his strengths is he is not afraid to try something new,"said Sweeney. "And if a concept does not work, he is also quick totake corrective action and address his mistakes. Like when he wenton a retail expansion spree in Singapore, he quickly realized thathe was making a mistake and refocused on smaller volumes but betterquality."Bose of the Sports Goods Dealers Association added: "That he is notafraid of trying does not go against him."Gill plans to expand to other markets when the timing is right."I will be ready to go into India, when India takes off," he said,though he said he thought China, with its many shopping malls, hada better retail setup for the time being, adding that an offer wason the table for him to start a joint venture there.Although Gill's father, who died last March, had not approved ofhim striking out on his own, he ultimately approved of his son'sundertakings."My father was very proud of me," said Gill. As for not supportinghim at first, he said: "I don't blame him... the world is changingand I don't think my children will necessarily listen to me."Maybe the world was changing at that time, and my father was notready to accept that. I always wanted to be a free, young man andindependent, and do something on my own. It was not that it was thereason to break up from the family, but it was the idea to do yourown thing."He said he had enough of taking direction from others. "I wentthrough that. So, I told myself - get out!"Another reason for his leaving home, he said, was that, at thatage, you have nothing to fear because you have nothing to lose.As for the future, Bose said he saw competition on Gill's home turfgrowing stronger."The closest competitor to Royal Sporting House would be World ofSports, belonging to the Ossia Group, which started just four tofive years back but is one of the fastest growing companies," Bosesaid.Gill does not express concern, however. With a growing legion ofpeople in Asia interested in sports, he hopes his recipe of localexpertise and strong entrepreneurial skills will keep his cashregisters ringing.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996US Fed explores scandal avoidance measuresfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 5by Gene KoprowskiUnited States officials are examining new measures aimed ataverting trading scandals such as the Daiwa Bank losses and thecollapse of Barings.Failure to comply with the measures would result in institutionsfacing censure through public disclosure - and correspondingimplications in credit ratings and raising capital - rather thanstraightforward financial penalties.Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago were finalizinga study for December release which examined whether the FederalReserve should impose public disclosure requirements on banks thattraded derivatives and futures, government officials said.The study was undertaken because of the Fed's concern that atrading scandal, similar to the Barings and Daiwa Bank crises orthe Sumitomo copper losses, could undermine US financial markets.As talks proceed, former copper trading king Yasuo Hamanaka wasarrested on Tuesday on charges that he forged documents to createsecret trading accounts. The arrest came after Sumitomo Corp fileda legal complaint against Hamanaka, its former chief copper trader,who it blamed for a US$2.6 billion loss from unauthorized copperdeals.Douglas Evanoff, a senior economist and assistant vice-president atthe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said the completed report onimproving public disclosure would be discussed as the basis forpossible regulation with the other member banks of the FederalReserve System. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, aswell as the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and SupervisoryPractices - an organization of the world's central bankers - willalso be consulted.The idea was first floated internally earlier this year at the Fedby economists Paul Kubiak and Jim O'Brien in Washington. Staff atthe Chicago branch of the Fed, one of 12 regional banks in theFederal Reserve System, picked up the idea and developed itfurther.By midyear they convinced Michael Moskow, president of the FederalReserve Bank of Chicago, to discuss the idea in a speech aboutderivatives, and in subsequent remarks, Evanoff said."We think it is something that can influence their behavior wheninstitutions realize their name has been made public," he said."We're trying to develop the optimal penalty structure."The central bankers, simultaneously, are eyeing a pilot program,launched last month by the New York Clearing House Association -the international organization of banks which clear trades in theUS. The program serves as an experiment with the idea ofdisclosure.Evanoff said the pilot program was starting to collect data, whichwould be useful in determining the efficacy of the plan. The firstphase of the plan would run through the fourth quarter. "All ofthis sounds great conceptually, but we want to see if the idea isviable in implementation," he said. The pilot program was firstmentioned in June.Moskow said: "Bank capital, and ultimately the Bank Insurance Fund,is at risk if the value of a bank's trading book falls rapidly dueto a sudden change in market prices. Fears of a bank collapsetriggered by such changes have been exacerbated by the increaseduse of derivatives."Consider the collapse of Barings last year, which was the resultof a high-stakes bet on the direction of Japanese stocks usingderivatives traded on the SIMEX [Singapore International MonetaryExchange] and the Osaka exchange... If improperly used, derivativesmake it easier for an imprudent institution to damage itself, theBank Insurance Fund and the safety and soundness of the financialservices sector," he said.Evanoff said the pilot program was helping the participants severalunnamed financial institutions - examine their present exposure torisk from derivatives and just how much they should allocate tocover that risk. Insiders said the first phase ran through thisquarter and it was likely to be extended for more than a yearbeyond that.What are the reporting requirements of the pilot program? Accordingto David Marshall, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank ofChicago, banks involved in the New York pilot program pre-commit toa certain level of risk for each quarter of the year.For example, if the bank thinks the worst loss it can have inderivatives trading during the forthcoming quarter is US$10million, it informs regulators of that risk level. Then, at the endof the quarter, regulators and bank officials meet to determine howwell the bank met its projections.During the pilot program, reporting would be done on a quarterlybasis. But reporting requirements had not been finalized, Marshallsaid. "The frequency of the reporting has not been worked out yet.Some regulators want daily reporting requirements. But that may betoo onerous for banks."The risk-based capital requirements adopted by the Basel Committeein 1989 did not apply to off-balance sheet items, or trading bookassets. However, off-balance sheet items present a potentiallysubstantial risk. In the Barings case, market prices of derivativesmoved rapidly and devastated the net worth of that bank. "Clearlythere should be capital charges made to protect the system as awhole against declines in the value of these securities," Marshallsaid.Banks would use computer programs to determine their level of riskbased upon their outstanding level of securities. "This is known asthe internal models approach," Marshall said. "Basically, theregulator asks the bank: 'How risky is your portfolio? You tell us,using the best tools you have.' Basically, they give us a value ofrisk number."The idea is that regulators will let the banks tell them what isthe maximum loss their portfolio will take over a threemonthperiod. "What is the worst they can do over three months? That'swhat we would want to know," Marshall said. "Then they take thatdollar amount, say US$10 million. They pre-commit not to lose anymore than that amount. Make that their capital charge. They have tohave enough capital set aside so that capital completely absorbstheir loss."Then, if the loss from derivatives exceeds that pre-committedloss, the disclosure penalty is put into place."They're simultaneously choosing the risk of their portfolio andthe capital to set aside against that risk. And if we set thatpenalty function correctly, then we should get them to do that ina way which meets safety and stability requirements of regulatorsand risks to the bank insurance fund," Marshall said.US regulators are currently limited in the actions they can take onderivatives risks and they want to try out measures to mitigate therisks for the US financial system. Immediately following Sumitomo'sannounced loss in September, the Fed took steps to determine thesize and nature of US bank exposures to the trading company and tothe copper market.Several banks had trading or financing transactions with Sumitomorelating to its copper trading and were owed payments by Sumitomoin connection with those transactions. In the future, thegovernment would like to regulate that kind of credit risk as well.Evanoff said although the proposed disclosure requirements were notgoing to be placed on trading companies themselves, publicdisclosure of risks at banks which lend to them hopefully wouldcontinue to strengthen their internal auditing and informationsystems."The well-publicized losses at Barings, Daiwa, Sumitomo and othershave all derived from violations of fundamental, managerialprinciples of control, such as those dealing with the recording ofall positions and the adequate separation of duties. Managementsmust build and maintain adequate systems for controlling risks,whether they operate bank or non-bank institutions," said Fed boardmember Susan Phillips, in Congressional testimony three weeks ago.Dmitrius Papadimitriou, executive director of the Jerome LevyEconomics Institute, a regulatory issues think tank in Ithaca, NewYork, said the proposal provided a level of "transparency" that hadbeen sorely lacking in the derivatives world. "It actuallyencourages banks to improve their risk-assessment andrisk-management technologies," he said."What's more, there is no need for the regulators to impose a modelof portfolio risk in setting regulatory capital." Regulators needonly to verify initially that the bank has an adequaterisk-management structure in place, to review the bank'sprofit-and-loss information.Another benefit was that the proposal did not impose a "top-down"regulatory structure from the federal govern- ment, but amarket-oriented approach, he said.Financing of commodity and derivatives deals is not a new activityfor US banks. They have been involved in financing commodityactivities through their agriculture lending programs directed atthe production and sale of agricultural products, both domesticallyand abroad.More than one-quarter of all US banks have farm loans in excess of25 percent of their total loans.Unlike the banks' more traditional functions, their trading ofcommodity derivatives, such as copper, gold and silver, hasincreased in recent years, largely for the same reasons tradingactivities, in general, have grown - expanded international trade,increased demand for hedging instruments and improved methods formanaging and controlling risk and advances in computerization andcommunications technology.What impact will the study on derivatives regulation likely havewhen it is released in six weeks?Evanoff believes "this is the best way to regulate, on anincentive-compatible basis." Marshall said: "This is a radicaldeparture from the command-and-control regulation structure wherewe say: Hold this amount of capital and that's it. Banks tell ushow much of a capital loss they can pre-commit to."Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA TIMES via NewsNetOctober 23, 1996US$8.8 billion bubble burstsfrom ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1by Richard HansonMore than half a decade after Japan's property market began tocollapse, the bubbles are still bursting.But the latest collapse - that of Nichiei Finance under the weightof yen1 trillion (US$8.8 billion) in debt - serves to illustrate ahuge gap in how Japan reacts to an ordinary bursting bubble and abubble with strong political interest involved.Just about everyone in Japan knows the story of the liquidationearlier this year of a group of seven jusen housing loan companies.They collapsed with trillions of yen in bad loans, a messy processthat ended up requiring an infusion of taxpayer money by electedpoliticians.Then there is the story of Nichiei Finance. Nichiei Finance, asubsidiary of Nichiei Co, was established in 1972 and listed itsstock on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1991.On Tuesday, Nichiei Finance, a long-troubled medium-sized financingcompany, earned its place in the record books of bankruptcy bydeclaring itself broke with the largest bubble of potential baddebt in Japan's history, showing how long it is taking for Japan toshake off its bubbled past.The possible bad debt is larger than the previous biggestbankruptcy - yen590 billion left by Muramoto Construction in 1993- and even larger than the yen685 billion ponied up by parliamentearlier this year to help liquidate the jusen, althoughcollectively the jusen debts were larger.Nichiei Finance was bad news for its main creditors andshareholders, including three of Japan's largest bank's and itswell-known (solvent) parent company, Nichiei Co, which is also inthe loan business.They had tried to rescue the company since 1993, but the continuedfall in Japan's property prices thwarted their efforts. The debtswere just too large.Financial institutions have loaned yen170.9 billion - about half byDai-Ichi Kangyo (DKB), Asahi Bank and the Bank of Yokohama - toNichiei Finance, which has applied for court protection under thebankruptcy laws. The parent company will post a loss of yen12.3billion as a result.Dai-Ichi had yen56.9 billion in loans to Nichiei Finance, whileAsahi had yen32.2 billion and the Bank of Yokohama yen20.3 billion,bank officials said."DKB, Asahi and Bank of Yokohama have manageable exposures as theirwrite-offs in conjunction with this fiasco will only reach about 20percent of their expected total asset disposal amount this year,"ING Barings Securities said.The real "bubbles" in Nichiei Finance are the yen820 billion inloan guarantees it extended mostly to real estate customers, thevalue of whose collateral has also crashed. About yen100 billion isa total loss, while much of the rest is dubious.So where is the political angle?There is none. Bar a few knock-on bankruptcies in what is known asthe non-banking sector of financing firms, there is little chancethat Nichiei Finance, the biggest financial bankruptcy in Japan'shistory, will produce more than a loud drop in the black hole ofJapan's property market. There are no depositors at risk.So why were the jusen such a big deal?They too were just housing loan companies gone wild in the era ofproperty speculation, with no depositors.The difference was that the biggest lenders to the jusen, it turnedout, were a large number of agricultural cooperatives, who blithelylent trillions of yen to the jusen, most of which was going to belost, threatening their solvency.Agricultural cooperatives did have depositors, mostly farmers, whohad the political clout to mobilize the support of the LiberalDemocratic Party (LDP), which depends heavily on the farm vote.The LDP fixed it so that the agricultural cooperatives would notlose any of the money that they loaned to the jusen, and would getoff with a token payment to help with the liquidation of thosecompanies.The farmers were grateful, of course. In Japan's general electionon Sunday, they helped return the LDP to a more secure position asthe largest party in the Lower House of parliament.Nichiei Finance should have such friends as friends of its lenders.Copyright 1996 Asia TimesBack to Headline List WT03-B03-11IA086-000615-B047-59http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it81.html 205.156.212.5 19970122022037 text/html 67375HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:18:33 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:12 GMTContent-length: 67188Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it81.html Sample Issue Copyright ASIAN ECONOMIC NEWS via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Nissho Iwai to develop coal mines in Australia+ (243 words) Casio Computer to jointly make pagers in India+ (180 words) Mitsubishi to boost transmission output in Philippines+ (137 words) Lion to begin feasibility study on Vietnamese market+ (148 words) Japan to provide food aid to N.

The two companies will produce cars in Southeast Asia under aburden-sharing scheme and cooperate in developing vehicles to boosttheir productivity, they said.     They also plan to standardize components and parts to be usedin their vehicles.     Nissan has been providing technological assistance to SamsungMotor in plant construction and production of components since Aprillast year.     More than 100 Nissan officials now are assigned to assist theSouth Korean automaker, which plans to start producing passenger carsat a newly completed assembly plant in Pusan in January 1998, theofficials said.     The development came amid reports that competition amongforeign automakers has intensified in the fast-growing auto marketsin Southeast Asian countries.     ''South Korean cars have great growth potential in SoutheastAsia as they are sold at prices nearly 20% below those oftheir Japanese counterparts,'' an industry official said.     Japanese automakers have taken a dominant share of the Asianauto market but their hegemony has shown signs of declining in recentyears in the face of the strong yen and a powerful sales drive bySouth Korean competitors, industry sources said.     For instance, they said, the market share held by Japanesemakers in Thailand dropped from 90% to 68% in 1994 inthe face of rising competition from U.S., European and South Koreanrivals.     Nissan lagged behind the forerunners there because the companyfocused on expanding its markets in North America and Europe, theysaid.     Nissan will strengthen its partnership with Samsung in SoutheastAsia to catch up with its rivals there, a company official said.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN ECONOMIC NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 19964.3 mil. tourists visit Indonesia in '95+JAKARTA, Dec. 28 Kyodo     About 4.3 million foreign tourists visited Indonesia in 1995,bringing in estimated revenues of 5.21 billion dollars, localnewspapers reported Thursday.     ''The total number of foreign tourists entering Indonesiathrough seven main gates as of December 1995 is estimated to havereached 4.3 million,'' Tourism, Post and Telecommunications MinisterJoop Ave was quoted as saying Wednesday.     Joop said the projected revenues represent an increase of 10.8%from 4.7 billion dollars in 1994, though the number of touristarrivals rose only 7.3% from last year's level of slightly abovefour million.     According to a five-year development plan, the governmentexpected 4.5 million foreign tourists to visit Indonesia this year,bringing revenues of at least 6 billion dollars.     The number of tourist arrivals is projected to rise to betweenfive million and 5.4 million in 1996, bringing revenues of 6.91billion dollars.     Indonesia is targeting the tourist industry as a major foreignexchange earner by 2005, when it expects to attract 11.1 millionvisitors who will spend a total of 15 billion dollars in the country.     The promotion of the country's tourist industry was hamperedearly this year when the Japanese press reported that dozens ofJapanese tourists had become ill with cholera after returning fromthe resort island of Bali.     Japan, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Germany are majorsources of tourists for Indonesia.  In 1994 more than half of alltourists, 56.83%, came from these five countries.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN ECONOMIC NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996China aims to attract foreign investment in real estate+BEIJING, Dec. 28 Kyodo     China is trying to make its real estate sector more attractiveto foreigners, mainly in the area of low-cost, mass-market housing.     There has been a boom in construction of office blocks, luxurycondominiums, villas and hotels in the past few years, mainly fundedby foreign investors seeking high profits through leasing or selling.     But the government has now applied the brakes with a mixture ofthe carrot and the stick to force foreign funds into sectors ofperceived greater need.     It has issued new regulations lifting the previous exemption onimport duties and other taxes for materials and equipment brought infrom overseas for the construction of virtually any type of realestate project.     Currently, there are restrictions on the approval of landavailable for such projects as well as a value-added tax for realestate.     A Circular on Strict Control of the Development of Luxury RealEstate Projects was also introduced in late 1995 and the regulationspeaks for itself in indicating government determination to controlwhat it reckoned was the main reason the construction sectoroverheated in the early 1990s, leading to runaway inflation.     At the same time, foreign companies willing to cooperate withthe government in a massive urban renewal plan scheduled for the nextdecade -- razing entire low-rise residential districts in many citiesand replacing them with high-rise apartment blocks -- will be givenpreferential treatment as well as a guaranteed rate of return ontheir investments.     According to Minister of Construction Hou Jie, the government'sefforts to bring the real estate sector under tighter control arebeginning to pay off.     In 1992, for example, investment in building constructionprojects rose 117% over the previous year.  By 1994, growth had beenreduced to a 41.3%, and Hou anticipated an even lower increase thisyear.     ''There are four million urban families facing severe housingproblems.  The per capita urban housing space in at least half thecountry is below the national average and 40 million square meters ofurban housing are dangerous and in urgent need of repair orreplacement,'' he said.     Hou is trying to persuade potential foreign investors that thedevelopment of low-cost housing, while yielding lower profits,actually involves less risk and will represent the chief investmenttrend in Chinese real estate in the foreseeable future.     According to the minister, it takes one year to organize acontract for a major hotel and at least three years to build it.  Itthen takes eight or nine years to recover investments and reapprofits.     On the other hand, the construction of an ordinary housingproject requires only six months for the entire cycle.  Two cyclesper year can be completed in south China but only one in north Chinadue to the inclement weather.     ''The great demand for housing continues to offer foreigninvestors excellent prospects for earning good returns.  Foreignbusinesses investing in real estate can earn higher profits than thecurrent international level in developed countries,'' Hou said.     ''Internationally, average profits for real estate range from 6to 8%, with the rate in some countries dropping to 2%. In China,average profit seldom falls below 30%,'' he said.     Taking the lead in this area is the Shanghai municipalgovernment, which is counting on new preferential policies to helpovercome the resistance of foreign construction companies to becominginvolved in the city's ambitious urban housing redevelopment program.     Guaranteed after-tax returns on investment will be limited to15%, but the main sweetener is new policies designed to reduce therisks and red tape involved in building cheap apartments forresidents forced out by urban projects.     According to Huang Yuejing, deputy general secretary of theShanghai municipal government, regulations allowing foreigninvestment in domestic housing projects were actually issued at theend of 1993 but did not find any takers.     ''Potential investors were discouraged by the huge outlays fordemolition of old buildings, relocation of residents and theprovision of utilities, all of which took a huge bite out ofprospective profits,'' he said.     Foreign developers also had to team up with local parties to buya plot of land for redevelopment, and also pay a transfer fee for therights to the land, adding to the costs and risks.     To overcome resistance, Huang said, ''We have come up with newpolicies which we estimate will save overseas investors much of theirexpense if they put their money into housing projects for domesticsale rather than for overseas buyers.''     The new approach, which applies to all foreign-invested projectsin areas with high concentrations of shabby or dangerous houses,calls for the local authority to allocate the land to the Chinesepartner in a joint venture, with the foreign side providing thefinancing.     The Shanghai municipal government has pledged to buy the entirehousing project when completed and be responsible for its eventualsale.  The profits reaped by the foreign investor can be remittedoverseas free of the normal restrictions on foreign exchange.     The Shanghai approach is likely to be copied by other municipalauthorities.  Beijing, for example, is reported to be considering asimilar package of financial incentives with a guaranteed return of18%.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN ECONOMIC NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996Cambodia counts on foreign funds for 45% of revenue+PHNOM PENH, Dec. 28 Kyodo     Cambodia still depends on foreign aid and borrowings frommultilateral aid institutions for 45.1% of its budgeted revenue forfiscal 1996 which begins April, according to the state budgetapproved Thursday by the National Assembly.     The parliament endorsed the government's overall budget proposaltotaling 1.45 trillion riels (5.66 million dollars) for fiscal 1996.     The budget size represented an increase of 13.2% over a yearearlier.     Although the budgetary dependency on foreign money declinedfrom the preceding year's 45.9%, the rate is still alarmingly high,analysts say.     In breaking down the budgeted expenditures in percentage terms,defense accounted for the biggest chunk at 34.9%, down from thepreceding year's 38.9%.     The budget for the Interior Ministry ranked second at 15.2%,down from the preceding year's 16.8%.     These defense and security expenditures shrank somewhat as thesecurity threat from the Khmer Rouge guerrillas eased.

The subsidiary will conduct clinical tests of new, promisingdrugs concurrently in both Japan and China.     The subsidiary will enable Daiichi to move quickly in new areas,giving it an advantage over its competitors, the spokesman said.     He said the new subsidiary, Daiichi Pharmaceutical (China) Co.,is capitalized at 5 million dollars.     It will start clinical tests of the synthetic antibacterial drugCravit and the cerebral neurotransmission improvement drug Translonat a Beijing hospital from March, the spokesman said.  Tests of otherdrugs will begin gradually.     Daiichi expects to obtain Chinese government approval for Cravitand Translon in 1998, he said.     The subsidiary will then establish a joint production and salescompany for the drugs with a local pharmaceutical firm, and Daiichiwill invest some 3 billion yen on facility construction, thespokesman said.

The daily said in a front-page article that the government hopesto ratify the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea during theupcoming regular Diet session and establish the exclusive economiczone.     The convention, which went into force in November last year,obliges all signatories to recognize an exclusive 200-mile economiczone off a nation's coasts.     Within their zones, states have the exclusive right to fish orto exploit natural resources such as oil, reclaim land or constructartificial islands.     In question will be Japan's dispute with China over the SenkakuIslands, known in Chinese as the Diaoyutai Islands, in the East ChinaSea.     Tokyo also disputes South Korea's claim to Takeshima Island,known as Tokto in Korea, in the Sea of Japan.     The Senkaku Islands, located some 150 kilometers northeast ofthe northern tip of Taiwan, are also claimed by Taipei.     China has said it plans to ratify the sea convention nextsummer.  South Korea has already ratified the treaty.     Some Foreign Ministry officials said earlier this month Japanshould delineate a 200-mile zone with the Senkaku Islands as abase of reference, arguing that refraining from doing so could beinterpreted by the Chinese as a lack of interest in the territory.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN ECONOMIC NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996Japanese help Indonesian village improve iron casting+URAWA, Japan, Dec. 29 Kyodo     The Japanese city of Kawaguchi in Saitama Prefecture, borderingTokyo, famous for its cast-iron pots and pans, is helping anIndonesian village bring its metal-casting technology up to date byintroducing modern cupola furnaces.     Six makers of cast-iron products in Kawaguchi have founded theKasia metal-casting technology exchange cooperative hoping to helprealize a model factory in Ceper, a village on Java, by the middle ofnext year, said Kenichi Masuda, head of the cooperative.     Because of the strong yen, the Kawaguchi makers have sufferedfrom sluggish demand, even for products made from new materials suchas ceramics.  They have embarked on the project in a bid to overcomethe mood of the recession, he said.     The name ''Kasia'' is a contraction of Kawaguchi and Asia.Ceper has some 300 metal casters who make their products inhand-shaped sand molds.     ''Their technological level equals that of Japan in the Edoperiod (1615-1868), with rejects sometimes amounting to almost 80%of production,'' Masuda said.     The idea for the project was born when the head of ametal-casting cooperative from Ceper requested technologicalassistance after inspecting Masuda's factory during a visit to Japanin 1991.     The village is providing the site and the factory free ofcharge.  Kawaguchi workers skilled in the latest metal-castingtechniques will serve as instructors at the Ceber model factory andbring the know-how of some 20 local metalworkers up to date.     Also planned are a library and a metal-casting contest.     Indonesia relies heavily on imports for cast-iron products,particularly machine parts.     Japanese makers producing in Indonesia are not able to keep upwith demand.  Masuda, though, said he does not expect the modelfactory to make profits right from the start.     ''We are ready to live with a deficit in the first few years.For us, the project is significant in giving new impetus to Japan'smetal-casting industry which is in a fix.''Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN ECONOMIC NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996Steelmakers face price-cut pressure for exports to Asia+TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo     Japanese steelmakers are under growing pressure to cut pricesof Asia-bound steel products due to a glut in the market, steelcompanies officials said Friday.     They said China's restraint on economic expansion, including aswitch to a tight credit policy, is primarily responsible for theglut.     The Chinese government has ordered domestic steelmakers to limittheir production to reduce large inventories resulting fromoverproduction in 1994, they said.     China's crude steel output was estimated at 90 million tons in1994.     Japanese steel producers recently bowed to a Chinese demand fora price cut of about 8.0% for their steel shipments in theFebruary-July period.     The officials said Japanese steel companies already face growingcalls for price cuts from Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia.     Prices of steel products bound for India and the Middle Easthave also declined by about 10% from the July-September level ofthis year.

In a bid to level the playing field among China's backwardinland regions and its booming special economic zones, and to offerforeign enterprises the same treatment as domestic one, the StateCouncil has issued a circular calling for the reduction of thegeneral tariff rate to 23%.     It also called for an end to the duty-free benefits enjoyed bythe special economic zones, the Economic Daily said.     The circular conforms with the tariff cuts promised by ChinesePresident Jiang Zemin at the Osaka informal summit meeting ofAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in October and is seenas a significant step toward China's entry into the World TradeOrganization.     No information was provided on the precise size of reductions orwhich products would have their import duties cut.     However, regulations were set out regarding a transition periodfor preferential tax policies and duty-free benefits for foreigninvestment projects legally approved before the publication of thecircular.     Foreign investment projects worth more than 30 million dollarsand approved before Dec. 28 would continue to enjoy their reduced andduty-free tariffs and preferential import taxes on imported equipmentand raw materials until Dec. 31, 1997, it said, while such projectsvalued under 30 million dollars could extend the previous policyuntil Dec. 31, 1996.     Equipment for technological transformation approved for importbefore the issuance of the circular would also continue to enjoyprevious preferential import policies during the transition period,it said.     If equipment and resources are not imported within the specifiedtransition periods, enterprises could ask the Ministry of ForeignTrade and Economic Cooperation or the State Economic and TradeCommission for an extension from the State Council, it said.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN ECONOMIC NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996China breaks another grain output record in '95+BEIJING, Dec. 29 Kyodo     Chinese farmers harvested a record 466 million tons of grain in1995, up 21 million tons over last year and nearly 10 million tonsover the previous record harvest in 1993, Xinhua News Agencyreported Friday.     The record output came, though several grain growing areas wereplagued by natural disaster during the year and rising costs forfertilizer and pesticides threatened to keep farmers off the land.     ''With the rise in grain prices mainly blamed for last year'shigh inflation rate, the 1995 increase in output is a great help inthe nation's efforts at curbing inflation and easing the strainedgrain market,'' analysts said, according to Xinhua.

Remittances from such workers to the nine countries totaled 75billion dollars in 1993, exceeding their aggregate ODA of 54 billiondollars from industrialized countries, including Japan, the surveyshows.     The survey covered the Philippines, Thailand, India, Bangladesh,Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, China and South Korea.     In the Philippines and Indonesia, the ratio of contract workers'annual remittances to the nations' gross domestic product (GDP) is onthe rise, according to figures collated by the Manila-based regionallending institution.     In a period from 1987 to 1993, the aggregate of remittances homefrom Indonesian contract workers abroad quadrupled from 86 milliondollars to 346 million dollars, while that of Filipino workers showeda 2.4-fold jump from 1.02 billion dollars to 2.54 million dollars,the survey showed.     In contrast, the aggregate home remittances from Thai and SouthKorean workers saw much slower growth ratios over similar periods.     Aggregate remittances from South Korean workers increasednearly 50% from 418 million dollars to 605 million dollars from 1987to 1993, while those from Thai workers grew 40% from 784 milliondollars to 1.13 billion dollars in a period from 1987 to 1992,according to the bank figures.     This could imply that a nation's dependence on such remittanceeases as its economy prospers, alleviating the need for contractworkers to go abroad and send money home, analysts said.Back to Headline

1996ASIA CHASES THE 1996 'INFRABUCK'China faces, 'strong competition from the rest of Asia in attractingdevelopment capital,' Trevor Bush, NatWest Markets managing directorfor China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, told a conference in Beijing recently.He explained that China risks losing out to other Asian countries whichare introducing legal and regulatory reforms at a faster rate toattract international financing for infrastructure projects.The statement reflects comments made recently by Ted Rule, executivedirector of Asian Infrastructure Fund Advisors. Talking about build-operate-transfer projects in China, and in particular road schemes, hesaid international banks are not usually prepared to finance buildinghighways where the return comes only from the project itself. He saysthat to attract the money, China must allow substantially higher roadtolls, like Indonesia where tolls are 50 to 75 per cent higher.It is true that China has its problems attracting the infrabuck. Itssystem of law routinely causes clashes between the central and stategovernments. It has no binding BOT legislation, local governments haveno right to sell land to foreigners (although in plenty of cases theydo), and, at times it seems that the central government is trying toput the brakes on the process of attracting the internationalinfrabuck. In an attempt to harness its foreign debt it has bannedprovincial governments from proceeding on projects without centralgovernment approval, and has cut the sectors which are open to foreigninvestment. Against this background, competition from other Asiannations should be rife, each one offering the international infrabuck asubstantially better deal than it gets in China.But where exactly is the 'strong competition'? Which countries arewinning the infrabucks?Ted Rule cites Indonesian toll roads, but all the road contracts havegone to the state-run toll road operator Jasa Marga, or consortia madeup of Indonesian companies, including Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada,controlled by president Suharto's eldest daughter. There has beeninterest from international companies in Indonesia's road projects butso far no private projects have been awarded to these companies - andthus no international infrabucks.Indonesia has been persistently criticised for its lack of transparentbidding for projects, particularly by the World Bank, and its group ofdonor countries. Politically Indonesia is 'stable', even if it lacks acommon democracy, and certainly foreign investment through the stockmarket is strong. But analysts' judgements on stocks tend to be basedon how they view the political clout of the companies, not on thecompanies' efficiency or management. Indonesia seems no better thanChina at attracting the infrabuck.Earlier this year the Philippines seemed the ideal place for theinternational infrabuck. President Ramos had privatised electricitygeneration with tremendous success, and private generating companieswere guaranteed minimum sales through the state grid. The country has asophisticated BOT law, a dedicated department to deal with BOT projectswhich reports directly to Ramos, and transparent bidding procedures.Now the president has pushed through executive powers to be able tohandle the water supply crisis in the same way as the power shortages,and has invited the IFC to advise on the best means of privatisingwater.But cracks are beginning to appear that will worry internationalinvestors. There has been a huge upsurge of the 'Filipino-First'attitude. In October the Supreme Court placed a temporary ban on thegovernment sale of the Manila Hotel to Malaysia's Renong when thelosing Philippine-based Manila Prince Hotel lodged a petition citing'Filipino-First'. This will deter international investors if a losingnational firm insists on preferential treatment on the basis ofnationality.Fuelling the Filipino-First sentiments is Representative RamonBagatsing, who has introduced a House Bill which stipulates that thehiring of consultants for infrastructure projects should be limited toFilipinos. The only exceptions are where the hiring of foreignconsultants is a condition of a loan, where the local consultants donot have the necessary experience or where bilateral agreements exist.Cost is not cited as a reason to appoint foreign consultants.President Ramos has given two airport contracts to a group of sixChinese-Filipinos who have formed the Asian Emerging Dragon Consortium.Despite interest from foreign companies, AEDC has been promised thecontract as long as it matches the lowest tender. Not surprisingly,there are not many bids to match. International companies who areinterested in the projects would rather tie up with AEDC than present abid themselves against such obvious bias.Another reason that the Philippines may lose out on the infrabuck isbecause of new regulations that are being discussed. At present foreignexchange-denominated profits can be repatriated. The government is nowlooking at compelling contractors to accept peso payments and torequire them to make regular remittance reports to the central bank.The department of finance has also recommended an overhaul of thegovernment guarantee scheme for BOT projects by imposing fees on suchguarantees, requiring contractors to share the risks of the projectsand reducing any future guarantees. In only six months the Philippineshas lost its edge as a strong competitor for the internationalinfrabuck.In the last few years India has pledged itself fully to privately-funded infrastructure projects. The ministry of surface transportproduced a glossy brochure advertising areas for private portdevelopment, management and operation. International companies havebeen invited to do free feasibility studies for sections of a planned13,000km of national toll roads. The promised pay-off was the contractto build and operate the roads and to develop the land around theroute, as long as they could match the lowest bidder (which was to beevaluated according to its proposed toll levy) for each section. TheIFC are advising on water privatisation in some states and plans areafoot to bring in a dedicated BOT law which bypasses the morass ofcentral and local laws that currently have to be negotiated.The prospects looked good, but in reality almost nothing has happened.Plans have been bogged down by local elections and a central governmentthat is desperately trying to curry favour for the elections this year(1996). Privatisation is rarely popular with the electorate.In November, the finance ministry refused to approve the national tollroad project. It objected to the fact that each contract was almostguaranteed to go to the company undertaking the feasibility studies,and the fact that those companies would not have to pre-qualify totender. Twenty-two firms had already started studies at their ownexpense.Disputes over Dabhol, the supposedly fast-track private power projectwhich Enron was awarded in Maharastra, have also concernedinternational investors. Local newspapers pounced on the story once thedeal was announced, claiming that Enron's profits and the price of theelectricity were not justifiable. The project has since been droppedand resurrected like a yo-yo, although there are some signs that acompromise is likely to be reached soon.As for the port privatisations, the ministry of surface transport hasjust turned down a proposal to privatise the management and operationof the existing berths at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust near Bombay.The construction of two new berths at the port are apparently beingoffered to the private sector and details are on page 14. The questionremains, though, whether it will always be 'future' projects on thebasis that 'tomorrow never comes'? Despite its much-publicisedwelcoming of the private sector into infrastructure, India may not yetbe a serious contender for the international infrabuck.Thailand is faring no better in nurturing the climate that attracts theinfrabuck. It is host to an array of political scandals, particularlyin the appointment of contractors for infrastructure projects. Itsrecord for rewarding those that provide the international infrabuck hasbeen poor. Government pledges to hand over land or to ascertain rightsof way on inner-city route clashes have been ignored. And, to add toThailand's problems, the government changes frequently, the leadingparty has not had a majority for years, and each new government selectsdifferent projects for its 'infrastructure priority'.Vietnam, on the other hand, will be desperate to compete with China -although its estimated $6bn needed by the year 2000 is nothing comparedto China's requirements. But Vietnam is simply too poor to get themoney. 'There aren't that many projects on which you could recoup yourmoney because the market isn't there,' a lawyer was quoted as saying(AIM/June issue/p2).Malaysia is probably the most advanced country in Asia in terms of itsprivate sector infrastructure facilities. Even here politicalrequirements conflict with the conditions which attract internationalinvestors. Worried about its inflation rate, the government has steppedin to dissuade PLUS from raising its toll rates on the North-Southhighway. This is despite a contract which guarantees minimum rates ofreturn and orders the state to pay compensation if it interferes withthe toll rates levied to reach that return.Malaysia's record is on the whole good for privately-run infrastructurefacilities. It is a tested market, and one that is likely to remainattractive to the international infrabuck. Analysts are worried,however, that its high rate of growth makes it unstable, and its ownbuilding projects (such as the new airport and the planned newadministrative capital) will overstretch its resources. Indeed much ofits growth comes from construction projects which are due to becompleted by the Asian Games in 1998, and some observers doubt whetherit can pay for the private services once the boom is over. There isconcern that private companies are going to face both a shrinkingdemand and a public outcry over tariff rates once the games are overand the economy slows down.Whatever doubts there are about China, it is competing in an arenawhere every false move is publicly known and the scale of the projectscauses inevitable problems. The whimsy of its officials certainlyrenders China less attractive but all its competitors have a job to doin wooing 1996's infrabucks. Co-operation between the public and theprivate sectors require all parties to be competent, consistent,flexible, full of integrity and re-elected without problems every time.However, in the real world, some things will go wrong. What is alsoevident is that Asia's need is so great and the region is expanding sofast that private infrabucks must find sensible employment. Then it isonly a matter of returning to the question 'where?'.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CHINA: RAILWAY MINISTRY IS LOOKING TO 'MAKE CONTACTS'China plans to widen the opportunities for foreign funding in railwayconstruction in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000). At theforthcoming Third International Modern Railway Equipment Exhibition inBeijing in March, the ministry of railways has said it plans to makewide contacts with foreign companies for purchasing major technologyand rail equipment, especially in the construction of high-speedrailways which is to be a key focus of the new five-year plan. Between1980 and 1994, the country used $4bn in foreign loans from governmentsand international organisations and $1.15bn from the World Bank in itskey railway projects.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CHINA-INDIA RAIL LINK IS PROPOSEDDiscussions are under way between China and India on a potentially hugerail co-operation scheme which could form the backbone of a moreambitious project to build a trans-Asia railway. According to a recentreport in the Asia Times, both Chinese and Indian officials areexploring the idea of building a high-speed freight railway which wouldconnect India and China through Burma.It is understood that the railway scheme was conceived by a consortiumled by China-based Upleader International. The consortium is alsobelieved to include China Railway Engineering and ConstructionCorporation, Techrail Engineering (Malaysia), TFA (USA), and Canadiantransport specialists.Talks between the two countries are said to have started six monthsago. 'China's government is said to support the project, hoping todevelop the country's interior provinces and to take a more dominantrole in global trade,' the newspaper said. It added that a railwayconnecting India and China would 'theoretically' tie into China'snational railway in Yunnan province - which faces Burma's north-easternborder - and run through North Korea and Russia. A southern branch ofthe India-China railway could use existing tracks which run fromSingapore to Thailand through Malaysia.One of the biggest problems if such a project were to go beyond thefeasibility stage would be gauges. China, for example, has no standardgauge and its national rail system uses many different gauges. Thailandand Malaysia uses narrow gauges rather than the standard-gauge tracksthat have been adopted by many countries.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SHANGHAI PLANS INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING CENTREShanghai, which houses China's biggest port, has mapped out a three-stage strategy to develop an international shipping centre over thenext two decades. Vice-mayor, Sha Lin, recently said that between 1996and the year 2000, the city would start building the centre, initiallywith a project to deepen channels at the mouth of the Yangtze River to8.5m.When the first stage ends, the first port will be able to handle 220mtonnes of cargo - up from 170m tonnes last year - and move 2.5m-3m TEUcontainers. Mr Sha, speaking at the Marintec China 95 symposium, saidthe next stage would see the port capacity enlarged and the channeldeepened to 12.5m to accommodate container ships of over 50,000 tonnesby 2010.By 2020, he added, Shanghai would be able to handle super Panamaxcontainer vessels. Shanghai would also develop new shipping andshipbuilding industries to achieve its objective.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SHANGHAI UNVEILS NEW POLICY FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENTThe Shanghai municipal government is counting on new preferentialpolicies to help overcome the resistance of foreign constructioncompanies to become involved in the city's ambitious urban housingredevelopment programme. Guaranteed after-tax returns on investmentwill be limited to 15 per cent, but the main sweetener is new policiesdesigned to reduce the risks and red tape involved in building cheapflats for residents.According to Huang Yuejing, deputy general secretary of the Shanghaimunicipal government, regulations allowing foreign investment indomestic housing projects were actually issued at the end of 1993, butdid not find any takers. 'Potential investors were discouraged by thehuge outlays for demolition of old buildings, relocation of residentsand the provision of utilities, all of which took a huge bite out ofprospective profits,' he said. Foreign developers also had to team upwith local parties to buy a plot of land for re-development, and pay atransfer fee for the rights to the land, adding to the costs and risks.What investment there has been has tended to concentrate on luxuryhousing, most of which is being snapped up by overseas buyers. Thecentral government is now clamping down on this type of construction inmajor cities throughout the country and insisting the local authoritiesswitch the emphasis to low-cost mass housing. To overcome resistance,Huang said, 'we have come up with new policies which we estimate willsave overseas investors much of their expense if they put their moneyinto housing projects for domestic sale rather than for overseasbuyers.'The new approach, which applies to all foreign-investment projects inareas with high concentrations of shabby or dangerous houses, calls forthe local authority to allocate the land to the Chinese partner in aSino-foreign joint venture, with the foreign side providing thefinancing. Financial assistance will also be provided for thedemolition of the old homes and rehousing of residents - with theinvestors only having to pay a maximum 30 per cent contribution to theremoval costs. Help is also promised for the construction of utilities,although the exact nature and scope of the assistance has not yet beenspelt out.The Shanghai municipal government is pledged to buy the entire housingproject when completed, and be responsible for its eventual sale. Therewill be a guaranteed 15 per cent after-tax return on the investment,which, as one developer suggested, 'effectively means the authoritiesare borrowing the money from the foreign side and promising to pay 15per cent interest.' This profit can be remitted overseas free of any ofthe normal restrictions on foreign exchange.Some 3.1m sq m of land in 114 lots has been identified by theauthorities as available for low-cost housing development with foreigninvolvement. Huang is convinced there should be plenty of takersbecause, 'market demand is very high as the government is determined toincrease per capita living space.' The goal is to raise this from thepresent 7.5 to 10 sq m by the end of the century. Some 3.65m sq m ofdilapidated housing has to be renovated in order to meet this target.But Shanghai does not have the capacity to raise enough financing onits own, he stressed. Real estate analysts in the city agree the schemeshould be attractive to investors. They point out that the housinginvolved will be low rise and low cost, so that companies could developa 'supermarket approach' in which units could be quickly assembled fromprefabricated parts. With the authorities paying on completion, thedevelopers can then have money available for further construction,making projects basically self-financing once the first has beencompleted.The Shanghai approach is likely to be copied by other municipalauthorities. Beijing, for example, is reported to be considering asimilar package of financial incentives with a reported guaranteedreturn of 18 per cent.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996STUDY LOOKS AT DIVERTING WATER TO SUPPLY BEIJINGA feasibility study is due to be presented to the Chinese governmentthis month (January 1996) on a plan to channel water from the YangtseRiver basin to the drought-stricken, heavily-populated northern partsof the country, including the capital Beijing and adjacent areas ofHebei Province. Some 200 experts are working on the study whichinvolves three different channel routes.Officials in Beijing say construction could start within the nextcouple of years depending on the decision of an appraisal committee setup under the minister of water resources, Niu Maosheng. Although thereare a number of technical problems to be overcome, analysts say themain concerns are likely to be financial. No figure has yet beenrevealed as to the possible cost.At a recent seminar in Beijing, experts exchanged views on theproject's three different proposed routes for carrying water from theYangtse basin over several thousand kilometres to the northern citiesthat are chronically short of water for industrial and domestic use. Anestimated 70bn cu m a year is scheduled to be siphoned off from theYangtse.The so-called 'East China' route entails linking the river with theGrand Canal. This would be the easiest option both technically andfinancially, because it would utilise existing facilities. But the mainconcern of experts is the environmental risk as all the region'swaterways have pollution levels far in excess of state-set limits. Theproject, however, could be tied in with a current programme to persuadeforeign investors to join up with interested Chinese parties to provideclean water supplies to the key cities of central and east China.The "Central China" route would use the existing Danjiankou reservoiron the Hianjiang River, a tributary of the Yangtse to the north, as thegathering point, and then siphon off the water through a new channel tobe dug as far as Beijing.The "West China" route is the most complicated, calling for a system ofcanals linking up the headwaters of the Yangtse and the Yellow Riverswhich are quite close. This would be the most technically demanding,calling for the construction of a 300m dam and at least 100km oftunnels beneath some of the massive mountain ranges which dominate theneighbouring provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai.It is not clear how much foreign involvement there might be in theproject. But a spokesman for the ministry of water resources said itwas highly unlikely that China would have the technical or financialmeans to go it alone on whichever route was chosen. The main questionto be settled is probably how to make involvement financiallyattractive for foreign investors, the spokesman added.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996TUMEN RIVER DEVELOPMENT INCHES FORWARDIn early December, representatives of China, the two Koreas, Russia andMongolia signed three agreements at the United Nations that paves theway for the so-called second phase of development of the Tumen RiverEconomic Development Area (TREDA).To be sure, the objectives of the second phase are modest. They includethe introduction of a framework for achieving 'sustainable economic andsocial development' and call for the creation of a consultativecommission to promote investment, technical co-operation andenvironmental protection. A separate co-ordinating committee will beset up for trade and investment. Moreover, in an attempt to build anorganisational framework for the economic zone, member countriesconsented to the establishment of a permanent secretariat.UNDP chief, James Speth, who presided over the signing ceremony saidthe second phase would benefit the poor and jobless of the region andmarked an important step in the development process. 'These initiativeshave changed the situation into a dynamic investment environment,' hesaid, adding that until now the area's borders, 'tended to be barriersrather than doors'.Announced in 1991, the project involves ambitious plans to unlock theresource-rich region, long cut-off from world markets and investors, byopening up regional borders. The massive project stretches from Yanbianand Changbaishan Mountains in China, to Nakhodia in Russia in the northand to Chonjin in North Korea. It is intended to make the regioneconomically vibrant.Major infrastructure projects planned for the area include a new port,11 specialised harbours and a rail hub.

Macau Airport companychairman, Dr Antonio Diogo Pinto, said current plans include a $35mhigh-speed ferry pier and a massive expansion of air cargo,warehousing, office and hotel facilities at the airport.Dr Pinto said the airport, which has only been operating since earlyNovember, has already exceeded expectations.

At a recent meeting with the Hong KongAirport Authority he said it was a 'waste of time' to open the newairport without a second runway.The first runway of the new international airport at Chek Lap Kok isnot expected to open for business until 1998. 'We don't see the pointin spending vast sums of money to build an airport which doesn'tincrease capacity,' he said, adding that, if anything, the new airportwould constrain capacity while requiring airlines to pay higher landingfees - landing and parking fees at Kai Tak, already stretched tocapacity, have increased 28 per cent over the last three years makingit one of the most expensive in the world. IATA's views on the secondrunway are shared by Hong Kong's main carrier, Cathay Pacific.Gordon Sui, secretary for economic services, denied the IATA claim.'The new airport will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, unlikeKai Tak which is severely restricted by a curfew,' he said recently.'Even with one runway, existing capacity at the new airport will beincreased from 26 million passengers to 36 million passengers peryear.' Sui also said there had never been any suggestion to build onerunway at Chek Lap Kok. 'The new airport was designed for two runwaysand that is exactly what the new airport will have. The opening of asecond runway will be a matter of timing.' He said the government willbe looking at the traffic flow at the new airport before making a finaldecision.Jeanniot said he thought there may be another reason for thegovernment's reluctance to open the airport with two runways. 'Thereseems to be a paralysis in the decision-making process. A feeling thatit is more political than anything else.' The airport project, thelargest single engineering project in the world, has been at the centreof a fierce political debate between China and Britain since it wasannounced in 1989 by the former governor, Sir David Wilson.That debate has cooled down somewhat and in early December Britain andChina agreed to drop the 'provisional' from the Provisional AirportAuthority. It was seen as a major turning point in the massive project.Not only is Hong Kong getting a new airport it is also getting theinfrastructure investment that goes with it - a new bridge linkingKowloon to Lantau Island, massive reclamation to support a highway, anda rail link to Hong Kong and Kowloon with property developmentsspringing up around the new stations.From December 1, 1995 the Airport Authority took over from theProvisional Airport Authority with pro-China businessman, Wong Po-yan,at the helm. Recently it went to the market for a massive HK$8.2bn($1.06bn) syndicated loan and revolving credit. The loan consists of aHK$6.4bn ($872m) loan and a HK$1.8bn ($233m) revolving facility. Theauthority will pay an interest rate of 43 basis points (0.43 percentagepoint) above the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate for both tranches ofthe loan. The Airport Authority was permitted to borrow an additionalHK$3.4bn ($440m) under Sino-British agreements.In January the Monetary Authority signed an agreement to act asarranging agent for the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) for aHK$10bn ($1.3bn) note-issuance facility. The Airport Authority has saidit would find such a facility attractive if it carried access to theMonetary Authority's liquidity adjustment facility. The AirportAuthority's issues would be of shorter maturities than the MTRC issuesbecause it has to pay off the first part of the project by the end of2001.Standard Chartered Bank recently described Hong Kong's existinginternational airport as 'an indispensable piece of infrastructurepromoting the territory's rapid economic growth.' But Kai Tak hasreached its full capacity. Between now and the opening day of the newairport, Kai Tak will become more and more congested. 'An efficientairport is part and parcel of Hong Kong's competitive advantage inserving as a business centre for the Asia-Pacific region as well as forChina,' the bank said. It has been estimated that any further delays onthe new airport could cost Hong Kong dearly. Failure to meet projectedrising demand for air transport could cost the territory HK$420bn($54bn) between 1997 and 2010 the bank said.More than 20 per cent of aircraft movements at Kai Tak either originatein China or are destined for the mainland.

AA corporate development director, Clinton Leeks, said theAuthority is confident the lost time can be clawed back and the airport'remains on target for substantial completion by mid-1997.'

Work was held up for several weeks,although the contract is back on schedule.Industry insiders say the difficulties stem from the fast-track natureof the airport project. 'The AA wants contractors to start as soon asthe contract is agreed on day one. Its just not possible. It takes timeto get staff to Hong Kong and organise the massive amounts of equipmentneeded,' commented one construction chief. 'There is also a limit tohow much construction can physically be done. The contract periods areunrealistic. The foundations are a case in point. Heavy rains probablyheld the job up by two months, but the remaining three month delay waslargely caused because the contractor couldn't go any faster,' headded.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HONG KONG: OPPORTUNITIES ARISE FROM CLK'S PRIVATE FACILITIESConstruction of the privately financed facilities at Chek Lap Kok,including cargo handling and aircraft maintenance, got off to a flyingstart with key awards for design work going mainly to British firms.One of the biggest schemes is the $1bn construction of the world'slargest air cargo complex by Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals.

The dispute is a result of the terminationof a tunnelling contract between the two companies.Touted as the 'key to the success of the project,' by the ministry oftransportation and communication's (MOTC) Taiwan Area NationalExpressway Engineering Bureau (TANEEB), the 12.9km Pinglin Tunnel hasyet to be started. In a contract signed in October 1993, Ret-Ser sub-contracted the building of the tunnel to SB. However, the contractrequired Ret-Ser to build a 12.9km pilot tunnel. Although constructionon the pilot tunnel began in July 1991, only 1.5km was completed by theproposed date of March 25, 1995.'Poor geological conditions is the reason for the delay,' said Ret-Ser's department of special projects director, Tsai Hsi-chi. Heexplained that the $1m tunnel boring machine (TBM), used by Ret-Ser forthe first time, got stuck on numerous occasions, the most recentincident halting work for a nine month stretch. In addition, waterinflow to the tunnel was more than triple the maximum safe operatinglimit of 35 litres per second which halted work.TANEEB has already approved a 300-day extension for Ret-Ser to completethe pilot tunnel, but Ret-Ser is currently preparing more documents toapply for a further 365 day extension in the near future, said Ret-Serexecutive vice president, Shen Ching-peng.Despite the non-completion of the pilot tunnel Ret-Ser asked SB tobegin tunnelling on the main tunnel. SB refused claiming the work wouldbe a safety hazard and could result in unforeseen problems and delayswithout all the geological data gleaned from the completion of thepilot tunnel. SB project manager, Olivier Colin, likened the situationto the construction of a house - the foundations must be completedbefore construction can proceed. 'We proposed a number of alternativeconstruction methods for the main tunnel without geological data fromthe pilot tunnel, but this was rejected by Ret-Ser,' he said.The French sub-contractor has now filed a civil suit accusing Ret-Serof wrongful termination of the $50m contract after failing to re-negotiate the price on the original contract. SB have asserted that Ret-Ser's delay on the completion of the pilot tunnel has resulted inincreased cost and time, thus requiring a revised amount in the newcontract. SB claimed that it stated as a pre-condition in the Requestfor Proposal three years ago that the quote on the tunnel project wasbased on the completion of the pilot tunnel. Ret-Ser maintains thatthere were no clauses in the contract that stated the pilot tunnel mustbe completed before SB begins boring the main tunnel.Ret-Ser's Tsai has also asserted that a change in identity of SB is themain reason for terminating the contract. The original sub-contractorwas the 150-year-old Spie Battignolles that in July became 'SpieBattignolles TP' after a restructure and recapitalisation in a mergerbetween Spie Battignolles and its parent company Schneider. 'Accordingto Taiwan law, the name on the contract cannot be changed. SB is notthe one who entered into the contract,' said Shen.Ret-Ser further allege that SB provided inadequate documentation on the'new company.' Ret-Ser says it is unable to ascertain that the new SBmeets the requirements under the Pre-Qualification list, a factor thatfirst won Spie Battignolles the contract. Further negotiations withSchneider proved futile as the parent company refused to act asguarantor for SB, said Shen.According to Colin, SB is still the same company as the name on thecontract. The 'TP' or 'Civil Works' was added to the name to emphasiseits focus on civil construction, he said. SB's capital was boosted fromabout $40m to around $161m after the merger with Schneider. 'SB'srecapitalisation made the company stronger. A change of name was justan excuse from Ret-Ser to terminate the contract,' he added.SB's official spokesperson, C. P. Chen, has said that another problembehind the dispute is that many local companies still operate in the'Chinese Way'. 'Political and cultural differences stand in the way ofproductive co-operation between local and foreign companies,' he said.An example of the 'Chinese Way' was Ret-Ser's forcible take-over ofSB's construction and office facilities in mid-November. SBsubsequently lodged a criminal complaint to the Ilan districtprosecutor's office which is currently investigating the case. 'It istrue that the three TBMs are the assets of TANEEB and Ret-Ser duringthe construction, but checking SB employee's passports and confiscatingthe company's accounts, geological data and documents is unreasonableand illegal according to our lawyer,' said Chen. He agreed that SB wasin for a tough legal battle against the government-owned Ret-Ser,technically a department under the Executive Yuan (Cabinet)'sVocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen, rather than astate-owned enterprise. 'But SB is willing to take on that challenge toprotect its own interest,' Chen added.Colin sees the cause of the dispute as a simple case of shirkingresponsibilities. 'The only reason Ret-Ser terminated the contract isto hide the fact that they cannot finish the project and to escapetheir responsibility. They desperately needed a scapegoat, and as it isaround election time, SB became that ideal scapegoat.'However, Spie Battignolle has previously acted as the sub-contractor toRet-Ser for projects in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Bahrain which havebeen successful according to Colin. 'SB had a good working relationshipand worked in total confidence with Ret-Ser - that is why we came overto Taiwan. SB will work again in Taiwan if a new opportunity arises andconditions are different. We will be more prudent, since we are not theonly company that have problems with government agencies. Theconstruction business can be bad and risky but not everything can be100 per cent covered on paper. A lot of working relationship is basedon trust,' he said.Meanwhile, Ret-Ser is in discussion with Italy's Torno about completingthe Pinglin Tunnel. The Italian construction company has already won abid to work on a 4.8km tunnel, also on the Taipei-Ilan Expressway.Torno was one of the two companies that expressed interest in thePinglin Tunnel out of eight companies that put in a Request forProposal. Shen said that Ret-Ser will approach the remaining sixcompanies individually to find a new sub-contractor to finish theproject.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996PHILIPPINES: BARRIERS ARE OVERCOME FOR LRT-3One of Manila's light rail transit schemes has finally clearedfinancial, political and legal barriers. It now seems that the project,known as LRT-3, can go ahead unimpeded.Senator Franciso Tatad and other opponents had tried to stop theproject, but the Supreme Court has thrown out their petition.The concessionaires, led by Fil-Estate and Ayala have raised $150m asinitial paid-up capital. They have appointed JP Morgan as theirfinancial advisor, and are looking to raise a further $100m and tofloat $300m worth of debt instruments on the international capitalmarkets. Domestic banks (local and foreign) have agreed to provide theremaining $100m of the total $650m that is required.The last problem was posed by the so-called 'Save Edsa Movement', ledby columnist Antonio Abaya and supported by the Philippine MotorAssociation. Edsa is an acronym for the road along which LRT-3 willrun. The movement objected to the traffic chaos that will be createdwhen the work is undertaken. It initially proposed an alternative routefor LRT-3, along Circumferential Road No. 5, which runs parallel toEdsa. However, it has softened its stance and is amendable to the routealong Edsa, as long as alternative routes are provided for vehiclesbefore construction commences.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996INDONESIA: ELABORATE LRT PLANS ARE ANNOUNCED FOR JAKARTAIn the middle of December, 1995, PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada (CLGP)suddenly announced an elaborate extension to its plans for a light railsystem in Jakarta. It has now said it will spend $1.2bn on a three-level transport artery in Jakarta, comprised of a public road on theground, a light rail line above that and a toll road on the top. Thestructure is to cover a distance of 16km between Bintaro in southJakarta, downtown Kota in north Jakarta, and a further 2km from Bintaroto Blok M, also in south Jakarta.Company chief executive, Bambang Soeroso, said that a consortium wouldbe formed in May 1996 to carry out the project and finance would bearranged. CLGP spokesman, Fariza Irawadi, said that the light-railaspect of the venture was almost certain to require the participationof one or more foreign partners. 'Up to now we haven't had anyexperience in this country with light rail,' he told AIM. He added thatthe company's considerable experience in elevated toll roadconstruction meant that overseas expertise was unlikely to be neededfor the remainder of the project. Fariza would not be drawn on thecomposition of the consortium, but confirmed that several foreigncompanies have expressed interest.He said the plan had not yet been completed and that there might stillbe further administrative 'input' on the scheme. 'After that the finalengineering design will be prepared. It will be finished in one year,with construction beginning in 1997,' he said.Only in November the plan was still known to the public as entailingthe construction of a light-rail simpliciter. At the beginning ofNovember, director general of highway construction, SoeharsonoMartakim, said that construction of the light rail line, at that timestill known as the Light Rapid Transit (LRT) system, would begin inApril 1996. In mid-November, when the project carried a price tag of$800m, minister of transportation, Haryanto Dhanutirto, said that theLRT would be carried out by CLGP in co-operation with Steady Safe, theowner of a city taxi business.The project outline has changed extensively, but what has stayed thesame is that it remains in the hands of CLGP which is controlled by thepresident's daughter. The company remains the major private-sectorinvestor in Indonesian toll roads. It has also built tolls roads inMalaysia and is preparing to undertake two large toll road projects inthe Philippines.The Jakarta light rail project was awarded to CLGP early this yearwithout a tender. Commenting on the fact recently, Haryanto said itfollowed because the project had been proposed to the government by thecompany. In August, Ms Rukmana publicly denied that her company'ssuccess in gaining infrastructure projects was related to her closerelationship with the president. 'My father, who happens to be trustedby the people to lead the nation, has always reminded me not to use hisname for business purposes,' she told a local newspaper.On December 16, 1995, CLGP's subsidiary, Citra Bhakti Margatama Persada(CBMP) broke ground on the Cikunir-Cakung-Cilicing-Tanjung Prioksection of Jakarta's Outer Ring Road. The 1,920km section of toll roadis scheduled to be operational in 1999, at an investment of Rp1,040m($4.5bn). Company representatives said the project would be financedwith loans from domestic banks. CBMP is a BOT joint venture betweenstate-owned toll road company Jasa Marga (34.83 per cent) and CLGP,Tridan Satriaputra Indonesia, Bhaskara Duniajaya and Yayasan TiaraIndah. Consultants on the project include Pacific ConsultantInternational and BIEC International.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BATAM AIRPORT IS UPGRADED TO RIVAL SINGAPOREIndonesia has started construction of an aircraft maintenance facilityand upgraded the international airport on the island of Batam in a bidto rival Singapore's Changi airport's role as an international flighthub for the south-east Asian region. Batam island, which lies a fewkilometres south of Singapore, is being developed as an industrial andtourist centre together with the Singapore government authorities. Theisland's airport already serves as a centre for cargo traffic forindustrial estates located there.Batam's Hang Nadim airport, controlled by the Indonesian governmentthrough the Batam Industrial Development Authority, has had its runwayextended to 4km at a cost of about $217m. It can now accommodate wide-bodied aircraft such as Boeing 747-400s.Construction of an aircraft maintenance and services facility has alsostarted. PT BAM, or Batam Aircraft Maintenance, located adjacent toBatam's airport, is scheduled to complete a hangar at a cost of Rp18bn($7.9m) by the end of 1996. It is hoped that BAM's services will helplure customers away from Singapore's Changi airport. The maintenancefacility is being built to handle different types of aircraft includingBoeing 737 jets, Fokker planes and Indonesian-built CN 235s. BAM ismajority-owned by Indonesian entities including the state-ownedaircraft manufacturing company, IPTN, and Sempati Air, a privatedomestic airline controlled by one of President Suharto's sons.However, Singapore Technologies Aerospace, a unit of the Singaporegovernment's Singapore Technologies, also has a 25 per cent stake inBAM. Singapore Technologies Aerospace is originally believed to havewanted to take a majority stake in the project, a move which wasopposed by Indonesia's minister for research and technology, Mr B.J.Habibie. As chairman of the Batam Industrial Development Authority, MrHabibie is closely involved with the island's progress.Batam's goal is to become an international aviation hub. Aviation fuelis about 20 per cent less expensive on Batam than in Singapore.However, Singapore's Changi airport controls flight information inparts of Indonesian airspace, including Batam. The latter has been apoint of some friction between Indonesia and Singapore, although theboundaries of flight information regions were revised in September 1995when President Suharto made an official visit to Singapore.Indonesia was given control of air traffic services over an additionalspace stretching from south of its islands of Sumatra to the Natunaislands in the South China Sea but Singapore's Changi airport retainssupervision of aircraft movements from airports in Batam andneighbouring Bintan.The Indonesian authorities want Batam's Hang Nadim airport to act as atransit and connecting point for international flights. However,Indonesian officials admit this is still a long way off. 'It is stillhard for international air carriers to transit at Hang Nadim, as theflow of goods and passengers is still low,' the director general of airtransportation, Mr Zainuddin Sikado, was quoted as saying in theJakarta Post. 'The most important thing will be how Batam improves thequality of its services.'Currently, there are no international flights to Batam, although elevendomestic flights connect Batam to other airports throughout theIndonesian archipelago. Local press reports said that by the end of1999 twelve additional domestic routes are due to be served from HangNadim.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SINGAPORE DECIDES TO LIST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTSSingapore's finance minister, Dr Richard Hu, has just announced thecreation of a foreign board for listing regional infrastructureprojects on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES). The listing criteriaof the foreign board are less stringent than those for the main board.Infrastructure projects do not require a profit record, they need onlyshow potential for a reasonable rate of return and good cash flow'vouched by competent and independent experts.'For analysts the comparisons with Malaysia are unavoidable. InSeptember, the Securities Commission there issued a set ofcomprehensive guidelines that paved the way for infrastructure projectsto be listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Unlikeconventional initial public offerings, the guidelines stated thatinfrastructure project companies (IPCs), which have long gestationperiods, can offer their shares based on forecast earnings, even ifthey do not have a profit record.Candidates for a listing on the KLSE are likely to include EkranCorporation's M$15bn ($5.9bn) Bakun hydroelectric project in Sarawakand the five independent producers. More recently, Malaysia's financeminister, Anwar Ibrahim, said Malaysia may allow foreign infrastructurecompanies controlled by Malaysians to list their shares on the KLSE.The Singapore guidelines state that infrastructure companies wishing tolist on the proposed new foreign board must have secured projects worthat least S$300m ($212m). These projects must have a remaining lifespanof at least 15 years from the date of listing, though companies withconcessions of at least 10 years will also be considered.'Companies engaged in infrastructure projects need not show profits inthe financial year before listing, nor any record of prior profits, butthey must demonstrate strong cash-flow and a good rate of return overthe duration of the concession,' the SES said in a statement last week.By comparison, Singapore-incorporated non-infrastructure companies musthave a paid-up capital of S$15m ($10.6m) and cumulative pre-tax profitof at least S$7.5m ($5.3m) for the last two years, of which S$3m mustbe chalked up in the latest year prior to listing. Alternatively, thesecompanies can be considered if they show a pre-tax profit of at leastS$10m ($7.1m) for the latest year.'As companies listed on the foreign board are expected to have shortertrack records, investment in these securities may entail additionalrisk,' the SES said. 'Warning about the risks specific to suchcompanies will be required and such warning must be prominentlydisplayed on the front cover of the prospectus.'The shares of these companies will be quoted in a foreign currency andtraded in minimum board lot sizes of $2000 or the equivalent. The SEShas also introduced a moratorium requiring company owners to hold theirshareholding for a year after listing. Although they can sell some oftheir stake in the subsequent two years, they must hold at least 51 percent of the total shares that they had at the time of the listing.'At least one promoter holding at least 20 per cent of the pre-floatation issued capital must have the relevant technical managementexpertise to carry out and operate the project successfully and tofulfil all requirements of the project,' the SES said. Companies listedon the foreign board can transfer to the main board after one year.However, they have to meet the latter's more stringent listingcriteria. Analysts have welcomed the establishment of the new board,the third on the local bourse. They say the new board will help raisethe stature of Singapore as a leading regional financial centre.One investment banker said, 'the new board could attract to Singaporemany large regional companies which are currently contemplating raisingcapital in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney,' he said. 'However the sharesof companies listing on the foreign board are expected to be targetedmainly at institutional buyers'.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE MONTHLY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996THAILAND: BTS MASS TRANSIT OWNERSHIP IS RESTRUCTUREDTanayong, the concessionaire for Bangkok's elevated rail transit, willissue $160m worth of secured bonds as part of a shareholderrestructuring, as doubts continue to grow over its financial status.The listed real estate firm reported in a mandatory stock market filingthat details of the issue price, collateral and launch time would bereleased at a later date.Talks have also opened with Thai-based Siam Commercial Bank on aplanned mobilisation of $562m from local capital markets, which willform the core of financing for the $1.7bn project. It has alreadysecured a $50m loan from the International Finance Corporation andhopes to raise a further $424m from KFW of Germany. 'We understandcontracts for the loans will be signed around the end of the year(1995) and payment will be made in full to contractors shortlyafterwards,' said a banking executive.Piling work on the 24km Bangkok Transit System railway began a year agobut Tanayong has yet to come up with a funding package. Primarily adeveloper of low-cost housing estates, it has been heavily affected bya downturn in the property market and is regarded as having virtually azero credit rating. Bangkok Bank resigned as financial adviser earlierthis year after declining to guarantee a loans package. Itsreplacement, Siam Commercial Bank, is insisting on a shareholderrestructuring that will bring in equipment suppliers and contractors onan equity basis.Italian-Thai Development, the sole construction contractor, has notbeen paid since work started, and is expected to hold a 10 to 15 percent stake. 'The construction cost of the BTS skytrain is around Bt4m-Bt5m ($160,000-$200,000) a month. We have received only Bt200m ($8m)from Tanayong, while the value of work completed is around Bt1.86bn($74.4m),' said company president, Premchai Karnsauta.Siemens, the main equipment supplier, and Siam Commercial are expectedto be the other shareholders. Tanayong has agreed to reduce its staketo 60 per cent, after attempts to push it into a minority role werethwarted by contractual obligations. This will block efforts to raisecash by listing the project on the stock exchange, as market rulesrequire a larger public shareholding. However, another attempt will bemade to diminish Tanayong's stake when its four-year concessionexpires.A Siam Commercial spokesman confirmed that 10 financial institutionshad been approached to join the domestic loans deal, which the bankwill guarantee in the absence of security from Tanayong. The localpackage replaced earlier plans for an issue of US Yankee bonds that wasscuttled by bank worries over foreign exchange fluctuations.Any further delays in putting together a loans package will almostcertainly force a halt in work on the mass transit, which dependsheavily upon the patience of Italian-Thai. About 12 per cent of thepiling work has been finished. 'We will continue to do advance work forBTS in the next year. That is, we will wait until BTS is ready to pay,'said Premchai, 'obviously Italian-Thai cannot be expected to continueon the present basis.'

The remaining funds will come from Hopewell itself. 'Thenegotiations are expected to be concluded early next year (1996). Thesetalks are still going on because Hopewell has just received theconstruction designs, which have to be presented to the creditors,' hesaid.Transport Minister, Wan Muhammad, earlier granted Hopewell another twomonths to show definite progress on the scheme, amid speculation thatit would be scrapped. He said that unspecified action would be takenagainst the firm if it failed to meet the deadline, citing a two-yeardelay in completion of the first phase. 'We will decide at that timewhat steps can be taken, including the possible cancellation. But atpresent we hope that won't be necessary,' he said.The project was approved five years ago as a multi-level combination ofexpressways and railways built above an old freight train line, but hassince made little progress. The Hong Kong firm blames the governmentagencies' delays in handing over land holdings and ironing out designproblems, while the government charges that the contract was poorlydevised.Originally intended to extend 60km, the route is likely to be reducedby at least one-third because of obstructions that cannot be cleared.Anusak said the first stage, from Don Muang airport to Yommarat incentral Bangkok, was due to be completed in early December, but only 7per cent of the work had been carried out. Hopewell now plans to finisha tollway covering all three phases in time for the 1988 Asian Games,and the remaining work two years later.But a transport ministry adviser, Gun Nagamati, said this deadlinewould be almost impossible to meet because detailed designs for theroute were incomplete. 'There are conflict points with four expresswayroutes that have to be resolved and no one has decided who will pay forthe additional construction costs from the necessary design changes.This will take a further 12 months to sort out,' he said.

This isbecause it is unable to provide 25 to 30 per cent of the loan's annualrelease from its own resources. For this fiscal year the budget forroads is just Rs3.66bn ($105m), which is not even sufficient to repairthe existing roads.The surface transport ministry feels that unless the finance ministrygives it an additional grant for these counterpart provisions, it willnot be able to draw on the World Bank loan. Once the ministry commitsitself to drawing the loan it has to pay commitment fees, even if itdoes not finally draw on the loan. The proposed loan was the thirdtranche of the World Bank loan for Indian highways. It was meant forwidening and building bridges along the 1,100km Delhi-Calcutta nationalhighway. After feasibility studies and the project reports globaltenders are normally called for.The second tranche of $200m has been partly used for the nationalhighways projects in six states - Punjab, Haryana, Orissa, West Bengal,Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

The new berths are expectedto cost between $150m and $180m, and will be tendered for on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis for 20 years.The tenders will have a technical bid and a financial bid. Thetechnical bids will include 'concept plans' as spelled out in the biddocuments. The financial bid will have to specify a one-time downpayment as a license fee, the royalty on each container handled andguarantee a minimum annual throughput of containers. If this is not metthe contract would be in default. Only if the technical bids areaccepted will the financial bids be opened. After 20 years the twocontainer berths and ancillary facilities will revert back to the JNPTat a depreciated value defined in the tender document.The qualifying criteria for bids are as follows:- companies must have over three year's experience of operating andmanaging marine container terminals with an annual throughput of500,000 TEU or more, using state-of-the-art equipment. Averageproductivity of quayside cranes over three years of continuous actualoperations must be over 20 moves per hour;- the average annual turnover of the bidders over the past three yearsshould be over $100m and paid-up capital of the company registered bythe bidders should be over $33m;- the bidders should have adequate experience in the marketing anddevelopment of international seaborne trade and sufficient expertiseavailable for efficient operation of a port-related container freightstation;- the bidders need not have an Indian partner but the party finallyselected will have to be registered in India.The tenders are to be submitted by April 19, 1996, and will be awardedby the end of 1996.

The two new berths are expected tohave a throughput of 470,000 TEU in the sixth year of operation. In thelast fiscal year (1994-95) the three existing container terminals ofthe JNPT handled 240,000 TEU which is expected to go up to 400,000 TEUby 1996-97. The berths should take third generation container ships of12m draft. The minimum equipment required will be four cranes forberths, each costing around $30m to $32m and capable of 70,000 to80,000 moves a year, 10 cranes in the yard, and two cranes in therailway yard. Similarly successful bidders must have operated quaysidecranes for three years with an average productivity of not less than 20moves an hour, whilst the present highest crane productivity at JNPThas been 12.2 moves an hour.At present the turnaround time for container ships at JNPT is under 48hours and containers lie in their yards for an average of one week. Theoperating efficiency of the new container berths will have to beconsiderably higher if they are to meet the throughput requirements ofJNPT.Earlier plans for privatising the existing three container berths metwith political opposition and were dropped by the surface transportministry which is responsible for ports in the country.Shukla says that the environmental clearance for five berths at a newchemical terminal is expected to be passed within a couple of months.Tenders for building the chemical berths and supporting facilities on aBOT basis will follow soon after. When approved, this new terminal,south of the existing bulk terminal at JNPT will boost the port'scapacity considerably. Shukla expects the chemical terminal to behandling around 18m tonnes of bulk chemicals in another decade, makingit the largest in the country.

The contract has upset China NationalOverseas Engineering Corporation, a company owned by the Chineseministry of foreign trade and co-operation, which submitted the lowestbid for the project at a bid price of Rs1.134bn ($33.1m).Moreover, of the nine bids submitted to the National Highways Authority(NHA), Astaldi's bid was the only one submitted after the deadline ofAugust 30, 1995. Referring to the late submission of the bid by theItalian company, the consultants, Denmark's COWI Consult declared that,'Astaldi's bid was brought to the meeting room (at the NHA head office)at 11.20 am ... all bidders were asked whether they would accept thebid from Astaldi. As none of the bidders had any objections, the bidwas accepted as being received in due time'. Industry sources say thisstatement appears to be an attempt to obfuscate the real issue, sinceit was not the other bidders' responsibility, but NHA's, to reject thebid because it had been submitted late.'The "Instructions to Bidders" in this regard were unequivocal and veryclear. But not only was Astaldi's bid opened along with those of theeight other bidders, NHA has now decided to award the contract to theItalian company, and that too, at a price that is a staggering Rs366m($10.7m) more than the price quoted by China National OverseasEngineering,' it added.Industry sources say that this suggests that Astaldi must have somevery influential political connections indeed in Islamabad. They saythis perception gains further credence when the NHA comes up withflimsy excuses to sideline China National's bid. NHA claimed that theChinese company did not have enough English-speaking staff and that itsbid was 'too low'.In a letter to NHA, China National said, 'we are prepared to offer anyguarantees within the realm of internationally accepted constructionnorms, and as defined in the contracts documents, to assure theNational Highways Authority of our intention to complete the project infull compliance with the tender specifications and within the timeperiod stipulated'.When the NHA invited pre-qualification applications from interestedfirms to bid for the construction of the new Sukkur Bridge earlier in1995, 35 companies applied. Of these, NHA pre-qualified only 15 to bidfor the project, which is being financed by the Manila-based AsianDevelopment Bank.Of the 15 pre-qualified companies, only nine submitted bids. They were:- China National Overseas Engineering Corporation - Rs1.134bn ($33m);- Astaldi - Rs1.501bn ($44m);- China Road and Bridge Corporation - Rs1.744bn ($51m);- S.

So thiscrossroads-of-Asia market has to be taken seriously now."Potentially one of the richest countries in the world" said the London"Financial Times" in a special review (11 July 1996).Oil and gas are the keys to future prosperity - the problem has been gettingthem to Western markets. On 27 April financing for the Caspian Pipeline (toNovorossiisk from the huge Tengiz oilfield) was at last agreed; the dollarsshould start coming in from the end of the century. These must eventuallyfuel a consumer boom in Almaty near the China border (a new central capitalmay be under construction by then). Meanwhile the building teams on the 750kmroute will create heavy demand for foodstuffs, engineering supplies and manycommercial services.On 13 May the missing rail link between Iran (leading to Turkey'sMediterranean ports) and Almaty was completed. The new Trans-Asiatic Linecarries freight via Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Meanwhile upgrading workproceeds on the recently-plugged Aktogay-Urumchi line which leads to theChinese port of Lyanyungan. Access to the old Trans-Siberian is good, andKazakhstan's part-electrified, part-dualled lines have substantial surpluscapacity. So access to this landlocked country is going to be less of aproblem.On 17 June the German subsidiary of Samsung (Korea) acquired on complicatedlease terms a 40 per cent stake in the huge copper mining/smelting facilitiesat Zhezkazkantsvetmet, pledging investment of over US$1bn over a 15-yearperiod. Production has doubled over the last twelve months, and the chaebolis expected to acquire a majority share shortly.And on 18 June Indian mega-investor Lakshmi Mittal purchased no less than 15coal mines to feed the huge integrated Karmet steel complex at Karagandawhich Ispat had earlier acquired (with debts). With the aid of steelmakingequipment from Samsung Shipbuilding & Heavy Industries Co production hasnearly tripled already this year, and this promises to be one of Asia's keybasic and structural steel sources. Nearly all output used to be kept withinthe former Soviet Union. Following the customs union agreement of 1995 withRussia, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan this trade is reviving already. But theKazakhs want more business in non-CIS Asia.So Kazakhstan really is on the move, and the dreamers are talking of abreadbasket cum basic-industries heartland in the centre of Asia. The formerSoviet Cosmodrome is thrown in - but so too are vast areas unsuitable foranything because of nuclear tests conducted in Stalin's era. Not much can bedone about these, but in the metallurgical-industry zones environmentalclean-up technology is badly needed.China looks to gain most; five per cent of imports came form here last year(against two-thirds from the CIS, mostly the Russian Federation itself). Theborder is notoriously leaky, both for foodstuffs and consumer goods.One market that enterprising local businessmen seem to have filled alreadyis in used cars. Dubai on the Persian Gulf is the centre of a thriving tradein secondhand road vehicles by enthusiastic Kazakhs who have left their Ladasbehind. But good trucks and buses are in short supply.For the latest information fax the Almaty Chamber of Trade & Industry on +73272 620594. Most trade fairs in Almaty are energy related, but aninternational consumer goods event will be held from 15-18 April next year(fax +1 703 406 8543 for details).

Today, it has set its sights on furtherdiversification. It develops and manufactures its own products, including theNSE Hydraulic Hammer.This new product consist of a dropping weight solid ram, rigid hammerhousing, pile helmet with inner cap and cushion, and two lifting cylinderswith hydraulic components.What makes this NSE product different? The company claims severalcharacteristics and benefits, including: the short time needed to changeattachments; greater impact and vertical driving capacity; automatic andmanual mode; low noise level; advanced design, and the ability to vary theenergy per blow by varying the height of fall.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996Slipform successfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996Contractors on the record-breaking Ting Kau Bridge in Hong Kong have optedto use the specially developed RMD slipform technique for a further foursupport piers, in addition to the three main pylons which the company arecurrently sliding.Formwork specialist RMD has already provided purpose-designed forms for thebridge's three central pylons and will now carry out and deliver slipformoperations for four piers ranging from 46-56m in height.RMD has developed its basic slipform system to meet the project's specificrequirements for the three main pylons, providing further decks and aframework to lift and support internal soffits. The adaptations also offeradditional storage space with an extra platform added as required.The main advantage of RMD equipment is that the heavy duty slipforms producegreater rigidity leading to more improved accuracy than with conventionalsystems. The system also offers tolerances within BS5606, and yet stillallows more weight to be carried with the added attraction of extra storagespace.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996Pavseel specifiedfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996A major new development currently being undertaken for the Port of Singaporeincludes extending the container storage area by some 14,000 sq.m. Concreteblock pavers which match existing areas were chosen for the new facilities.ACM Pavseel was specified for sealing the new installation as well as forstabilising the existing areas. To date, over 20,000m have been treated witha further 5,000m of block paving soon to be laid.The importance of jointing sand stabilisation has gained wide acceptanceamongst experienced paving specifiers in recent years and ACM Pavseel isacknowledged as a proven system for this purpose.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996Trenchless technologyfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996Tracto-Technik steerable boring systems have been put to good use in Taiwan,where contractors have been installing gas pipes. In the city of Shin-Chu atotal of 913m of gas HD-PE pipe had to be installed. The contractor decidedto invested in a Grundodrill after initial theoretical training of the newoperators - the first bores were done in March this year.A total of 20 working days had been allotted for the installation of thepipes, but due to the skills of the new operators - who had never worked withTracto-Technik equipment before - the time required was reduced to less than12 days.Using the Grundodrill percussive hammer, up to 1,000 strokes per minute canbe applied onto the drill stems so that steering the bore head even in stonysoils is possible, whether other fluid-assisted boring systems without hammerwould fail.Compact and powerful, Magnum Diamond's .38 special pavement saw can be usedfor joint widening, highway patching and repairing and other tasks. The useof high quality components in the manufacturing of this well-balanced unitmakes it durable and dependable. The unibody frame, jig-welded reinforcedsteel plate, has rolled edges and heavy gauge steel cowling for addedstrength.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996Civil instrumentation and systemsfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996Construction of the Estan Dam in China was facilitated by the use ofequipment and services from drilling-parameter recording specialists Jean LutzSA of Jurancon (France).For over ten years this company has been developing and manufacturinginstrumentation for measurement and recording of problems encountered duringdrilling, injection, pile construction, tunnelling and specialised work onfoundations. All necessary sensors and software are supplied to clientengineers as part of a package deal.This company's equipment is intended for use under extreme environmentalconditions, by non-specialised operatives. Training courses are available ondemand, and an in-house data processing service can be used if required.As an example the CL88/EPF Drilling and Injection Parameter Recorder featuressimultaneous graphical and digital recording, the former by means of ahigh-definition printer which incorporates headings, scales and ad hocobservations by operators. The CL88 measures and records from one-tenparameters, such as depth, instantaneous drilling rate and time,thrust/restraint/water pressures, vibration by reflected percussion wave,water/mud/air flow rates, mast inclination etc. Data resulting is stored onMEMOBLOC and downloaded into a PC using the supplier's EXEPF software.Instruments such as these have become key tools of foundation constructionspecialists worldwide. Their principal areas of application are in soilinvestigation, preparation of deep foundations by flight auger piling andother processes; and jet grouting. These measuring/recording devicesfrequently form part of an automatic control process, as in subterraneanpouring of concrete and mast positioning.Developments in micro-electronics mean that the associated software becomesmore and more a vital part of the package - for a new site a new tailor-madeprogram is simply slotted in.The CL88's multi- and compound parameter ability means that programming onsite is possible through the use of scrolling menus, and instantaneousproduction of graphs and associated documentation is of great benefit to theresident engineer. In certain cases the multiple recordings of conditionsimmediately ahead of a tunnelling machine (for example) are produced withsimultaneous interpretations available in the field.Related equipment includes the JTC (recording jet grouting parameters), theLGH Lugeon tester, and the VIB vibration parameter recorder - all prefixedCL88 in the Lutz product line-up. Also available are the Taracord CEcontinuous flight auger piling recorder, TRANSCARD tunnelling recorder,MICROPAC automatic controls for mixing plants, and the VOPI and PVCIMENTsystems for measuring grouting conditions.The company's PPF4 deviated control panel presents at one point all necessarydata for the accurate use of a drilling machine.By means of Jean Lutz equipment solutions can be found to problemsencountered during drilling, injection, piling and other foundationoperations - all by means of automated measurement and control.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996CRANES: Lift off for new erafrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996The takeover by a Malaysian group of an Australian crane builder points toa new engineering industry for Southeast Asia. Asian Review projects the wayforward.Just as Asia - especially China - has become the centre of gravity of theworld cement market, so Hong Kong and Singapore have become the hub of thecrane business. For years more cranes of most types have been changing handshere than anywhere else. Now with the formation of Favelle Favco Cranes(Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (a subsidiary of Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd, establishedby purchase from an Australian principal in 1995) the region is well on itsway to founding its own crane-building industry. FFC is currently advertisingin the world's specialised heavy-lift press, offering a range of tower,wharfside and dedicated offshore equipment.Previous attempts to establish a crane building industry locally have focusedon licensing arrangements, such as Grove's with Daewoo and Gru Comedil's withGuangdong Comedil Construction Machinery.So an exciting new era has opened. How long will it be before Asia-builtlifting equipment is heading west (and to Japan) - reversing the directionof a vigorous trade that has been established over the last 40 years? Alreadya considerable amount of high-specification structural steelwork, used forlattice booms and towers, is incorporated in western fabrications. And othercomponents are sourced locally too; most of the world's key crane buildershaving representative offices at least in one of the two cities.A key strength of this embryo industry is the sheer number of agents and usedequipment suppliers, such as Continental Equipment (Hong Kong) and Lynne Hunt(Singapore), who have built up a formidable expertise in the field. This nowrivals the globally-active used crane supply business once dominated byEuropean groups like HOVAGO (Netherlands). The used-plant market is still thecore of the multi-million dollar local trade.Asian Review predicts that the way the industry is likely to develop is byrenovation and re-manufacturing of tower cranes. Mobile crane technology isstill too sophisticated, with too many of the patents jealously held byforeign builders. Dockside portal cranes offer good potential, but the marketis too small and well supplied for local competition to start upsuccessfully. But with so many mega projects like Chek Lap Kok airport takingshape the demand for these versatile lifters has never been stronger. Andwith a re-manufactured unit costing perhaps half the capital outlay of newequipment - fully updated and with a brand new serial number (and warranty)attached - concentrating on this segment of the market makes a lot of sense.Locally rebuilt cranes are already widely available, both from manufacturers'agents (though not all western crane builders support this activity), andfrom independent suppliers. Typically these have all wearing components likebearings and motors replaced with reconditioned parts, usually sourced in theoriginal factory. Standard items like cables are replaced with new. Often thecab is updated with a contemporary range of electronic controls, and theunit's lifting capacity may be upgraded while still remaining within strictlocal rules too. But the basic structure remains unchanged, and the originalserial number applies. An advantage of this sector of the industry is thatlocal suppliers know their customers' needs very well, and can thus customisethe crane for the precise conditions in which it will be expected to operate.This is particularly important for offshore operators. Crane rebuilding isalready a well-established local industry, as is the much simpler repair workundertaken by most distributors.The attitude of original suppliers to crane re-manufacturing varies widely;some support it, with their own specialised facilities such as those ownedby Manitowoc in Arkansas. Others, particularly the Japanese builders, areless keen, and very few mobile manufacturers want to get involved at all. Butfor local engineering firms the market for re-manufacturing of tower cranesappears to be wide open, as long as necessary principals' support isobtained.Suitable units have to be very thoroughly inspected so that there are nonasty surprises when the equipment is taken (literally) to pieces. Boomdamage in particular has to be precisely assessed and rectified. Allstructural steelwork has to be sandblasted back to bare metal, all welds andother fixings examined carefully, and the unit must be finished according tothe original specifications. All working components have to be replaced withnew in order to obtain a new product designation. A brand-new cab and controlsystem is normally installed. Obviously it would be impossible to undertakethese tasks without the full co-operation of the original manufacturer. Then,before the crane can be licensed for local use it has to be inspected bylocal officials, with all necessary documentation presented. Rules varywidely within Southeast Asia, so the ultimate destination has to be knownfrom the outset of the operation.The re-manufacturing of very heavy lifters - the sort of cranes used to shipin turbine and process-plant equipment, for example - seems to be a goodstarting point for this proto-industry. These cranes command premium hirerates, and are often completely unavailable. Being so large they arerelatively easy to both inspect and work on. Many widely-available componentscommon to smaller cranes are incorporated. And there seems no end to thegrowth of demand for their services.The next stage in the development of the local crane industry must beindigenous R&D. Several local fabricators already specialise insingle-purpose add-ons, usually oriented to the needs of oil and gasproducers. These are tailored uniquely to the requirements of individuallocal users. But there is no reason why markets further afield should not betackled too. All the requirements of steel geometry fabrication are availablelocally, so building these to locally-developed designs is the obvious nextstep. And modular components like motors and winding drums can be purchasedoff the shelf. So there is little reason why Southeast Asia's own range oftower cranes should not be seen on worldwide construction site skylines earlyin the next century.If the frenetic pace of local demand development allows room for suchexports, that is.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996CRANES: Potain's new Topkit tower cranes in Puchonfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996Two of Potain's recently introduced MC625, Topkit tower cranes have beendelivered to a massive apartment block construction site at Puchon City, 40kmwest of Seoul.

The design and construction concepts behindthis model, say the manufacturer, are clear responses to the many criteriademanded by crawler crane users, incorporating many innovative ideas andimproved qualities.Increased output and efficiency, excellent stability combined with lowoperating weight, durability and strong construction, high operating safety,low maintenance costs and extreme versatility are just some of the manyfeatures of Liebherr's technologically advanced hydraulic crawler crane.The HS843 HD is a 60t class machine and supersedes the HS842 HD. In comparingthe two cranes, the new product has 30 per cent more engine power, with nochange in operating weight. There is a corresponding 27 per cent increase inthe hydraulics performance too.Link-Belt Construction Equipment Company has introduced its new 150t LS-238Hcrawler crane. This all-hydraulic lattice boom model offers contractors liftcapacities equal to the older Link-Belt LS-518, with fast non-assistedstripdown and lightweight modular components that are easy to transport.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996CRANES: A different classfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996With the AC 75 City Class, Mannesman Demag presents a new two-axle telescopiccrane which they claim combines manoeuvrability, compactness, outstandingperformance and functional design.The overall length of the carrier is only 6.68m, and clearance height isbelow 3m. The boom sits next to and slightly below the cab in travelling modeto give optimal driver visibility.According to market studies carried out by the manufacturer, transit time toa job site can take up much of a crane's daily operation time. With its fullyautomatic transmission, fuel efficiency is maximised at any speed.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN ASIA: Doing business by the bayfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996When Wong Wen Chi flew into the Philippines to work for telecommunicationsgiant Thomson Consumer Electronics at the burgeoning Subic Bay Freeport, hewas destined to find both business and pleasure.The Subic Bay Industrial hub, where Thomson relocated 15 per cent of itsworld-wide telephone manufacturing operations in 1994, has emerged as one ofthe Philippines' leading manufacturing centres as well as a recreationalparadise."It's very convenient here," said the 50-year-old Wong, who oversees theproduction of 250,000 telephone sets every month at a plant in the freeport,located in Subic town, Zambales, about 90km northwest of Manila. Outside ofwork, he sweats it out on a tennis court, learns golf or makes use of one ofthe many sports and amusement facilities inside the 14,600-hectare industrialarea.Wong's company, attracted by the freeport's infrastructure, availability ofEnglish-speaking production staff and air and sea cargo links to majorcapitals, is planning to expand business by transferring its entire telephonemanufacturing operations, now spread across Asia, to Subic.The transformation of the former U.S. naval base is phenomenal. Just fiveyears ago, it was partially buried under tons of volcanic ash along withlarge areas of the main Luzon island after Mt.Pinatubo erupted. A year afterthe eruption, the United States withdrew from the facility.The Philippine government salvaged US$8bn worth of infrastructure left by theAmericans from under tons of volcanic ash and started transforming the placeinto a boom town, envisioning another Hong Kong.Today, the government agency in charge of the freeport, the Subic BayMetropolitan Authority (SBMA), has convinced 209 companies, mostly fromneighbouring Taiwan, to move in with about US$1.49bn worth of investments.Some 137 of the firms, including Thomson, are already in operation,manufacturing products that include computer motherboards, neck ties, Reebokrubber shoes, armoured cars and small boats. The rest are preparing forbusiness.The man at the centre of Subic's phenomenal rise from the ashes is RichardGordon, a charismatic but controversial politician, who heads the SBMA. "Wehave survived Mt. Pinatubo's eruption. We have survived the closure of theAmerican base - and we have made the situation better," said Gordon, a formermayor of Olongapo town next to Subic. Gordon's effort, backed by a batteryof young, Western-educated executives is paying off, but it's not all plainsailing. Unable to rely on a national government too preoccupied withrehabilitating a country from decades of political and economic stagnation,Gordon set out on his own, travelling around the globe to reach outpersonally to potential investors.He privatised most of the freeport's utilities as a guarantee against theunstable supply of power, water and other basic services that had driven awayinvestors elsewhere in the country.Among Subic's utilities are a power supply of 60MW, water supply of 12mgallons per day, a base telephone system with 7,000 (expandable to 13,000)lines, and tank storage for 2.4m barrels of petroleum products.Last year, the U.S.-based cargo carrier Federal Express made Subic the Asianbase of its world-wide delivery system after its 2,744-metre-long runway waslengthened and widened to accommodate large aircraft. Fedex's entry alsoboosted the freeport's potential as a manufacturing centre.Subic was also chosen as the venue for the Apec Summit, a crowning glory forGordon, who is widely believed to harbour presidential ambitions.Two years ago, the World Bank approved a US$40m loan to upgradeinfrastructure including a US$12m airport passenger terminal. Some goodfortune, coupled with incentives like a five per cent profits tax, duty-freeimports, full repatriation of capital and profits and land lease of up to 75years, have lured big-league investors like Taiwan's Acer Computer and theAmerican-owned Coastal Petroleum, a distributor of petroleum products inAsia.Officials are also concentrating on developing Subic's potential as a primetourist destination. More than US$279m worth of construction projects -including a hotel, condominiums, conference facilities, golf courses, marina,and casinos are planned.Subic is one of 18 industrial zones the Philippines is developing in its bidto bounce back as one of Asia's economic tigers after decades of politicaland economic stagnation.The industrial zones were set up under the economic reforms unleashed byPresident Fidel Ramos in an effort to liberalise practically all sectors ofbusiness. The the government hopes they will act as investment magnets acrossthe Philippines.About 50km north-west of Subic, another former U.S. military base is alsorising from the ashes of Mt. Pinatubo volcano. The Clark Special EconomicZone, a 33,000-hectare former U.S. air force base is being transformed by theManila government into the Philippines' main gateway wit the building of aninternational airport complex that will replace Manila's congested NinoyAquino International Airport. Officials plan to construct another runway in1998 in addition to two 3.2km-long runways at the airfield.The Clark Development Corporation (CDC), the state agency overseeingdevelopment in the former air force base, is planning to turn largewarehouses, stockyards, depots and residential units into factories thatwould operate as an economic zone similar to Subic. Unlike Subic, however,only a few big-name investors have moved to Clark.Romeo David, chairman of the CDC, said a total of 71 foreign and localcompanies have set up business and 78 others have committed to move intoClark in the next five years, together bringing 18.9bn pesos (US$600m) ofinvestment. Among the top investors Clark has attracted are Japan's Yokohama,one of the world's largest tyre manufacturers; Sampo Technology Corporation,a leading Taiwanese electronics firm; and Mondragon Leisure and Resorts, alocal apparel distributor and resort developer.Clark officials are trying to improve utilities and to fast-trackconstruction of tourist areas comprising hotels, sports complexes and a27-hole golf course to lure investors.The existing utilities at Clark include a telephony system for 5,000 linesthat is expandable to 50,000 lines, a road network of 3,000km, a power supplyof 50 MW, and a water supply of 5,000 gallons per minute. Two domesticchartered flights ply routes from provinces in central and westernPhilippines to the area almost daily.A problem Clark - and to a limited extent Subic - is encountering when itcomes to attracting investors is a fear of further eruptions by Mt. Pinatubo.Five years after the volcano wrought havoc on a region that used to be knownas the country's rice bowl, huge volcanic mud flows, driven by seasonalrains, continue to periodically sever road links to Manila around Clark andSubic.When roads are totally cut-off as happened a year ago, detours lengthen athree-hour drive from Manila to Subic to at least eight hours, atransportation nightmare few investors would want to deal with. Althoughgovernment volcanologists predict that Pinatubo's fury is over and that itssmall ash emissions are too weak to reach either Clark or Subic, manyinvestors remain apprehensive.Such a problem gives an edge to economic zones near the business districtsof Manila, such as the one comprising a belt of provinces called Calabarzon(for Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) south of the capital. MajorJapanese companies prefer Calabarzon's various industrial parks over Clarkand Subic.Edgy businessmen concerned about the effects of Subic and Clark's success ontheir profitability have also become a problem. Earlier this year, thegovernment scrapped a US$200 shopping privilege given to patrons of duty-freeshops in both Clark and Subic after local manufacturers complained thatimported products sold in the duty free shops cut their profits and deprivedthe government of revenues.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996INNOVATIONS: A vital linkfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996Lindapter International recently showed its full range of fixing systems atthe Offshore Southeast Asia show in Singapore.Designed to offer significant reductions in installation time and costs, theLindapter range includes steelwork fixings, support fixings, steel cavityfixings, floor fixings and rail fixings.Lindapter steelwork fixings facilitate connection of structural steelworkwithout the need for on-site drilling or welding.

This makes the product particularly suitablefor a wide range of non-food industries.Unlike many other inverted machines which make fixed length packs, theAstra's random length control option allows the machine to automaticallyadjust film cut-off lengths from one item to the next, according to the exactlength of the product.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996INNOVATIONS: Steel trialsfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996British Steel have completed a series of piling trials and demonstrationsover a five day period in the Bangkok Basin area. Key specifiers and endusers were invited to witness first-hand the benefits of switching from thestandard 400mm wide sheetpiles in common use in Asia to British Steel'sstronger and wider LX product.The trials took the form of a direct comparison between the 400mm and 600mmsections during repeated driving/extraction cycles. All the sample piles weremeasured for pile distortion including twisting, leg splaying, head/toe andclutch damage.According to British Steel, the results demonstrated that LX piles could bedriven faster than their narrower counterparts. With smaller capacity hammersthe extra weight and stiffness of the LX piles proved to be of advantage andpermitted accelerated driving times.British Steel are producers of steel sheet piling with a comprehensive rangeof sections and sizes.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996INNOVATIONS: Adaptable treatmentfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996Manufacturers, municipal councils, mining companies and primary producers areconstantly seeking better ways to control the quality of wastewater orrecycled water as well as the possible reuse of purified water. This not onlyrelates to changing government regulations but also because in many instancesthe efficient retrieval of valuable by-products from production is a veryimportant cost benefit factor. One way to achieve financial advantage is theelimination of downtime in the removal of waste solids.Syskill Australia Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based company with 14 years experiencein consulting and commissioning wastewater systems, has developed two systempackages which can be adapted to a range of industrial applications and canprovide any level of treatment (primary, secondary or tertiary). Selectionand development of the correct system for your particular process can ensurecost efficiencies.By cutting down on the solid waste volumes, including the thickening ofmunicipal and industrial sludges, the high cost of removal is greatly reducedand therefore the transfer of solid waste into the sewerage system can beeliminated.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996INNOVATIONS: Tracking systemfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996Reading numbered containers and drums to try and track and monitor goods hasposed huge logistical and manpower problems, but a new product fromrecognition specialists, Cambridge Neurodynamics, is set to transform thetransport, storage and processing industries.The new system - the Container Tracking & Identification System (CTIS) - is,claim the makers, the most accurate and reliable yet developed.

The companymanufactures a range of light rod and bar sections from purchased billet.As a result the main mill motors have for the last three years reliably usedCT's "Mentor" drives which are rated at 1850A (DC)/600V. More than onethousand of these have been installed in Thailand alone, so it was decidedto build Anshin's control panels in the Ladyao manufacturing Centre nearBangkok.Localised control boxes enable the operator to Run/Jog Reverse/Stop thestands and lock off the power if the stands themselves need attention. Themill cannot be started from the main pulpit, but cascaded speed control iscarried out from this position.Menus for the varied products to be rolled are stored in a PC in the pulpit.When a product is selected for rolling data concerning the dimensions of thebillet and the mean diameter of each roll is downloaded to a PLC. Control isbased on the principle of constant volume rolling and cascaded speed controlwhereby the speed of each stand is related to the master finishing stand.Calculations concerning motor speed for each drive are made continuously inthe PLC and sent to the second processor in the "Mentor" drives as 12-bitparallel words. All stand speeds are simultaneously updated to avoidtension/compression during changes of speed.When the velocity of any section is adjusted the PLC calculated the new speedof all upstream drives and updates them. Individual speed trims for thedrives are available to the operators from stations mounted near the millstands. The speed of the master stand is set using a preset potentiometer.Anshin's two roughing mills use 1,000hp AC constant-speed motors. The relatedconveyor systems use DC motors and "Mentor" controllers. These are controlledby joysticks and have to accelerate rapidly to guarantee entry of bars intothe roughers. Other related DC drives run at the speed of the bar.On exit the disc shear cuts the bar to preset lengths - multiples of the cutlength at the cold shear and accommodatable within the cooling bed. Speed andpositioning of the exiting bar is determined by measuring the time elapsedbetween passing two detectors.With this information the bar can be cut precisely. The disc shear is drivenby three DC drives, one for each blade and one to orientate the shearmechanism. The run-in conveyor to the cooling bed is driven by 32 DC motorsconnected in parallel across the controller.Five 35hp DC motors located along the kick-off shaft drive this, beingcontrolled by the same number of four-quadrant "Mentors" which load-share.If necessary the shaft can operate on only three drives. Braking isregenerative, with the unit operating as a holding brake only.The 80m cooling bed operates similarly, being driven by five 50hp motorscontrolled by similar "Mentors" for accurate slowing and stopping.Shuffle bars driven by 15hp motors, this time controlled by single-quadrant"Mentors", carry the bars to the run-out conveyor. This uses three 30hpdrives which are operated manually from the cold shear desk. Three moreconveyor drives carry the cut bars to the packing line. This is driven byfour CT inverter drives and controlled by an Omron PLC. The packing lineitself was built in Malaysia.In total there are 45 "Mentor" drives and six inverters controlling over onehundred individual motors in this Malaysian finishing mill.Control Techniques Asia Pacific have subsequently installed rod mill standsat four steel plants in Thailand. The mill control system at Albion Steel,the most recent, differs significantly from earlier projects. Theincorporated PC is much more powerful, enabling the whole mill to operateusing a SCADA Windows package. And the use of a beefier MD29 processor cardenables many tasks to be undertaken within the drive itself.Current control strategy is to use the PC for product menus and on-linemonitoring, the processor card for closed-loop functions, and the PLC forsequence control. This means a simpler and more user-friendly PLC can beused.Control Techniques' steel activities are not confined to hot rolling. Thecompany has supplied control panels and motors for slitting and roll formingmachines in both of the countries cited, and has installed cold rolling millsin India, Indonesia and Thailand.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE: A flexible systemfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996Computer systems providing internal electronic communication facilities haveled to increased productivity and an evolution in working practices for amajor Japanese company.Nippon Steel Corporation, the largest steel company in the world, is like anyother company constantly seeking ways to increase efficiency and cut costs.At its biggest facility, the Kimitsu Works in Chiba Prefecture, output hasincreased over the last 10 years while the total number of employees hassteadily declined. The size of the white-collar workforce, however, hasremained constant at around 1,400, indicating that management andadministrative processes have changed very little despite increases inmanufacturing efficiency.Information technologies and process automation have played an integral rolein production processes at the Kimitsu Works since it opened in 1967. Today,for instance, process control systems operate in blast furnaces and rollingmills, while video systems record the performance of individual sites andtransmit images electronically to a production control centre. Officesystems, however, have lagged behind, with administrative processes changingvery little. Until recently, white-collar workers relied on inter-officememos, telephones and fax machines for business communication and informationsharing.In the early 1990s plant managers decided to boost white-collar productivityand reduce labour costs by improving business communications and informationsharing within the organisation. They decided to invest in informationsystems which would allow them to 're-engineer' essential business processes.As a consequence, they expected to reduce the white-collar workforce byaround 400 once the systems were fully implemented. Key to their success waschoosing a workgroup computing system that could be easily adapted to boththe corporate culture and the network infrastructure.In 1994 the company's Computer Systems Department conducted a six-month studyto define the requirements for a system that would best suit the KimitsuWorks. It sought a flexible client-server system that would allow stafflocated in many different parts of the plant to communicate and shareinformation electronically. It also sought a system that would build on thecompany's existing technology and could be expanded incrementally as the needarose. Key requirements included the ability to run on both MS-DOS andWindows PCs, as well as compatibility with connections such as LANs, PBXs andpublic switched telephone networks.The department looked at a number of workgroup computing products availablein Japan, including Lotus Notes and MS Mail, before settling on TeamWAREOffice. Fujitsu Limited had adapted the base product to the Japanese marketand also provided the required dedicated support services.Operation began in January 1995 with a single server configuration supportingmore than 1,000 users. The initial focus was on two essential aspects ofworkgroup communications, e-mail and group information sharing, and for theseTeamWARE Mail and Forum software were installed. The total cost for theserver hardware, software and installation support was US$680,000.Within a few weeks of installation, the system was being widely used bystaff. Users had little trouble learning how to operate the software, andsoon began to use both products in their everyday jobs. More than 1,000 usersat all levels of the corporation are logged onto the system.People communicate and share information electronically, which has done awaywith much of the need for telephone calls, fax messages and inter-officeletter mail. E-mail has spread to all areas of the plant, including the ColdMill and General Affairs Divisions, as well as the Production and TechnicalControl Division.E-mail has speeded up the flow of information through the organisation. Memosand written requests that used to take two or three days to travel from onedepartment to another are now delivered within seconds. For example, seniorexecutives can have the minutes of executive meetings distributed throughoutthe plant as soon as they are written, so that line managers receive almostinstant notification of important decisions. Moreover, executives and seniormanagers can communicate decisions more effectively . They are beginning tocommunicate directly with staff, which is leading to changes in the patternsof office work and the delegation of responsibilities.TeamWARE Forum promotes on-line discussions and information sharing, andprovides a collection point for opinions on any given topic. Users haveadapted quickly to the process of discussing issues on-line, posting topicsand responses in the same way they would e-mail. More than half theindividual forums are requests for new ideas; for example, a group mightdiscuss approaches to improving a production process in the rolling mill byposting comments and replies. Then, when a manager needs to preparerecommendations and conclusions, he simply reviews the comments made bymembers of the group when writing his report. Similarly, when differentpeople need to contribute to a report, each person posts their sections inthe designated forum for the others to review.Electronic communications have also had a democratising effect at the KimitsuWorks. White-collar workers at many different levels of the organisation canparticipate in on-line discussions and directly receive electronicinformation from senior managers. This serves as an initial step towardsbreaking down communications barriers. Younger workers in particular beginto feel that they are more directly involved in the company's activities andhave a better idea about what they are expected to do. They can receivedirect copies of management memos and production reports, rather than havingthe information selected and interpreted by their superiors.The next stage for the Computer Systems Department is to extend groupwarecapabilities by introducing TeamWARE Library and TeamWARE Flow, the system'sdocument management and workflow modules. Moving to an electronic archivepromises a number of benefits.Workers will be able to find and share each others documents. They will beable to search through large collections of documents in many different ways- by titles, keywords or full-text words and phrases. They will also be ableto maintain a work history of specific projects, collating minutes, memorandaand project reports, so that activities can be better co-ordinated. Tomaintain security for sensitive documents, user access can be managed and arecord kept of each access to a document and any changes made.TeamWARE Flow will enable the passing of information from one person toanother or from one group to another in a structured manner, reducing theneed to produce reports for general distribution. Initially, the departmentplans to use the system for simple processes, such as exchanging requestsbetween departments internally, but once an electronic gateway to thecompany's Tokyo head office is established, it expects to be able tocommunicate with workgroups at the corporate level.The TeamWARE electronic communications and information sharing systems haveproved a sound investment for Nippon Steel, allowing it to introduceorganisational changes at the Kimitsu Works and support new kinds of workactivities as users become accustomed to working with a networked on-lineelectronic environment.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996RUSSIA/CIS: Heavy engineering for Asian marketsfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996Two case studies reveal that Russian engineering is rebuilding fast. And thenumber of trade fairs taking place throughout the CIS shows that this is asource, and market, to be taken seriously.Intriguing accounts of life in the new era for the heavy engineeringindustries of the CIS have been appearing this year in the Moscow monthly"Business in Russia"*. This is the sector that is supposed to be badlyaffected by the continuing decline in industrial output. But some bigexporters are making good already.First, worldscale truck maker Kamaz. Located in the autonomous republic ofTatarstan on the steppes east of Nizhny Novgorod the ex-Soviet Union'snumber-one truck plant entered production in 1978; a major fire subsequentlyentailed major updating. Total output could be a massive 1.5m vehicles/year.Kamaz trucks have a huge trading advantage in the new CIS - their spares andservice requirements are known everywhere. And they are designed for thetoughest road conditions imaginable,which is why non-CIS Asia is beingtargetted as a key export sales zone now.Kamaz was one of the first giant enterprises to be privatised, in 1990. Stillloss making, it receives no state support whatsoever. One of its biggestproblems is outstanding debt - to government agencies, amongst others. Tosolve this it has set up a new mega-business partnership calledKamaz-Sodruzhestvo Association with Gazprom,Russia's biggest company, LUKoiland other major users, guaranteeing annual sales of 30,000 heavy vehicles andinvolving substantial much-welcomed swapping of the debts that plague thesehuge (mostly energy) businesses too. The two governments are associatemembers, which means yet more "in house" sales.So the domestic market looks very good. But to keep the massive multi-linefactory running more exports are vital - and if those are to take placeKamaz's traditional reputation for go-anywhereability has got to besupplemented with environmental-friendliness too. So last year the companyconcluded agrrements with nearly 60 Japanese and European machine-buildersto supply the plant needed to build prime movers that meet the latestenvironmental standards worldwide. These come on top of the earlier deal withCummins Engine Co (USA) to build a brand-new power unit.Rockwell (USA) are supplying power trains; ZF (Germany) gearboxes; and DAF(Netherlands) the technology to build new-style cab units. And the company'sclose links with Gazprom, the world's largest supplier of natural gas, meanit is now able to offer a dual-fuel (diesel/liquefied natural gas) power unitwhich will be a trend-setter everywhere oil is becoming too costly toextract. And in association with automobile manufacturer VAZ production ofover 100,000 passenger cars is planned too.Kamaz's new Mustang fourwheel-drive truck series put up a good showing in theParis-Beijing Rally recently - this vehicle is aimed at defence ministrypurchasers worldwide. The new 43118 high-capacity 4WD truck was built to thespecifications of the Emergency Situations Ministry - and in Russia"emergency" means just that. And the new 6520 dumper aimed at the energyindustries is designed to take on the best that the world's mining-truckproducers offer anywhere.Nearly 20 joint ventures and representative trade offices now supply Kamaztrucks and spares to 22 countries, including several in East Asia. As aresult export revenue nearly doubled year-on-year in 1995.Financially the company has been reorganised with the aid of US investmentspecialists KKR. Divestment took place and operations became more targettedas a result; the leasing field has been entered to secure more sales at home.Kamaz director Nikolay Bekh concluded his "Business in Russia" interview bysaying "I am convinced that our best days lie ahead".Not converted to conversionTo the east in the Urals metallurgy region - one which has been experiencingvery lean times industrially - Uralvagonzavod (UVZ) presents anotherengineering success story. But this company has not been privatised - it istechnically known as a state production association. It used to be the Eastbloc's main producer of battle tanks. It still is, although the bloc as suchno longer exists. UVZ is a classic representitive of the "military-industrialcomplex" for which Russian heavy engineering is famed, and used to be feared.UVZ ought to be a classic case of "conversion" - swords into ploughshares,-but isn't. Alongside its main function of building heavy weaponry it providedthe former Soviet Union with railcars (hence the name). But instead ofconcentrating on these peaceful pursuits UVZ has kept its highly-skilleddesign and production workforce together at Nizhny Tagil by continuing todevelop heavily armoured T-C series tanks - and selling them to governmentsworldwide in competition with established US, European and Chinese suppliers.It sells via the state armaments supplier Rosvooruzhenie. But it hasdiversified into construction equipment with a military flavour - tracked andwheeled excavators, bulldozers and front-end loaders. And it remains thepremier rail wagon builder in the CIS too.As a state-owned business UVZ labours under a lot of difficulties which Kamazmanagers are delighted to be rid of. It is required to keep resources onstandby ready for transfer to complete military mobilisation at short notice.It is plagued by debt. And it is required to participate in the operation ofa whole raft of state-provided services - local public transport and socialhousing for example - which bleed its management and financial resourcesheavily.But UVZ is not standing still, and has rejected partial privatisation andcommercial diversification in the interests of doing what its workforce dobest at the three in-house design institutes.These are two case-studies from the sharp end of heavy engineering in the CIS- the very sharp end in the case of UVZ. They demonstrate that Russians arerefusing to de-skill their huge economy, to become a mere raw materialssupplier. Some of the world's top R&D institutions are located in the CIS;the aim is to keep these highly skilled workforces intact; and this will beachieved by recruiting managerial and financial cooperation from non-CIS,including hopefully east Asian, sources.* July and September 1996 issues; fax +7 95 238 6058 for subscription details.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996RUSSIA/CIS: Buying and selling at trade fairsfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996The organising of trade fairs is big business in the CIS. Distances are sogreat and the concept of individual international marketing is so new thatattending a specialised exhibition is by far the best way for Easternbusinesses to make new contacts - whether buying or selling.Moscow is still the centre of gravity with Mezhvystavka's EXPOCENTR inKrasnopresnenskaya Nab, now firmly established as one of the world's toptrade fair complexes -you can fax them on +7 95 205 6055 for details of1997's prolific programme. But independent rival centres are springing upfast, and in terms of sheer numbers of specialised events, in order, thefollowing cities in the Russian Federation deserve serious consideration asdestinations: St Petersburg; Novosibirsk; Nizhny Novgorod; and Ekaterinburg.Nizhny Novgorod deserves a special mention - 1996 is the 100th year of formaloperation of Nizhegorodskaya Jarmaka (fax 8312 443404), but the city has ahistory of international trade exchange dating much further back than that.A selection of 1997 events at EXPOCENTR is as follows:20-24 January  - CONSUMEXPO - consumer goods19-23 May      - SVIAZ-EXPOCOMM - telecommunications16-20 June     - INLEGMASH - light industrial equipment, especially                             textile/footwear machinery1-5 July       - Byt i Moda - consumer goods8-12 September - Stroyindustria Arkhitektura - building20-24 October  - AGROPRODMASH - agricultural equipmentReaders interested in construction should also note the independentorganisation of MOSBUILD at the EXPOCENTR (12-15 March, fax +33 1 47 56 0818 (Paris - this is an off-shoot of the long-established French BATIMATshow).And at the VVC Fairground in Moscow ITE (UK - fax +44 171 286 0177) will beorganising the first Russian International Machine Tool & MetalworkingExhibition from 9-12 June.Around the independent republics there is nothing like so much choice - forKazakhstan see the special Central Asia Digest at the front of this issue.Moldova has its own international exhibition centre known as MOLDEXPO inChisinau (Kishinev; fax +373 2 62 74 20) with a diverse programme for 1997.This includes EXPOCONS (consumer goods; 9-13 April); TEXTILES (wares andequipment; 9-13 April); MOLDCONSTRUCT (11-16 June; construction equipment andmaterials); Industry of Moldova (16-20 September; general localmanufacturing); and MOLDAGROTECH (15-20 October; agricultural and foodprocessing machinery).In Ukraine there is a big consumer goods fair taking place in Kiev from 18-22March (fax +49 30 844 0739), while Machine & Tool will be held from 29September - 3 October (fax +49 40 460 4276). And Uzbekistan's InternationalTrade Fair will be held at the end of September in Tashkent (fax +49 221695865).

It saves damage to plant, cuts wastageof products due to line stoppages, helps keep production on target and isacknowledged to save money and improve efficiency for manufacturers. Anapproved system can also mean reduced machine insurance premiums.However, it is not an area to be entered without careful forethought. Eachmachine has its own monitoring needs, there are many techniques and types ofinstrument, and a manufacturer has first to decide what is required from acondition monitoring system. It is an area where many installations have notpaid for themselves.The principle behind all checks on factory plant is to decide objectivelywhen machines should be taken out of service for maintenance. This savesproduction being disrupted and enables maintenance and repairs to be plannedfor quiet periods on the factory floor. It should lead to a more efficientmaintenance programme than one which relies on a fixed schedule.Condition monitoring provides information which is not obvious from humaninspection. Information is collected from sensors on machines and theanalysis of readings taken over a period of time predicts when measurementswill exceed a safe level. This means a regular programme of inspection.Each time measurements are taken the plant should be working under a similarload to ensure an accurate comparison with previous data. This enables trendsto be predicted. It is not possible to assess the life left in a componentfrom a single measurement unless one has analysed data from similarcomponents. For a given reading one bearing could be close to failure whileanother has a long life ahead. A key skill in condition monitoring lies incalculating the future length of life of components from a trend of previousreadings.This is where computer programmes are valuable. Software will predict trendsand display the results numerically or graphically. Data can be either feddirectly to the computer from the factory floor through a network, downloadedat the machine to a portable or hand held computer and then transferred tothe main office machine or measured by hand held equipment and the readingsmanually entered into the computer.Measuring vibrationThe most popular method of monitoring plant is to check the frequency andamplitude of vibration of rotating parts using accelerometers and acousticor magnetic sensors. These transmit data to recording equipment which can befitted permanently to factory plant. The benefit of fitted instrumentationis the warnings it can provide of unexpected events. Plant can be shut downin an orderly sequence, rather than the operator having to hit the emergencystop after hearing squealing, grinding or other expensive noises.Recording equipment ranges from low cost meters, where the operator has toenter readings on to record sheets, to microprocessor-controlled dataanalysers which store many readings and display the results as a graph on ascreen or printout. Such equipment can automatically predict when readingswill move to unsafe levels and enable planned maintenance.Vibration can be measured by laser-based equipment which measures shaftmovement without needing to touch the shaft. Machine condition can also bereflected in a rise in temperature. A temperature sensor will measure spottemperatures of bearings, seals and couplings, for example, but thermalimaging shows exactly where heat is being generated as well as thetemperature.Such thermographic surveys can pinpoint heat centres whereas engineers maybe mislead by heat being conducted along metal components. One such exampleconcerned an electric motor running hot. The abnormally high shafttemperature indicated a worn motor bearing but a thermal imager showed a hotspot in the motor's gearbox and heat being conducted along the shaft. Withoutthe thermal imager the motor would have been taken out of service for bearingreplacement and taken out again for gearbox inspection.Advanced condition monitoring listens to plant and analyses a range of soundsfor frequency and amplitude. This can be displayed as a dynamic envelope, orfingerprint, and is suitable for machinery with a complex series ofmovements. This applies to special production machines with moving arms andlevers, for example, or electrical switchgear.Condition monitoring also covers lubricating oil analysis, pressure and flowof coolants, pressure and operation of hydraulic and pneumatic systems. Adrop in performance in any of these areas can lead to early machine failure.A worn bearing or one about to collapse presents less resistance to flow oflubricant so system pressure will drop as flow increases and acceleratebearing failure. If plant is water or air cooled then failure of thesesystems can cause overheating and thinning or degradation of lubricant.Quality of insulation on high voltage equipment can be tested with partialdischarge techniques. Energy can be dissipated through insulation withoutcomplete breakdown and where this results in a corona on insulators, theradiation frequency and energy can be monitored. Condition monitoring ofinsulating oil covers dielectric strength, colour, dissolved gas, andmoisture or detritus content.Developing skillsFor those who wish to develop condition monitoring skills, Schenck offerstraining courses on dynamic balancing, vibration analysis and conditionmonitoring. The company also offers a full range of equipment. The Series 40consists of five portable instruments while the 1100 is a low costself-contained monitoring unit which attaches to a machine and provides alarmand shut-down capabilities. The Vibrocam 4000 is PC controlled and canmonitor thousands of points. The trending and analysis software on thissystem informs machine operators of potential failures.SKF, which claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of bearings, hasused its production experience to develop a condition monitoring service.This can supply equipment from pen-size hand-held instruments tocomprehensive machinery protection systems and analytical software. Itslatest instrument is the Microlog CMVA55, a portable data collector which itclaims has diagnostic capabilities never seen before in a portableinstrument. A liquid crystal screen displays readings in numerical andgraphical form.At the other end of the scale, the company's M800A system can monitorcontinuously a complete factory with data networked back to a central loggingand analysis facility. As part of its service the company has produced a 48page booklet "How to Understand and Buy Condition Monitoring Equipment".SKF's Asia Pacific office is in Singapore.Bently Nevada has some 35 years experience in machine protection and offersa comprehensive range of monitoring equipment, installation and trainingservice. It has nine offices throughout Asia.For those who wish just to use condition monitoring techniques, vibration andnoise measurement specialist Bruel and Kjaer has developed a range ofequipment which can be operated by personnel unskilled in vibration detectiontechnology. For thermal imaging equipment, Land Infrared is a majorspecialist and offers a wide range of temperature sensing equipment.National Vulcan provides a condition monitoring service for audits andfeasibility studies and engineer surveyors for site visits. Bob Gray,Technical Sales Manager, highlights the need to plan before installingcondition monitoring and points out the value of using a consultancy such asNational Vulcan to ensure that optimum results are obtained from a monitoringsystem. The company is a leader in engineering insurance and says that theinstallation of monitoring systems can reduce premiums.Eagle Star also confirms that improved risk control reduces premiums. Thecompany is hoping to develop its machinery insurance services onto the Indiansub continent and is already working in China. Its engineering divisionoffers technical support with inspections, training and consultancy as wellas machinery insurance.Condition monitoring may be like insurance - you only wish you had investedonce it is too late.

Since 1987 the company has entered into contracts to provide watertreatment plants for more than 50 municipalities. Equipment supplied includesfiltration plants, chemical dosing units, chlorinators, flocculators, pumpsand automatic control systems.Also in China, Dewplan Ltd has recently been awarded a US$3m contract for thedesign, supply and commissioning of a multiprocess water treatment works toserve the new San Miguel Brewery. The plant is designed to treat boreholewater for the removal or iron and suspended material. It will alsoincorporate pre-chlorination, de-alkanization and final polishing through GAC(Granular Activated Carbon) filters.The Japanese government has offered China a US$435m line of credit over thenext three years for water supply improvements in Liaoning and Gansuprovinces, Guang Xi and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.The UK's Overseas Development Administration (ODA) recently appointed MottMacdonald as lead consultant for the Shanghai Water Master Plan (SWAMP),aimed at assisting the Shanghai Municipal Water Company (SMWC) to respondmore effectively to the rapidly changing demand patterns of its 3,900km longdistribution system.In the Philippines, a private consortium comprising Kamaman and the ClarkDevelopment Corporation has been commissioned to construct a US$50m watersupply system to serve the Clark Special Economic Zone, formerly a US airbase, in Central Luzon. The first phase comprises repairs to existingreservoirs, the installation of eight chlorinators, the acquisition ofmaintenance and other equipment, and the rehabilitation of five wells andpumping stations together with 160,000m of distribution pipelines.Meanwhile, 2m people living in the 20 poorest provinces of the Philippinesare to benefit from an Asian Development Bank US$37m loan to provide simplelow-cost water supply facilities to around 3,000 rural communities under thegovernment's Social Reform Agenda. Scheduled for completion by August 2001,the project is designed to reduce waterborne diseases resulting fromcontaminated open wells, streams and rivers.In the same region, The US Filter Corporation recently acquired KBS PureWater Pte Ltd based in Singapore and Penang. KBS is a major supplier of watertreatment plant, including deionization equipment for the microelectronicsindustry, and has established a 3,000 cu.m facility in Singapore.Weir Pumps, in addition to supplying pumps to Hong Kong, has won a contractto equip five stations belonging to the Metropolitan Water Authority inBangkok. The units, comprising single-stage, split casing pumps driven by1200kW motors, are to be installed at Bang Khen, Klong Toey, Lat Phro,Phahonothin and Samrong.India, which suffers some of Asia's worst drinking water problems, is shortlyto benefit from a change of tack by the World Bank with the provision of thecountry's first Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) schemes. New projectsinclude a US$70m rural water supply system for Uttar Pradesh, India's largeststate. in which the Bank is keen to involve NGO's, community organisationsand private sector companies.The World Bank is also the catalyst for a private project designed to supplyAnhdra Pradesh, a southern suburb of Hyderabad, with 1,850ml/day of cleanwater.Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996EXPRESS DELIVERY: UPS moves into Taiwanfrom ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996In March 1996, after long delays, the government of Taiwan finallygranted international air express cargo company UPS (United ParcelService) the right to operate an integrated cargo facility atTaipei's Chiang Kai-Shek (CKS) International Airport. If all goeswell, the move could spur the transformation of Taiwan into aregional air cargo hub, as outlined under the government'sAsia-Pacific Regional Operations Centre (APROC) Plan.The air express delivery market has expanded rapidly in recentyears. UPS boasts the largest turnover in the global industry, andin 1995 realised a 35 per cent growth from the previous year inoverseas shipments from Taiwan. Another key player, DHL, the firstforeign air express company in Taiwan and the local market leader,enjoyed growth of 27.6 per cent in the same period.International express carriers are now posing a formidablechallenge to Taiwan's domestic air cargo companies, which arehandicapped by financial limitations and less well developedoperations. Antonio An, general manager of local express carrierLita International Express Co, claims that his firm's deliveriesfrom Taipei to Singapore have dwindled from 500kg to 100kg dailysince foreign carriers entered the market. "The route may not lastout next year," he says.The war between domestic and foreign express air cargo companiesinvolves more than competition between carriers. Also caught up inthe fray is a network of air transport service firms, forwardingagents, customs brokers and inland transportation and warehousingcompanies. The question that many in the industry are now askingis: will Taiwan emerge from this battle with a stronger logisticalbase and sharper competitiveness in the industry? Or, in its hasteto achieve its APROC goals, will the government end up giving awayTaiwan's entire air cargo market to foreign companies?Air express cargo companies were born in response to the commercialneed for fast delivery of original documents essential to theoperation of a wide range of industries, particularly finance andshipping. Taiwan's document delivery business, however, is nearsaturation point and does not hold sufficient profit potential tosatisfy international express carriers, especially latecomers tothe local market such as UPS and FedEx. To tap greater profits,foreign firms have opened a new service offering express deliveryof consignments weighing over 45kg, which previously were shippedas ordinary air freight.Growing enthusiasm for this new service is attributable to acombination of Taiwan's manufacturing orientation, its geographiclocation and the time factor. Taiwan is far more attractive as anair express cargo hub than many of its Asia-Pacific neighbours.According to Adam Tsui, marketing manager for UPS in Taiwan, theeconomies of both Hong Kong and Singapore are dominated by servicesector industries, meaning that urgent deliveries are mainly in theform of paperwork, whereas Taiwan's economy is supported primarilyby export-oriented manufacturing industries, particularly in thehigh-tech sector. Although South Korea has a strong manufacturingbase, it is largely in heavy industries and this, combined with thecountry's geographical location, detracts from its potential as anair cargo hub. Many of Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs) are dynamic, high-tech goods manufacturers and these,according to Tsui, form the client group with the greatestpossibilities.Taiwan's largest computer manufacturer, Acer Sertek Inc., forexample, has a manufacturing facility at Subic Bay in thePhilippines that produces 150,000 computer motherboards per month.If the components for making these motherboards were flown in fromTaiwan via the usual routes, they would have to go first to Manila.Subic Bay is only about 100 miles from Manila, but delivery ofgoods is often seriously delayed when heavy downpours turn poorlypaved roads into impassable rivers of mud. Acer now relies on FedExfor chartered air cargo services direct to Subic Bay. The company'sdeputy general manager Gen Chang lauds the efficiency of airexpress services, but admits that costs are 30-50 per cent higherthan for delivery by ordinary air-freight.The growth of industries for which time is money means a bonanzafor international express carriers. But the capital- andtechnology-intensive requirements for the establishment of an airexpress operation, combined with the demand for logisticalefficiency in integrated express delivery services, havediscouraged many businesses from trying to get a share of theexpress delivery pie.Currently only four international carriers - UPS, FedEx, DHL andTNT - offer integrated air cargo services, in contrast to thecheaper but less time-efficient services available from localcompanies, which usually consolidate small consignments beforeshipping. The big international players provide door-to-doorservices that include pick-up and delivery to the airport, airtransport, customs clearance and freight forwarding facilities thatrange from inland transportation to warehousing. This allows themto control costs, guarantee delivery time and exploit economies ofscale, thus making them far more competitive than airline companiesand forwarding agents. Such considerations clearly explain thedifferentials in shipping rates.CH Lee, chairman of the Airfreight Forwarders' Association (AFA),admits that the integrated, streamlined operations of internationalair express companies have put them on an entirely differentfooting from the rest of the air cargo industry. Forwarding agents,customs brokers and airline companies have all been hit by thegrowing popularity of specialised air express delivery companies.Inland transportation and warehousing services are expected tosuffer as well.The government's moves to develop Taiwan into a regional operationscentre may benefit international air express companies, but theyhave sent a chill down the spine of the local industry. Since ahighly efficient air cargo system is essential to a regionaloperations hub, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has inshort time decided to establish both an air express cargo zone, orExpress Handling Unit (EHU) and an integrated air cargo zone, bothat CKS airport. The emphasis at the moment is on transhipment,which accounts for 75 per cent of cargo handled, whileimport-export accounts for only 25 per cent.The establishment of the EHU is a positive step towards replacingthe nine-to-five customs operation with a round-the-clock serviceallowing goods to receive customs clearance regardless of how latethey arrive. However, even though customs processing in the zonerequires only one quarter of the time previously needed, fewclients have shown interest in this special facility. Contrary toinitial estimates that 1000 cases would be handled per day, only900 were handled in the facility's first month of operation.International air express companies have complained of its highfees, stringent restrictions and the total of 32 approval sealsthat still need to be collected for each shipment, despiteallegedly simplified import and export procedures.Publications and home appliances cannot pass through the facility,as they have to be inspected by the Government Information Office(GIO) and Quarantine respectively. As one air cargo terminalofficer puts it, these unreasonable regulations cause "expressdelivery" to become "slow delivery".There are other serious limitations. Says Terence Chuang, generalmanager of DHL's Taiwan office: "The problem with the new facilityis that it's only allowed to handle - at least for now - shipmentsunder 45kg, and with a value below US$740. Shipments that meetthose criteria constitute only five per cent of the total air cargomarket."In addition to criticisms from international express carriers,local airfreight forwarders and customs brokers complain thatanyone interested in operating in the EHU must have an electronicdata exchange (EDI) system, which allows shipping documents to becomputerised and thus processed more quickly and efficiently. Thisrequirement, they say, was instituted without seeking input fromlocal firms who are unlikely to possess such technology, andseemingly with only the interests of international companies inmind.The second facility, for integrated air cargo operations, isexpected to set the ball rolling for Taiwan's transformation intoa regional operations hub. But among local air cargo companies, itis regarded as yet another unfair privilege for foreign companies.Operating rights in this zone give UPS an exclusive service area atCKS airport, where it will have its own ground crew and warehouses.Combined with its air transport, forwarding and customs clearanceservices, and possibly inland transportation service in the future,the arrangement gives UPS an advantage over local, as well as otherinternational, air express cargo companies. "There are plenty oflocal companies that understand this business, and understand itwell," says CH Lee of AFA. "We have no problem with competition,but it has to be fair competition. Foreign operators should not beoffered privileges that give them an unfair competitive advantage."DHL's Terence Chuang agrees that local companies are being put ata disadvantage by their exclusion from the integrated cargohandling zone, and predicts a rough ride ahead. "We need torecognise that there are too many airfreight forwarders here," hesays. "There are something like 500 in Taipei alone. In the face ofcompetition from integrated foreign express carriers, the largerlocal companies will probably survive, and some may have to mergetheir operations. But there's going to be a big shakeout in theindustry, and a lot of small forwarders are going to have to closedown. Local companies that want to survive will have to integratetheir operations, and establish co-operative agreements with otherintegrated forwarders in cities around the world and withcommercial airlines."The government has taken these steps with the broader aim ofsharpening the competitive edge of local industry. Moreover, theCouncil for Economic Planning and Development and the Ministry ofTransport and Communications expect the initiative to have acatalytic effect on the transformation of Taiwan into an air cargotranshipment centre, while at the same time strengthening thelogistical base for the manufacturing and financial centres calledfor under the APROC plan. Adam Tsui of UPS insists that theregional distribution experience of international expresscompanies, following the establishment of the transhipment centre,will spur the development of Taiwan as an exporter of value-added,semi-finished products assembled on the island.Not all agree, however. "It's a good idea, but they're going aboutit in the wrong way," says CH Lee of AFA. What needs to be changedfor Taiwan to become a regional operations centre is the wholeenvironment for the air cargo industry, particularly in terms ofupgrading services at its international airports, rather thanthrough negotiations with selected parties and creating anenvironment based on "special privileges" for internationalcompanies. "This is good for neither consumers nor manufacturers,"says Lee.Critics view the government's haste to establish an integrated aircargo zone as a reflection of its desire to quickly put a good faceon its APROC plan, about which most people are not particularlyoptimistic. Tsai Ching-yen, director-general of the CAA, however,insists that as the agency responsible for implementing thegovernment's policy, there was little the CAA could do to reduceits impact on the local industry. He maintains that the presentarrangements are only temporary, and that other companies will bewelcome once an additional terminal has been built at CKS airport.Both academics and industrialists insist that a completetransformation of the air traffic industry is more important thanmaking special arrangements for Taiwan to become a regional airtransport centre. Anthony Han, a professor at National Chiao TungUniversity's Department of Transport Engineering and Management,comments in a recent study that the air transport operationsenvironment, customs clearance and air cargo terminals operationsall need improvement, and that pertinent laws and regulations mustbe revised to meet the industry's changing needs. As one example ofwhat can be achieved, he cites Singapore's Changi InternationalAirport, which already offers 24-hour customs clearance for allgoods, not just express cargo.The liberalisation and integration of Taiwan's air cargo operationshas seen international express companies get off to a good start,while local companies claim they have been left behind. TerenceChuang of DHL, however, feels it is not too late for them to catchup. "Until CKS airport becomes an import-export hub, it's not goingto be of any real value. Right now, it's an image thing. At thesame time, I think the present emphasis on transhipment willactually give local companies some breathing room and allow them toupgrade their operations to be able to compete with internationalfirms when Taiwan becomes an import-export hub."Copyright 1996 Asian Review of Business and TechnologyBack to Headline List WT03-B03-14IA086-000615-B047-199http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it119.html 205.156.212.5 19970122022248 text/html 177913HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:20:29 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:45 GMTContent-length: 177725Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it119.html Sample Issue Copyright ASIAWEEK via NewsNet September 13, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Asiaweek Continuing Special Report on Asian Languages 13/09/96 (1188 words) BUSINESS: Stocks To Watch: It"s the Economy, Stupid: Buying bank stocks?

Upon his death,Khalid was succeeded by a half brother, the currently reigningKing Fahd. TRIVIA: Khalid was the first foreign head of stateto pay a visit to France's Elysee Palace after FrancoisMitterrand came to power.Khalistan literally "Land of the Pure" in PUNJABI. Name forthe (as yet unfulfilled) independent Sikh state demanded bymilitant adherents of the religion. In its purest sense, suchan entity would include not only the Indian state of Punjab,but also the adjacent territories that once belonged to therealm of the great Sikh leader Ranjit Singh (1780-1839).Khalkha the dominant Mongol group, making up more than three-quarters of Mongolia's population. The word also refers to thelanguage, which is spoken by 1.8 million people in Mongoliaand is the country's official tongue, and the territorycontrolled by the Khalkha people in the past (once also knownas Outer Mongolia). Khalkha submitted to Chinese rule in thelate 17th century, but declared independence when the Qingdynasty collapsed in 1912. It became the Mongolian People'sRepublic in 1924. (The "people's republic" was dropped fromthe name in 1992.)Khalsa (FIG.1) from PERSIAN khales, meaning "pure." Religious,military and social brotherhood established by the last Sikhguru, Gobind Singh, in 1699. Now the dominant order ofSikhism. Upon reaching puberty, most Sikh children areinitiated into the Khalsa. After the ceremony (amritsanskar),they assume the surname "Singh" (Lion) or "Kaur" (Lioness).Khalsa members (called amritdhari) are required to distinguishthemselves by bearing the Five K's: kesh (uncut hair -representing spirituality), kangha (comb - spiritual order anddiscipline), kara (steel bracelet - unity with God andallegiance to the Khalsa), kirpan (sword - courage, dignityand self-sacrifice) and kachha (short trousers - moralrestraint). They must also adhere to a strict code of conduct;one is prohibited from consuming intoxicants (especiallytobacco), engaging in adultery and dyeing or plucking outwhite hair. Sikhs not belonging to the Khalsa are called thesahajdhari ("slow adopters").khalwat MALAY in Islam, the offense committed when a man and awoman, who are not married to each other, are in closeproximity to each other in a secluded area. If you take yourgirlfriend into your house in the evening, a nosy neighbor maywell assume you are up to hanky-panky and notify the religiousauthorities. (Every once in a while, there is a highlypublicized case where a well-known politician, a prominentbusinessman or a film star gets caught in such a situation.)Being a popular destination for lovers, Kuala Lumpur's scenicLake Gardens are a particularly fruitful area for religiousofficers after dark. Errant couples looking for a quiet spotmay well find themselves being pounced on by the eagle-eyedenforcers and ordered to appear in court, where a fine or apromise to get married is extracted from them. Non-Muslims areexempt from charges of khalwat.Khamenei, Ayatollah Seyed Ali (FIG.2) (b. 1940) Iran'sspiritual leader. Once a student under Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini, Khamenei was imprisoned six times and exiled duringthe rule of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. After the 1979 IslamicRevolution, he served as Iran's president from 1981 to 1989and succeeded Khomeini as the supreme religious leader whenthe latter died in 1989. He is something of a scholar-figurewho did not shrink from lecturing on Islamic theology whenaddressing the United Nations in 1987 (he also did not refrainfrom fulminating against the U.S., causing the Americandelegates to walk out). He does not have the use of his righthand - the result of an 1981 assassination attempt in which atape recorder with a bomb hidden inside was placed on thelectern while he was giving a sermon.khamsin hot, dry and dusty southerly wind that occurs in NorthAfrica and the Arabian peninsula.

Apostman-turned-revolutionary, Khamtay served as the militarycommander of the Pathet Lao movement and was appointed deputyprime minister and defense minister when the Lao People'sDemocratic Republic was established in 1975.

Making his not-so-auspicious Test debut in 1971against England, Khan shook off his jittery beginnings toachieve a reputation as one of the best all-rounders (i.e.,proficient in both bowling and batting) in the history of thesport. He captained the Pakistani team from 1982 to 1992 (withtwo brief breaks due to injury and a short-lived retirement)and crowned his illustrious career by leading his country toits first World Cup title in 1992. As durable as hisreputation on the field was his image as a playboy: the one-time most eligible bachelor was long known for his string ofhigh-society girlfriends. He ended up marrying JemimaGoldsmith, a wealthy British financier's daughter half hisage, raising more than a few eyebrows - and probably breakingmore than a few hearts - in the process. Now retired, he ispresently lavishing his attention on his Shaukat Khanum CancerHospital - named after his mother, who died of cancer in 1985- and harboring political ambitions (he recently launchedTehreek-e-Insaf, or Movement for Justice).Khan, Jahangir (b. 1963) Pakistani squash great of Pathanstock. Coming from a family of squash champions (fatherRoshan, uncles Hashim and Azam, and cousin Mohibullahdominated the sport in the 1950s and '60s), Khan burst intothe international squash scene in 1979 by becoming the firstunseeded - and, at 15, the youngest - player to win the WorldAmateur Championship. In 1981, he embarked on a remarkablefive-year unbeaten streak of more than 500 games; when the runcame to an end, he was still only 22. Towards the end of the1980s, Khan seemed less invincible but nevertheless won hissixth World Open title in 1988 and the British Open for anunprecedented 10th consecutive time in 1991, silencing thosewho had dismissed him as over the hill.Khan, Jansher (b. 1969) another Pakistani squash great ofPathan stock (no relation to Jahangir). Currently ranked No.1in the world, Jansher first came to the world's attention whenhe beat Jahangir in 1987 (he went on to defeat his oldercompatriot in their next 10 encounters). The kind of respectand adulation showered on Jahangir, however, has been slowerin coming to Jansher, partly because of his somewhat abrasivepersonality.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996BUSINESS: Stocks To Watch: It"s the Economy, Stupid: Buying bank stocks?Look at the big picture first from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996By Assif ShameenAnyone bottom fishing for cheap stocks in Asia these days islikely to dredge up a number of big-name bank stocks. Beselective. "It's not a good time to be in Asian bank stocks,"warns Robert Zielinski, regional bank analyst at JardineFleming in Singapore. "Banking really is 95% macro-economics."Powerhouses from Singapore to South Korea are starting to slowdown partly because of a slump in electronics demand but alsobecause it is simply time for a breather after years of headygrowth. "Banks generally are very sensitive to levels ofeconomic activity," says Simon Smithson, a regional bankanalyst for Kleinwort Benson Securities. "There is a primafacie case for more circumspection in investing in banks."But there are bright spots. Zielinski is enthusiastic aboutthe Philippines, which surprised analysts last week byannouncing better-than-expected first-half GNP growth of 7%."Wow!" he says. "It's a fantastic economic recovery and growthstory. Most bank stocks there are up more than 50% this year."The Manila stock market may be nearly a year away from itspeak, he says, because "the Philippine economic cycle is abouttwo years behind Malaysia and about three years behindThailand." Raymond Lee, an analyst for Lehman Brothers, isbullish on Hong Kong: "The economy is picking up not onlythere but also in China. People talk about U.S. interest ratesrising but you have to realize that the Hong Kong economy isnow much more closely linked with China, where interest ratesare heading downward."So which counters look good? John Hobson, a bank analyst atMorgan Stanley Asia, says his house has a buy on eight bankstocks worldwide but only one of them is in Asia - that's HSBCHoldings, which controls Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank. Thecounter is a favorite with many industry watchers. "HSBC hasgreat regional exposure," says Lehman's Lee. "They've targetedthe growing affluent class in Asia, and as a leading bankgroup in Hong Kong, they are a key beneficiary of economicrecovery in the territory and China." Smithson likes the factthat HSBC derives nearly two-thirds of its profits from Asia."That proportion will go up rather than down," says theKleinwort analyst. "Even as it expands in Europe and the U.S.,HSBC will remain an Asia-centered bank. It is one bank that iswell-equipped to deal with the changing nature of Asia'sbanking marketplace."Zielinski is not so sure. "HSBC has such a huge exposure inBritain and the U.S. that bad news there can more than offsetthe good news in Asia," he argues. And HSBC and subsidiaryHang Seng have had a great run this year. "All the good newsfor HSBC as well as Hang Seng and some of the other banks inHong Kong is already in the price," says Bonnie Lai, a bankanalyst at brokerage Yamaichi International. She favorslaggards like the International Bank of Asia: "It's a smallbank that has underperformed the market and therefore islikely to fare better in the next few months." But Zielinskicautions: "There are lots of imponderables in Hong Kong beyondthe July 1, 1997 handover to China. There could be a whole lotof Chinese banks doing all sorts of things."If he were to purchase just one Asian bank stock, says theanalyst, "I would buy Philippine National Bank." True, PNB hasdisappointed analysts in the past three years with its slower-than-anticipated recovery, but Zielinski says this timearound, the former government-controlled bank is really goingto surprise people. PNB valuations are just half those ofother comparable lenders in the Philippines. "PNB may have hadlower returns on assets and returns on equity in the past fewyears, but you've got to realize this is a turnaround story,"says Zielinski. "It will have higher earnings growth than mostother banks over the next three years. There's little downsideand lots of upside." Smithson likes Metrobank, which is biggerthan PNB. Lee says he also wants to be in the Philippines, butworries about high valuations: "You can't pay the moon foreven the best stock."Zielinski is bullish on big Indonesian banks BDNI, BankInternasional Indonesia and Bank Danamon because they arecheap. "Indonesia, like the Philippines, is an underbankedmarket," he says. "This means banks have plenty of room togrow." One problem: interest rates. "At 20% per annum, they'rehigher than what an investor can earn from bank stocks," saysZielinski. "So over the long term, if you believe rates won'tmove too much either way, you must see if the stock you arelooking at can somehow get a return of more than 20%." Lee hasother worries. "In Indonesia, the macro economic picture isn'tthat bad, but you have political instability," he says. "Andthe central bank is trying to control credit growth and mayincrease the required capital adequacy ratio."What about the slowing economies? Zielinski finds good valuein Korean bank stocks, especially Shinhan Bank, CommercialBank of Korea, Korea Long-Term Credit Bank and Kookmin Bank."The Korean banking sector is probably the only one in Asiawhere stock prices could double or triple in two to threeyears," he says. "Now is the time to be accumulating bankshares. Many are selling at 7 to 8 times this year's earnings.An average bank in Asia sells over two times its book value.Korean banks are selling at 70% of book value or a third ofthe Asian average." But Morgan Stanley's Hobson has a caveat:"Unless you believe the Seoul bourse is going to risesubstantially, you should stay away from most Korean banks."He says banks in Korea are required to make provisions againstonly 50% of their stock market losses.Lee and Smithson like Malayan Banking in Malaysia, though theyconcede the stock is expensive. "If you have to pick a bankstock there, you might as well choose Maybank," says Lee.Smithson says Maybank is better positioned than any otherlender in Malaysia, where "concerns about overheating arereceding and there is a degree of optimism about the medium-term macro-economic fundamentals." Zielinski has a differenttake. "Malaysian bank stocks are among the most expensive inthe world and the banks are still lending like crazy toproperty developers, so they can't be a bargain in the longrun," he argues. What about Singapore? Banks there, saysZielinski, "are very exposed to the overheated property marketat a time when the government is trying to cool things."Lenders like Overseas Union Bank do have a reputation for goodmanagement. "But with earnings growing so slowly, I'd givethem a miss," says Smithson.The outlook in other countries does not look much better.Economic worries in Thailand may continue to be a drag on bankstocks, including heavyweights like Bangkok Bank. "Slowergrowth will impact on loan growth, interest margins andpossibly bad debts, and thus hurt profitability," says Lee."People wonder when might be a good time to start fishing inThailand now that the water level is so low. I believe afurther fall will make banks very attractive. But right now,Thai banks are a high-risk punt." Hobson is worried about asurge in the level of non-performing loans. Zielinski saysbank credit outstanding as a percentage of GDP in Thailand, asin Malaysia, is higher than anywhere else in the world. "Theratio of credit to the size of the economy is about 140% to150% and that's incredibly high. When Japan was at this levelof development, its ratio of credit to GDP was 70%."Investors should also realize that things have changed. "InThailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, it's no longerpossible to look at banks as a growth industry," saysSmithson. "The days of 30% to 40% loan growth are gone." Youmay get that in India with lenders like the State Bank ofIndia or in the Philippines. "In the more developed markets,"says Smithson, "banks have become a mature business." Theindustry has also become more competitive, "but not all thebanks will be equally well-placed to prosper in the newenvironment." Still, banks will always remain part of anylarge regional portfolio. Says Hobson: "If there is nodeterioration in asset quality, you can get a better returnfrom a bank compared with an industrial company or one thatsells consumer goods." Just be careful about fundamentals,price and timing.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996BUSINESS: Money & Investing: Banqueting With the Bears: As prices decline,savvy punters get hungrier from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996The apparent economic slowdown in Asia this year has cooledinvestor enthusiasm for stocks. But as markets fall, HughYoung, 38, managing director of Abtrust Fund Managers(Singapore) Ltd., says he is becoming more bullish. The trick,as usual, is to know where to tread. The Exeter Universitygraduate, who since 1985 has managed Britain's top-performingAsian unit trust, Abtrust Pacific, spoke with Asiaweek'sSteven K.C. Poh. Excerpts:Has the Asian growth story changed?Overall, the longterm economic outlook for Asia is aspromising as ever. With the exception of Japan, which isundergoing a structural, not cyclical, change and is having toopen its doors to the outside world, the forecasts for GDPgrowth over the next 3 to 5 years in Asia are a comfortable6%-7% per annum.So, should we worry about the apparent slowdown?That depends. I regard the slowdown we're seeing in Singapore,and indeed throughout the region, as fundamentally healthy.But it's also going to be painful for certain industries,specific companies and unwary investors. Singapore is a goodexample. The boom in the global electronics industry over thepast few years has had a dramatic effect, boosting economicgrowth above virtually all forecasts. It surprised me thatfirst-quarter 1996 growth was so strong at 10.9%. Yet noweveryone is sunk in deep gloom over second-quarter growth of7.0%. I find it hard to understand this reaction to a cyclicalevent, which should have been expected. Cycles are part oflife, and so is development. Development or economic successbrings its problems and I think that is what we are seeing inAsia today. All the region's economies are starting from ahigher base each year, so sustaining high growth levels isever harder. Labor, property and associated costs are allrising; that puts pressure on margins, and eventually squeezescertain businesses out.What are the implications for earnings?Corporate earnings are coming in much as we expected, but wehave had forecasts well below the consensus. Overall for ourAsian portfolios, we are seeing earnings-per-share growthslowing to around 12% in 1996. This is a function ofincreasing costs and increasing competition. With tariffbarriers coming down across the region, businesses are movingacross borders ever more rapidly. Any inefficient producerswho have traditionally been protected by tariffs will go outof business and those who survive will have to be forward-thinking and agile.It sounds as if you are bearish on Asia.No, oddly enough I'm getting more bullish as markets slip. Ithink the key is knowing what you're doing. It's no longersufficient to close your eyes and invest in Asia, relying oneconomic growth to carry you through. I think markets willpunish most concept stocks or those that have relied onfinancial engineering and aggressive leverage. Conversely, therewards will go to stocks that invest in professionallymanaged, well-financed companies - providing one is carefulabout not overpaying for those earnings. For those investorswho are prepared to do the hard work there's some great valueto be had.Is there value in sectors?Obviously there are sectors that we naturally favor. Anythingbenefiting from the growing wealth of the consumer should dowell, so we favor areas such as retail, insurance and media.Similarly with strong economic growth, we like banks andfinancial institutions. Also the infrastructure story willremain a core investment theme in Asia for many years to come.But at the end of the day, you have to be terribly stockspecific and focus on management because you are going to needsome skilled and visionary people to cope with all thepressures of success that Asia is facing.What stocks do you favor?Among the large-capitalization issues, it is hard to do betterthan some of the region's banks. Well-managed and standing onreasonable ratings, we would buy HSBC, even after its strongperformance, and the Thai banks, such as Bangkok Bank, SiamCommercial Bank and Thai Farmers Bank (but taking care toaccess these either via the local board, if legallypermissible, or via convertible bonds). In Singapore there isfabulous value to be discovered, but again only if one has theability to access the local board. The local board stocks thatlook very cheap are again the banks - DBS, OCBC, OUB and UOB.Singapore Airlines, which can be bought at asset value, andSingapore Press Holdings are also bargains. Elsewhere amongthe region's larger capitalized stocks, we are comfortablewith companies such as Indostat in Indonesia and PhilippineLong Distance Telephone and with some property companies thatare beginning to appear to be good value, such as Sime-UEP inMalaysia and Sammakorn in Thailand.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996The Asiaweek Financial 500: RATING YOUR BANK from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996Every year Asiaweek ranks the region's 500 biggest commercialbanks according to assets. We also tell you how they comparewith each other in deposits, loans, net profit andshareholders' equity. We calculate profit as a percentage ofassets and of equity (the higher the number, the moreefficiently the bank makes money), and equity as a percentageof assets (the higher the number, the more capital the bankcan tap to deal with financial strains and emergencies). Loansas a percentage of deposits, meanwhile, says how much a bankis able to make use of relatively cheap deposit funds inmaking lucrative loans.In the following tables, we classify the banks by country andindicate their moneymaking abilities, that is, their profit-to-assets and profit-to-equity ratios, which are important inpicking what bank stocks to buy. For the first time, we alsoinclude a table showing net interest income (NII). This tellsyou how much money a bank made from its core business ofmaking loans plus its earnings from other assets, such asinterbank deposits, bonds, stocks and securities. Compare NIIwith total net profit, and you will get an idea of howdiversified a bank is - or how dependent it is on interestincome.Another tool: a ranking of top banks according to capitaladequacy ratio. You arrive at a lender's CAR by dividing totalcapital - equity plus other assets - by the value of loans,securities and other assets, weighted according to theirriskiness. The Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements,which acts as a clearing house for the gold and currencyreserves of many countries, recommends a minimum CAR of 8% forinternational banks. Those with higher ratios are regarded asexceptionally stable, since they have more than enoughresources to cover risk assets.What does this all mean to you as a depositor, borrower andinvestor? As they say, forewarned is forearmed. Know thybanker and thy bank. By all means, look for good service,attractive deposit rates and cheap loans. But don't forget thefundamentals. The numbers in these pages are a good startingpoint.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996The Asiaweek Financial 500: Rapped on the Knuckles: Can Jardine Flemingregain investor trust? from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996Hong Kong's Jardine Fleming Bank, ranked No. 350 in theFinancial 500, might be thankful it focuses on treasury andforeign-exchange transactions, not on retail services.Ordinary depositors could have been spooked by news last weekthat a Hong Kong sister company, Jardine Fleming InvestmentManagement, had been censured for lax controls. JFIM's London-regulated affiliate, Jardine Fleming Asset Management or JFAM,was fined $625,000 and had its license in Britain withdrawn.Three other investment firms within Britain's Robert FlemingGroup, half-owner of Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming Group,were each penalized $156,000 for failing to make sure thatJFIM had adequate controls before entrusting it with itsclients' money.British and Hong Kong authorities came down hard on formerJFIM senior fund manager Colin Armstrong for enriching himselfat the expense of three funds, and on former JFIM and JFAMchief Robert Thomas for failing to adequately superviseoperations and deal with the misconduct. Armstrong, whoresigned in March, and Thomas, who was sidelined to anotherpart of the group a month later, had their license in HongKong revoked. (Thomas was also banned from working inBritain's fund-management industry.) Armstrong has returned anundisclosed amount to JFIM; the company will use the money aspart of a $19.3 million compensation fund for affectedinvestors. "This has been a painful experience," said HenryStrutt, managing director of the Jardine Fleming Group. "We'reglad to have been able to put the matter right."It is not over. Asia's biggest investment manager with $22billion in funds, Jardine Fleming faces the task of reassuringinstitutional and retail clients across the region. Last week,Robert Fleming disclosed that it had repatriated three fundsunder JFIM management, worth a combined $1.1 billion, back toLondon, though it insisted the move has no connection with theinvestigation. The controversy comes at a bad time. The HongKong government will introduce a mandatory provident fundscheme next year, which could mean billions of dollars in newpension money needing managers. Some of JFIM's existingprovident-fund clients are said to be looking at theiroptions.JFIM had been housecleaning even before the five-monthBritish-Hong Kong probe was completed. It had named a newchief of compliance and hired experts to review procedures.JFIM says it is banning personal-account dealings andintroducing a centralized system to check when and where alltrades are routed. Because of the loopholes, Armstrong hadallegedly found it easy to delay the booking of a trade. Ifthe transaction was especially profitable, say the regulators,it would be credited as a deal made by his personal account orone particular client account. If not, it would be allocatedto another fund he manages.Despite the disciplinary action, Armstrong has yet to be shownto have broken any Hong Kong criminal law. And JFIM? Thechallenge is to remain entrepreneurial while making sure noregulation is breached. JFIM's success has been credited toits free-wheeling management. "This is the same business stylelauded in the press as more dynamic than half-a-dozen of itscompetitors," says an industry source. "But any system is onlyas good as the people within it." The regulators - andinvestors - are watching.- By Matthew FletcherCopyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996The Asiaweek Financial 500: A Behemoth Awakes: New Delhi"s biggest bankreinvents itself from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996In India, a giant is stirring. The State Bank of India(assets: $36.1 billion) is putting away its musty files andledgers the size of billiard tables. Chairman P.G. Kakodkar,59, aims to computerize 1,000 branches a year. SBI has alsostarted streamlining management structures and delegatingpower to division heads. In August, it announced the formationof subsidiaries to handle credit cards and securities trading,and launched a partnership with travel firm Thomas Cook to setup a tourism development finance company. "Internationally,the bank is positioning for a dominant presence in the cross-border loan syndication markets and also in the issue ofIndian paper by blue-chip companies," says Kakodkar.There is much to do. Ranked No. 63 in the Financial 500,state-controlled SBI employs 229,000 people and has 8,763branches in India and 49 overseas. Owned 60% by the state, SBIis under orders not to fire people, which raises the questionof what it will do with excess staff after computerization andstreamlining. Still, improvements are beginning to show.Customer complaints are now considered black marks that canaffect an employee's prospects. SBI offices are less often thedingy affairs that prompted jokes about the bank's expansionstrategy: go to a village, look for a cowshed, drive away thecattle and set up operations. "The first thing we're doingwith the computerization of branches is to rework theirinterior decor," says SBI spokeswoman Ranjana Bharij."It's a huge task to make SBI friendlier to the ordinarycustomer," says investment analyst Imran Contractor. "Theyhave been so used to resting on their power." Improvingservice to corporations should be easier. A new commercialaccounts division has just opened a Bombay branch to servebusiness groups exclusively. SBI has also reduced processingtime for all loans. "These changes will ensure that oldclients will not go away," says Prasanna Someshwar, a bankinganalyst for W.I. Carr in Bombay. "This is important becausenew private banks are going for big business."Can SBI compete? Contractor says the bank is still "highlysusceptible to government interference." But Someshwar isoptimistic: "It used to be a giant which did not know where itwas headed. Now it is focused." Four years ago, SBIcommissioned Canadian management consultancy firm Mackenzieand Co. to study ways of improving its operations. The bankstarted implementing the recommendations in January. InKakodkar, says Someshwar, SBI has found "an instrument ofreform, not necessarily a visionary." An SBI veteran who onceheaded the bank's training college and technology division,Kakodkar became chairman only two months ago. But he knowswhere the bank has been - and where it wants to go.- By Arjuna Ranawana/New DelhiCopyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996The Asiaweek Financial 500: Too Many Lenders?: Let the market decide, saysManila from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996Edgardo Reyes has accounts with three financial institutions."One bank is more efficient than the others," says theFilipino entrepreneur, "but I do business with all threebecause I can get better terms that way." He is learning totake advantage of the country's two-year-old bankingliberalization. The money people are getting an education too."Times have changed," says Rafael Buenaventura, president ofPCI Bank and the Bankers Association of the Philippines. "It'sno longer unusual for us bankers to wake up in the morning anddiscover that changes have occurred overnight. As we scan themorning papers over breakfast, we find out that one new bankis about to open, a new product has been introduced, and thegovernment is thinking about some new means of taxation."Welcome to the brave and ever- expanding new world ofPhilippine banking. In the last few months, Filipino-ownedEast-West Banking Corp., Ecology Bank, iBank and Total SavingsBank opened their doors. Earlier, Banco Santander of Spain,Dao Heng Bank of Hong Kong and Taiwan's Chinatrust teamed upwith Filipino partners to launch three new ventures. Lastyear, 10 foreign banks - among them Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,Development Bank of Singapore and Bangkok Bank - started full-scale operations. The tally so far: 152 institutions. "Ourbanking density ratios have significantly declined from morethan 17,000 persons per bank in 1990 to about 12,500 in 1995,"says Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson. "That is bringingus closer to the much lower densities seen in Hong Kong andJapan."Good or bad? Ask the public. Pre-liberalization, the 137mostly Filipino-owned banks offered only basic services. Thesedays, lenders entice clients with phone banking, automatedteller machines that sell airline tickets, high-yield savingsplans - and longer hours. "Various product and marketdiversification strategies have been implemented and a host ofelectronic banking innovations created to tap yet unservicedconsumer segments," says Antonio Abacan, president ofFilipino-owned Metrobank, the country's best-capitalizedcommercial bank. Rates for customers have improved. In 1994,the spread between the lowest deposit rate and the primelending rate was 12.5 percentage points. The gap is now onlyhalf that.But there are worries. After Indonesia opened up its bankingsector in 1988, hundreds of new banks and deposit-takingcompanies set up shop. Some found themselves dangerouslyoverstretched. One casualty: medium-sized Bank Summa, whichcollapsed in 1992 under the weight of $800 million in debts."I would like to admonish some sectors not to be too hasty inpressing for more liberalization," says Buenaventura. "It'spremature to consider the entry of more foreign banks."Singson insists that safeguards are in place to protect thebanking system. The central bank has increased minimumcapitalization - from $30 million to $48 million forcommercial banks - and tightened its monitoring, especially ofrisk management. "Everywhere in the world, governmentofficials have a poor track record whenever they startsubstituting their judgment for that of the market," he says."Business decisions are best left to the bankers." And to bankcustomers.- By Wilhelmina Paras/ManilaCopyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996The Asiaweek Financial 500: Asian Promises: The WTO hopes to solidify themfrom ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996The financial services trade deal that took effect Sept. 1 wasa baby step on the road to open markets.

Those promises include things like increasing thenumber of foreign banks allowed to operate in a given countryor permitting overseas brokerages to establish joint ventureswith local companies. Beginning Nov. 1, 1997, the signatorieswill have 60 days to amend, add or withdraw promises alreadymade. That is not the only unfinished business. Last year, theU.S. dropped out at the last minute. The hope is thatWashington will be more willing to deal once presidentialelections are past.The U.S. has been especially critical of Asian nations forpracticing protectionism. Asian negotiators respond that theysee little to gain from matching the U.S. in opening markets.How-ever, that didn't stop many from making concessions. Bysector, here are some of key ones:BANKINGIndia: Increased to eight from five the number of bankinglicenses it awards to foreigners each year.

Theinstitution has been extending loans and deposit facilities toits customers since 1960. Amirsham puts commitment to peoplefirst. "Being No. 1 has many responsibilities," he says. "Thepublic expect excellent services, our staff expect anexcellent working environment, shareholders expect superiorreturns. Meanwhile, our competitors try to match every move wemake. All this sums up the need to be a truly efficientorganization which continuously strives for excellent service,to satisfy the expectations of increasingly sophisticatedcustomers."Banthoon Lamsam, 43, president of Thai Farmers Bank (No. 96),aims to combine Asian conservatism with Western innovation."First, extremely careful lending, and second, changing theway we provide services" are his winning strategies, says theHarvard- and Princeton-trained billionaire scion of the bank'scontrolling family. One of his pet peeves: long lines atteller windows. He has trimmed them.David Li Kwok Po, 57, deputy chairman and CEO of the Bank ofEast Asia (No. 154), is one of Hong Kong's most prominentbankers and the industry's representative on the territory'sLegislative Council. Li's family has made BEA one of the majorbanking forces in the territory. He once aspired to theAnglican Church ministry, but chose instead a more secularcareer path. His secret for success? "It's confidence," saysLi. You have to convince the client that you are trustworthyby providing good service, he urges. Do that and loyalty willcome. One strategy: student loans. Li aims to turn them intoloyal clients early.Okkie A.T. Monterie, 51, deputy president director of BankInternasional Indonesia (No. 245), says transparency is onestrong reason for the bank's success. For starters, it makesraising money offshore far easier and often cheaper."Investors know exactly what we're doing," he explains. "Wehave a clear-cut image." He compares BII and Bank CentralAsia, the country's largest privately owned institution. "BCAis not a public company; we are," says Okkie. "There is nopressure on them to show a good bottom line. A public companyhas more visibility, more transparency."Peter Seah Lim Huat, 50, president and CEO of Overseas UnionBank (No. 116), joined the Singapore lender after 10 years atCitibank, widely regarded as one of the few truly globalinstitutions. That experience gave Seah a taste for thinkinginternationally and keeping up with an ever-changing market."Consumer banking is going through a radical evolution," heobserves. "We are moving into a highly electronic environmentwith a broader range of more complex products. That requiresdifferent skills, a different mentality, retraining andrepositioning. When you have been in a business for over 40years and are steeped in tradition, these changes are notsimple."Yoon Byung Chul, 60, president of Hana Bank (No. 115), seesvirtue in both big banks and boutiques. "You're either a nichebank or a universal bank that provides just about any kind offinancial service," he says. "These days there is nothing inbetween." Hana is setting up a stockbroking firm and wants tooffer unit trust, insurance and other services as soon asKorean regulators will allow them. Plainly, Asia's best banksare hardly sitting pretty waiting for the interest to pile up.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996FINANCIAL 500: The Asiaweek Financial 500: From global giants to nimbleniche players, Asia"s banks tell the secrets of success from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996By Ricardo Saludo and Matthew FletcherIn a world of phonebanking, automated teller machines, onlineasset switching and smartcards, Antonio Abacan has a secretweapon. "We serve tea in all our branches," allows thepresident and chief operating officer of Metropolitan Bank &Trust Co., the Philippines' largest financial institution, No.218 in The Asiaweek Financial 500 ranking of the region'sbiggest banks.The hot cups of Chinese brew are part of Metrobank's Asianstyle. "We've developed a niche - Filipino-Chinesebusinessmen," Abacan says. One such client, a Mr. Angpin,appreciates the familiar touch: "They know the Asian way. Youcan drop by, give a bag of money to the manager for deposit,and not bother counting the money." Yes, confirms Abacan, "ourteller will later call him to say, `Your deposit is 1 millionpesos.' Other banks try to imitate our style, but this kind oftrust takes years and years to cultivate."As competition hots up in the liberalizing world of Asianbanking, the leading players are finding that tried and testedways are just as important in staying ahead as the latest hightech and financial legerdemain. Banker-legislator David LiKwok Po, chief executive of Hong Kong's third-ranked Bank ofEast Asia (No. 154 in the 500), breaks no news when heexpounds on BEA's success formula: generating confidence,providing strong service and building relationships. Plus amaverick streak: the bank's early push into China has made itprobably the most profitable foreign player on the mainland."You can't be too aggressive because your customers won't likethat," Li explains. "But you can't be too conservative either.It's hard to get the mix right."But mix the top banks must. This special report looks at howsome of the best performers in key Asian markets cope withrising competition and rapid change. Their moves and those ofthe regional industry are major factors in shifts among theFinancial 500 banks. Now in its third year, the annual ranking(starting on page 60) again chronicles in telling numbers thesurges and strains of Asian banking. Trillion-yen write-offsin Japan? No wonder the 500's top 20 lossmakers are Japanese.Roaring economies in Greater China? Indeed: with just 15% ofthe 500's assets, banks from China, Hong Kong and Taiwangenerated nearly 40% of all profits.The world's largest financial institution as of March 31,1996, the end of the fiscal year covered by the 500, was Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (assets: $536.6 billion). But DKB's return tofirst place (it was No. 1 for years during the 1980s) lastedbut a day. The newly merged Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, withcombined assets of $791 billion, dwarfed it on April 1 - andpointed to the likely future of Japanese banking. Faced withmonstrous dud loans and equally gigantic competition, andurged by the Finance Ministry, lenders in Japan are seekingstrength in tie-ups and takeovers. Four institutions withstakes in Taiheiyo (No. 169) are rescuing that lender. NipponTrust (No. 131) cut its losses by $1.2 billion after it wastaken over by Mitsubishi Bank (No. 3). The latter's mergerwith Bank of Tokyo (No. 12) is just the latest union amongseveral in recent years, which also created Sakura Bank, No. 1in the previous Financial 500.The marriages and write-offs by Japanese institutionshighlight a key plank in the strategies of topnotch Asianbanks: Beef up your capital. Singapore's Overseas Union Bank(No. 116) plans a big push in both regional and consumerbanking. For that, OUB and its subsidiaries have more thantripled their capital to over $2 billion since 1992,polevaulting from 400 to 162 in the ranks of world bankinggroups by capital funding, and fifth in ASEAN. "Our muchlarger size has enabled us to effectively penetrate [loan]syndication markets in Thailand, China, Hong Kong and evenAustralia," says OUB chief Peter Seah Lim Huat. The heftierequity base has also helped it acquire Chase Manhattan'scredit-card business in Singapore. With investment bankingambitions, Japan's Sanwa Bank has augmented its capital bycashing in some $1.3 billion in stocks. That lifted itscapital adequacy ratio to 9.12%, well above the 8% recommendedfor international institutions and despite a $9.2-billionwrite-off charged against equity.The urge to merge is also spurred by intense competition. "Youwill see it happening in Hong Kong," says Thomas Koetzsch, aHong Kong-based analyst for bank rating agency CapitalIntelligence. "There are too many banks." And more are coming,from outside and inside Asia. Bank Austria is among the latestWestern institutions following corporate clients to Asia.Koetzsch reckons Hong Kong could see local tie-ups orpurchases by mainland banks of Hong Kong institutions afternext year's reunification with China. Many large Chinese banksare eager to widen their presence in Hong Kong, and "the`easiest' way seems to be to buy a local bank," says Koetzsch.London-based HSBC Holdings, parent of the Hongkong & ShanghaiBanking Corp. (No. 19), is rumored to be among the suitors forAustralia's state-controlled ANZ, whose strengths in SouthAsia, Australasia and the South Pacific would complementHSBC's reach. The new government in Canberra is believed to beopen to a foreign takeover.Asian banks revving up for tougher competition also need toenhance their human and technological resources. Sheltereddomestic markets, steeled by high regulatory walls, once ledto world-beating spreads and profits. But they left homegrowninstitutions short on technology, innovation and marketingsavvy. "The prosperity of Asian banks is due not to goodmanagement or innovation, but to protectionism and cartels,"says Robert Zielinski, research chief of Jardine Flemingbrokerage firm in Singapore. "Banks have become fat andinefficient." But they're changing, says analyst Phuah EngChye of Kleinwort Benson Research in Kuala Lumpur. "Banks arefocusing on how to reinvent themselves. Once complacent, theyare now more alert and flexible."At least, that's the goal. For Thai Farmers Bank's billionaireboss Banthoon Lamsam, it means only one thing: Build aservice-oriented staff. "Our service was terrible - that wasthe assumption from the beginning," says the Ivy Leaguer,whose ethnic Chinese family founded Thai Farmers (No. 96 inthe 500) in 1945. He partly blames entrenched habits in thedomestic industry, where banks tend to be "very bureaucraticand controlled by a closed group who take advantage ofconsumers." Banthoon's solution: new technology and trainingpeople for high performance.Overcoming employee resistance to change has been the toughestchallenge, he says. To meet it, Banthoon revamped andrevitalized a core group of about 200 managers, imparting tothem his vision of Thai Farmers as a world-class player.Result: online accounts, phonebanking, automatic bill paymentsand credit-card clearance are now standard. Queues at ThaiFarmers are much shorter. And the improvements are gettingnoticed. "Thai Farmers is perceived as a bank with vision anda long-term plan to stay competitive," says Susheel Neruda,head of research at Seamico Securities in Bangkok.Metrobank's Abacan has also worked to improve employee morale,teamwork and drive. He has helped create a spirit ofbelonging, which has spurred staff to work long and hard andbe loyal (average length of service among senior executives:27 years). Bank chairman George Ty himself sets the example,at 64 still at his desk every day. Another morale boost:spouses are often invited to bank functions. "They're family,"says Abacan. Also boasting high productivity, BankInternasional Indonesia (No. 245), which has to make the mostof its relatively small headcount - 5,800 - spread among 170branches. "We're very much lower in operating expenses vis-a-vis competitors," says senior v.p. Manuel Sia, a Filipino whojoined BII in 1990. That has helped give the bank a 23.6%return on equity, highest among the top 20 Indonesian banks.Part of the Sinar Mas wood-based empire, the Jakarta-basedinstitution has grappled with another issue facing Asian banksin a changing industry: universal vs. niche banking. Does abank offer a full range of services to all comers, or focus ona narrow stratum of services and customers? But whichever onechooses, the imperative, as BII has seen, remains the same:Develop a market position. A bank should resolve theuniversal-niche issue based not on theoretical argumentsfavoring one or the other, but on what its market demands. Andonce chosen, the market position should be developed bygearing up to service the target clients and publicizing thekind of bank one aims to be."In the beginning we were looking at corporate banking, but itdidn't make sense," recounts BII deputy president-directorOkkie A.T. Monterie. He saw that Indonesia's growing ranks ofaffluent consumers wanted bankers that could offer everythingfrom car loans to credit cards. Three years ago BII shiftedgear. "The right direction for Indonesia is universal orsupermarket banking," says Okkie, who notes that two othercorporate-oriented players, Bank Niaga (No. 324) and Bank Bira(No. 427), are going the retail banking route. BII seems well-advanced on that road - literally: to better publicize itsconsumer tack, it has bright red ads touring Jakarta on thebodies of public buses.Building a market position from scratch is a dauntingchallenge, of course. One solution: take over a successfuloperation, which will bring with it the hard-to-duplicatecustomer relationships that underpin any banking operation.HSBC bought J.P. Morgan bank's dollar-clearing unit, vaultingitself into the top five in the global business, handling $80billion a day for some 700 institutional clients. The questfor an instant market base on which to build motivates buyoutsof consumer banking businesses like Chase's credit-cardoperation in Singapore. That acquisition, says OUB's Seah, hasbeen "instrumental in energizing the rest of our consumerbusiness." For its part, Taipei-based Chinatrust Bank (No.144) stole a march on rivals with a different kind of tie-up:with auto dealers for its push into car loans. It's the sametack for BEA, which is linking up with German marque MercedesBenz in China. "They have the name," says CEO Li. "We buildthe relationship."Like market position, the issue of technology suffers fromslogan-ridden herd-driven thinking. Everyone is innovating, sobanks feel they have to or else. Asia's smart bankers follow ahard-nosed, market-led rule of thumb: Use technology to reachthe client. Not to impress other bankers or follow the fad,but to improve service and boost profits. Old-style bankingrequired the public to travel across town, line up beforetellers and fill out complicated forms. The high-tech varietyenables customers to avail themselves of the same services andmore from the comfort of their office desk or bedside table.Financing is arranged when it is needed: as the client buyssomething.Hongkong Bank aims to use that strategy in its drive for thehigh-end consumer market. So will its subsidiary Hang Seng(No. 49), which is targeting a mass market that is only nowbecoming comfortable with innovations like phonebanking andcredit cards. Helping HSBC's techno-ambitions is its size: itcan spread the cost over eight major affiliate institutions,including Midland Bank, one of Britain's top four, andAmerica's Marine Midland.For Metrobank, high tech and modern systems helped it reachout to the thousands of Filipino workers overseas. Its PrivateElectronic Remittance and Communication System handles largevolumes of money remittances fast. The service allows cash tobe withdrawn by a worker's family in the Philippines on thesame day he or she deposits the money at one of Metrobank'sonline terminals abroad. Technology upgrades being such adaunting operation - Thai Farmers had to re-engineer 500branches over three years - they have to pay for themselvesand more. And they can if they bring in customers.What about going international? Under the World TradeOrganization's financial services deal, banking markets inmany countries are opening up. But Kleinwort Benson's Phuahbelieves for most of the region's institutions, "globalizationdoes not appear feasible because Asian banks are not clearwhat objectives can be achieved. How does opening a branch in,say, New York, London or Tokyo contribute to profitability?"He expects banks with international ambitions to expandregionally first. But Amirsham Aziz, head of top-rankedMalayan Banking (No. 70) goes further back: "To be successfulabroad, you would need to first succeed in your own market.Then you would need to know the foreign country well and makesure you can be an important component in its development."Maybank is itself grappling with the challenges of banking inthe New Asian Economy, where old developmental priorities havegiven way to the demands of fast-expanding affluence andregional business. Its experience mirrors those of otherestablished Asian lenders, most of which started as conduitsof funds for early industrialization and infrastructure."Maybank was established in 1960, when the country had justachieved independence," recounts Amirsham. "We played our roleas a mobilizer of capital for economic development."Such institutions were more concerned with bankrolling roads,bridges and factories than attending to their bottom line. Nowthat their nations have achieved economic strength, theyironically face the prospect of losing the fruits of theirnation-building efforts to newcomers more attuned to suchthrusts as consumer financing and investment management. InKorea, for instance, while the largest lenders creak undernon-performing business loans built up during the decades ofrapid industrialization, a relative upstart like Shinhan Bank(est. 1981, No. 61 in the 500) can plot bold moves with itsclean balance sheet.Can the established lenders of the development years adapt andprofit from the very success they helped create? Maybank,which serviced mainly companies during the development years,has been moving to develop its consumer banking business. Inthis endeavor, Amirsham points out, "the bank's earlyexpansion to reach various segments of the people gives us astrong market presence." He adds that the bank's developmentorientation also imbued it with concern for the client."Meeting customers' needs has always been at the forefront ofeverything we do," stresses the CEO, a 19-year veteran at thebank. "We've also adopted a philosophy that values long-termrelationships with our customers."In sum, nation-building lenders may in fact have the sametraits that could win them loyal customers in today's boomtimes if - a big one - they can target the new class ofclients. But in doing so, Asian institutions need to maintaina cautious conservatism in the face of unfamiliar booms thatcould so easily go bust, as Japan's bubble-economy bankershave seen. Kleinwort Benson's Phuah rings out a familiarwarning about Kuala Lumpur, which would apply to many otherAsian cities: "Easy liquidity has fueled asset prices,especially in property. If there's a severe fallout, bad debtscould rise."At the same time, years of intimate experience in Asia'smarkets give its lenders a unique plus. Says Chinatrustexecutive Steve Chou: "Imagine a multinational walking into alaundry shop to evaluate credit risk. Local banks have livedwith these people so many years, they know." Whether gaugingrisk, building relationships or just having tea, the ultimatetenet in regional finance seems clear: Banks in Asia can winby being Asian. After all, in a business built on trust, ithelps to be one of the family.- With reports from Bangkok, Delhi, Hong Kong, Jakarta, KualaLumpur, Manila, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei and TokyoCopyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996PEOPLE: Now, Enter the Mongolian: Sumo fans would have to wrestle with aname like Daba Badobayaru from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996Sumo fans would have to wrestle with a name like DabaBadobayaru.

Prior to showbusiness, she hada different kind of high-flying career - as a Cathay Pacificflight attendant.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Technology Computers: Tick Tock Goes the Clock: Experts race to head offthe Year 2000 crisis from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996By Jose Manuel TesoroThe way the doomsdayers tell it, the world as we know it willend at midnight, Dec. 31, 1999. The second the next millenniumbegins, people will be recorded with negative ages. Phonecalls will be billed in millions of dollars. Instead of payinginterest due on loans, borrowers will receive a percentage ofwhat they owe - while depositors will be asked to pay bankspart of their savings. Building security systems may fail,financial markets could be paralyzed.All this is forecast to happen because computer programmersdecided over 30 years ago to save on data storage space bydesignating years with two-digit numbers. They assumed that bythe time the 1990s rolled around, hardware and software wouldhave been replaced by versions that do not assume all datesare in the 20th century. The old "legacy" systems think "00"signifies 1900 - so at the beginning of the next millennium,they will start calculating current bills, interest-ratepayments, pension disbursements, bond maturities, mortgagesand the like as if they began, ended or spanned the beginningof the century. The bug will affect both personal computersand mainframes.Since business and government have become so dependent oncomputers for data processing and analysis, the stroke ofmidnight could have an ominous ring to it (see box). Ana-lystshave likened the so-called Year 2000 problem to a virus -though it technically is not one - since it is so wide-spreadand so dangerous. U.S.-based market research firm the GartnerGroup estimates that fixing the "millennium bug," which mayrequire rewriting millions of lines of computer code, willcost $600 billion. Last April, its research director, BruceHall, told the U.S. Congress that "the Year 2000 virus is themost devastating ever to infect the world's business systems."That dire? Maybe not. Many companies - both computer suppliersand their customers - have long been aware of the bug and havebeen working on solutions. In addition, Asia generally has theadvantage of having adopted the latest technologies, whichhave benefited from the results of this awareness. So, as withmany things in the region, the Year 2000 crisis could end upbeing the Year 2000 moneymaking opportunity."It's a business problem - and people really have to take thebit between their teeth," says Ray Muller, business consultingmanager for CSSL, a Hong Kong-based reseller of IBM mainframesthat will soon launch a consulting division to offer clientssolutions to their Year 2000 problems.Dozens of U.S. and European companies are already in themarket. Software and services company Compuware, for instance,offers a package that includes software products as well asprogramming professionals to diagnose, test and solve problemapplications. The process, says Andy Lewandowski, Compuware'smanager of international operations, will "take a lot of humanintervention." Though off-the-shelf solutions exist, rewritingcustomized code will need people.That is good news for India, which has a wealth of computerprofessionals. Over 50 Indian companies working on ways tosquash the millennium bug have formed a special interest groupto promote their services. "We will offer cheap, quick andeasy solutions to the problem," says industry spokesman DewanMehta. These companies feel that they can grab around $5billion of the global business."The tools to solve this problem are the same everywhere,"says Raghavendra Rao of Hyderabad-based Satyam Com-puters."But it requires extensive manual intervention. And peoplecosts in India are cheaper - less than half of those in theU.S." The Gartner Group estimates that farming codework out tooffshore sites such as India will cut costs by 40%.The Indians think the Gartner estimate of $600 billion ishigh. Mehta says the final figure is likely to be between $60billion and $200 billion. One reason: many companies haveaddressed the problem early. Hongkong Bank, for example, beganmaking its systems "Year 2000-compliant" in the mid-1980s. "Weknew it would be a problem," says Bob Carlson, the bank'stechnical services director. So the company simply includedYear 2000 compliance as part of its normal program of up-grades. The bug "is a real problem," Carlson acknowledges,"but the situation is being exacerbated by some of the peoplewho have most to gain from offering services to fix it."Hongkong Bank has been aided by the relative newness of itssystems. Many U.S. and European companies adopted - and stilluse - technologies from the 1970s and early 1980s. Still, saysCompuware's Lewandowski, Asia's slight advantage should not bean excuse for complacency. "Never assume anything," he warns.Preparing for the Year 2000 should be every business'sbusiness.- With reporting by Arjuna Ranawana/New DelhiCOME MIDNIGHTSome examples of what might happen:Computers could subtract birth years from 1900, giving peoplenegative ages.Jan. 1, 1990, was a weekday.

Given a choice betweencreating their own ideas and "borrowing" someone else's,producers can be counted on to take the easy option. In thissense, Bollywood, as India's Bombay-based movie industry iscalled, is an apt name. It suggests a cut-rate, bloated andfolly-ridden version of Hollywood.Alert copyright lawyers could make a killing from an industrythat doesn't settle for stealing merely ideas. Some Indiandirectors also lift scenes, dialogue, music, posters andbillboards. Try, for instance, to spot the artistic differencein the posters, right, for Hollywood's Mr. Jones, starringRichard Gere, and Bolly-wood's Akele Hum Akele Tum (I'm Alone,You're Alone). Naturally, the Indian movie is also a faithfulcopy of the original.In one of the most celebrated cases of borrowing in recentyears, the famous scene in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables,when a baby carriage bumps its way down a staircase - itself anod to Eisenstein's Battle-ship Potemkin - was reproduced inits entirety in N. Chandra's Tejaab (Acid).At the moment, there are three Hindi versions of Sleeping Withthe Enemy playing to packed houses in Indian cinemas. Eachputs a new, uniquely subcontinental twist on an already warpedtheme. In one, titled Yaarana (Friends), the eternal triangleis resolved with a macho male-bonding finale. In another, AgniSakshi (As Fire Is My Witness), the harassed wife becomes avamp, while the stalker is portrayed as the wronged party. Andin Daraar (Fear), the busty and popular Juhi Chawla plays agyrating song-and-dance version of the Julia Robertscharacter.Director Mahesh Bhatt's most recent effort, Phir Teri KahaniYaad Aagaye (Your Memory Comes Back to Haunt Me), is a copy ofBasic Instinct.

Perhaps authors think that the field is crowded, withtomes by Tom Clancy and the more elegant products of John leCarre. But The Tim-Tim Man (Penfolk, Ashwood, Victoria,Australia, 567 pages, A$19.95, paperback) is a valiant attemptat mixing up an Asian brew of political conspiracy against anhistorical and factual background. The author, Kerry Collison,is Australian-born, although he is now an Indonesian citizen.He once served as a diplomat in Jakarta and has a soundunderstanding of the country and its politics.His protagonist, Stephen Coleman, is  a middle-levelAustralian diplomat who also happens to be a spy. Caught up inthe coup that toppled Sukarno, he makes contact with a risingstar of the Indonesian army, Nathan Seda. They form alucrative business alliance based on secret arms sales forIndonesia's armed forces. But Seda has a hidden agenda: EastTimorese by birth, his ultimate aim is independence for hisnative island. He secretly steers weapons and money to theFretilin resistance fighters.The book begins in the turbulent mid-1960s, and tracks Seda'srise through the 1970s and 1980s. Sometime in the near futurehe is within sight of the ultimate political prize. Yet the"Tim-Tim man" (slang for Timor) never forgets his realmission, independence for East Timor, carefully disguising hisambition behind a lot of national unity bluster. To achievethis goal, Seda plans to provoke war between Indonesia andAustralia by planting a bomb in Australia's Parliament.Meanwhile, the head of the Australian secret service is alsoconniving. He  sees some benefit from a nice little war, andhe manipulates Coleman, who has fallen out with his formerfriend, into a plot to kill the general. The labyrinth ofdeception and counter-deception ends, literally, with a bang,although not one which any of the protagonists had planned.The author hits all the hot buttons: corruption, East Timor,the Suharto succession and sometimes touchy Australian-Indonesia relations. So it is not surprising that Indonesiancustoms officers burned an early consignment of the book,although the action seemed to to be the result of a lower-level misunderstanding rather than orders from the top.Regrettably, Collison cannot resist the temptation toeditorialize about Indonesian politics and sometimes seems tolose the thread of the narrative as he pursues varioussidetracks. The key to success in a thriller is to keep thestory moving, and he only just manages to avoid getting boggeddown. Perhaps his second novel, to be called Merdeka Square,will show a defter touch.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996IN BRIEF: A spice that heals  Relations between India and the U.S. arespicing up - literally from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996A spice that heals  Relations between India and the U.S. arespicing up - literally. The Indian government's Council forScientific and Industrial Research is to challenge the patentfor turmeric granted in 1994 to two Americans who argued thatthe herb's active ingredients have medicinal qualities as anantiseptic.Known to South Asians as haldi and to botanists as Curcumalonga, turmeric is the yellow powder most commonly found incurries. In India it is also used as a wound salve, a facialcleanser and a disinfectant after funeral rites. In addition,a 1992 study in the Indian Journal of Physiology andPharmacology found that a one-week course of the spice loweredcholesterol levels by 29%.Turmeric is made up of curcuminoids - anti-bacterial compoundsthat also counter inflammation. AIDS patients even report thatthey feel better when taking it, but it should be stressedthere is absolutely no evidence it has any effect on the HIVvirus.So a lot more than fragrant curries are at stake here. Dr.Ranjit Roy Chaudhury, chairman of India's Advisory Council onTraditional Medicine, says: "We are moving towards the 21stcentury and cannot keep saying we have been using thesesubstances for centuries as an excuse for not obtainingpatents." Dr. Chaudhury says Asian scientists should protecttheir interests by taking out patents on herbal andtraditional treatments.But while the international debate rages, you can use homemadeturmeric preparations whenever you wish.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Health: Inflationary Pressures: Some timely tips on avoiding intestinal gasfrom ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996By Catherine ShepherdIt's an embarrassing topic. But it is a real enough problemfor all that. We all know what it is like to have stomach orintestinal gas. Overindulging at a family banquet or havingone beer too many can be at best embarrassing, and, at worst,very uncomfortable. So what causes gas? There are morevillains than you ever thought.First, leave those candies and chewing gum on the shelf. Whenyou suck hard candy, the constant swallowing of air causesbloating and burping. Also, sugar-free gum often containssorbitol - a sweetener that the bacteria in our colons gobbleup and break down to produce large amounts of gas. This makesthe muscle walls of the colon contract; you feel thecontractions as cramps. So cut back on the gum or read thelabel carefully. Sorbitol and other similar sugar-freesweeteners are often listed as "sugar alcohol" on ingredientlists.Avoid leftover carbohydrates. Corn and whole-grain rice formgas-producing compounds when refrigerated. Thawing andreheating refrigerated leftovers increases the bacterialactivity that causes gas. If you must eat leftovers, then trythem cold. If they don't go down well that way, heat onlyenough for one sitting.Fiber is an important cholesterol-lowering and colon-cancer-preventing nutrient. But too much of it causes intestinal gas.If you plan to add fiber to your diet, do so slowly. Therecommended intake is 25 g per day, and working up to thisamount gradually will be easier on your gut. In particular, bewary of beans, cabbage, apples and broccoli.Lastly, reduce your fats and oil consumption. Lowering fatintake is sage advice for any healthful diet, but fats arealso the most difficult nutrient to digest. They can stay inyour stomach up to two hours and delay the emptying of yourintestinal tract, causing cramps and bloating. All fats,whether from cooking oil, meats or desserts, cause the samereaction, so refusing that third helping of fried noodles oryour second mooncake could go a long way to keeping yourstomach happy.If you cannot avoid the culprit foods, there are a number ofways to purge the gas from your gastro-intestinal tract.Following a meal with a spice such as peppermint, cinnamon orginger will prevent vapor formation and aid digestion. Steep-ing ginger-root or a cinnamon stick in hot water will give youan aromatic, anti-gas tea.Fight the tendency to lounge after a meal. Going for a briefwalk will increase the movement of gas from your digestivesystem. Never lie down; it will only worsen the symptoms. Andif these drug-free remedies don't work, try an over-the-counter gas medication, and follow the package directionscarefully.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Art: strokes of brilliance Please: Thai artists brush aside their rivals inthe third ASEAN art competition from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996By Julian Gearing  BangkokNo room for the finer things of life in the business-before-all-else world of Southeast Asia? Think again. A total of3,624 entries were received for the ASEAN Art Awards 1996, thethird time the prestigious competition has been held.Judging took place in the National Gallery in Bangkok, where,to the delight of locals, Thais took the first three places.Top prize of $10,000 went to Sakchai Uttitho, for his LifeUpcountry No. 6 - a paean to the charms of his home town ofUbon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand. "I am happierthere, more peaceful," says the 28-year-old, who is studyingfor a masters in fine art at Bangkok's Silpakorn University.Life Upcountry drew praise from Sawasdi Tantisuk, 71, one ofThai-land's leading painters and a judge for the PhilipMorris-sponsored ASEAN competition. "Sakchai has composed anatural picture of the countryside, with a strong contrastbetween light and dark," he said. "It has a lot of energy,which contributes to its beauty."Vorakorn Metmanorom, a 28-year-old commercial artist, tooksecond place - and $8,000 - with Yearning for Return ofSpirituality # 1. Of his work, he says: "It is a reflection ofthe fact that you need hope. Take farmers, for example. Evenif the wind is strong, if there are floods, if the crops arenot good, they always have to have determination. There is nosecurity for them, no guarantee the crops will be good. Thefocus is on hope and determination."In third place, with prize money of $5,000, was Light of Asia,by Metha Kongsonthi, 25. Like Sakchai's Life Upcountry, thisswirling, colorful work is an evocative tribute to thespirituality of northeast Thailand. Behind the top-placedThais came a Filipino and an Indonesian. Alfredo D. EsquilloJr. took fourth spot, and $3,000, with his spiritual conundrumDaang Ligid-Krus (Cross Roads), and Sugeng Restuadi was fifthwith Life II, 1996. His prize money was $1,500.Thais have dominated the ASEAN Art Awards since theirinception in 1994. In that year, Santi Thongsook won firstprize with his much-discussed Breath in the Capital City - adisturbing image of a birth in the crowded streets of Bangkok.Another Thai, Navin Biadklang, was runner-up last year. Whythis apparent Thai mastery of the Southeast Asian arts scene?Sansern Milindasuta, chairperson of the department of visualarts at Bangkok University, says it is partly because ofchanging social attitudes. "The number of people visitinggalleries and exhibitions has increased," he says. "Also, thenumber of artists has grown. Students are showing moreinterest in taking up fine arts. And parents are moreunderstanding."Phaptawan Suwannakudt, who runs the Place of Art gallery, saysanother factor is a boom in art competitions. "Thais lovecompetitions," she says. "Young people try their best in them.They follow the rules and the style and take into account thetaste of the judges."  But that, says Bangkok University'sSansern, is one of the problems. "There is simply too muchrivalry in competitions," he argues. "There is another way tobe an artist. They can present their work in an exhibition.That is better than entering a competition." Sansern maintainsthat in the past five years or so, it has become easier tolive as a professional artist in Thailand. "There are moreprivate collectors, institutions and foreign collectors," hesays.As Thailand's budding art scene continues to grow, second-placed Vorakorn says one major incentive is missing. "We stilldon't have a contemporary art gallery in Bangkok," hecomplains. "So there is no place for permanent exhibitions."Until then, Thais will continue to enter competitions - andmost likely win them.- Entries  from the ASEAN Art Awards will be on display in theNational Museum in Kuala Lumpur Oct. 6-31.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996EYEWITNESS: BOOZING BOVINES: A bottle or two of beer are all part of thepampered lifestyles of the cows of Matsusaka from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996The irony about Japan's recent food-poisoning outbreak is thatthe archipelago's inhabitants are generally the mostfastidious farmers, careful cooks and demanding diners in theknown universe.

"Female beef is sweeter," explains farmerNagata Koichi, "and virginal cows are more tender if theyhaven't gone through the struggles of labor." What's more, theheifers are constantly fussed over - especially in terms offeeding, which is astonishingly precise in its timing,quantity and content (hay, soy, vitamins, minerals and beer).The result: meat with the finest of fine threads of fat inbeasts worth up to $18,520 a head.

The 69-year-old politician haslong been proud of that title. "My power will never wane," heonce said.  But a series of recent crises suffered byThackeray seem to belie his boast.The latest setback to the Hindu radical leader was the deathof one of his henchmen, Amar Naik. A powerful mafia boss inBombay, Maharashtra's capital and India's richest city, Naikwas wanted in connection with 28 crimes, including severalmurders. In early August, police gunned down the 47-year-oldgangster as he was driving a stolen car.The Shiv Sena, which rules Maharashtra state with the Hindunationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was angered byNaik's death. An editorial in the official Sena daily, Saamna(Confrontation), called on the police to stop targeting Hindumafia dons and go after Muslim gang lords instead. Itsuggested that Hindu gangs should be allowed to take overBombay's underworld because the city belongs to the Hindumajority.Naik was apparently targeted at the behest of state deputychief minister Gopinath Munde, who belongs to the BJP and isin charge of the local police. According to a BJP member, theparty's high command did not take kindly to Naik's enormouspower and the patronage he received from Thackeray. The BJP isthe main opposition party in India and its regional ally'sassociation with a gang leader was clearly a politicalhandicap.Munde is also said to be behind another problem for Thackeray.In late July, police discovered the body of Ramesh Kini, a 45-year-old Shiv Sena member, in a cinema in Pune, near Bombay.Investigations revealed that the tenants in the Bombaybuilding in which Kini lived had been pressured for years bytheir landlord, Laxmichand Shah, to vacate their flats. Shah,who is a close friend of the Thackeray family, wanted todemolish the building to make way for a larger apartmentblock. Except for Kini, all the other tenants had eitherwillingly left or were forced out.Kini's widow, Sheila, has accused Raj Thackeray, the Senaleader's 33-year-old nephew, of complicity in her husband'sdeath. She alleges that Raj and Thackeray's son, Jaidev, hadthreatened Kini to leave his flat a few days before he died.Raj was questioned by police but has denied any involvement.The Maharashtra government, apparently under pressure fromThackeray, changed the state attorney midway through theinvestigations. Sheila has demanded a federal probe into herhusband's death.The Kini case shot to public prominence after state oppositionleader Chhagan Bhujbal raised the issue in the Maharashtraassembly. Bhujbal, 49, was a Sena member and a confidant ofThackeray until his defection to the Congress party four yearsago. The two politicians have been sworn enemies since then.Says Bhujbal: "There are hundreds of cases against theThackeray family that have been hushed up."Neither Thackeray nor any of his family members hold formalposts in the government, which allows them to wield powerwithout being publicly accountable. Anurag Chaturvedi, aBombay political columnist, says the string of scandalssurrounding the Thackerays point to a steady decline in thepower and public reputation of the Shiv Sena boss. "Two yearsago, it would have been unthinkable for the police to questiona member of the Thackeray family or touch Amar Naik," he says."The myth of Thackeray is being eroded."Dissent from within the Shiv Sena is also brewing. Severalsenior party leaders privately criticize Thackeray for hishigh-handedness. Maharashtra Chief Minister Manohar Joshi, whois a Sena member and owes his position to Thackeray, rarelygoes out of his way now to defend his political mentor. At arecent press conference, Sena member Madhav Deshpandecriticized Thackeray for not holding party elections. "Peopleare appointed at his whim," he said. "I do not want to see theSena committing sati [self-immolation] for the Thackerays."But for all his problems, Thackeray is still one of Bombay'smost powerful leaders. On Aug. 20, Prime Minister H.D. DeveGowda met with Thackeray in Bombay, reportedly to solicit theShiv Sena's support in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh stateassembly elections. The PM wants the Shiv Sena to split fromthe BJP, thereby helping his  United Front Alliance win thestate. For now, Thackeray may be down, but he is definitelynot out.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Nations: Indonesia: A Split Within the Ranks: Jakarta is abuzz with talk ofa military shakeup from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996By Susan Berfield and Keith Loveard JakartaIndonesia's military has been flexing its muscles at home andabroad. Troops patrolled Jakarta's business district withautomatic weapons in the wake of the July 27 rioting, andsecurity forces have since rounded up leading members ofopposition groups. Last week, the armed forces launched itslargest and most complex war games ever: some 19,000 airbornetroops, 50 warships and 41 aircraft are taking part in a 17-day drill in the South China Sea. The site of the exercise isthe waters around the gas-rich Natuna Islands, part of whichBeijing covets.These shows of force, however, have diverted attention fromwhat appears to be a growing and unusually public rift withinthe military, whose political influence is unmatched by anyother national institution. For the past 30 years, the armedforces have underpinned President Suharto's government. AndSuharto in turn has molded the armed forces to meet his ownends. Now, the president is faced with reshaping a dividedmilitary at a crucial time.The army supports the president as always. But that support issplit into emerging factions. "In the old days, the armedforces commander would go to the president and say, `This isour position,' " says a senior officer. "Today there is nosuch thing as a military position, there are only the opinionsof certain officers."The talk in Jakarta is that Suharto, as supreme commander, isplanning a major shakeup. The rumors have prompted authoritiesto issue formal denials. Nevertheless, says politicalscientist Ariwibowo: "Everybody knows that something ishappening within the army."Suharto's first move came on Aug. 15, when he sacked the ArmedForces chief of staff Lt.-Gen. Suyono, who has been at oddswith Armed Forces commander Gen. Feisal Tanjung for some time.Feisal, who ranks second only to the president, may himself bein trouble. Also in danger is the military socio-politicalchief, Lt.-Gen. Syarwan Hamid, who ranks just below Suyono.All three have been criticized for the heavy-handed way thearmy quelled the Jakarta riots.In the background is the presidential succession. Suharto, whowill almost certainly seek another term in 1998, wants amilitary that he can implicitly count on. When he doeseventually step down, he is expected to cede power to someoneselected from within its ranks. That person must be able toprotect the president's family and their business interests.In the meantime, "the military is being transformed into apalace guard for a president facing an uncertain future," saysAustralian analyst Gerry van Klinken of the IndonesiaResources and Information Program in Melbourne.Rival generals are scrambling to secure the high ground. Thetensions center on two pivotal figures: Gen. Feisal and armycommander Gen. Hartono. Each has civilian allies. Feisal isbacked by Research and Technology Minister B.J. Habibie, whois also chairman of the prominent Muslim group known as ICMI.Hartono is backed by Suharto's daughter Siti Hardyanti Rukmana(Tutut), who is a leading official of the ruling Golkar group.One well-connected ex-intelligence officer told Asiaweek: "Thesituation is explosive."For the moment, neither Feisal's nor Hartono's prospects lookpromising. If Feisal is ousted, former Jakarta commander Lt.-Gen. Wiranto is expected to take over, even though Hartonooutranks him. If Feisal stays, Hartono also loses. ComeNovember, when his appointment ends, Hartono could findhimself pushed onto the sidelines.This would be a surprising turnabout for Hartono, given thatsome have said Suharto was grooming him to be the next vice-president, or even president if Suharto decides to step downduring his next term. Influential Muslim leader AbdurrahmanWahid says Tutut virtually endorsed Hartono as the nextpresident during a recent talk to ulamas, or religiousleaders, in East Java. Says Wahid: "She told them `If you wantHartono to be president, by God's will you will have him aspresident.' "Tutut's enthusiasm would seem to bode well for Hartono. Butaccording to a well-connected civil servant, "The backing ofthe president's daughter doesn't necessarily mean that much.Suharto is believed to be far more wary of Hartono than ofFeisal, who is just doing his job."The way the armed forces commander has handled that job,however, has caused friction. The military's violent takeoverof the Democratic Party of Indonesia's headquarters fromsupporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri on July 27, and its toughresponse to the rioting that followed, has alarmed many. "Thearmed forces bared their teeth in a way not seen for sometime," says van Klinken. The cost, he says, is an erosion ofthe military's legitimacy. Even Suharto is thought to bedispleased.What the president will do to show his displeasure, however,is still anybody's guess. Until last week, most believed thatGen. Feisal and Lt.-Gen. Syarwan would be the next casualties.The once-whispered rumors of their downfall were spoken soloudly in Jakarta that top officials have for the first timeissued formal denials. On Aug. 16, State Secretary Murdionosaid that no changes at the top were planned.To many, that denial only confirmed that there was somethingto the speculation. Syarwan later told Asiaweek that highcommand had "heard nothing about [a shakeup]." And then added:"This sort of thing doesn't happen overnight. There is aprocess involved."But when Sudomo, the head of the Supreme Advisory Council anda Suharto confidante, also called the rumors fiction, somefigured Feisal would survive after all. He might even bereincarnated as defense minister. Edi Sudrajat, who currentlyholds that position, would then take over Sudomo's job. AndSudomo would go into graceful retirement.For his part, Lt.-Gen. Syarwan is fighting back. He told agathering of officers in Surabaya Aug. 13 that rumors of asplit within the military were "divide-and-conquer" tacticsused by enemies of the government. "Such political deceptionis being carried out by irresponsible parties," he said.So serious are the divisions at the top, however, that some inthe old guard have broken rank and publicly criticized thecurrent military leadership. Among them are senior retiredmilitary leader Abdul Haris Nasution, one of the founders ofthe modern armed forces, and former Home Minister Rudini. WhenRudini oh-so-gently reminded the military that it owed itsallegiance to the people, not the president, CoordinatingMinister for Politics and Security Susilo Sudarman had toremind the retired officer of the need for unity, at least inpublic.Still, despite the heightened tensions within the ranks, andthe growing calls for a more open political system, themilitary remains the dominant power in Indonesia. "It ishighly likely that the armed forces will influence thepolitical process in Indonesia for several decades," says IanMacFarling, lecturer at the Australian Defense Force Academy.Civilians within Golkar admit that the generals will probablythwart their plan to push Information Minister Harmoko asvice-president. "We have to accept that the military is stilltoo strong," says a member of the Golkar central board. Andall other political institutions are still too weak.The only one with any control over the generals remainsSuharto. He alone chooses who goes and who stays. The questionnow is, how will Suharto shape the military, and to what ends?Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Nations: Taiwan: Remaking the Opposition: The DPP"s new leader takes amoderate tack from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996By Todd Crowell and Laurence Eyton TaipeiThe Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's largest oppositionforce, has fallen on hard times. After fighting two bruisingelections within four months, it has little to show for itsefforts. The DPP's momentum stalled in the legislature pollslast December, and its standard bearer in the island's firstpopular presidential contest in March finished a very distantsecond to the incumbent, Lee Teng-hui of the Kuomintang. Andif morale is low, the party's financial coffers are evenlower: last month, it could not even meet its payrolls.DPP partisans hope these problems can be solved, given alittle time and fresh leadership. But it won't be easy to re-animate the issues that had motivated supporters, not a few ofwhom went to prison for their beliefs. Their backing made theparty Taiwan's fastest-growing political group during theheady days of the early 1990s, when democracy was floweringafter the end of four decades of martial law. Inevitably,perhaps, tensions and divisions have emerged within the ranks,prompting some former stalwarts to set up their own party.The DPP, which holds 51 of the Legislative Yuan's 164 seats,was founded during martial-law days in the 1980s. In the early1990s, it called boldly for Taiwan's political independence.Party leaders also demanded more civil rights for the island'snon-mainlander majority and greater democracy for all. Now, ofcourse, Taiwan is just about fully democratic. An indigenouspolitician occupies the presidency. So the party's ritual callfor independence is looking increasingly like something thatwill bring Taiwan little benefit - and much trouble fromChina.The task of turning the DPP's fortunes around falls to HsuHsin-liang, who was elected chairman in June. He replaced ShihMing-teh, a key member of the party's hardline pro-independence faction. Though Hsu has a longstanding reputationas a dissident - he started his political life with the KMTbut quit the ruling party in 1977 - and has endured exile aswell as a year in prison for his political activities, hehails from the DPP's moderate wing. He wants to reposition theparty as a more liberal, social democratic, "caring"alternative to the government.But first, Hsu has to resolve the DPP's financial crisis. Hesays he wants to reschedule debt, negotiate more loans andraise more money from members. But the DPP may in fact bebanking on government funding of political groups. Hsu isasking that all parties receive an annual subsidy of NT$100($3.60) for every vote they won in the last election. "Rightnow the situation is unfair," he says. "The KMT has all itscorporate wealth. The other parties have nothing."Given the Kuomintang's majority - albeit a narrow one - in theLegislative Yuan, the chances of the opposition pushingthrough a political funding bill would seem slim. Yet Hsu hassome leverage. The ruling party is seeking bipartisan supportto break the gridlock that has characterized the currentlegislative session. KMT secretary-general Wu Poh-hsiungcalled on Hsu recently to seek the opposition chief'scooperation in passing laws. Hsu's precondition: that hisparty obtain some relief from its financial problems.Hsu denies that he is selling DPP support in return forpassage of the political-financing measure. Rather, he saysthat more cooperation, rather than confrontation, would be agood thing at this stage. "What I want to see is somethinglike the National Government in Britain during World War II,where all parties worked together in the face of a bigcrisis," Hsu explains. "We have many historical problems, suchas threats from China. The KMT itself is immobilized by itsown money politics and links with gangsters. Given this, onlya coalition can carry out reforms Taiwan needs."But Hsu's call for enhanced cooperation across the benches hasalienated some of the DPP's purists. One is its formerpresidential candidate, Peng Ming-min, who has already left toform his own Nation-Building Party, which is more aggressivelypro-independence. He and other dissenters claim that there islittle difference now between the KMT's position of"reunification - sometime" and the Hsu-led DPP's call for"independence - but not yet." Still, by couching the issue invague terms, both are probably in tune with the great majorityof Taiwan's people.Hsu thinks that his opponents within the party may be fightingyesterday's battles. "We can't consider the KMT a `colonial'regime anymore after the presidential election in which LeeTeng-hui got more than 50% of the vote. The whole politicalenvironment has changed fundamentally, and our party has toadjust." He hints at the prospect of putting on the backburner the DPP's core issue - independence. If the party wereto gain power, Hsu suggests, it might not proceed with itslong-promised plebiscite on the matter, at least notimmediately.Still, the DPP faces the difficult challenge of coming backfrom the political wilderness to regain a cutting-edgerelevance among voters. In an evolving, increasinglysophisticated Taiwan, continuing to wave the banner ofindependence may not be the way to do that. Hsu is counting ondoing better with his new emphasis on a "caring society."Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Nations: Thailand: A Gateway to Vietnam: Thais debate where next to bridgethe Mekong from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996Nakhon Phanom is at the end of the road. A sleepy Thai bordertown on the banks of the muddy Mekong river, it is a placewhere opportunity is mostly elsewhere. When young peoplegraduate from school, they generally head to dingy employmentoffices to sign up for work in Bangkok or West Asia.Otherwise, things move slowly. On a recent afternoon, a queuefor the ferry to Laos consisted of five vehicles. One driverhad just missed the boat. No matter. He would sleep patientlyin his cab until morning.But Nakhon Phanom won't remain the stereotypical backwater forlong, at least not if Santi Kowabootr gets his way. Four yearsago, the town's self-appointed savior cottoned on to aninescapable fact: the city is a potential gateway to Vietnamand, most crucially, the South China Sea port at Vinh, 338 kmaway. Even back then, there was talk of upgrading the mostlydirt road across Laos. Santi, a liquor store owner and busfleet operator, saw a bridge across the Mekong as the missinglink and resolved to get one built."Right now we can trade with Laos only," Santi says, as hedrives his car along dusty red roads to the site of theproposed span. "There are not many people in Laos, with apopulation of 4.8 million. But with a connection to northVietnam, we have a market of 32 million." Links are alreadygrowing. Trade between Thailand and Vietnam in 1995 reachedabout $500 million, or 0.5% of Thailand's world trade, up from$142 million in 1991.Fellow residents are skeptical, but Santi has one veryimportant reason to be optimistic: Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. Thedeputy prime minister wants a bridge there too, and as apossible contender for the top job in the next Thaigovernment, he may help Santi get his way. Two years ago,Chavalit gave up his constituency outside Bangkok for NakhonPhanom. The populous northeast is a valuable vote bank for awould-be premier. Since the switch, Chavalit has been curryingfavor with the locals, building roads, hospitals and now - hehopes - a bridge.Not so fast. A hundred kilometers downstream, the town eldersof Mukdahan are lobbying hard for their own span, and theyhave strong political backing too. The interest isunderstandable since the stakes - and opportunities - arehuge. The Mekong is the world's 12th-longest and arguablyleast developed major waterway. The river's resource-richbasin is also home to 229 million people, a market that oneday could rival Europe.Who will pay for the infrastructure needs in the largelyunderdeveloped region? That has yet to be worked out, butthere have been some encouraging signs. Under the aegis of theAsian Development Bank (ADB), plans for some $22 billion worthof roads, rails, dams and airports have been hatched for theriver basin. And last week, delegates from the six Mekongnations of China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia andVietnam met in the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming forthe latest in a string of meetings held since 1992. Theneighbors are trying hard to cooperate. Their challenge is tofind a mutually beneficial strategy to develop a complex andfragile region that until recently was best-known for junglefirefights and khaki commerce.Nakhon Phanom and Mukdahan are competing to be the firstcommercial hub of what the ADB calls the East-West Corridorfrom Thailand through Laos to Vietnam. Four new routes areplanned along existing (and largely unpaved) roads: Routes 8,9, 12 and 18 (see map, opposite). Once open, they will providemajor opportunities for trade between Thailand and Vietnam, aswell as give landlocked Laos access to the sea. If the morestarry-eyed planners have their way, new asphalt could one dayrun clear through Myanmar, shaving hours or days off thejourney from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean.It is easy to see why Santi is in love with the idea of abridge. "Developing a trade route to Vietnam is not onlyimportant for Nakhon Phanom," he says. "It is also importantfor the whole of northeast Thailand." The problem is thatBangkok-centric politicians and business types have longignored Isan, as the impoverished region is known.With prosperity around the corner, Isan residents rarely talkabout what is good for Laos - and Vientiane's aging socialistshave noticed. Only now emerging from decades of economicisolation, Laos has been wary of opening up to foreigninfluences too quickly. Sandwiched between two powerfulneighbors bent on expanding bilateral trade, the Laotians holdsome good cards, and they are no longer shying away from thegaming table. Last month, Vientiane announced that before theend of the year tourists and business people will be able toobtain visas on arrival. Local residents on both sides of theMekong can now move relatively freely across the border. Andin an important breakthrough, Laos indicated at a recent ADBtransport forum that it was considering fully opening itsborders.Even so, cross-river commerce promises to be complicated, atleast in the short run. Under one scenario, Thai trucks wouldhave to unload in Laos once they have crossed the Mekong fromNakhon Phanom. Laotian or Vietnamese carriers would take overfrom there. Impractical yes, but in theory all partiesbenefit. Such an arrangement would help Laotians believe theircountry was not merely a Thai highway.Eventually, Thai and Laotian goods could be shipped fromVietnamese ports. This would be an incalculable boon totraders based in Nakhon Phanom. One wood exporter now sendsLaotian logs to Bangkok, then on to Singapore, where finallythey sail to the U.S. With a new road, says the firm'sexpatriate manager, "We would only be faced with a short tripto a deep-sea port in Vietnam and then we could ship direct tothe States."The north Vietnam market - and the Laotians' demand for ashort Vientiane-to-Vietnam route - make Nakhon Phanom a strongcontender. With construction on Route 8 expected to finishwithin a year, Vietnam-bound Thai goods may soon roll throughLaos. But a bridge at Nakhon Phanom is probably not on theimmediate horizon. Pramaul Khuntri, proprietor of theoptimistically named Windsor Hotel, is candidly pessimistic:"It could take as much as five years," she says. Or longer.After the Friendship Bridge linking the northern Thai town ofNong Khai with Vientiane was completed in 1994, plannersturned to other potential sites, and Mukdahan, not NakhonPhanom, was touted as the best place to start.Politics played a part in making the town the frontrunner. Onelocal MP is a Democrat and the bridge was greenlighted whenparty leader Chuan Leekpai was prime minister. As well, theLaotian finance minister hails from Savannakhet, on the Laoside of the river. And ADB officials insist that there arepractical reasons for Mukdahan getting a bridge before itsupstream rival. "They're constantly having to dredge the riverto allow ferries to cross [at Mukdahan]," says Preben Nielsen,an ADB economist. During the dry season, passage is even morearduous.Moreover, Mukdahan is fast emerging as a trading hub. Perhaps200 trucks cross by ferry each day, and last year the townexported some $71 million worth of goods to Laos and Vietnam.By contrast, Nakhon Phanom exports amounted to some $24million, and most went to Laos. On the agenda at last week'sKunming meeting was an upgrade of Route 9, which runs throughLaos from Savannakhet (opposite Mukdahan) to link with theVietnamese port at Danang. Barring delays, an all-weatherRoute 9 will open in 2003; the bridge in 2001.The boosters of a span for Nakhon Phanom are hardly giving up.One of their oft-cited arguments is that their town is 154 kmcloser by road to Vietnamese ports than is Mukdahan. Inaddition to Route 8, there are also plans to upgrade Route 12,which would provide a direct link to a new Vietnamese port atVung Ang, south of Vinh. But the upgrade will take time. Route12 is still a dirt track, and a hilly one at that.A bridge at Nakhon Phanom seems inevitable - especially sincethe Laotians are eager for Route 8, which would provideVientiane's new capitalists quick access to ports at Vinh andVung Ang. And Thai officials and ADB planners insist that thequestion is not if, but when.Standing at the site of the planned bridge outside NakhonPhanom, Santi gazes across at the verdant, unspoiled hills ofLaos. Even he finds it is hard to imagine a four-lane highwayand bridge cutting through this idyllic spot where waterbuffalo currently outnumber cargo trucks. He chuckles: "IfChavalit becomes prime minister he can build a bridge atNakhon Phanom tomorrow or next year. If not, maybe we won'thave a bridge for 10 years." Not surprisingly, the town has abackup plan: more ferries. Which would mean more trucks. Evenwithout a bridge, Nakhon Phanom could well vault past itsrival.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Nations: Philippines: "Just and Lasting Peace": What the president wantsfor Mindanao from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996Fidel Ramos first met MNLF leader Nur Misuari when then-president Corazon Aquino forged a ceasefire with the Muslimseparatists in Sulu in September 1986. At the time, Ramos wasAquino's armed forces chief, in charge of crushing theinsurgency. Last week, Misuari signed an accord to bring anend to the 24-year-long war. President Ramos recently talkedwith Senior Correspondent Antonio Lopez about his hopes forpeace in the region. Excerpts:What is the Southern Philippine Council for Peace andDevelopment?The SPCPD is not a regional government. It is not a governingauthority. It has no lawmaking power. It has no power overlocal government units. Neither will it have control over thelocal police and military. The SPCPD is neither an autonomousregion nor a political subdivision of government. It is simplya transitory administrative arm under the control andsupervision of the president. Its powers and functions are anextension of the powers of the president.What is your vision for Mindanao?Our vision for Mindanao is three-fold: First, to remove fromthe southern Philippines the roots of dissidence, injustice,and inequity which gave rise to separatist movements,rebellions and the 25-year-old condition of instability.Second, we foresee Mindanao as a very progressive social,economic and political component of the Philippines. Mindanaohas certain advantages in terms of its proximity to the moreprogressive countries of ASEAN, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia,Singapore and Brunei. The third aspect consists of bringing upall of the people of Mindanao - Christians, Muslims, andLumads or indigenous people - to a level of developmentalready achieved by many, many Filipinos in the Visayas and inLuzon, so that together, all Filipinos can be trulycompetitive in the 21st century.Why did you negotiate a deal with Misuari?On day one of my administration, I called on radicalinsurgents to give up their armed struggle. Our goal is ajust, comprehensive, peaceful and lasting resolution of theinternal armed conflict that has cost the nation and ourpeople so dearly.What do you think of Misuari?He is not an ordinary revolutionary. He is a man with astatesmanlike vision to perform his mission for his people. Hehas gone through the various stages of armed struggle, but nowI see him turning to a peaceful, legal, constitutionalstruggle through elections. I also see him as a very deep-thinking intellectual who is also pragmatic, in that he cannegotiate and be flexible in order to forge a solution to avery difficult and complex problem. Lastly, I see him as avery admirable leader. He has not veered from his cause tobring Muslims in the Philippines a better life.What happens to the three other separatist groups, the MoroIslamic Liberation Front, the Islamic Command Council and theAbu Sayyaf?We will continue to work with the MILF with regard to aceasefire. Talk of a ceasefire has been going on for quitesome time. I am optimistic about these talks. The ICC and theAbu Sayyaf are different. They first have to forgo violenceand terrorism.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Nations: Philippines: The Anatomy of a Deal: How Ramos"s government andMuslim rebels made peace in Mindanao from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996By Tim Healy and Antonio Lopez ManilaBack in 1968, Nur Misuari was not much for niceties. The 27-year-old student firebrand staged a nine-day protest in frontof Malaca-ang Palace demanding the ouster of then-presidentFerdinand Marcos. Not long after, he barged uninvited intoMarcos's office to seek - successfully, as it turned out - therelease from prison of an ailing Muslim rebel leader.Last week, Misuari was back in Malaca-ang, but undersubstantially different circumstances. The rebel chief of theMoro National Liberation Front was the star at the dramaticsigning Sept. 2 of a peace accord with President Fidel Ramos'sgovernment, ending a 24-year rebellion on the southern islandof Mindanao.Some 120,000 people - half from the ranks of the MNLF - havedied in the secessionist struggle. The government has spent atleast $3 billion prosecuting the war. Misuari told Asiaweek:"The first time I came to Malaca-ang was for the cause of oneman's freedom; the second time is for the cause of peace."Replied Ramos: "Today we are all victors - triumphant over warand violence."Ramos and Misuari, one a West Point military man who rose tobecome president, the other a former university professor andonetime Maoist, could hardly say enough good things about eachother. Ramos's eyes moistened as Misuari asked the 1,500guests at the signing to rise in the president's honor."Without your boldness and heroism, we would not have reachedthis far," said the rebel to the president.Both men have a sizable stake in the accord. Neither ofRamos's two predecessors, Marcos or Corazon Aquino, were ableto achieve a permanent peace, despite years of effort. Ramoshad to overcome opposition from the Christian majorities insouthern Mindanao, who do not trust the MNLF or Misuari. Ramoshopes to win them over with his economic development plans forthe region (see interview, p. 22).For Misuari, who founded the MNLF in 1968, signing meantsettling for something short of his original goal of self-government. During the negotiations, which began in Jakarta inOctober 1993, Misuari frequently came under attack fromcompatriots who said he was selling out. "I was tiptoeing onbarbed wire," he recalls.The treaty creates a Special Zone of Peace and Developmentencompassing 14 provinces and nine cities. Overseeingdevelopment in the area will be the Southern PhilippineCouncil for Peace and Development (SPCPD), to be headed byMisuari or a hand-picked ally. The five-member council, whichcomes under the Office of the President, will not havelawmaking powers, but will be able to channel much-neededdevelopment funds to the region. After three years, the memberprovinces and cities will be asked to vote on a fullyautonomous government.As part of the deal, Ramos's Lakas-NUCD party is backingMisuari in the Sept. 9 election for governor of the AutonomousRegion for Muslim Mindanao. The ARMM comprises the four small,mostly Muslim provinces that chose autonomy in a 1989plebiscite.During the three years of formal talks, Manila and the MNLFclashed over what kind of administrative system should beinstalled in southern Mindanao. Misuari originally demanded a10-year provisional government; Manila's chief negotiator,retired four-star Gen. Manuel Yan, offered one year. Misuaricompromised on five years and Manila came up to two. The talksstalled at that point. Then, Libya and Indonesia intervened toget negotiations back on track. Indonesia was especiallyhelpful, says Ramos. At the signing ceremony, the presidentlauded the Indonesian delegation as "the best negotiators inthe world." Misuari and Yan eventually settled on a three-yeartransitional council.But what form would the council take? In 1994 and 1995, thetwo sides agreed on 123 items, including how MNLF forces wouldbe integrated into the Philippine military. But they could notsettle on a structure for the transitional body. Misuariobjected to a plebiscite, which the Muslims could lose in theChristian areas, but Manila insisted that the Constitutionrequired a vote. Talks recessed at the end of 1995.Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas credits Ramos for thebreakthrough: "It was President Ramos's idea for the Councilfor Peace and Development that broke the deadlock." Theproposal, which actually originated with Ramos's chief ofstaff, Ruben Torres, was to create a non-elected governmentbody or regional development council, already authorized bythe Constitution.Senior Indonesian diplomat Wiryono Sastrohandojo sold the ideato the MNLF. Barging into a private meeting, he told therebels: "The SPCPD will have powers derived from the Office ofthe President. It is derivative power, but power just thesame. What is important is you will have money fordevelopment." Eventually, the MNLF agreed.Now it is up to Misuari to make it work. Not all Muslim groupshave signed on. The foremost holdouts are the 15,000-strongMoro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the 500-man AbuSayyaf terrorist group. Misuari believes he can win over thefirst: "I maintain contacts with my brothers in the MILF." Andthe other? "The only problem is the Abu Sayyaf. I will try toreach out to them to convince them to join us in thisexperiment." After 24 years of bloodshed, Filipinos can onlyhope that he will succeed.- With additional reporting from Keith Loveard/JakartaCopyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Editorials: JUST DO IT: Japan should cut the excuses and legalize the pillfrom ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996When oral contraceptives were developed in the 1960s, Japan'sgovernment banned them, saying they had unhealthy side effectsand promoted sexual promiscuity. With the advent of the low-dosage pill, another pretext was needed - and convenientlyfound in the spread of AIDS. Legalizing the pill, of course,might discourage the use of protective condoms. When thatargument began to wear thin, Japanese health officialsdiscovered another excuse in a claim by a British medicaljournal that oral contraceptives might be slightly conduciveto blood clotting.One way or another, Japan's guardians of public health andmorals have found reasons to limit the birth-control choicesof its women. As a result, Japan shares the dubiousdistinction, with North Korea, of being the only countries toproscribe the sale of oral contraceptives. Only in recentmonths have there been signs that Tokyo might considerchanging course and legalizing the pill. What Japaneseauthorities should do, as soon as possible, is to wind up theendless debate - and just do it.A key catalyst has been the appointment of a new health andwelfare minister. Unlike his predecessors, Mr. Kan Naoto seemsinclined to listen more to consumers than to special-interestgroups. That suggests change may finally be at hand. Indeed,an ethos is emerging in Japan that citizens, rather thanbureaucrats, should be their own guardians. However,formidable opposition remains. Some health officials seem tohave gone out of their way to undercut their minister'sreformist positions. More pertinently, powerful commercialinterests object to legalization.Chief among them are the country's condom-makers, whoobviously want to forestall competition from the pill. WithJapan the world's top consumer of prophylactics, they ply alucrative trade. Aligned with them are the nation'sphysicians, who think that the unrestricted sale of the pillwould cut into their highly profitable abortion practices. Thedoctors, overwhelmingly male, are organized by the JapanMedical Association. Longtime supporters of the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party, they exert considerable influence on thepolicymaking process.Their maneuvers have not been balanced by any strong movementto legalize the pill by women's organizations or familyplanners. In Japan, unwanted pregnancies is hardly a burningissue. In fact, the nation worries more about its fallingbirthrate, which some people think is the real, if unstated,reason that the government has been reluctant to legalize thepill. By some estimates, only 10% of women would choose thepill over other methods if it were made legitimate - thougheven that would be a big boost from the 1% now using it undera legal loophole.If there is no clamor to legalize the pill, why do it? Thereare several good reasons. The unavailability of oralcontraceptives is one factor behind Japan's unusually highabortion rate. About 350,000 women choose to abort every year,most of them because of unwanted pregnancies rather thaneconomic pressures or fear of giving birth to a malformedchild. There are virtually no legal barriers to abortion and,on the surface at least, few religious or moral strictureseither.But abortions are cause for deep personal disquiet in Japan,as they are anywhere else. The evidence lies in the thousandsof tiny statues to "water babies" - memorials to abortedfetuses - that dot the nation's cemeteries. And thoughabortions are performed by licensed practitioners, the surgeryis not entirely without risk. By encouraging more abortionsthan would otherwise be performed, the restrictions on thepill add unnecessarily to the health hazards facing Japanesewomen.Moreover, about 200,000 women use oral contraceptives under aloophole that allows doctors to prescribe them as a means ofregulating menstrual disorders. Yet the only one permitted isthe old-style high-dosage, high-hormone variety. That meansthe women who really are using the pill only to avoidconception are also subjected to risks unnecessarily. Japan isa major contributor to family planning organizations aroundthe world. By banning in its domestic market one of the mostcommonly used methods of contraception, Tokyo lays itself opento charges that it callously dumps pharmaceuticals indeveloping countries that it considers "dangerous" at home.Even so, the most powerful argument is that legalizing thepill gives women additional control over their ownreproductive lives. In the three decades since the advent oforal contraceptives, the world has had ample time tounderstand that their benefits far outweigh theirdisadvantages. The decision on whether to use them should restwith individual citizens. Japanese authorities have run out ofexcuses.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Editorials: JUDGING THE PAST: Nascent democracies must beware the perils ofscore-settling from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996Mr. Paul Bell, a South African journalist, likes to recall howhe once bumped into Rev. Desmond Tutu in a shopping mall.Almost without thinking, he thrust his young daughter into thebishop's arms. "Please bless my child," asked Mr. Bell. Rev.Tutu readily complied. "I couldn't tell you why I did that,"says Mr. Bell. "I just wanted my child to have thatbeneficence bestowed on her." Actually, his instinctiveresponse is entirely understandable. Rev. Tutu's ethicalstature makes nearly irresistible the opportunity to receivehis blessing. The Nobel Peace Prizewinner has been chairingSouth Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, whichserves as both confessor to sinners in the nation's pastapartheid brutality as well as therapist to its victims.Note well the touchstones of Rev. Tutu's organization: truthand reconciliation. Then consider the recent court verdict inSouth Korea, in which two former presidents, tried at thebehest of their onetime political ally, President Kim YoungSam, were convicted of treason and manslaughter. Mr. Chun DooHwan was sentenced to death, and Mr. Roh Tae Woo to more thantwo decades in jail. And think about developments inBangladesh, where the government of Sheikh Hasina Wajed hasimplicated the slain husband of the prime minister's chiefpolitical rival after a vigorous inquiry into the 1975assassination of her father, founding PM Mujibur Rahman. Itseems unlikely Mr. Kim or Sheikh Hasina will be asked to blessbabies anytime soon.With the onset of democratic reform, governments around theworld are faced with the question of how to deal with unsavorypasts. Take Eastern Europe. Shortly after Romania threw outcommunism in 1989, the nation's new leaders tried, convictedand executed Nicolae Ceausescu for crimes committed during his24-year reign of terror. Ex-dissident Vaclav Havel chose agentler approach when he became president of the CzechRepublic. He advocated that those convicted of past human-rights abuses be barred from civil service jobs.The line between justice and vengeance can be fine indeed.After Mrs. Corazon Aquino became president of the Philippines,many expected Mrs. Imelda Marcos to be nailed by a probe intothe 1983 assassination of Mr. Benigno ("Ninoy") Aquino. Mrs.Aquino had long contended that President Ferdinand Marcos andhis wife were behind her husband's dramatic murder at Manilaairport. But the rule of law prevailed. Mrs. Marcos wascleared for lack of incriminating evidence. By accepting thecourt ruling, Mrs. Aquino refuted allegations that she wasbent on a personal vendetta.It would, of course, have been understandable if Mrs. Aquinowanted to avenge her husband's murder. Similarly, SheikhHasina's zeal to gain justice for her father - even in theface of a constitutional provision granting pardon to theperpetrators - might be excused in different circumstances.But Mrs. Aquino was bound by a higher standard to allow thePhilippine judicial system to determine Mrs. Marcos's guilt orinnocence. In the same way, the Bangladesh Constitution is nota document to be changed at the whim of an incumbent primeminister, however personally wronged.In the quest to determine how to deal with transgressions fromthe past, a society must take the law as its starting point.And if statutes are found inadequate or outdated, they shouldbe changed through legally constituted channels - but notapplied retroactively. Above all, legal justice must bedispensed evenly, not shaped to scoop up specific victims. Itis not a tool to be used by those in power.This will surely have occurred to President Kim. He isconstitutionally barred from seeking a second term when hiscurrent one expires in 1998. That means he will soon be in asimilar position to Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh, before their arrestslate last year. He might hope that his successor is more thana friend, for his own friendship with Mr. Roh counted forlittle during the latter's travails. Korea may need a newpresident who is willing to take on a system that condonesillegal activities such as bribe-taking, rather than simplygunning for individual bribe-takers and ignoring thefundamental problem. In short, the country needs someoneunlike Mr. Kim.What would such an approach mean for the hundreds ofdemonstrators killed in Kwangju 16 years ago? Should no one inpower be held accountable? Can the living forgive on behalf ofthe dead? The simple answers are yes, there should beaccountability, and no, forgiveness cannot be bestowed inabsentia. If he pardons the two ex-rulers, Mr. Kim is likelyto come in for much criticism. But, for a number of importantreasons, that would be the right thing to do.Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh have been rightly tagged with seriouswrongdoings - truths recorded for posterity. But blame foreven the worst offenses rarely rests on just one person. Whowere Mr. Chun's accomplices in the Kwangju crackdown, and towhat extent were they involved? And how many, actually, werekilled? The trial failed to shed light on these key aspects,squandering perhaps a historic opportunity to do so. If thegovernment had established such truths, it would have donemuch more to put the incident to rest than by staging a trialwhose outcome always seemed predetermined.Then there are practical considerations. Pursuing truth andjustice may mean a chance to lay ghosts to rest through apublic catharsis. But what about the costs? If the UnitedStates had not intervened in 1986 to spirit Mr. Marcos out ofMalaca-ang Palace to Hawaii, civil war could have erupted inthe Philippines. Those who wanted to hold Marcos fullyaccountable for abuses under martial-law rule were denied theopportunity to punish him accordingly. But consider the gains:large-scale conflict was averted, the strongman was gone forgood - and a popular uprising succeeded, without sheddingblood.In the wake of the South Korean verdict, Myanmar's rulingjunta must be wondering whether it would ever be smart to cedepower, even incrementally, to democrats without a bloodyfight. Similar thoughts must have occurred to close associatesof Indonesia's Suharto family while contemplating theconsequences if their benefactor ever lost politicalauthority. Vengeful score-settling only reinforces the naturalreluctance of autocrats to share power or undertake democraticreform. And while the Kwangju survivors have no realobligation to consider how their pursuit of justice mightaffect others, it is the responsibility of elected leaders,like Mr. Kim, to do so. Besides, every system of governmenthas its winners and losers. It would be inimical to a nation'sstability as well as its broader interests if new winners wereconstantly to re-evaluate those they replaced, turning theirpredecessors into new losers - a vicious cycle.In the end, governments must always keep their attentionfocused more on the present and the future than on the past.Bangladesh has one of Asia's lowest per-capita GDPs and facessuch monumental challenges as feeding its people, developingviable industries and raising literacy levels. Can it affordto have its leaders doggedly pursuing decades-oldassassinations? In South Korea, the rampant corruption thathelped fell Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh highlighted longstandingmalpractices. The Seoul government would more productivelyspend its energy and resources tackling their root causes thanpursuing further redress for past wrongs. As Rev. Tutu wouldprobably agree, once the truth has been established, a nationshould move on to reconciliation. Down that path liesprogress.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Passage: UNDER ARREST: Rear-Admiral Lu Li-kang, in his early 50s; forcorruption... from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996UNDER ARREST: Rear-Admiral Lu Li-kang, in his early 50s; forcorruption; revealed by the Defense Ministry; in Taipei Sept.2.

It is the environmentally safe way toavoid dangerous encounters with sharks without having to killthem. Developed by South Africa's Natal Sharks Board, thebattery-powered POD costs a little less than $1,000 andconsists of three parts. The main section is strapped to adiver's aqualung, the pad to one of the fins, and the controlis hand-held. The POD unit functions by generating an ultra-mild electrical current that works against sensors in ashark's snout which normally pick up the electrical emissionsof prey. The device creates a sort of force field around thediver, repelling a shark from a distance of four to sevenmeters. Though the POD works well for recreational divers, itis probably more useful as a tool for researchers who want tomingle with the beasts. It was successfully tested by twodocumentary film makers swimming with sharks in tanks as wellas in the open sea. The Natal Sharks Board is working onadapting the units for swimmers, surfboards, canoes and evenlifejackets.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996Update: Justice Delayed: The year 1984 was one of great upheaval for Indiafrom ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996The year 1984 was one of great upheaval for India.

Both sides are making cautiouslyconciliatory statements in public. Early last month, ChineseForeign Minister Qian Qichen in-vited the Democrats toparticipate in the Selection Committee, a 400-strong bodywhose responsibility is to choose Hong Kong's first post-1997chief executive and provisional legislature. Though theirreply was no, the Democrats said they were willing to hold adialogue with Beijing on other transition issues. Qian saidfine, but stressed that joining the Committee would improvethe atmosphere.The mood is already much better. Party sources say thatpreparations are already under way for two of the group'sstalwarts, chairman Martin Lee Chu Ming (pictured) and vice-chairman Yeung Sum, to travel to Beijing in the near future.Apparently, both sides have agreed in principle to such atrip. Indeed, the buzz in the territory is that a rankingmember of the party has already been to the Chinese capital.The Democrats have little problem with the Selection Committeepicking Hong Kong's future leader, but the party has long saidit will not participate in the entire process because itconsiders the interim lawmaking assembly illegal. Beijing'slatest compromise proposal to the Democrats is: join theCommittee and abstain from voting on the provisionallegislature - so long as you do not openly continue to opposeits creation. With public opinion in Hong Kong runningstrongly in favor of Democratic participation in the selectionbody, the party faces a tough - and potentially divisive -decision.Copyright 1996 Asiaweek LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAWEEK                                      via NewsNetSeptember 13, 1996NEWSMAP: INVESTMENT: CITIC Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of China"s topstate investment... from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996INVESTMENT CITIC Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of China'stop state investment  company, is teaming up with Pirelli SpAof Italy to establish a power and telecommunications cablemanufacturing and installation business in China.

Her peace-through-war strategy hascaused innumerable sufferings to the Tamil civilians of thenorth and east of Sri Lanka. Her willingness to gloss overthis human tragedy and to let the Sri Lankan armed forcesprosecute the war with unparalleled brutality and impunity hasonly deepened the ethnic chasm in Sri Lanka.The latest Amnesty International report on Sri Lanka slams hergovernment for its tolerance of continuing human rightsabuses. Perhaps, president Kumaratunga should reevaluate herconcept of human rights and justice for the sake ofalleviating the misery of thousands and thousands of innocentSri Lankans.E. S. Anton, Ph.D.New Haven, Conn.U.S.A.Ron Gluckman had erroneously failed to record PresidentChandrika Kumaratunga's determination to restore civilian lifeand rehabilitate the war-ravaged North. In June, the Presidentunveiled an ambitious plan to raise money from foreigncountries to restore the Jaffna region. The plan envisages therebuilding of roads, re-equipping of schools, creation offarms, restoration of postal and telecommunications services,and so forth. The plan is expected to cost about $274 million.But equally determined are the Tamil Tigers to sabotage therehabilitation work  as demonstrated when a suicide bomberkilled 23 and injured 60 others including the Minister forConstruction.P.A. SamaraweeraDarwin, AustraliaPrabhakaran, Cont'dSachi Sri Kantha's observations [LETTERS, Aug. 16] amused me agreat deal. That Anthony Davis did "a good profile" ofPrabhakaran hinges on what was intended. Reading between thelines, the aims and goals of transnational "Tiger Inc." areviolence, murder and sudden death. I do not think the articlewould have earned the ire of the Sri Lankan government inparticular. They would have welcomed it.Mr. Sri Kantha latches on to the statement, "Prabhakaran'sacumen is as much that of a CEO as of a military commander."One is reminded of a GI's comment about General "Blood andGuts" Patton: "His guts and our blood."Mr. Sri Kantha must have a very fertile imagination to claimthat the profile of Prabhakaran differs but little from thoseof George Washington, Mao, Begin and Arafat. As far as Beginis concerned, the parallel seems correct. It would be aninsult to the others and to Nelson Mandela to associate themwith Prabhakaran.Mr. Sri Kantha has failed to mention the true Asianrevolutionary, Ho Chi Minh, whose thesis was to "work thesocialist revolution through the nationalist aspirations" ofthe people. And in Ho's lexicon, nationalism was not theracist dogma that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has inits lessons of indoctrination to very young students or in theoath of hate taken at the commencement of daily parades.How can he compare the military spending of the LTTE with thatof the Sri Lankan government? The government of Sri Lanka is alegitimately elected government, whereas the LTTE's is, defacto, a rogue or outlaw organization. If, as Mr. Sri Kanthamaintains, the LTTE embodies the genuine aspirations of theSri Lanka Tamils, why is it then that they have dungeons inwhich those thought to be opponents, and those who haverefused to contribute in kind or in money under coercion, areincarcerated and tortured? Amnesty International hasdocumented evidence of this as have the University Teachersfor Human Rights (Jaffna).Cuda BibileCarlingford, New South WalesAustraliaMahathir for the U.N.I would like to bring your attention to the fact that formerUnited Nations Secretary General U Thant of Burma was not acabinet minister as you mentioned. ["The Asian Factor in theU.N. Race," FRONTLINES, Aug. 23]. He was merely a parliamentsecretary in the Ministry of Information in the government ofthe late U Nu, the last elected civilian prime minister ofBurma. In 1952 U Thant became a Burmese delegate to the U.N.and five years later became the country's permanentrepresentative.You also forgot to mention the most outstanding potentialcandidate, one who is capable of doing the job of SecretaryGeneral efficiently, with a proven record of building thenation to prosperity: PM Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia.Dr. Ko-Ko AungBukit MertajamMalaysiaWhat Comes after Having It AllI refer to "How to Know You Have It All" [NATIONS, Sept. 6].As a Singapore citizen who had worked his guts out and cameclose to karoshi [a Japanese term for sudden death fromoverwork] through his 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s, to eventuallyattain the 5Cs [Cash or career; Credit cards, Car, Condo,Country club membership] cleanly (no mortgage or other debt),I wonder whether young Singaporeans are aware that what comesafter they have made the 5Cs are the 5 Ds: Decay (hair andteeth), Disability (worsening myopia, arthritis, etc.),Disease (clogging of arteries, cancer, gout), Depression(boredom from not working) and finally Death.There is more. When you have finally attained the last D, youhave a choice of the 3Es: `Eaven (heaven), `Ell (hell) orExtinction (if you do not believe in the first two Es).Mike Chan, 55SingaporeCORRECTION  Our story "The Billionaires' Binge" [BUSINESS,Aug. 23] mistakenly said that Singapore's Fraser and Neave hasCoca-Cola bottling franchises in Myanmar, among otherSoutheast Asian countries.

It ruled the company, whichproduces electronic parts and components, was not obliged to compensateher because it had been entitled to terminate her employment after shehad been absent for more than six months.Five years after beginning work at the plant, Mrs Mayuree suffered bodypain and headaches. Tests at Chiang Mai's McCormic Hospital establishedshe had been exposed to chemical poisoning.Some 13 workers have died of suspected chemical poisoning in Lamphun butthe Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand contends they died of Aids.After the verdict, a tearful Mrs Mayuree said she would appeal. MrPraphan, her husband, said the family had accumulated more than 300,000baht in medical bills.He said his family was waging a lone battle against a big corporation.None of their neighbours, who work at the estate, dared lend them supportfor fear of losing their jobs.The authority is cooperating with the SSPA Maritime Consulting Co ofSweden on an environmental risk assessment in electronics plants at theLamphun estate.The study, funded by Sweden's International Development CooperationAgency, aims to identify the risks so appropriate safety measures can beintroduced. Factories will assist the study.Ingemar Palsson, of SSPA, said the assessment is focusing on factors thatmay have adverse effects on workers. After the assessment, he said,safety measures would be introduced.Mr Palsson said safety measures must comply with legal standards and mustbe acceptable to the workforce.Environmental risks in the electronics industry mostly concern solder andcleaning work. Soldering, which involves melting lead to connectelectronic components on circuit boards, produces toxic fumes that areextremely hazardous to health. Cleaning involves solvents that are alsotoxic.Kasemsri Homchean, director of the authority's Environment and SafetyControl Division, confirmed that the assessments would be carried outsoon but said it was up to factories to decide if they were to adoptprescribed measures.Factories that adopt the recommendations would manage their ownenvironmental management performance, he said. It could be a steppingstone towards environmental management under ISO 14000, he added.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Help sought in condo scamfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01Over a hundred people in Pathum Thani are in debt to Siam City Bank forfailing to make mortgage payments for condominium units they did not buy.They sought help yesterday from the Office of Civil Rights Protection andLegal Aid.One of them, Arunee Vijitkraisri, 55, said the bank is demanding that sherepay a loan plus 19% annual interest, adding up to 476,107 baht.Otherwise it will ask the court to confiscate the unit she is alleged tohave bought at Maitreekij Estate Co's MT Condominium in Thanyaburi.But Mrs Arunee said she did not buy the condo or apply for a mortgagefrom the bank.She said she had been told by a broker, Somchai Kulhiransawat, that shewould be paid 2,000 baht by Maitreekij Estate Co for helping to reservea unit of its project.As her husband makes only 4,500 baht a month to feed six mouths, MrsArunee said she and her four children agreed.Her family and neighbours went with Mr Somchai to Thanyaburi Land Office.Officials there asked her to sign some documents. Mrs Arunee, who isilliterate, said she did not know what the documents were about.She was then paid 2,000 baht. Her four children also reserved four unitsand were also paid 2,000 baht each.Prosecutor Yuenyad Jaisamut said the people, most of them low-incomeworkers, demanded about 500,000 baht each from the bank in suits filedwith South Bangkok Civil Court and Thanyaburi Court.Mr Yuenyad alleged the condo project owner conspired with bank officialsto cheat the people and could be charged with fraud.The penalty for fraud is not more than five years in prison or a fine notexceeding 10,000 baht or both.Mr Somchai, the broker, was among the victims filing complaints with MrYuenyad yesterday.Mr Yuenyad said he had ordered the agency's lawyers to investigate andgather evidence.The agency provides assistance free of charge, but the people must paya 1,000 baht court fee by themselves.He called on the Government to help pay the fees for these poor people.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996British royals warmly greeted: Second time here by UK queen since 1972from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01Anjira Assavanonda and Varalee SinlaratHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II renewed her acquaintance with Thailand forthe first time in 24 years yesterday.The British monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh, her consort, who are ona five-day state visit, were greeted at Don Muang airport by TheirMajesties the King and Queen.Hundreds of people, Thais and foreigners, watched the greeting before theKing and Queen accompanied their royal guests to motorcade.From the airport, they went to Maha Jesadabodin Pavilion, where cityofficials were in attendance. Thousands of people lined Rajdamnern Avenuewaving the tri-coloured Union Jack and Thai flags.Silence descended moments before the motorcade arrived at 3.40 p.m.Queen Elizabeth, in an emerald green dress and hat, stepped out of thecar, drawing expressions of delight and excitement from the crowd.Chariya Rattakul, wife of Bangkok Governor Bhichit, and SunanthaSamalapa, wife of City Clerk Prasert, presented garlands to QueenElizabeth, Queen Sirikit and Prince Philip.On behalf of Bangkok, Governor Bhichit welcomed the monarch and presentedher with a key to the city.The key is gold-plated, eight inches in length engraved with the emblemof the city showing Indra, keeper of Amarawadi heaven, atop Erawan, thewhite elephant.In response, Queen Elizabeth thanked the people of Bangkok and expressedpleasure at a welcome that was as friendly as in 1972.She said she arrived in Bangkok then by river, but this time she enteredthe city from the newly-expanded airport. From the short drive, the UKQueen said Bangkok had changed almost beyond recognition.She said she was glad the city, despite modernisation, had retained itsrich cultural heritage which would be enjoyed not only by Thais but byan increasing number of overseas visitors, including Britons."I am sure the citizens of Bangkok, in facing up to the demands of modernliving, have lost none of their warmth and humour," she said.The Queen told Mr Bhichit he had been elected governor of one of thegreat cities of Asia and had accepted a responsibility both exciting andrewarding.She also wished the governor and the people success in continuing to makeBangkok a thriving and happy place in which to live in years ahead.After the ceremony, the King and the Queen accompanied Queen Elizabethand Prince Philip to Boromabhiman Mansion, where they will stay.Most people in the crowd expressed delight for a chance to welcome theroyal visitors even though many of them did not have a clear view.Porntip Pimcharoen, 57, and her daughter, from Min Buri, had arrived atRajdamnern at 5 a.m but missed seeing the Queen because she left her spotfor a few moments just as the motorcade arrived.She said, however, she was glad to be there.

Instead, he entered the agriculturecollege at Chiang Mai University, which was a blessing in disguise.After MS5, Lee Suk was on his own, but reluctant to give up education,he borrowed money for university fees and books. He brought his problemto the attention of representatives of His Majesty the King's hilltribeprogramme. As a result, he was granted scholarships from the governmentand Australia, which enabled him to finish his BA in agriculture inChiang Mai.Three years ago, he took leave to study for a master's in agriculturalpromotion in Chiang Mai, and in January, he graduated.Born in Pa Wai, Nakhon Thai, Phitsanulok, Lee Suk's childhood was spentfighting malaria and poverty. He barely knew Thai until 11 when a groupof volunteer teachers set up a school for H'mong children in his remotevillage. It was the first time he had learned the Thai language.Lee Suk excelled over his peers. He picked up the language faster and waspraised by all the teachers. But his studies came to an abrupt end whencommunist insurgents raided the village and shot dead the headmen.His parents and their nine children fled to a temple in Nakhon Thai townwhere they took refuge for three months before they settled in Tak, whereLee Suk resumed his studies at a state school.Today, Lee Suk, or Lee Suk Rithnettikul, as he is known to hiscolleagues, works at the Hilltribe Development and Welfare Centre inChiang Mai, where he is using his knowledge for his people.Lee Suk counts himself as lucky to have been granted the scholarship fromQueen Elizabeth, which was a turning point in his life.

Between 146-205 respondents were selected at randomfrom each constituency.Mr Samak questioned the reliability of the poll, saying its results weremisleading since the number of respondents was too small to representBangkok's entire population.He also doubted all the respondents were eligible voters.The survey predicts a clean sweep by Democrats Vinai Sompong, ThawatchaiSatchakul and Gen Panlop Pinmanee in the three-seat Constituency 1, withMr Samak coming in fourth.Mr Samak blasted the poll, saying it was aimed at classifying politicalparties into good and bad ones in a misleading way."Let me ask you this. Will the (pollsters' relatives) at home die or getsick all of a sudden, or will their office buildings collapse if they gowithout the poll?" he said.The Interior Ministry has instructed its officials to stay neutral in thelead-up to the election to ensure a fair and clean poll.Speaking to a meeting of some 966 district chiefs and provincial policechiefs yesterday, Deputy Interior Minister Arsa Meksawan warned them notto side with any candidates."Some officials have close ties with local politicians who may ask themto do something to boost their chances of getting elected.

yesterday accused of falsifying an alienregistration paper which he used to attack Prime Minister BanharnSilpa-archa in last month's no-confidence debate.The accusation was made by a complaint filed with the Crime SuppressionDivision by Somsak Phakhipho, a 58-year-old lawyer.The lawyer said the copy of an alien registration paper produced by MrChamni during the September 18 censure debate and which the Democratclaimed to have been issued to Sengkim sae Bay, Mr Banharn's father,showed that Mr Sengkim arrived in Thailand in B.E. 2480 (1937), while thegenuine document showed the year of his arrival to be 2450 (1907).Mr Chamni, meanwhile, said in Nakhon Si Thammarat yesterday that doubtsover the legality of Mr Banharn's Thai nationality raised by him duringthe September 18 censure debate have been distorted and used by threepolitical parties with support bases in Bangkok to attack the Democratsin a bid to maintain their popularity.He said what he raised during the debate was the suspicion that MrBanharn might have obtained his Thai nationality illegally, basing hisarguments on the alien registration paper issued to the premier's father.However, he said, the Prachakorn Thai, Muan Chon and Palang Dharmaparties have twisted the real issue to accuse the Democrats of racialdiscrimination.Mr Chamni said before the debate he had tried to verify the document withthe police but they refused to cooperate.The Democrat said he was responsible for what he had done and would notmind if Muan Chon leader Chalerm Yubamrung filed a complaint with thepolice over this matter."Pol Capt Chalerm himself should not have stayed on as caretaker justiceminister because he was one of those who had betrayed Mr Banharn byforcing him to resign after the censure debate," Mr Chamni

October 29, 1996, Page 03Somchai MeesaneThe Democrats are going high-tech to win the hearts of Muslim voters inthe four southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Satun.Campaign director Surin Pitsuwan said yesterday a party which could "opena new world" for Muslim communities stands to win.The Democrats are relying on video multivision and the print media astheir main weapons in the battle for votes in the four Muslim-dominatedprovinces.Mr Surin used video multivisions in the Yawi and Malay languages for thefirst time during his campaign in Pattani's Yaring district on Sunday.The new technology was warmly welcomed there.The former deputy foreign minister said the battle between the Democratsand New Aspiration in the South has boiled down to a race to build up "anew process of learning" for Muslim communities.The old strategy of the Wadah Group headed by New Aspiration's WanMuhamad Nor Matha, which demands that Muslim people look up to theirreligious leaders as the only channel for news and information will notwork this time, Mr Surin said.The Democrats lost in the past because it had no chance to clearthemselves of accusations made by the Wadah Group, then led by DenTohmeena, which rejected learning through reading, listening andwatching, said the former Nakhon Si Thammarat MP.Mr Surin said attempts by his party to bring "a new way of learning" tothe Muslims in the South through its campaigns helped it win in the foursouthernmost provinces in the last election on July 2, 1995.He said if the Democrats could instill the habit of learning throughreading, watching and listening in them, he believes Muslims all over thecountry will vote for the party.The four provinces were the strongholds of New Aspiration for about adecade until the July 2 election when the Democrats managed to snatcheight seats from New Aspiration, which could hold on to only five.This time it's going to be a fierce contest again between the two partiesvying for the 13 seats at stake -- four each in Pattani and Narathiwat,three in Yala and two in Satun.The Democrats aim to capture 12 seats this time, leaving only one seatin Yala to deputy New Aspiration leader Wan Muhamad Nor Matha.New Aspiration, meanwhile, hopes to not only keep its five seats but alsoto win three more from Den Tohmeena in Pattani's Constituency 1, ParinyaJetapivat in Narathiwat's Constituency 2 and Horsaree Mahrem in Satun.That means Mr Den, a veteran Pattani MP, has to beat Democrat MareepengPajakiya, while Mr Parinya and Mr Horsaree must defeat Ramree Mama andThanin Jaisamut, respectively.Muslims, who form 70 percent of the total population of the foursouthernmost provinces, are therefore the deciding factor.Apart from video multivisions, Mr Surin will also issue a party journalfeaturing Democrat achievements in the South under the theme "Recoveringthe Thai Economy and Building the Darussalam (land of peace)."The journal covers Democrat policies on Muslim communities, the GrowthTriangle, promotion of hadji affairs, Malay language studies.Some 200,000 copied will be distributed to Muslims all over the country.The wind of change has been so strong Mr Wan Nor, who now leads the WadahGroup, admitted he could no longer rely on Muslim religious leaders tohelp canvass votes for New Aspiration.Mr Wan Nor has ordered former Mass Communications Organisation ofThailand director Rachan Husen to prepare multivision media for theparty's election campaign.He will also issue leaflets in Thai and Yawi to publicise the WadahGroup's work in the South.The group has also stepped up its campaign among young eligible voters-- those between 18-20 years old -- by promoting sport competitions andrecruiting them to help with the party's work.Mr Surin claimed young voters who were against the "old process oflearning" were a major force behind the defeat of the Wadah Group in thelast election.There are about 20,000 young eligible voters in each of the foursouthernmost provinces.Mr Wan Nor admitted the "Chuan Fever" is very strong in the South andthat New Aspiration leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh could not match theDemocrat leader in terms of popularity in this region.The Wadah Group has already dropped the "Chavalit for prime minister"slogan here and switched to "Southerners for NAP ministers" instead.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List

is keeping a close watch on unusual cash transactions in thisprovince, where there has been an upsurge in demand for 100 and 50-bahtbanknotes.Preeda Thumthiang, chairman of the PollWatch committee in the Northeast,said many banks in the province came across clients asking to havemillions of baht in cash changed into the 100 and 50-baht notes.Such practices were rare outside the election period, he said, addingthat a PollWatch investigation had found that people who carry largeamounts of cash work for a big political party with a large support basein the region.But so far, no one has been caught violating the election law. PollWatchwill continue to keep an eye on activities that may lead to vote-buying.Mr Preeda said he expected fierce competition in all four constituenciesof Khon Kaen.The various parties have begun selecting canvassers to work for them inthe different localities.The parties have spent a lot of money devising election strategies to bedeployed in rounding up support from potential voters.He explained that canvassers are usually chosen from respected figuresin the community. They will tour the villages recommending theircandidates to the people.The local people were told the candidates would fulfil their promises ifthey were elected.The canvassers often threatened to withdraw support for the villagers ifthey did not vote for their candidates. "Now is just about the time tofind the canvassers," said Mr Preecha.He said PollWatch volunteers would closely monitor the canvassers' moves.Legal action would be taken against them immediately if there wasevidence to suggest they had committed wrongdoing.Mr Preeda opposed New Aspiration's bid to woo local voters by supportingits leader as prime minister for the Northeastern people, saying thiswould only divide people of the different regions.He said the party's effort to draw votes from the teachers may eventuallyprove futile because election victory depended on many other factors.Vote-buying, for example, looked likely to change the voting pattern.Starting from November 5, PollWatch would despatch its officials toeducate locals about democracy and the adverse effects of vote-buying.The campaign is expected to be joined by more than 120,000 residents.Vote-buying is likely to be particularly heavy during the week precedingthe election.So far, PollWatch has received reports that some parties have distributedcoupons which can be redeemed for cash to attract people to theircampaign rallies. The coupons have a value of between 20 and 50 baht.Sukit Wattanasuk, head of Khon Kane's PollWatch Development Office, saidabout 1,300 volunteers, mostly Khon Kane University students, were sentto monitor the pre-election situation in the villages.PollWatch has also asked the provincial governor that its officials beallowed to man election units on election day so as to preventmalpractice.He said it was found the voters were handed ballot papers which hadalready been marked, adding that vote-buyers and officials often workedas a team.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Election snippets: Party canvassers use lotto-strategyfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03The competitive atmosphere in Phuket is heating up, with many canvassersusing a new strategy to seek votes for some candidates by sellingunderground lottery tickets to local people.Some candidates' supporters reportedly sell the so-called "MP lotteries"to people in Phuket for ten baht each and promise to pay 1,000-5,000 bahtto those buying lottos with the name of the winner.Many villagers have complained to to Phuket PollWatch chairman KittipongThieng Khunatham, requesting that the agency take action.Two-time Democrat MP for Phuket Anchalee Vanich Thepbutr and NewAspiration candidate Revuth Chindapol are fighting a political battle tocapture the single seat in this southern province.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Election snippets: Partisan police will face reshufflefrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03Police officers in the North will face immediate reshuffle if theysupport certain political parties, according to the head of PoliceRegional Bureau 5, Pol Lt-Gen Prasarn Wongyai.Pol Lt-Gen Prasarn said he had authorised every provincial police chiefin the North to transfer every officer acting against election laws outof the area urgently."Policemen of every level will be transferred to other remote areas toprevent more malpractice if they use their authority to benefit someparties or candidates.

Based on this assessment, theSouthern Seaboard Committee decided to relocate the port to Phangnga.Environmental officials agree that any negative impact on the sea turtlepopulation, if it occurs, would likely occur as a result of manydifferent activities at the port both during and after its construction,especially oil spills from large tankers.The high frequency of transportation would possibly disturb the migratoryroute of the sea turtles heading to nest at the peaceful Thai Muang beachin the national park.Ecolas suggested that the Phra Thong Island in Ranong province could becreated into a new nesting ground for the migrating sea turtles. However,environmental officials argued that turtles always lay their eggs on thesame grounds where they are born.An average of 77 nests with 100 eggs of leatherback and olive ridleyturtles can be found on the current nesting ground each year but thenumber is said to be declining, according to the record books of thePhuket Marine Biological Centre.Four different species of sea turtles found in Thai waters, apart fromeight other species found worldwide, include the green, hawkbill, oliveridley and leatherback.

Deputy City ClerkKriangsak Lohachala said the move is an attempt to inform motorists ofthe programme beguan in August with Sathorn as the first dust-free road.A month later, each of 40 districts had designated at least one road aspart of the programme.Trucks entering dust-free roads are required to cover what they aretransporting if it is construction materials or materials that may litterthe roads. Their wheels and bodies must be free of dirt.Mr Kriangsak said the city's attempt to install the signs came after itreceived complaints from people who said they had no way of knowing whichroad has been designated dust-free.It was one of the reasons why motorists unintentionally broke the rules,he said.He said the project had so far proved successful, although truck driversspurning the rules were still to be found.Some drivers avoided police checkpoints by using other roads because theyknew the time and place where police usually set up their checkpoints,Mr Kriangsak said.The authorities have since suggested to the police that they periodicallychange the time and location of their checkpoints or apply a randomsystem to deter violators.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996American held on drug chargefrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04Chiang RaiAn American was arrested yesterday on charges of having 350 grammes ofheroin in his possession.Lee Roy Frank, 55, was stopped at Chiang Rai airport at about 12.30 p.m.as he was about to board a flight to Bangkok.Police allegedly found 350 grammes of heroin hidden in a compartment ofhis luggage.Mr Frank had travelled to Thailand 12 times and visited Chiang Rai twicebefore his arrest.Meanwhile, police held two suspected drug traffickers in a separate raid.Police stopped to search a pick-up believed to have smuggled illicitdrugs on the Chiang Saen-Chiang Khong road.Driver Wirat Chanthawan, 33, of Chiang Rai's Wiang Pa Pao district, andMonkasem Chainit, 42, of Nakhon Pathom, were caught after police found5,000 amphetamine pills and 70 grammes of marijuana hidden in thepick-up.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996New chief for Port Authorityfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04Amornrat MahitirookThavorn Chunnanond has been nominated as the new Port Authority ofThailand director, replacing Anuparb Sunananta who is to be transferredto an inactive post, a source in the PAT board said yesterday.Mr Thavorn was the agency's deputy director before the nomination madein a meeting on Thursday of the PAT board headed by Navy chief Adm VichitChamnankarn, its new chairman.The nomination will be forwarded for cabinet endorsement today.The source said Mr Anuparb will be made a water transport specialist atthe Transport and Communications Ministry as recommended by DeputyMinister Chaipak Siriwat who oversees the PAT.Learning of the upcoming change, Mr Anuparb initially planned to quit PATon September 30, but changed his mind after Mr Chaipak urged him to leaveeven earlier than that, the source said.That was why the change had to be effected through the board last week,the source said.Mr Anuparb was the deputy secretary-general of the National Economic andSocial Development Board before his appointment to head the PAT inJanuary last year.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Camp to be cleared by November: About 600 boatpeople to face repatriationfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04Prasit TangprasertNakhon RatchasimaThailand plans to complete the repatriation of an estimated 600Vietnamese boat people still at Sikhiu camp by mid-November, officialssaid yesterday.The remaining Vietnamese are to be sent back in groups at the rate of twoflights a week, they added.Amid varying degrees of protest, Thai authorities have sent back a totalof 1,824 Vietnamese in 12 separate batches since the operation began onJuly 1, after United Nations funding support ended.A Vietnamese who was due to go back with the latest group on October 24was rushed to hospital and narrowly escaped a suicide bid by swallowinginsecticide.

The firms inturn buy the produce from them at a pre-determined price in the contract.If, for whatever reasons, the quality of the produce does not meet thecontractual requirement the prices go down."The farmers have to be responsible for debts incurred in undertaking theproject while the private firms risk nothing, lose nothing," he said.Many farmers are driven into bankruptcy as a result of the low qualityof seeds, fertiliser and equipment supplied by the firms.The government-private sector coordinating committee for agriculturedevelopment has suggested a cost-sharing system which would requireprivate firms to share risks with farmers."Under the new system private firms will provide the means of productionto the farmers who will repay the loans only after they have successfullyharvested the crops and sold the produce to the firms at pre-determinedprices," he said.Under the current system farmers borrow money from the Bank ofAgriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, but in the revised system theprivate firms will have to borrow money from BAAC or other commercialbanks at 5% interest and transfer the cash to farmers or provide themwith equipment and production material.Besides, the firms will have to deposit cash with BAAC amounting to 10%of the value of the produce. This money will be used to assist farmersif they face crop failure, he added.If the farmers fail to meet contractual obligations they will be droppedfrom the programme and required to repay their debts at the normalinterest rate.Conversely, if the firms break the contract farmers can file forcompensation.Mr Suvit said the ministry will submit the proposal to the cabinet soon.Private firms, meanwhile, were not happy with the revised scheme.A representative of Panchaphol Pulp Industry Co Ltd, which specialisesin fast-growing trees, said the company has decided to withhold itsproject in light of the new cost-sharing system.The project, spanning five years, would require soft loans totalling over1,600 million baht to grow trees in the central region."The existing system is good enough.

"In this case, it means it is used in 2,500cases."America also limits the number of disease centres, for instance there isonly one heart disease centre per city. "We have sufficient expensivemodern technology but it is under-used and has very low productivity,"said Dr Viroj."To maximise use, it should be distributed to the provinces. Much of itis in private hospitals in Bangkok."A survey in May 1995 found there were 205 CT scanners (each costing 10-20million baht), 20 Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) computerised x-raymachines (70-80 million baht), 37 extra corporeal shock wave lithotripter(ESWL) used for stones of less than 3cm (8-39 million baht), 114 lasers(cost varies) and 594 ultrasonograms (1-5 million baht).The survey found that 59 CT scanners are used in public hospitals and 146in private hospitals. Of those, 43 percent are in Bangkok.MRIs: eight in public and 12 in private hospitals; 75 percent in Bangkok.ESWLs: 19 in public and 18 in private hospitals; 38 percent in thecapital. Lasers: 36 in public and 66 in private hospitals; 88 percent inBangkok. Ultrasonograms: 259 in public and 309 in private hospitals; 36percent in Bangkok.Most of the equipment has a high health care cost impact on patients butthere have been no systematic evaluations of clinical outcome.Dr Viroj said there is a probability of the needless application ofmedical equipment, for which patients pick up the bill. The probabilityof abuse involving ultrasonograms is high of lasers and MRI possible andthere is no definite information on CT scanner abuses.Though there has been lesser abuse of ESWLs, they are only used on 50percent of patients with stone disease.Though most patients are from the lower income group, 38 percent have topay for treatment out of their own pockets. Since 30 percent come fortreatment when the stone is big -- more than 3cm -- they have operationsrather than ESWL treatment, he said.Developed countries treat 80 percent of patients with ESWL because theyare treated when the stone is smaller than 3cm, he added.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996New operation plan for city bus agency: Private sector to be assigned moreroutesfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05Amornrat MahitirookThe director of the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority, Arun Chirachavala,has prepared an operational plan to help the debt-ridden bus agencybefore announcing his resignation at the end of the month.His resignation will follow the reshuffle of the BMTA board endorsed bythe cabinet earlier this month at the urging of Deputy Transport MinisterChaipak Siriwat, who has been assigned to supervise the agency.Mr Arun said the operational plan designed to be used in the next fiveyears will focus on improving three major areas of the bus agency so thatit can begin generating profit from 1998 onwards.Under the first area of the plan, the BMTA will improve passenger busroutes, the fare collection system, and bus conditions, and award moreroutes to private operators.Secondly, the agency will reduce the size of its own organisation byreducing the number of its buses from 4,624 currently to 4,000 and cutthe number of staff from 23,346 currently to 17,573 within 2001.The third area of the plan focuses on the BMTA's finances. The agencywill ask the government to subsidise the loss-ridden operation ofordinary buses, the fares of which have been frozen in the publicinterest.The authority will also ask for approval to introduce a single fare ratefor air-conditioned buses.The rate will be 12 baht per trip instead of the current one which rangesfrom six to 16 baht depending on traveling distances.The BMTA will also raise capital of 7,698.12 million baht to clear itsold losses.If the plan is implemented, the agency will have a net profit of 447million baht in 1998, Mr Arun said.He described his operational plan as a "masterpiece".Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996BECL's guided bus project passes technical evaluation: Construction workto begin next yearfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05Supoj WancharoenThe Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA) has passed the guidedbus project of the Bangkok Expressway Co Ltd (BECL) through its technicalevaluation.ETA deputy governor Somchai Charukasemratana said an ETA sub-committeeselecting the guided bus operator met yesterday to consider the technicalaspects of the BECL's project, and agreed that the details complied withthe ETA's terms of reference.The ETA will consider the financial proposal of the BECL next week andexpects that the construction of the system could start next year, hesaid.The BECL is the only contender vying for the contract of the project,which will be built under the second-stage expressway system for adistance of 16 kilometres from Chaeng Wattana to Victory Monument.

They pushshoddy wooden carts on daily prowls through the metropolis, rooting atgarbage cans for food and scraps. Their only contact with the rest of thecity is when they rap at car windows to beg, hawk cigarettes by the stickor snatch a purse or a wristwatch from pedestrians.Now, as the Philippines steps on to the world stage with the coming outparty of its once-ailing economy, the great unwashed of the Philippinecapital are under siege as the government lays on a giant snow job to puta silver lining to its imperfections.Three people have been killed and several hundred others have so far beeninjured, a rights monitor here says, as giant squatter colonies whichblight this city of eight million are torn down by government demolitioncrews armed with crowbars and court orders ahead of the November 25summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum.President Fidel Ramos denies any connection between the slum campaign andApec, and last week controversially stopped the demolition of a colonyof 4,000 squatter shanties clogging a waterway in the central Maniladistrict of Paco.Mr Ramos, who at that time had been holding a dialogue with a churchsupport group calling for an end to violent demolitions, said that "ifwhat happened is intentional, this is subverting the government".The Department of Interior and Local Government said it has relocated22,320 squatters so far to government-built relocation sites in thenearby provinces of Bulacan and Cavite, and that about 300,000 remain tobe removed.Some analysts say the latter figure is grossly understated.Manila and its satellite cities and towns hold about 12 percent of thepopulation of 68 million, and a World Bank study shows a third of theeight million residents do not hold a title or contract allowing them tostay in their current abode.The big numbers of these squatters are routinely blamed for causingcrime, flooding, pollution, disease and other ills which how afflict thiscity. Last month, Health Department investigators traced the cause of acholera outbreak which killed five people to an illegal tap in the watersystem, possibly contaminated by human faeces from a squatter colonywhich had been stealing the water."There is a certain Hobbesian element that sets Manila apart," saidUniversity of the Philippines political science professor Alex Magno.He described Manila as a "cruel city" where "the air is bad, traffic isterrible, sewage does not work, a third of the population live in slums,housing is expensive".The vice mayor of the city of Manila, Lito Atienza, said the Pacosquatters at the centre of the Apec flap had been notified to vacate thearea two years ago, with them "fully aware that they are occupying adanger zone"."With or without Apec, we are using our mandate which maintains the goodliving conditions of our constituents," said Mr Atienza.The congestion of Manila is blamed by the government on the lack ofemployment opportunities in provincial areas. Most of the squattersregularly run over by speeding trains are migrants from provinces southof Manila which arrived by rail in search of jobs and proceeded to buildtheir shacks beside the tracks."One has to be glad that the Apec meeting has been scheduled here," saidHoracio Paredes, a cabinet member in the previous administration ofCorazon Aquino."If the holding of such a meeting clears the city of squatters, at leastalong the roads and waterways that the rest of us need to maintainresident-free for the metropolis to have some breathing space, then welland good," he said."Imagine how much urine, human excrement and garbage those 4,000 familiesdump into that canal daily," he said of the Paco squatters.Some politicians say squatter colonies are coddled by some localofficials, who find in them a big reservoir of swing votes to keep themin power in the next local election."Their presence there is symptomatic of the failure of government togovern properly," said Mr Paredes.Complicating the resettlement problem is a law that states that slumabodes cannot be demolished unless a relocation site has been preparedfor the residents ahead of time. Critics say this gives the act ofsquatting an attractive incentive.The law does not cover those who obstruct roads and waterways and thosewho live in zones that are considered dangerous to human habitation, suchas river banks or beside railroad tracks.Opinion on the whole issue however is divided.Manila Times newspaper concedes that while "the cost of keeping blightedcommunities now exacts a toll on nearly everyone, from questions ofsanitation and health to matters of peace and order", it argued that"there must be a more dignified way of cleaning up the metropolis otherthan chasing people down with truncheons and water hoses".Looking to the longer term, the government has initiated moves to try todecongest the city. It is now granting tax incentives to companies whichset up industrial enclaves in other regions and to the factories whichset up there.Many of the new industrial projects are now being set up in the so-calledCalabarzon growth area, comprising the provinces of Cavite, Laguna,Batangas, Rizal and Quezon, south of Manila.President Ramos has also created a government task force to study othermeans of dispersing economic growth, which serves as a magnet formigrants, to other regions.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Parties turn up the heat in the battle for Bangkokfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 14BANYAT TASANEEYAVEJThe heat is rising in the lead up to the election two weeks from now, andthe 37 seats in Bangkok will be the determining factor in whether ChuanLeekpai or Chavalit Yongchaiyudh becomes the country's 22nd primeminister.As the centre of information with the largest educated population,Bangkok has always acted as somewhat of a barometer in measuring thepolitical climate around the country.And since the people of the capital are closest to the seat of power,they follow the moves of politicians and their parties more closely thantheir rural cousins and can be turned off or on by the slightest thing.It is for this reason that no single party has ever been able to dominatethe city for any length of time before falling out of favour.The Democrats once held the hearts and minds of city people in the yearswhen they fought the military dictatorship. Prachakorn Thai capturednearly every seat in Bangkok in the mid-1970s when the country swung topolitical right, and Palang Dharma swept aside all challengers in thelate 1980s and early 1990s when the public became fed up with corruptionand opted for a party promising them honesty.The political wind seems to be blowing again in the Democrat Party'sfavour for the November 17 election. The Democrats know their immediatepolitical future rests with taking the capital since they cannot hope tobeat New Aspiration in the Northeast where vote-buying is the determiningfactor.The Democrat team chosen to contest the city have been selected based ontheir perceived ability to undertake the key issues of political reformand economic management. Most members of the Democrats' so-calledeconomic dream team are running in Bangkok; Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda,Supachai Panitchpakdi, Abhisit Vejjajiva and Savit Bhotiwihok.Mr Chuan went to pains during his two-hour speech at the party rally atRoyal Plaza Saturday to excite the political consciences of city folk.He told them his party won only seven seats in Bangkok in the lastelection, while the other 30 were won by parties which threw theirsupport behind Banharn Silpa-archa.History, he said, might repeat itself if the Democrat candidates are notelected in great numbers.Most of the Democrat seats last election came from the South, where theparty expects to win most of the 52 available seats this time. But thelargest number of seats, 137, are concentrated in the 17 provinces of theNortheast, where Gen Chavalit's New Aspiration Party is expected to dowell since it has recruited the largest number of known politicians fromthe region.In the last general election, the NAP captured 36 seats in the Northeast,Chart Thai 29, Chart Pattana 27 and the Social Action Party and Democrats14 each.With such a short campaign period, vote-buying is expected to be evenworse in the Northeast this year. This means Bangkok represents the onlyhope for the Democrats in beating the NAP and returning Mr Chuan as primeminister.In the last general election in Bangkok, the Palang Dharma Party won 16seats, Prachakorn Thai 12, the Democrats seven and Muan Chon two.The other parties will be ganging up on the Democrats this time. ThoughPalang Dharma is not an ally of either Prachakorn Thai or Muan Chon, itwill have to join in on the attack on the Democrats.Both Prachakorn Thai and Palang Dharma have been attacking the Democratsfor raising the issue of Mr Banharn's and his father's nationality duringthe no-confidence debate. The raising of the race issue by the Democratswas not very well received by the ethnic Chinese community in Bangkok.In the Thanam Ratchawong Chinese community for example, a large posterdeclares: "We don't want politicians who look down on the ethnic originof fellow Thais."The community is in Constituency 2, the former stronghold of the PDPleader. Even though Thaksin Shinawatra is not running this time, partycandidate Orathai Kanchanachusak hopes to keep the three seats thereunder the party's control.The Democrats are fielding a strong team in the constituency made up offormer House Speaker Marut Bunnag, respected academic M.R. SukhumbhandParibatra and dream team member Supachai Panitchpakdi. If all three canwin a seat, this would shatter the PDP's strongest base in the city.Mr Chuan is now concentrating his efforts on helping party candidatescampaign in Bangkok using a two-pronged approach: Getting people to votefor them and building fear among constituents of the possibility of GenChavalit becoming premier.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Dateline Bangkok: Race debate is unhealthyfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15Destructive criticism seems to be the theme of most campaigns launchedby political parties contesting the coming election. Instead of talkingabout the policies of their parties, candidates tend to engage inmud-slinging that could create political conflict and division among thepeople.In the July 2 general election last year, the Prachakorn Thai and PalangDharma parties, the two major political rivals in Bangkok, lost much oftheir popularity among voters.Palang Dharma, in particular, came under much public criticism becauseof dramatic changes in its political role and conduct. Both Palang Dharmaand Prachakorn Thai are Bangkok-based parties. They have shown nointerest in expanding party branches outside the capital to makethemselves a truly mass party.In the September 13, 1992 general election, Palang Dharma lost many ofits seats while Prachakorn Thai won only two seats in Bangkok. TheDemocrat Party made considerable gains. In last year's election inBangkok, both Palang Dharma and the Democrats suffered a setback, whilePrachakorn Thai made considerable gains. Palang Dharma and PrachakornThai, however, were invited to join the Banharn Government.The first no-confidence debate in May this year led to a Cabinetreshuffle. Both Palang Dharma and Prachakorn Thai resigned and thenrejoined the Government in a manner that caused much confusion among thepublic. The Democrats, meanwhile, managed to regain its popularity byexplaining its handling of the Sor Por Kor 4-01 land programme to thepublic.Palang Dharma leader Thaksin Shinawatra and his predecessor ChamlongSrimuang are not contesting the coming election. As the election campaignhots up in Bangkok, Palang Dharma and Prachakorn Thai are apparentlyjoining hands to attack the Democrats. Political friendship is a goodthing, but both parties should not bring up the issue of racial prejudicebecause it could cause disunity in the country.Editorial from Siam Post dailyCopyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Bangkok Post Postbag: Changes at council part of a re-focusfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15There has been some speculation in your letters column about the BritishCouncil, and I would like to take this opportunity to respond to thevarious queries regarding its function, its library and informationservice, art gallery, educational counselling service and Englishlanguage centre.The British Council is Britain's principal agency for cultural relationswith other countries and its work in these countries is supported by agrant from the British Government. It actively promotes educational,cultural and technical cooperation between Britain and the rest of theworld. In each country the British Council adapts its services to meetthe particular needs of that country.Consequently the services offered in India, Malaysia, Japan or Singaporewill differ from those offered in Thailand. In Thailand, the BritishCouncil through its offices in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, offers a widerange of services. First of all, it provides access to information aboutcontemporary Britain. Furthermore, it initiates and develops projectsbetween British and Thai government, educational and non-governmentorganisations, particularly in the fields of English language teaching,education, science and engineering, health, the environment, governanceand the law, and the arts. In these areas it has a particular trackrecord of promoting long-term partnerships between British and Thaiuniversities and other education institutions.The British Council Library in Bangkok makes available English languageteaching materials (including audio-visual and multimedia programmes) toall its library members. When the British Council moved to its newlocation at 254 Chulalongkorn Soi 64 on the edge of the Chulalongkorncampus in Siam Square, it decided to use the opportunity to re-focus itslibrary and information services so as to respond more effectively to thedemands of the majority of its members.Based on research and data collected from its members' borrowing habits,it decided to extend those areas where demand was greatest and alsoupdate its technology to provide a more efficient service. Some areas andbooks which were less well used were removed. In addition to informationabout all aspects of Britain, the British Council library now offers itsmembers a comprehensive collection of materials on English languageteaching and study, a selection of British newspapers and periodicals aswell as British films, documentaries and popular television programmeson video and a collection of modern British fiction.For the use of library members, government and educational institutionsseeking information on the United Kingdom, a reference section with booksand CD ROM is also available. We are continually adding to this material,but information not immediately available can be obtained from theBritish Library in the UK. The opening hours of the library have alsobeen extended and we are now open six days a week.The British Council library was never intended as a general library andreading room, but as a gateway to information on contemporary Britain.To make space for the specialist areas that have been in heavy demandfrom the Thai public, educational institutions and other users of ourservices, we either donated the excess books to Thai educationalinstitutions or sold them to our library users for a small consideration.If some residents in Bangkok missed the sale that was held in the librarypremises over several months, I am sorry that they lost the occasion toacquire some excellent books. I can only advise them to turn up for theannual Ploenchit Fair on Nov 23 at the British Embassy when the BritishCouncil will again be running the second hand book stall (if any BangkokPost readers have unwanted books in reasonable condition we would bepleased to take them off your hands -- the proceeds all go to charity).The British Council continues to have art exhibitions on its premises,there have been two since we moved. In addition to the forthcomingexhibition of "Thailand Drawings" by Justin Knowles (Nov 4-23), whosework was recently acquired by the Tate Gallery in London, and anotherexhibition of prints based on nursery rhymes by Paula Rego (Nov 24-Dec20), we have acquired from the British Council Collection in Londonseveral works by British artists and sculptors for permanent display.As in a number of our offices around the world, the British Council inThailand offers individual and group counselling and information to allthose interested in study and training in Britain. This service isoffered free of charge by our specially-trained Educational CounsellingService (ECS) staff who guide applicants through the process of choosinga course at British educational or training institutions to best suittheir particular needs. They can advise them on how to apply for thatcourse and even provide a follow-up service if required.The ECS also holds a broad range of reference materials, as well asprospectuses, CD ROM databases and videos from schools, institutes anduniversities. They also provide detailed information on fees, andscholastic and English language requirements for entrance to secondary,graduate and post-graduate courses in the UK. In addition, the BritishCouncil will be holding its 10th annual British Education Exhibition atImperial Queen's Park Hotel in Bangkok from Nov 22-24, where interestedcandidates can meet with representatives from about 100 British schools,colleges and universities.The ECS office is located in the main entrance hall of the new BritishCouncil premises in Siam Square and we are sorry that the two visitorsto our office who wrote to your newspaper failed to notice it. The ECSis now also available in Chiang Mai and the British Education Exhibitionwill this year, for the first time, also visit Chiang Mai (Nov 28-29) atLotus Hotel, Pang Suan Kaew.The English Language Centres of the British Council across the worldbelieve in setting high standards in English language teaching. Thisapplies to the range of courses we offer in Siam Square where we caterfor beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of study, for younger andmature learners and as well as to our other teaching operations in ChiangMai and New Phetchaburi Road. We therefore recruit well-qualified andexperienced native-speakers of English as teachers. They use up-to-datematerials and facilities matched to the needs of the class and in SiamSquare have available a CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning) Roomequipped with purpose-designed CD ROM materials.I hope this letter will satisfy the queries of your letter writers. Ourrecords indicate that none of your correspondents on this issue arecurrently members of the library. However, my colleagues and I are readyto answer any queries and complaints, and would encourage those withconcerns to discuss them directly with us so we can improve our servicesto library members, centre students and other users of the BritishCouncil.Dr John RichardsDirectorCopyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Bangkok Post Postbag: Not every Aussie has racist viewsfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15I refer to the recent coverage of the racism debate in Australia. Itconcerns me greatly that your readers are getting an impression ofAustralia as a racially intolerant society simply because of remarks madeby an ignorant minority. I would like to put the debate into perspective.Australia is a democracy and the second largest multicultural nation inthe world. As such, it represents a wide variety of different culturesand views. Recently, a very small minority of elected representativeshave made racially based remarks which the majority of Australians rejectand despise. The fact that nine out of 10 members of Port Lincoln Councilresigned because of the racist remarks of its mayor illustrates thispoint clearly.Racism exists everywhere. As a Caucasian, I have also been the subjectof racism during my travels in Asia, but I do not see everyone in Asiaas racist because of an ignorant few.We must all fight against racism. The fight is happening in Australianow.Australians are proud of their rich multicultural heritage and theirposition in Asia. Never doubt that.Ken DobsonSydneyCopyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Bangkok Post Postbag: Ticky-tackyness of US politicsfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15I was watching the American vice presidential debate recently on Channel7 and I noticed the similarity between Al Gore and a young Ronald Reagan.The way Al Gore held his head and looked into the camera reminded me ofhow our Ron used to look.Is Al a secret member of Ron's family or is it a prerequisite forAmerican politicians to come from the same mould?It all reminds me of that old song, "Little Boxes", where the chorusgoes: "And they are all made of ticky tacky and they all look just thesame".Raymond JCCopyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Commentary by Paisal Sricharatchanya: Station outside Mater Dei should gofrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15In the weeks and months after the second school semester reopens thisFriday, Bangkok will witness a new struggle of an extraordinary kind.After a year of quiet and unsuccessful negotiations with the variousparties concerned, the prestigious, all-girl Mater Dei School onPloenchit Road will begin mounting a public campaign to get rid of aplanned electric train station right outside its front door that -- ifbuilt -- will almost definitely worsen the children's quality of life andpose serious hazards to their health and safety.The campaign is at the centre of what looks like a grossly uneven match.A well-behaved and deferential Catholic school is finally forced to standtall to fight against the financially-powerful and politicallywell-connected BTSC, the concessionaire of Bangkok's elevated electrictrain project.But the solidarity movement that has taken shape among the almost 2,000students, their parents and teachers plus alumnae is determined to fightto the very end.The high point of a comprehensive package of campaign strategies callsfor a petition to His Majesty the King, who spent part of his childhoodat this very school. The petition, however, will be a last resort if andafter all else fails.This is not simply a fight between the school and BTSC. At stake is thevital question of whether innocent children who will graduate to becomethe country's precious human resources should fall victim to greedy andirresponsible Big Business.What is also pertinent to this campaign is another crucial question ofwhether greater transparency and accountability should be instilled intothe national decision-making process of granting concessions tolarge-scale public projects bearing a direct impact on the environmentand citizens' rights.In the apparent haste with which the electric-train project was approvedduring the tenure of former Bangkok Governor Chamlong Srimuang,fundamental requirements such as a proper environmental impact assessmentstudy have either been glossed over or imperfectly fulfilled.Given the fact that construction of the entire project is going ahead atfull steam, it appears there's no turning back in spite of its known andunknown shortcomings.But the ghastly structure that is planned to become one of the mainstations right in front of Mater Dei should be shifted elsewhere. And ifshifting it to another adjacent location is not possible, the stationshould be scrapped.Siting a large and crowded train station at the doorstep of an all-girlschool smacks of extreme irresponsibility on the part of the projectmanagers. The high-pitch noise and polluting particles resulting fromtrains arriving at and departing from the station every two minutes willpose appalling health hazards to the school children. This is not tomention other threats to their safety.Alternatively, scrapping of the Mater Dei station should cause littlefinancial damage to the project operator -- if finances are their mainconcern -- since passengers travelling on the route can still beadequately served by two not-too-distant stations: one in front of theMahathun Building and the other just around the corner near the RegentHotel.A dangerous precedent will be set where innocent students at othereducational institutions may also be victimised in the future if thisserious blunder is allowed to go ahead.All the phu yais at BTSC and Bangkok Metropolitan Administration will doa great service not only to the Mater Dei students but also the publicat large if they demonstrate the sort of moral conscience and socialresponsibility expected of them by ordering the relocation or scrappingof the planned station.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Sakchay takes on sport's top jobfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 16Suchin ChirakulIn a surprise decision, Dr Sakchay Tapsuwan was yesterday appointedGovernor of the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT), taking over from DrSomchai Prasertsiriphant who resigned suddenly last week.Long serving deputy governor Dr Charoenthat Jinthanaseri had been tippedto take over the post.Minister of the Prime Minister's Office Pongpol Adireksarn, who is theSAT president, announced that the SAT committee endorsed Dr Sakchay tobe governor for the next four years.The meeting acknowledged the resignation of Dr Somchai, who was governorfor six years and who many thought would stay on much longer until hisretirement.Although Dr Somchai officially retired to give someone else a chance atthe job, it is generally believed major internal conflicts were the realreason for his resignation.Late last year he had been sacked as director of the organising committeeof the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok and there had been some questionsabout his administrative ability.However, Dr Somchai, who has worked for Thai sport for 28 years, is nottotally out of the picture and has been named special councillor wherehe will still have a say in decision making.Dr Sakchay is also vice-president of the International Amateur BoxingAssociation and secretary of the Amateur Boxing Association of Thailand.He is closely involved with the 13th Asian Games.The new governor is regarded as a good administrator and diplomat, whichis essential for organising big tournaments.With Dr Somchai's resignation the governorship has now become a four-yearpost, but one that can be renewed for two more years.SAT also announced yesterday its budget for next year would be over 4million baht, most of which would be used for the Asian Games.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Amateurs shine for Thailandfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 16Pairoj Suppasil won the Volvo World Amateur individual title and liftedThailand to win the team event on Saturday at Sotogrande, Spain.Pairoj, Phisand Karnleung, and Lerdsiri Kierthanomkul were Thailnad'srepresentatives in the Volvo amateur final at the weekend playing againstgolfers from 11 countries.Pairoj finished with a winning 78 in this important amateur event, whichwas contested according to the Stableford rules, while Phisand camefourth and Lerdsiri ninth.In the team event, which counted the best two scorers, Pairoj's 78 andPisit's 73 were enough for Thailand to edge out Malaysia by a 1.5 margin.The United Arab of Emirates finished third with an aggregate 70.5.INDIVIDUALS78 -- Pairoj Suppasil 38-4077 -- Chen Chia Ho (Taiwan) 38-3975 -- Chok Moo Hong (Malaysia) 39-3673 -- Phisand Karnleung 40-33TEAMS75.5 -- Thailand74 -- Malaysia70.5 -- UAE70.5 -- SingaporeCopyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Somprasong chairman faces fraud charges: Prasong evades warrant, employeestry to block searchfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)Krissana Parnsoonthorn and Busrin TreerapongpichitPolice are hunting for leading property developer Prasong Panitpakdee oncharges of doctoring financial statements, falsifying his company'sreports and destroying evidence.There were rumours yesterday that Mr Prasong, chairman and managingdirector of troubled Somprasong Land Plc, had fled the country. However,police believe he is still in Thailand.An arrest warrant was issued after Economic Crime Investigation Divisionpolice received complaints from a group of Somprasong shareholders. Apreliminary investigation found grounds to believe that Mr Prasong wasresponsible for wrongdoing.A search warrant was also issued for the Somprasong headquarters in theKlong Sarn area of Thon Buri.Economic Crime Investigation officers arrived at the building at 10 a.m.but company employees wouldn't let them in. They relented after policeshowed them the search warrant -- and threatened to arrest them if theyresisted.The employees continued to make the officers' job difficult by refusingto give them keys to certain rooms. Police had to call a locksmith toopen the rooms, which they found filled with destroyed documents andpiles of others awaiting destruction.Officers also forced open an out-of-service elevator and found it filledwith destroyed documents.Police said they believed Mr Prasong knew in advance that they werepreparing to move in on him, and that he ordered his employees to startdestroying documents at 3 a.m. yesterday.Investigators collected documents hat had not been destroyed but aSomprasong lawyer would not allow them to take the documents out of thebuilding.The Economic Crime Investigation officers called local police at SamraePolice Station for help. They had called Somdej Chaophraya Stationearlier, but were told that Somprasong executives had asked a seniorofficer to refuse the station's help to the Economic Crime police.Reinforced by local police, the economic police eventually took thedocuments to Samrae Station.Police said Mr Prasong is likely to face additional charges of sharemanipulation. Officers said they found many share certificates and someevidence that Mr Prasong may have been involved in manipulating theprices of certain stocks.According to the complaints lodged by company shareholders, Somprasonghad falsified its earnings from several property projects in reports tothe Stock Exchange of Thailand.

The method will create confidence in themarket in times when there might be abrupt impact on the market'sliquidity."In a way, the central bank will provide direction and avoid thefluctuation of local interest rates," said Paiboon Kittisrikangwan, chiefanalyst in the central bank's banking department.He ruled out suggestions by some analysts that the bonds circulating inthe system were insufficient for the operation.Mr Paiboon said private bonds circulating in the banking sector wereworth about 300 billion baht, with state-enterprise bonds worth 250billion, Bank of Thailand bonds 19 billion baht and Government bonds 22million baht."The amount is enough for the central bank to intervene in the moneymarket and guide its monetary policy," he said, adding that this system,together with the central bank's moves to adjust the mechanisms forquoting interest in the bond repurchase market, would force financialfirms to adjust their liquidity more effectively.The central bank will trade only bonds with one-month-up maturity,resulting in market managed liquidity in the longer term.In the first stage, the central bank expects to choose 15-20 financefirms as its dealers.

Exporters would alsoget tax reprieves on the export of some machinery and fuel.Compensation rates now range between 0.17-8% of the export value, downfrom the previous 11%.The source said the car industry benefits most with a reprieve of 8%.But the source said exporters will have to prepare themselves bysharpening their competitive edge to cope with international competitionwhen the government help stops.He said the Government could no longer shoulder the tax burden.An agreement of the World Trade Organisation also says the compensationwill have to be waived to create fairer competition, the source said.But Customs Department director-general Supachai Panitchpakdi saidThailand has to retain compensation to stimulate foreign investment.But he said the measure might later be reviewed.He said compensation has caused worries among department officialsbecause it opens the way for unscrupulous people to claim false taxexport figures to claim tax rebates.Beginning in January next year, the department would counter false exporttax claims by introducing an accounting system to control tax claims forimported raw materials.He said it would not be compulsory for exporters to participate in thenew system, but he would like them to take part and capitalise on itsbenefits.An accounting system would facilitate exporters, therefore the departmentwould not pressure exporters to participate, he said.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Tripods cut exploration costs: Platforms first to be designed locallyfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)Unocal Thailand is introducing new locally-designed platforms for itsextensive gas production in the Gulf of Thailand.The new platforms will help the US gas prospector to cut the overall costof developing gas reserves in the Gulf of Thailand.Fabrication of the first two fully automated tripod (three-pile)well-head platforms is near completion and installation of thosestructures in Funan and Pladang fields is planned for early next year.These tripod platforms, the first to be designed and installed inThailand, offer substantial savings on fabrication costs over traditionalfour-pile platforms. Unocal's offshore wellhead platforms, currentlytotalling 60, have traditionally been of the four-pile type.Unocal's tripod platform is more compact than a four-pile one. Itrequires 755 tons less steel, is insensitive to water depth, and is fullyautomated. Most importantly, it is as safe and strong as the conventionaltype, and can support the same number of drilled wells.Unocal Thailand president Brian Marcotte said the new concept formed partof Unocal's attempt to reduce the overall cost of developing gas reservesin the Gulf."Tripod platforms will have a significant impact on how Unocal operatesits fields in the Gulf and elsewhere around the world. They are theplatforms of our future," the American executive said.A multi-disciplinary team of Thailand-based technical professionals,including geologists and engineers, came up with a design to suit theactual geological conditions and drilling experience in the Gulf ofThailand. From engineering design to completion, the team took less thana year.Drilling of gas wells will be carried out by a jackup rig, which will beable to move between development well and delineation well activities asneeded, thus eliminating the need to use two different rig types.The company recently sailed away its last four-pile platform from ThaiNippon Steel's fabrication yard in Samut Prakan. Thai Nippon Steel hasbuilt most of Unocal's platforms to date. It is also the fabricationcontractor for the tripod platforms.Operating for co-concessionaires Mitsui Oil Exploration and PTTExploration & Production (PTTEP), Unocal has been producing natural gasfrom fields in the Gulf of Thailand since 1981.Unocal gas production from fields in the Gulf in the first nine monthsof this year came to an average of 735 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd)and 26,482 barrels per day (b/d) of condensate.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Industry aims to top Malaysia: Call for leaders who can see potentialfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)Kornrarath SilsmithThe Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) and the Industrial FinanceCorporation of Thailand (IFCT) are convinced Thailand's electricalappliances and electronics sectors can overtake those of Malaysia to beranked top in the region.This is possible if the new government has good vision, they said.Sompong Nakornsri, president of FTI's electrical and electronics group,told an Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand seminar of thepotential in Thailand's electrical and electronics industry.Thai industrialists can produce electrical appliances and electronicsthemselves because they have cheap labour, raw materials and goodsupporting industries.Thailand can also develop technology itself and improve products to bein line with worldwide standards. As a developing country, the localmarket has a high demand for these products, which could also beexported.But Thailand has before lacked leaders with a long-ranging and clearvision, which meant the industries were not well developed.High technology electrical products such as electrical fans, motors,adaptors and compressors are better than those produced in Malaysia.To help Thailand occupy the top rank in the production of electrical andelectronics goods within the next decade, the new government should havefive-, 10-and 15-year plans to promote investor confidence.The tax structure and details of the Customs Department should beimproved. The government should also act urgently when imported goods aredumped and when import tariffs are raised by trading partners.Taxes for raw materials are higher than those for finished goods. Forexample for the optic-fibre industry, plastic pellets are taxed at 30%,but finished imports are taxed at 5%."Thailand is the only country that imposes a tax for unprocessedmaterials at a higher rate than for finished products. The procedures ofthe Customs Department is more confusing and slower than those inMalaysia which permits the imported and exported goods to pass theCustoms Department within 24 hours without any difficulties overdocumentation," said Mr Sompong.Sirikul Jongtanasarsombat, assistant vice-president of the IFCT, saidThailand needed more engineers. Thai education did not produce workerswith appropriate skills for the jobs at hand. There was also a lack ofmarkets, market information, export testing centres and money needed ascapital by small firms.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996Housing projects likely to increase Supalai profitfrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)Real estate firm Supalai Plc expects 40% growth in sales to more top twobillion baht this year, mainly through three housing projects.The new projects are Supalai Grand Park at Bang Na-Trat Road, SupalaiOrchid Park 3 and Supalai Ville at Thon Buri-Pakthor Road."Encouraged by these projects, Supalai's sales volume this year isexpected to reach 2.65 billion baht, up 42% compared to last year'sresult of only 1.9 billion baht," said president Prateep Tangmatitham.Sales from January to September recorded 42% growth to 2.1 billion bahtover the same period last year.Mr Prateep said Supalai's 15 projects will earn the company more than12.6 billion baht in 1997. Under other development schemes, Supalai hasformed a joint venture with local investors in Khon Kaen and Hat Yai todevelop real estate, which it expects to earn more than 1.3 billion bahtin 1997.The company is trying to bring its liability ratio to lower than 2.5:1in 1997, and to below 2:1 in the next 2-3 years.

The committee earlier made a strongcommitment that the organisation's monopoly at Bangkok Port would not beextended. The ministry's endorsement was given without the committee'sconsent," Dr Amnuay said.Currently, the ETO is said to account for only 25% of total truckingtransport services at the port, with 75% belonging to itssub-contractors.Dr Amnuay described the ETO's action as that of a parasite waiting tosuck blood from its fellow Thais, particularly exporters.Liberalisation of the transport industry was the best way to preventthis, he added. "It doesn't mean the government will stop theorganisation's requirement to continue its business. But the governmentneeds to create more open competition among operators in the field."The ETO's board had previously agreed transport services at the portshould be opened to competition because of pressure from customers andother truckers.But the liberalisation plan has been delayed, with Deputy Transport andCommunications Minister Chaipak Siriwat championing efforts for the ETOto continue its port services that provide 87.5% of its annual incomecurrently totalling one billion baht.The port's long-term plan envisages ending the ETO's privileges andencouraging more truckers to offer their services and end bribery andother corruption allegedly fuelled by the monopoly.Mr Chaipak's policy aims not only for the ETO's monopoly to remain, butfor it to directly handle 50% of truck services at the port.Copyright 1996 The Bangkok PostBack to Headline List CopyrightBANGKOK POST via NewsNetOctober 29, 1996MBK shrugs off poll worry: Services takes shape in hope of licencefrom BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)MBK Properties & Development Plc plans to set up a commercial bankdespite political uncertainties posed by the general election.The group was one of the three groups short-listed by the bank selectioncommittee.

These additional handsets will have the same homenumbers.For incoming calls, owners can set all lines to ring simultaneously orjust a particular handset.

This will be 100 baht/month for thesecond handset in addition to 200 baht/month for the first.The airtime fee will be three baht for the first two minutes and 1.50baht for each subsequent minute of each call for each handset used.PCT will cover 1,600 sq km of Bangkok. By end of 1998, the coverage areawill extend to 4,500 sq km to take in outlying areas.Mr Vallobh said he expected more than one million subscribers within thefirst three years.The service could be used in cars travelling at 60 km/h because thesystem's cell sites were close to each other. TA would have to fix cellsites on all 800,000 power poles of the Metropolitan ElectricityAuthority to provide efficient coverage, he said.Motorists travelling at more than 100 km/h would find cellular phonesmore efficient than cordless sets, he noted.TA and Thai Telephone and Telecommunication (TT&T) will ask the TOT toallow them to use the same control frequency that would allow a roamingservice between the two cordless networks.TT&T's subscribers could then use their cordless phones in Bangkok, whileBangkok subscribers could use their sets in the provinces.Both TA and TT&T would have to negotiate their sharing of revenue fromthe roaming service, Mr Vallobh said.TA is also negotiating to provide a cordless service for subscribers tothe TOT's 1.7 million phones in Bangkok in addition to TA's 2.6 millionlines.TOT wants 21% of the revenue but TA considers this to high.TA's multi-media fibre network for the 2.6 million lines in Bangkok hasthe capacity to handle six million lines, Mr Vallobh said.

Salary supplements, orwhat is sometimes known as risk incomes, are determined accordingto management achievements, including the growth rate of assetsand profits, with the ceiling level tripling the base salary.For example, regardless of level of achievements in businessoperations, the maximum salary ceiling for the director of alarge enterprise will not exceed 200,000 yuan. This sum isreasonable under China's current conditions. Introduction of thebase salary-plus system not only inspires enterprise directorsand managers to work harder and restricts abuses of power, butalso takes into account the interest of employees.Implementing the base salary-plus system in state-ownedenterprises will pave the way for forming an orderly professionalentrepreneur market.Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA-PRESS: Changes in Employment Structurefrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996YANGZI WANBAO(Yangtze Evening News)With the acceleration of reform in China's labor system and theimprovement of labor markets, changes have also occurred inemployment structures.First, a two-way migration work patterns is taking shape. Agrowing number of urbanities now seek jobs in rural areas. Amongthe country's 130 million employed by township enterprises, 10percent are urbanities. For example, many urban skilled workersin southern Jiangsu Province prefer township enterprises wherethey can gain higher incomes and have greater life choices. Insome township enterprises, one-third of workers come from cities.Even university graduates and qualified technicians prefer towork at township enterprises. For example, a continuous stream ofuniversity graduates come to the Hongdou Group for employment.The 6,000-employee firm, located in suburban Wuxi City, JiangsuProvince, now employs more than 600 university graduates.Second, the number of employees in the private and individualbusinesses has increased rapidly.

Thecompound is landscaped with lawns, flower beds, fountains and twosquares.The library, scheduled for a limited opening by the endof this year, offers 5,000 seats in 20-odd reading roomsfeaturing books, periodicals, and audio-visual and electronicpackages catalogued in terms of differing disciplines. Thefacility's expansive book lending center offers wide-rangingworks published during the last five-eight years.The library is equipped with computer andtelecommunications technology for the management of purchasing,cataloguing, circulation, public inquiries and lending systems.It will also introduce a CD-ROM system and various specializeddatabases for items such as classical and rare books andcontemporary photo archives. In addition, the complex will beequipped with various audio-visual systems, facilities for theproduction of audio-visual materials, cataloging and monitoringsystems, and satellite  dishes.Deputy Director Wu Jianzhong noted that constantlyexpanding public access to information requires libraries toalter the previous practice of stressing book collections, andinstead place priority on improving services for readers. "Wewill shift the focus of work from simply collecting books toupgrading services,'' said Wu.Library ExpansionStatistics show that the country had 392 scatteredlibraries in large cities at the founding of New China in 1949.By 1994, however, the number had soared to 258,477, withmore than 400,000 employees, housing collections of over 3billion volumes. They facilities included 2,596 public librariesabove the county level, 1,080 university and college libraries,more than 8,000 large and medium-sized libraries serving variousscientific research institutes, and a substantial number ofchildren's libraries and various libraries attached to tradeunions, primary and secondary schools, Party schools and armyunits.Since the 1980s, numerous library buildings featuringdiversified architectural styles have mushroomed in variouslocalities, with a new facility opening every couple of days.The new library for the China National Museum, located inthe western suburbs of Beijing, is the pride of Chinese citizens.The modern facility, which opened in 1987, is the largest libraryin Asia and one of the top five libraries in the world, with itsdesign offering unique national flavor. The complex, with a totalfloor space of 140,000 square meters, currently houses 16.7million volumes, including 280,000 rare books from thecollections of imperial families in various dynasties and famousprivate collections.The Tibet Autonomous Region now has 50 libraries atvarious levels. The first public library in the region was builtby the 18th Army Group of the People's Liberation Army in theearly 1950s. Soldiers led yak carrying gunnysacks full of booksto fill the shelves of the facility.The new Tibet Library, the largest of its type in theregion, opened on July 1 this year. The modern multipurposelibrary, which sits at the highest elevation compared to anylibrary in the world, mainly collects books and materials onTibetan studies, and will gradually be transformed into a majorcenter offering materials to Tibetanologists both at home andabroad, and a major venue for comprehensive public education.China currently has 427 libraries in minority nationalityareas.New TechnologyMany of the libraries have introduced new technologysuch as computers, microfilm, xerox, audio-visual equipment, CDs,automatic transmission and fire- and theft-resistant facilities.Computer technology, the nucleus of modern technology, isgaining increasing popularity. According to a 1995 study of 3,139public, university and scientific research institute librariesnationwide, subject facilities were equipped with 6,521computers, 2,296 terminals, 1,076 databases for differentcategories of information, 3,113 photo copy machines and 1.93million audio-visual packages.The National Library in Beijing, Zhongshan Library inGuangdong Province, and Shenzhen Library are engaged in anextensive effort to developing software and databases. Notableprogress has also been made in establishing a network linked tothe Zhongguancun Library in Beijing, a Beijing-Shanghai-Wuhancomputer network linking libraries of all institutes under theChina Academy of Sciences in the three localities, and asatellite network for libraries attached to the People'sLiberation Army.The National Library, the Beijing Eastern DistrictLibrary and various other libraries currently have reading roomsoffering electronic publications. China's first public computerlibrary--the Zhongnan Computer Library in Guangzhou City--openedearly last year. The facility which occupies 250 square meters inthe Guangzhou Library is equipped with computer operations andsoftware rooms, computer publications reading rooms, computersales halls, and expert reception rooms. The library offersreaders access to more than 100 computers and 200,000 sets ofsoftware free of charge.Capital ShortagesThe public library in the bustling and hot city ofShenzhen provides residents with a quiet and cool place to relax.The current situation, however, is much different from only a fewyears ago when capital shortages prevented the facility frominstalling air-conditioners. A leading local government officialdecreed that the library should be air conditioned prior tooccupation of the municipal government office building.China's library system has developed despite the factthat financial strain has hindered both construction andoperations. Capital shortages have led to the overuse of numerousfacilities, including the National Library in Beijing. Inaddition, constant price hikes for publications in recent yearshave resulted in a decline in the availability of new books andperiodicals in most public libraries. Du Ke, director of theLibrary Division of the Ministry of Culture, noted thatgovernment capital appropriations to public libraries have, infact, increased constantly, with annual funding soaring from lessthan 60 million yuan in the 1980s to over 740 million yuan in1995, a rate far exceeding that for national economic growth andincreases in financial revenue. Nonetheless, the admirable efforthas been unable to fully facilitate the developmental needs oflibraries.Serving Economic DevelopmentQu Jiankang, director of the Shaanxian County Library inHenan Province, was somewhat surprised at a meeting when a farmerpopped in to present him with over a dozen carp. The farmerthanked Qu profusely, saying that the books Qu had sent on fishbreeding techniques and methods for treating aquatic diseases hadprevented him from losing as much as 100,000 yuan."Providing services to spur economic development is oneof our major tasks,'' said Qu. According to statistics for recentyears, despite being handicapped by limited operational funds ofonly 280,000 yuan, the Shaanxian Library has provided varioussectors in the county with information and materials which havehelped to create over 6 million yuan in output value. Uponlearning that the county's chemical fertilizer plant planned tolaunch an art paper manufacturing project, Qu invited thefactory's technology director to the library and provided himwith all related books and materials. The materials helped thefactory to quickly formulate construction and production plansfor the new facility and in turn saved 450,000 yuan inconstruction funds alone.In recent years, libraries at different levels in variouslocalities have provided materials and information for majorstate and local construction projects, and in so  doing haveplayed an extremely important role in the country's economicdevelopment. The National Library has contributed information andmaterials to key projects involving mineral exploration, waterconservancy, metallurgy and geology. The Shanghai Libraryprovided invaluable assistance to the Huangpu River tunnelproject. The Gansu Provincial Library provided assistance toconstruction of the Tianshui-Lanzhou, Lanzhou-Urumqi and Baotou-Lanzhou railways, as well as to survey and design projects forthe Liujiaxia Hydropower Station. The Henan Provincial Libraryjoined in the Yellow River treatment project and the HangzhouLibrary participated in the cross-channel dike project for theQinshan Nuclear Power Plant. The Library of the China Academy ofSciences has provided voluminous materials concerning theecological and environmental impact of the Three Gorges Projecton the Yangtze River. Services provided by the libraries havehelped to solve many technical problems, improve design, expeditethe progress of related projects and save construction funds.Since 1986, libraries nationwide have worked incooperation with responsible departments to promote the SparkProgram, a major project the State Science and TechnologyCommission introduced to expedite the industrialization andcommercialization of the results of scientific and technologicalresearch. The goal of the program is to accelerate local economicdevelopment. Some 70 libraries in Hunan Province have providedmore than 200 local Spark projects with follow-up services,including 85 key projects. The libraries have compiled andprinted more than 40 scientific and technological informationpamphlets and 150 catalogs for specialized publications. Inaddition, they have sponsored 250 practical technology trainingcourses which have attracted over 12,500 people.Special ServicesMany libraries now offer special services, with Beijinglibraries in particular recording notable progress in relatedactivities.A 1986 survey conducted by the East District Libraryrevealed that the 25 clothing manufacturing factories in thedistrict accounting for the majority of both the total outputvalue and number of employees were in urgent need of adaptingthemselves to rapid changes in the clothing market. The libraryimmediately formed a clothing information group. To facilitateconstantly increasing demand, in 1990 the library established theclothing information section with a collection of severalthousand books and periodicals, and scores of video tapes onfashion industries from more than a dozen countries and regions,including the United States, France, Japan, Switzerland andItaly. The information section, now known as the capital'sclothing information center, has introduced reading rooms whichattract numerous garment designers and manufacturers.The West District Library, located in an area withabundant cultural relics and tourism resources, has established atourism materials section which categorizes existing books,periodicals and materials into tourism trends, scenic wonders inChina, scenic sites and folklore in Beijing, and special servicesin the Chinese capital. It has also established cooperativerelations with the Lushan Library in Jiangxi Province, AT&T(China) Co., and various travel services, with the effortdedicated to arranging exchanges and sharing tourism information.Last year, the section served more than 20,000 readers, or 40percent of the library's total number of visitors. The sectionlent more than 90,000 books and periodicals, with the figureaccounting for over 90 percent of the library's total circulationvolume.In recent years, the Decorative Art Materials Section ofthe Haidian District Library has attracted a growing number ofpeople engaged in arts and crafts, decoration and advertisementdesign, and general readers with a strong affinity for the arts.The Chongwen District Library offers a wide-rangingcollection of books on architecture, while the Xuanwu DistrictLibrary is known for its collections of books and materials onfolklore and packaging. The Capital Library is currentlyaccelerating formation of the Beijing Local Documents Database.The past closed management style of Chinese libraries wascharacterized by each facility pursuing the accumulation of largequantities of materials and complete volumes of documents. Theapproach resulted in duplicated collections and prevented thefull use of limited funds. Experts contend that the currentpractice centering on each facility pursuing its own advantagesprovides basic material conditions for the establishment ofcooperation networks which will promote share and inter-librarylending. The formation of said networks will also helprationalize the use of funds.Knowledge PoolTwo-year-old Yangyang frequently visits her grandparentson weekends, with her parents seizing the opportunity to visitthe local library.In recent years, the couple, university graduates whorespectively earned degrees in oceanography and chemistry in thelate 1980s, have regularly visited the local library on Sundaysto update their knowledge and information.Along with the rapid development of the market economyand the increasingly fierce competition in the job andinformation markets, many people, particularly those in rapidlygrowing localities, opt to supplement their knowledge withinformation provided by libraries.The Shenzhen Library's annual practice of issuing newbook cards represents a special occasion in the city. As many as10,000 people often queue in front of the library from dawn todusk, with some even coming on the previous night. According tostatistics, the Shenzhen Library now serves 5,400 readers daily.Rural township libraries have mushroomed in southernJiangsu Province since 1990, with more than 430 townships inSuzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou cities opening facilities by 1994.Each library in the 35 townships in Wuxi County, WuxiCity, have collections exceeding 10,000 volumes. The libraries,which have a total of 600,000 volumes, serve 1.2 million ruralreaders annually, with their combined circulation surpassing 2million volumes.Rural families in southern Jiangsu traditionally hold afamily feast on the evening of the Winter Solstice. On lastyear's Winter Solstice, however, many residents of Luoshe Town,Wuxi County, visited the local library after dinner, filling the300-square-meter reading room. The visitors refused to leavedespite a power outage.

Practice of the Sino-Israeli Demonstration Farm offers a positive answer. By relyingon advanced agrotechnology, China will create a new miracle inagricultural production.The Sino-Israeli Demonstration Farm (SIDF), which is located inthe southeastern suburbs of Beijing, has attracted worldwideattention since its establishment two years ago. No visitor fromany part of the country hesitates to express admiration for thehigh yields brought about by high technology.The four large white greenhouses, the most eye-catchingstructures in the farm, are totally controlled by computers, inwhich high-yield and quality crops introduced from Israel areplanted. According to Zhu Hongfeng, head of the farm, thegreenhouses, which were imported from Israel, are fairlyadvanced. The two insulating layers on the ceilings keep thegreenhouses warm in winter, and protect plants from the scorchingsun and lower the temperature in summer. These devices can bemoved automatically to ensure the necessary temperature fordifferent stages of vegetable growth.The trickle irrigation system, a symbol of Israel's highagrotechnology, crisscrosses the farm's 75-hectare field. Thiswater-efficient system ensures the crops  fully absorb moistureand fertilizer.Israel and China face common problems in agriculture, namelyinfertile land, drought and water shortage. However, the formerhas solved its problems by applying high technology.Chinese agronomists hold that the advanced agrotechnologydisplayed by the farm is highly suitable for China, especiallyfor the arid and water-deficient inland areas in northwestregions, such as Gansu and Ningxia which were widely consideredas places unworthy of agricultural development.A bare fact may well explain why Chinese farmers show such agreat interest in Israel's irrigation system. The system enablesthe SIDF to create several firsts in vegetable production. Forexample, the quarterly output of tomatoes has reached 5,500 kgper mu (1 mu equals 1/15 hectare), three-four times that producedby individual farmer households. Green pepper's output hits15,000 kg per mu, with one pepper weighing 700-800 grams.The key to the success of the farm lies in the country's longingfor agricultural modernization. In many parts of China, farmersstill sow seeds manually and plough their fields with the aid ofox. The backward farming techniques lead to low yields andvulnerability of grain production to natural disasters, typicallyannual flood in the south and drought spells in the north.Due to the underdevelopment of agriculture, China has long beenobsessed by the grain issue and the question of how to fulfillthe growing demand for quality farm produce following theconstant increase of incomes. In addition, the low income fromfarming has driven numerous farmers to cities, resulting in theshort supply of raw materials for industrial production, a majorfactor restricting the development of the national economy.Early this year, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciencesreported that China lags behind Western countries by 15-20 yearsin terms of the comprehensive level of agricultural science andtechnology. The per-unit yield of many crops is lower than theaverage international level. To narrow this gap, China hasintroduced from other countries more than 1,000 advancedagrotechnologies during the past five years. Prior to the year2000, the country plans to invest US$500 million for importinganother 1,000 advanced, applicable agrotechnologies.Some people have asked whether the SIDF mode can be popularizedthroughout the country. Undoubtedly, fine quality farm producewould bring about generous profits. However, if unable to beuniversalized, such high-tech agriculture featuring high input,high output and high profits still faces an unpredictable marketin China.According to Zhu, as the supply of his farm's products currentlyfalls short of demand, Beijing citizens can hardly get them onthe market. In fact, the farm's products are mostly bought byluxury hotels because their price is four-five times that ofordinary vegetables on Beijing market.The SIDF is now trying to lower cost by combining importedtechnology with local farmers' traditional practices. Forinstance, the farm has built brick greenhouses and equipped themwith Israeli trickle irrigation and computer control systems.Saving expenses for importing specially made greenhouses hasenabled the farm to cut the per-mu production cost by severalthousand yuan.Zhu said that the per-capita productivity of his 170-staff farmhas attained a fairly high level and annually earns a net incomeof 50,000 yuan from one mu of vegetable. "If the production scalefurther expands, costs will drop further,'' assured an officialfrom the Ministry of Agriculture.Expansion of the use of high technology is essential for China torealize agricultural modernization and intensification. China iscooperating with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization andother international institutions to explore effective ways forspreading high agrotechnologies. The SIDF has become a base inthis regard. In spring this year, the farm began to host on-sitetraining courses for farmers from all over the country. Thefarmers were taught the skills to grow the varieties bred by thefarm.China plans to increase the contributory rate of science andtechnology to agriculture from 35 percent to 50 percent by theend of this century, and gives priority to importing applicableadvanced technology to enable more Chinese farmers to directlybenefit from agrotechnology.Modern agrotechniques have not only enabled Chinese farmers togain direct economic results, but also provided foreign businesspeople with an opportunity to enter Chinese agricultural market.Officials of the Israeli embassy in China assess the beneficialresults of the SIDF every month, and recently revealed the planof establishing two similar farms in other parts of the country.An official of Chinese Ministry of Agriculture noted that theSIDF has produced an advertising effect.Li Hongyi, head of a Shandong farm, expressed willingness to buyequipment and seeds as those used by the SIDF. He even intendedto employ one or two Israeli agronomists.The SIDF, called by the Chinese as a "modernized agriculturalfactory'', opens up a bright prospect for China's agriculture. Aneconomist noted that the time has come for China to create thesecond miracle in agriculture by relying on high technology.The first miracle emerged in the early 1980s following theabolishment of the people's commune system and introduction ofthe system of contracted responsibility for tilling the land. Thefarmers' enthusiasm was greatly aroused, and in turn thecountry's grain output increased by 80 billion kg in thesubsequent nine years. The effort is commonly regarded as asystem revolution, and now China is envisaging a technologicalrevolution.Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA: Chinese Foreign Ministry News Briefingsfrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996Spokesman Shen Guofang.PI DAWEIChinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang told reportersattending last week's regularly scheduled news briefings thatPrime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh SheikhHasina will pay an official visit to China between September 12-16, 1996, at the invitation of Premier Li Peng.Shen then opened the floor for questions.Q: Would you comment on the two missile attacks the US militarydelivered against Iraq?A: We deeply regret and are strongly dissatisfied with the factthat the United States attacked Iraq with missiles, causingcasualties and property damages. The use of force against asovereign country not only represents a serious violation ofinternational norms, but also heightens the already tensesituation in the region and creates the possibility for seriousadverse effects. The Chinese government reiterates that Iraq'ssovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected. Wesincerely hope that all parties concerned will immediately ceasemilitary operations to relieve the tense situation in the region,and will in turn reach a just and reasonable resolution toproblems lingering from the Gulf War through political dialogueand on the basis of relevant UN resolutions.Q: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PalestinianPresident Yasser Arafat held their first summit on September 4.How does China view the meeting?A: China supports all steps leading to the realization of a justand comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We believe the summitbetween the two leaders will help Israel and Palestine establishmutual trust and resume peace talks at the earliest possibledate. We sincerely hope that all parties concerned will observeprevious agreements in order to remove all remaining obstacles topush forward the peace process under the principle of "land forpeace."Q: The People's Liberation Army Daily recently carried an articleentitled "Losing 1,000 Ounce of Gold is Preferable to Losing OneInch of Land." Does this mean the Chinese government will assumean uncompromising attitude on the issue of the Diaoyu Islands atthe risk of losing 400 billion Japanese yen in loans?A: The issue of Japanese loans is a totally different matter fromsafeguarding China's territorial integrity and sovereignty.Japanese loans to China will benefit bilateral trade and economiccooperation. Nonetheless, the Chinese government offers no roomfor compromise and will take whatever action is necessary tosafeguard China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. We dulynote that China and Japan have disputed control of the DiaoyuIslands. Therefore, we propose that both sides shelvedisagreements and jointly develop resources in the islands.Neither side should resort to any action which will heightentensions concerning the situation.Q: According to recent reports, the Dalai Lama is scheduled tovisit Australia. What is China's position?A: We believe the Dalai Lama is not only a religious figure, butmore importantly a political figure in exile. Therefore, wemaintain that any country maintaining normal diplomatic relationswith China should not host visits by the aforementioned politicalfigure. We also believe that any country maintaining normaldiplomatic relations with China is blatantly interfering inChina's internal affairs by hosting the Dalai Lama.Q: According to recent reports, Taiwan's Li Teng-hui informedAustralian reporters that he would like to visit Australia. Howwould a visit by Li affect Sino-Australian relations?A: China and Australia currently maintain normal diplomaticrelations, with political, trade and economic ties developingrapidly in recent years. Therefore,  Australia should refrainfrom meddling in China's internal affairs on the Taiwan issue. Wesincerely hope that Australia will honor its commitments inaccordance with the joint communique for the establishment ofSino-Australian diplomatic ties by refraining from developingofficial relations with Taiwan. Any other course will seriouslyaffect Sino-Australian relations.Q: German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will meet Chinese ForeignMinister Qian Qichen at the end of September in New York. He alsohopes to visit China in October to pave the way for a Novembervisit by the German president. Does this indicate thenormalization of Sino-German relations?A: China attaches great importance to developing relations withGermany, with economic and political ties expanding rapidly inrecent years. However, various factors earlier this year createda strain in Sino-German relations. We hope the meeting betweenthe German foreign minister and Qian Qichen will be successfuland will in turn return Sino-German relations to a course ofsound development.Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA: The world has reason to watch for whither Japan is heading Japan:Don't Do Anything Foolishfrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996by People's Daily CommentatorIn the last few weeks Japan has carried out a series ofprovocative actions over the Chinese territory, Diaoyu Islands,situated between Taiwan and southern Japan.On July 14, the right-wing Japanese Youth Foundation built alighthouse on Diaoyu Island, the main island of the islets, andthe Japanese government announced an exclusive economic zone of200 nautical miles on July 20, taking in the Chinese islands.Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda then openly claimed thatthe Diaoyu Islands belong to Japan and that there is no need tojustify this claim.On August 18, a right-wing group from Japan's southern Okinawa-ken put up a board on one of the islands with a drawing of theJapanese flag.There are reports that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimotoordered the military to prepare for any contingency and that theJapanese authorities even went so far as to threaten force ifnecessary.The Chinese people will not stand by violation of theirterritorial integrity. The Diaoyu Islands, like Taiwan, are aninalienable and indisputable part of China since ancient times.Evidence dating back as early as the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),when Chinese fishermen conducted activities in this area, provethe islands are part of China.Japan seized Taiwan and its surrounding islands, including theDiaoyu Islands, during the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895. InApril 1895, the government of the Qing Dynasty was forced to signthe Treaty of Shimonoseki, and ceded the islands to Japan.After World War II, a defeated Japan returned Taiwan to China,but privately handed the Diaoyu Islands over to the UnitedStates. In 1971, the US government illegally returned the DiaoyuIslands to Japan, an action the Chinese government stronglyopposed.When Japan and China normalized relations in 1972 and signed theSino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1978, the twocountries, taking overall relations into account, agreed tosettle the issue of the Diaoyu Islands in the future.Japan, however, broke its promise and has intensified its effortsto create instability and stir up trouble. Japan tried tostrengthen the symbolic significance of its occupation of theDiaoyu Island by playing the shameless card of "if I haveoccupation, I have possession."It is well known that in international relationships, the issueof ownership of territory is the most crucial. Japan has upsetthis sensitive balance many times recently and evidently wants totake advantage of the changes in the political situation in EastAsia since the end of the Cold War to demonstrate its power tothe outside world and to test China's determination to safeguardits territory and sovereignty.China has always handled the issue holistically and cherishesfriendly relations with Japan. China's stand on the DiaoyuIslands is to put aside their dispute and jointly exploit theregion on the precondition that China has sovereignty.Over that past 100 years, the Chinese people have never kow-towedto foreign powers. They won back the independence and sovereigntyof the country with the blood and lives of millions of people.Today, if anyone thinks China's 1.2 billion people will surrendereven one inch of soil, they are indulging in fantasy; if anyoneholds the illusion that the Chinese people will yield to foreignforces, they are day dreaming; if anybody wants to take advantageof the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits,they are making a grave mistake. The Chinese people are unitedand adamant about maintaining their territorial integrity.Japan's challenge to China's sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islandsis not accidental but is an inevitable result of emergingrightist elements in Japan's internal political situation andJapan's intention to flex its muscle.To illustrate this tendency recently, many Japanese havedistorted the country's history, glorified its war of aggressionand imbued its countrymen with a sense of militarism.Some Japanese politicians are exaggerating the so-called "Chinathreat," trying their best to sow dissent between China and itsneighboring countries and inventing an excuse for the expansionof its forces.The Japanese government has strengthened the Japan-US securitysystem, expanded the scope of defense beyond Japan's borders andeven talked about "watching for trends of the Chinese military"in its official defense white paper. Japan has continuallyincreased its military expenditure, built up its weaponry andtried its best to send its forces abroad.Asian countries have long expressed their concern that Japanwould embark on its old road of militarism. These fears are notgroundless as this series of activities seem to prove. Asiancountries should tell those expansionist Japanese not to doanything foolish. At the same time, Asia must maintain highvigilance over Japan's actions.Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA: Rightist Comeback in Japan: Cause for Vigilancefrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996by Da JunDiaoyu Islands  Denial of Massacre   Denial of aggression  BalmVisiting Yasukuni ShrineThis summer, Japanese rightists, with the connivance and andsupport of the Japanese government, built a lighthouse anderected a Japanese flag on the Diaoyu Island, the largest of theDiaoyu Islands which have been part of China's territory sinceancient times. This provocative act cannot but arouse strongindignation from the Chinese people as a wanton encroachment uponChina's territory.AttemptsA review of Sino-Japanese relations suggests that Japan began tocovet China's Diaoyu Islands long ago.In the late 1960s, large deposits of oil and natural gas werediscovered off the islands. The Japanese unilaterally took aseries of actions attempting to establish claim over theterritory. They first sent  exploration teams and then cruiseboats to the islands, removing the original Chinese marks andreplacing them with Japanese ones. They also renamed eight isletsin Japanese.In 1978, when China and Japan were negotiating the signing of atreaty of peace and friendship, some members of the Japanese Diet(parliament) demanded that China recognize Japan's sovereigntyover the islands. The Japanese government, in answer to therightists' calls, dispatched patrol boats and airplanes tomonitor Chinese fishing boats working near the islands.In May 1979, the Japanese shipped personnel and equipment toDiaoyu Island and built a helicopter airport there. They alsosent an investigation team and a surveying mission to the area.In October 1990, when the West was imposing sanctions againstChina, Japanese rightists, with an understanding from thegovernment, built a beacon tower on one of the islets. TheJapanese government sent 12 ships and two helicopters to preventTaiwanese fishing boats from moving toward the islands.These facts indicate that Japan's every move on Diaoyu Islandswas designed not only to attempt to seize the resources in thevicinity but also to use the issue to plot against China. Theevents occuring this summer well illustrate the issue.Japan unexpectedly announced that it would redesignate July 20 asOcean Day and set it aside as a national holiday once again --July 20 was a national holiday before World War II. The Japaneseroyal prince and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto attended thecelebrations. On the same day, Japan officially began toimplement the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea andthe 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. By so doing Japanexpanded its waters by more than 10 times -- altogether more than6 million square kilometers, the sixth largest in the world.It seems, therefore, that Japan's celebration of the Ocean Day isnot purely incidental. The seizure of Diaoyu Island would add toJapan's already large waters and resources on its continentalshelf. No wonder the Japanese government connived at therightists' activities on Diaoyu Island.A Rightist ComebackWhile the rightists were staging their shows on Diaoyu Island,the Japanese cabinet adopted the 1996 defense white paper. Theofficial document contained such statements as "continuing towatch for trends of the Chinese military," "Russia no longer athreat to Japan" and "further cementing military cooperation withthe United States." It specifically blamed the military exercisesconducted by the Chinese Liberation Army in March 1996 for"creating tensions across the Taiwan Straits."The publication of the white paper is believed to be a result ofcloser US-Japanese military cooperation, which occurred after USPresident Bill Clinton visited Japan in April this year. Whileexpanding military cooperation with the United States, Japan putChina on top of its hypothetical enemy list.There are other signs that indicate a comeback of rightism inJapan. Some Japanese politicians openly deny the existence of"comfort women" that the Japanese government recruited duringWorld War II for its Imperial Army. Prime Minister Hashimotoopenly visited the Yasukuni Shrine which houses the remains ofmany top Japanese war criminals for worship. An art showfeaturing Japanese atrocities during the Nanjing Massacre of 1937had to be canceled in Osaka because of rightist threats.On August 15, the 51st anniversary of Japan's defeat in World WarII, some Japanese staged a farce in Yasukuni Shrine, reopeningthe old wound of other Asian nations. On that day, some ex-Imperial Army soldiers put on their military uniform with a saberon their belt, parading around the shrine. Some Diet membersjoined the farce in shouting slogans such as "the Great East AsiaWar was a sacred war" and "Tojo was innocent." Then they paidhomage to the shrine honoring the war criminals.In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II,Japan, instead of repenting its war record, intensified itsefforts to justify their acts of war in total defiance of worldopinion. A number of ministers and Diet members denied Japan'shistory of aggression and, in an attempt to divert attention fromthe government's attitude toward World War II, condemned China'snuclear testing instead.The so-called "no-war" resolution that was supposed to assure theworld of Japan's remorse over its past and determination forpeace was adopted by the House of Representative only and failedto address the fundamental issues.Japan has sought to become a political and military power. Inaddition to whitewashing history, it has also broken the taboosof limiting its military spending to less than 1 percent of thegross national product and of not sending forces overseas.Japan's Self-Defense Forces, armed with the most advancedoffensive weapons and spending US$50 billion annually, havebecome a military force to be reckoned with. In 1996, Japanexpanded its range of defense to include the entire Asia-Pacificregion. These developments have aroused suspicion and vigilancefrom many of Japan's Asian neighbors, including China.RootsAfter the end of World War II, although some major war criminalssuch as Hideki Tojo were condemned to hang by the InternationalTribunal, a number of other die-hard militarists who heldunshirkable responsibility for launching that war of aggressionwere shielded by the occupying US forces as part of the US ColdWar strategy. Shortly after the war, many war criminals who hadnot paid for their military crimes were set free by the UnitedStates or its allies. Aided by rightists in the political andfinancial circles, these ex-war criminals made a comeback in thepolitical arena and assumed major government offices, includingthe office of prime minister. The question of whether that warwas a just or an unjust one, therefore, has never been answeredin clear-cut terms in Japan.In sharp contrast, Germany, which was one of the three Axispowers during World War II, took a completely different attitude.In 1970, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt knelt down in frontof the Warsaw Monument in memory of the Jews persecuted by NaziGermany during World War II. The world responded withforgiveness. That act was possible because Germany under jointoccupation by the Allied powers took on a demilitarized approachto history. In Germany, war criminals and those associated withNazism were under strong pressure from the government and thesociety. Even to this day, Nazi war criminals at large are stillbeing hunted down. The Germans have been appraised of the Fascistcrimes and their grave consequences. Attempts to revive Nazismare getting nowhere in Germany.Japan's economic success has also lent to the uprise of theconservative forces in Japan. With rightism and nationalismrunning rampant, many Japanese choose not to confront theirhistory of aggression and disregard national feelings of otherpeoples. Some Japanese attempt to cover up aggression in thetextbooks and the media. On the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima andNagasaki, they confuse the perpetrators with victims of war.Propped up by a sense of racial superiority, they increasinglylook down upon other Asian nations. In the eyes of many Japanese,Japan is fast becoming a major power in the world.Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA: Backgrounder: History Proves Diaoyu Islands Are China's Territoryfrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996China  Russia  DPRK  ROK  Japan  Diaoyu Islands  Ryukyu IslandsTaiwan ProvinceThe Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea between China andJapan, have belonged to China since ancient times. The islandsinclude some small islands and reefs, with the Diaoyu Island thelargest one covering an area of five square kilometers. Lackingfresh water, no one can live there.The islands are 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan, 200nautical miles east of China's mainland and 200 nautical mileswest of Japan's southernmost island Okinawa.Geologically the islands are attached to Taiwan. The watersaround the islands are 100 to 150 meters deep and there is a2,000-meter deep oceanic trench between the islands and Japan'sOkinawa islands.Fishermen from China's Taiwan and Fujian and other provinces havefished and collected herbs here for centuries.The islands are recorded in a book published during the rule ofYong Le (1403 to 1424 AD) in the Ming Dynasty, more than 400years before Japan claimed discovery of the Diaoyu islands in1884. Since then many historical documents refer to the islands.In the 15th century during the Ming Dynasty, China included theDiaoyu Islands into its coastal defense area. In 1556, General HuZongxian was appointed governor to fight Japanese pirates anddefend the coastal area including the Diaoyu Islands.A map published in Japan between 1783 and 1785 marking theboundary of the Ryukyu Kingdom showed the Diaoyu Islands asbelonging to China.Japan never questioned China's sovereignty over the islandsbefore the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895.In April 1895, the government of the Qing Dynasty was forced tosign the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which China ceded the wholeisland of Taiwan and its surrounding islands including the PenghuIslands to Japan.Only since then has Japan had its own name for the area where theDiaoyu Islands are located. Before that, Japanese maps marked theislands by their Chinese names.Japan was occupied by the United States after it was defeated inWorld War II.In 1951, Japan and the United States illegally signed a treaty inSan Francisco without the presence of China, which was one of thevictor countries in the World War II.Although Article 2 of the treaty said that Japan surrendered itsclaim over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, Article 3 wronglyassigned the Diaoyu Islands, which Japan had stolen from China,and other islands, to the Ryukyu zone which was under US control.The then Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai lodged a strong protest andsaid the Chinese government would never recognize the SanFrancisco Treaty.In a statement on territorial waters in 1958, the Chinesegovernment said that Japan should return all the territory of thePeople's Republic of China including Taiwan and the islandsaround it to China.On November 11, 1969, Japan and the United States signed anagreement to return the Okinawa islands to Japan. In 1971, theUnited States, proceeding from its Cold War policy against China,returned the area under its trusteeship including the DiaoyuIslands to Japan.The Japanese government thereby regarded the islands as a part ofits Okinawa-ken prefecture and included them in the "air defensedistinguishing rim" of its Self-Defense Forces.On this situation, the Chinese government issued a solemnstatement on December 30, 1971, announcing that the Diaoyuislands are islands attached to Taiwan and they, like Taiwan,have always been an alienable part of Chinese territory sinceancient times.Consequently, it is an indisputable fact that the Diaoyu Islandshave historically been a part of China's territory.The issue of the Diaoyu Islands once served as an obstacle to thenormalization of Sino-Japanese relations and the conclusion ofthe Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Taking intoconsideration the overall interest to develop Sino-Japanesefriendship, the then Chinese and Japanese governments agreed tosettle the issue in the future.However, the Japanese side has broken its promise repeatedly andprovoked incidents one after another in recent years in anattempt to seize the islands.Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA: US Unilateral Action Protestedfrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996China will by no means accept the unilateral action by the UnitedStates of cutting China's 1996 textile export quota, a spokesmanfor the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation saidon September 7.The United States announced on Friday that it would cut itsimport quota of this year's 13 categories of textiles from Chinaby 195,001 dozen and 134,029 kilograms, alleging that Chinesetextile products had been trans-shipped.The spokesman described the cut as a severe violation of thetextile agreement reached between China and the United States,because the US government took the action unilaterally withoutpresenting sufficient evidence and without full consultations.After the United States presented a number of illegal textiletrans-shipment cases to China at the end of October 1995,according to the spokesman, the Chinese side made a carefulinvestigation. The two sides exchanged views in Beijing betweenMarch 25 and 27 this year, conscientiously checking relatedmaterials of these cases. said the spokesman.Judging by the materials provided, some cases were engineeredeither by persons engaged in trans-shipment or by importers, andothers by individuals engaged in trans-shipment in collaborationwith importers, the spokesman stated and added that the Chineseenterprises were wholly innocent of the transactions.To further check the cases, the Chinese side wrote to the US sideon April 26 for more evidence. To date, however, the US side hadnot provided any, but instead has made a unilateral assumption,the spokesman noted. The Chinese government will by no meansaccept it, he stressed.The spokesman pointed out that the US government has continuouslyraised obstacles to China's export of textiles to the UnitedStates in recent years, severely hindering the Sino-US textiletrade.He said that the Chinese government hopes that the Clintonadministration will reconsider its decision, with a standconducive to the development of Sino-US trade, and cancel theimport deduction action.Otherwise, the spokesman said, the Chinese government will haveto respond further and the US side will be responsible for theconsequences.Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA: Minority Cities Step Up Openingfrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996A number of cities in ethnic minority regions of China have madesatisfying achievements in foreign trade and inter-city economiccooperation, according to a meeting of mayors from capital citiesof the country's autonomous regions which was held recently inHohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia.Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, completed370 economic cooperation projects valued at 400 million yuan overthe past five years.

Jiangxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Hainan haveincreased their early rice production, but Anhui, Hubei andSichuan provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, allof which have experienced heavy floods, were unable to meet lastyear's rice yield.With bumper harvests and high sale prices, each farmer expects toenjoy a net income of 1,800 yuan this year, an increase of about5 percent over last year.However, cotton harvests this year will probably decrease by morethan 1 million tons from the 4.5 million tons harvested lastyear, according to agricultural sources.Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA: Healthy School Mealsfrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996Students who eat lunch at school can expect safer and morenutritious meals, following a new regulation on the hygiene ofschool meals.The regulation was introduced by the Ministry of Public Healthrecently and is targeted at improving the quality of schoolmeals, reducing cases of food poisoning and guaranteeing thehealthy physical development of Chinese children.Under this regulation, all staff preparing and distributingschool meals must receive professional training in nutrition. Themeals must meet national hygiene standards and be properlypackaged to avoid contamination during transportation.The regulation also encourages each school to assign a specialsupervisor to oversee the general quality of the meals.The ministry has also made public the daily intake of nutrientsrecommended for children as reference for meal providers.Schools are required to order meals only from licensed producers.They must set up facilities for storing the meals hygienicallyand for students to wash their hands and clean utensils.Meal suppliers and schools who violate the above regulations willbe punished according to the food hygiene legislation. Seriouscases will be brought to court.In Beijing, about 20 percent of all school children eat schoolmeals, according to a sample survey of 1,100 schools taken lastyear.About 5 percent of the meals are provided by individualproducers, the rest by school canteens.School lunches are convenient for both students and theirfamilies, but some meals are inadequate and pose a threat to thestudents' health, said Zhu Peifu, a spokesman from the Ministryof Public Health.

It was also the last grand gathering of top worldarchivists for this century.The theme of the congress is ''archives at the end of thecentury, taking stock and looking ahead.''Archives are the authentic recordings of the social activities ofhuman beings, stepping stones of the progress of humancivilization and an important component of the world culturalheritage, the Chinese Premier said.He called upon the international archive community to furtherpreserve and enhance the world's valuable heritage and provideauthentic historical records for future generations.China has a long history and is a nation with a brilliantculture, Li said, adding that thanks to the fine tradition of along-standing commitment to archives, the Chinese culture hasbeen carried forward from generation to generation and theChinese civilization maintains its strong cohesive force.He said the Chinese government always looks upon the archives asa major undertaking for preserving the original features of anation and as an important resource for the administration anddevelopment of a country.Governments at all levels attach importance to strengtheningguidance and supervision over archival work and have brought suchwork in line with the agenda of various administrations andsocial-development programs to ensure continuous and healthyprogress."Archives have played an important role in the Chinese reform andopening policy and in its socialist modernization drive,'' Lisaid.The congress discussed the history and future of archival work invarious countries, global trends in legislation on archives, thedevelopment strategy of international archival circles and otherimportant issues.Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA: Forum on Asia: A Commitment to Peacefrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996China's destiny is closely linked with that of other countries inAsia, Chinese Premier Li Peng said while addressing the 21stCentury Forum."China's development needs a stable and prosperous Asia; andAsia's development needs a stable and prosperous China," Li addedin his keynote speech entitled "The Impact of China's Developmentand the Rise of Asia on the World".The premier stated that China will always be committed to worldpeace. "The Chinese government and the Chinese people caregreatly about the future of Asia, and we stand ready to work withother Asian countries for the stability and development of thisregion," Li added.The forum, sponsored by the country's top political advisorybody, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference(CPPCC), was closed on September 6 after three days ofdiscussions. Over 500 statesmen and scholars from across theglobe, including former US President George Bush, former USSecretary of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger and formerWest German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, attended the forum.The participants discussed China's role in the next century andfuture political and economic trends for Asia's development.The forum concluded that Asia has a promising 21st century andthat it should contribute even more to world peace anddevelopment.According to Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, one of theparticipants at the forum, the next century will see Asia recoverits place in the world."For East Asia to maintain its rapid growth, peace and stabilitymust be secured. East and West together are responsible for thefuture," Lee remarked while addressing the forum.He also suggested that various nations learn to accommodate andadjust to each other, even when they cannot agree.He said that although most Western analysts view the rise ofChina as a de-stabilizing influence on the present world order,China has the power to demonstrate that, in the year 2020, ahuge, prosperous nation of 1.3 billion people, with a per-capitaGDP about one-fourth of that in the United States, can only bebetter for the world than an impoverished and unstable nation ofthe same population.Lee emphasized that growth in China and the rest of East Asiawill provide opportunities for the West, and will also produce asteadier global balance, both economic and strategic.Talking about relations between the two sides of the TaiwanStraits, Lee said that he considered it impossible for Taiwan tobe independent against the will of a united and an economicallypowerful China.In his opinion, the two sides of the Straits should not get intomilitary competition, and neither the United States nor Europeshould look for excuses to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan.Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in his remarksat the forum that the United States and China have a common stakein Asia's progress and stability and must work together to make a"decisive contribution to work order"."Some in America are calling for a containment policy towardChina as they watch her rise to industrial strength. But this isan illusion," Kissinger stated emphatically, adding, "Such apolicy would have exactly the opposite effect and will have notakers."Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA-CULTURE: Science Competition for Young Studentsfrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996Awards for the Fourth China "Radar Watch" Science Competition foryoung students were presented in Beijing on August 23, 1996.The goal of the competition, funded by the Swiss-based Radar Co.and sponsored by science associations from Beijing, Shanghai andGuangdong, is to evoke a zest for learning science and enhancethe actual applications capabilities of youngsters.Some 900 students participated in the event which lasted forthree and a half months.

In humanchallenge to the limit of physical potential, it is not enough tomerely rely on the arduous training of athletes. They should knowat what time and under what condition can each muscle of the bodygive forth the greatest strength, and be good at using it, justas they should do in relation to a precision instrument. This iswhat the sports scientific research studies.According to Lu Xiaojie, deputy head of the Science andTechnology Division under the Department of Science and Educationof the SPCSC, the domestic sports scientific research focuses onfour fields of sports psychology, fatigue elimination, skillappraisal and skill examination. The commission has allocatedspecial money since 1985 for scientific research and technicalservice. It put in 2 million yuan in 1994 and organized 200experts from 20 scientific research institutions into groups toapply research results in practice. Among the 56 scientificresearch subjects, major events, such as gymnastics, swimming andweightlifting, involve excellent athletes Wang Junxia, GaoHongmiao and Cheng Xiaoyan who have special subject groups tohelp monitor and instruct their training.Li Furong, director of the SPCSC Training Bureau, noted that animportant experience of the Chinese Table-Tennis Team inmaintaining their dominance in the world for over three decadesis placing priority on theory. In effect, the remarkable progressmade in many other sports events is inseparable from sportsscientific research. The experts of the Chinese Swimming Teamexamine and monitor the physiological and biochemical indexes ofeach athlete every day. It often happens that the detailed dataof the morning training have already been delivered to thecoaches before the start of afternoon training, thus effectivelysupporting the scientific sports training.It's a long-term task for sports scientific research to enhancethe scientific training to a higher level. According to Lu, theapplied basic research in China mainly relies on the over 40institutions and some universities throughout the country. Arelatively stable scientific research team has been formed. Everyyear, a group of graduates from Tsinghua, Peking and BeijingMedical Science universities will continue their advanced studiesat the sports institutions and will become the reserve force ofChina's sports scientific research."The competition of athletes on the arena is actually a test ofthe level of the coaches' scientific training. The athletes withexcellent coaches have grasped the initiative of winning.'' saidYuan Weimin, vice-minister the SPCSC and the world-famous coachwho had led the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team to marvelousachievements.In 1982, the SPCSC set up a special office of cultural educationin charge of the training of coaches. As briefed by Li Quanqiang,deputy head of the office, the current coaches' training systemconsists of four parts including academic education, professionaltraining, short-term training and information service. Accordingto a survey at 29 provinces and cities in 1995, 61 percent of the25,000 full-time coaches have received an education at or abovecollege level, 16 percent of whom have the same level ofeducation as undergraduates.During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the SPCSCwill carry out a wider professional training plan for coachesthroughout the country in order to provide basic training forover 90 percent coaches, accelerating the construction ofteaching materials and a teachers' contingent and finally form atraining network with several training centers at the core,covering more areas nationwide. Beginning from the year 2000,those coaches who haven't got a qualified certificate ofprofessional training will not be allowed to apply for positionor promotion.Analysed by SPCSC officials, competition on the arena in the next15 years will be manifest more and more as the competition forscience and technology and the Science and Education Program willhelp prepare China's athletics for future competitions.Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA-CULTURE: Female Orchestra Graces Beijing Stagefrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996The Women's Philharmonic Orchestra (WPO), consisting of 80 femalemembers led by the renown conductor Zheng Xiaoying, presented amid-August concert in the Beijing Concert Hall.The audience was delighted with the repertoire which included theoverture for The Marriage of Figaro and various selections by theorchestra's string section.

The advanced technology effectively overrides theinadequacies of the previous network and provides immediatepossibilities for the internationalization of China's credit cardindustry.by Li RongxiaerCopyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA-BUSINESS: New Measure for Foreign Exchangefrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996On July 1 this year, the People's Bank of China introduced ameasure of allowing foreign-funded enterprises to deal directlywith banks when settling or selling foreign exchange.Implementation of the new measure represents a major step leadingto the eventual convertibility of the renminbi under currentaccounts, and has helped to link China more closely with theinternational economic system. In addition, it has enabledforeign-funded enterprises to promote efficiency when settling orselling foreign exchange, and has strengthened the confidence ofoverseas investors in the mainland market.Implementation of the new measure has narrowed the gap betweenChina's existing exchange control system and stipulations inArticle 8 of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.The effort has also demonstrated China's determination to furtherits opening policy. At the same time, ongoing implementationeffort has created favorable conditions for ensuring the futurefree convertibility of the renminbi.Application of the new measure has provided a favorableenvironment for promoting the economic development of inlandChina, and has exerted major influence in the following areas. Ithas enabled foreign-funded enterprises to promote efficiency insettling and selling foreign exchange, with said enterprises nowenjoying the same rights as domestic enterprises to buy foreignexchange under current accounts. In addition, they can settle andsell foreign exchange by presenting appropriate documentation tobanks and the foreign exchange control administration has noneed to examine or approve them.The new measure permits foreign-funded enterprises to completeall formalities for the settlement and sale of foreign exchangewith banks, or to buy and sell foreign exchange through foreignexchange regulation centers as before. The measure thus expandschannels available for foreign-funded enterprises to buy and sellforeign exchange.Banks can now determine exchange rate quotations in accordancewith market supply and demand. Service charges are waived andexchange rates for purchases of over US$1 million are subject tonegotiation. Bank calculations for foreign exchange are moreflexible than those at foreign exchange regulation centers.The new measure has greatly reduced the 3-4-day period foreign-funded enterprises were previously required to complete alltransaction procedures at foreign exchange regulation centers.The new measure enables traders to immediately settle accounts inbanks.In addition, the Chinese government has standardized marketmanagement by tightening supervision and control of the exchangeaccounts of foreign-funded enterprises.by Li RongxiaCopyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA-BUSINESS: News in Brief: China plans to offer various majortransnational oil companies...from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996China plans to offer various major transnational oil companiesthe opportunity to participate in a number of new cooperativeprojects in petroleum and gas exploration and development.Cooperative ventures will involve risk exploration for oil andgas in west China and the Songliao Plains, with efforts to tapnatural gas reserves focusing on Sichuan Province and the Qaidamand Tarim basins.China has launched cooperative land oil exploration projects in21 provinces and autonomous regions.

Delman formerly worked inthe China office of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, andnow serves as director of the China-EU Center for AgriculturalTechnology (CECAT) which was established in 1990.CECAT, a highly successful agricultural technology popularizationcenter comparable to the Sino-Israeli Demonstration Farm, islocated in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. CECAT has scoredremarkable success over the past five years by playing anintermediate role in promoting both domestic and overseasagrotechnological and economic cooperation. The EU Committee hasdecided to continue its investments in the center. Thus far,investments from China and EU have totaled well over 100 millionyuan.Delman, an eyewitness of China's agricultural development overthe past 10-plus years, provided the following answers toquestions during a recent interview:Question:  How wide is the gap between Chinese  and modernEuropean agriculture?Answer:  China can learn at least two very important things fromEurope. The first and foremost lesson centers on raisingagricultural efficiency, a major issue currently facing China,and in particular, raising the economic efficiency of individualfarmers. Secondly, China has consistently emphasized increasedgross output, but it should also consider eliminating waste.China wastes excessive amounts of grain, vegetables, fruit andmeat between the harvest and purchasing cycle. Nonetheless,technology is readily available to solve the related basicproblems.The key problem concerns the availability of land, or the scaleof a farm. A small farm makes it difficult to raise efficiency.The solution rests with private ownership, a previous practicewhich seems not to work on Chinese agriculture. Yet anothermeasure centers on practicing economy of scale by mechanizingjoint production, which has already been introduced in many ofChina's major suburban areas. The rural population in some areashas dropped, with the figure for Chongqing City standing at only5 percent of the total, or the same level as Denmark. On theother hand, however, the rural population in Sichuan Provinceaccounts for between 60-70 percent of the total. Therefore, Chinashould formulate policies in accordance with the population,especially in southern areas where there are sharp contradictionsbetween population and land.Another problem centers on high prices. China Daily recentlyreported that prices for several agricultural products havesurpassed prices on the world market. The problem is most likelythe result of high production costs, excessive waste and poorcirculation efficiency. In terms of the latter, the large numberof intermediate organizations have led to price differences forfarm produce. While similar problems exist in European countries,but the gaps involved are much less noticeable. For example,farmers in Denmark and the Netherlands control the entirecirculation process from production to consumption. I recentlylearned that China's Ministry of Agriculture will  introduce afarm produce wholesale market as part of its ``Vegetable Basket''project to protect the interests of both producers and consumers.China's high prices and low-level production technology make itpossible to solve all related problems, and the centralgovernment has announced it will raise the level of investmentand technology in agriculture.Q: Will technology play a major role in China's agriculturalsector?A:  The market is the key factor, with one of the major roles oftechnology being to provide products for the market. Animalhusbandry developed rapidly on China's eastern plains followingan effort by the Ministry of Agriculture to promote the use ofstraw as feed. The ensuing success proves it wrong to believethat the area lacked potential for animal husbandry. Thelivestock market on the plains is indeed more promising thanthose in the Inner Mongolian and Xinjiang Uygur autonomousregions due to its close proximity to consumers and low costs.Raising the efficiency of agriculture depends on a number offactors, including technology, organization and the type ofeconomic system. CECAT primarily focuses on providing technologyneeded to solve problems, to meet the needs of the market, and tohelp farmers raise both their income levels and living standards.Technological problems demanding prompt solutions center onspecialized feed and searching for grain replacements. In thisregard, China has introduced unconventional feed products tosustain 20 million head of cattle in developed livestock areas inHebei, Henan and Shandong provinces.Q: What is the scope of Sino-European agrotechnologycooperation?A:  China can easily find cooperative partners in Europeancountries. Earlier this year, CECAT organized a visit by adelegation of 20-odd North European fishing companies interestedin providing fisheries technology to China. Next year, theNetherlands will provide a soft loan of US$5 million for theconstruction of an animal protein feed plant in Chengdu, capitalof Sichuan Province. CECAT is directly involved in the projectwhich looks very promising since China faces a shortage of animalprotein feed and related prices continue to rise.Countries with close cooperative relations with China includeDenmark, the Netherlands, France and Britain. I firmly believethere is also great potential for cooperative relations with anumber of other countries. Spain faces severe water shortages onthe same scale as China. I visited the former last year and foundextensive Spanish technology which would highly usable to China,especially northern areas. CECAT is currently extending greateffort to promote agricultural cooperation between China andSpain.Q: What are the prospects for Chinese agriculture to attractforeign investment?A:  Regardless of certain difficulties, there is still greatpotential for some projects to attract foreign investment. Risingprices for Chinese agricultural products will serve as yetanother magnet for attracting foreign investment. In addition,demand will continue to increase along with the constantly risingincome levels of Chinese citizens. I regularly tell foreign food-processing businesses of the vast potential for food markets inChina's major cities over the next 10 years. Some companies,including breweries, meat and dairy processors, have alreadybegun operations in China.The key to attracting investors rests with the transparency ofChina's entire system. The level of transparency is, in fact,much higher than that of only 10 years ago. For example, a fewshort years ago prices for farm produce seemed to be regarded asstate secrets. Now, however, prices are regularly carried bypublications such as Farmer's Daily. While investing in China ismuch easier than ever before, success and the level of returnsrest with the type of project and one's understanding of themarket. CECAT is working to help raise the level of transparencyby providing foreign firms with timely information concerning thesituation in China.Q: You have observed Chinese agriculture for the past 10 years.Can China solve its grain and agricultural issues?A: China has great prospects for the gradual development ofagricultural development. While China currently imports somegrain, the volume is significantly lower than some foreignclaims. Chinese agriculture can ensure the country's needs, withthe growth rate of grain output outstripping the populationgrowth rate for the past 10 years. While grain development hasbeen somewhat sluggish, areas such as meat and animal husbandryhave been growing rapidly, thereby indicating China's vastresources and potential.Copyright 1996 Beijing ReviewBack to Headline List CopyrightBEIJING REVIEW                                via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA: THE FOURTH CHINA BEIJING REAL ESTATE EXHIBITIONfrom BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996Time: 9 am-16:30 pm, September 25-28, 1996Place: No. 1 and 2 Exhibition Halls of ChinaPlaceNo.1 and No.2 Exhibition Halls of China World Trade Center(No.1 Jianguomenwai St. Beijing)ConsultantsBeijing Municipal Administration CommitteeReal Estate Market Council Under the China Real EstateAssociationSponsorBeijing Municipal Housing and Land Administration BureauSubject* Exhibition sale and leasing of office buildings, apartments,villas, normal residences and various houses for business;* Transfer of land use rights, talks on investment projects, andreal estate trust management and evaluation;* Information release;* Real estate policy consultations, and mortgage loans.Tel: (86-10) 64049839, 64030762Fax: (86-10) 64030661 Yinyan: A Would-Be World-Known Brand1.

President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has begun to use decrees (medidas provisorias) to implement essential reforms, thereby skirting the need to secure a two-thirds congressional majority, and without putting at risk the stabilisation achieved through the Plano Real. For first of these came on 19 June, when Cardoso announced a series of incentives for manufactured exports, which have suffered from the Plano Real's high interest rates and over-valued currency. These were in part a response to heavy pressure from the Sao Paulo employers' organisations, which had warned that they were no longer in a position to compete. The government was forced to admit that some industries had been made to suffer as a result of the stabilisation policies adopted in January 1995, and the time had come to help them out. The main element of the export incentives is a US Dollars 1bn credit line, to be administered by the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDES). Loans will be made over 15 months at interest rates of 5.5% above Libor. That will mean a one-third reduction in financial costs, according to the new planning minister, Antonio Kandir. Ten sectors are to benefit from the new facilities: footwear, clothing, car parts, furniture, ornamental stones, ceramics, domestic appliances, electronic goods, tools and plastics. The shoe, textile and car parts industries are in dire need of restructuring to make them competitive with imports in the newly liberalised market.  The government hopes the stimulus will add some US Dollars 1bn to the US Dollars 46.5bn in exports registered last year. Cardoso has pointed out that the impressive expansion in Brazil's foreign trade in recent years has still not made much impact on overall world trade: Brazil accounts for less than 1% of the total. The Sao Paulo employers' association, Fiesp, has welcomed the measures as the equivalent of a devaluation of the Real -which the government has ruled out. Kandir's appointment in place of Jose Serra (see Page 7, inside), has also been welcomed by the private sector as an indication that the privatisation programme will be pushed through more energetically than in the recent past. Despite his identification with the Collor Plan, with its confiscation of private savings, Kandir is a repected technocrat who is expected to get things done.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL REPORT  via NewsNetJuly 11, 1996 BRAZIL: LAND: CARDOSO THREATENS TO HALT INVASIONS: BUT AT SAME TIME RHYTHM OF EXPROPRIATIONS IS PICKING UP The strains that continuing conflict in the countryside is putting on government policy were demonstrated in mid-June by two apparently contradictory developments: President Cardoso warned that land occupations would in future be treated as a national security issue, with the army being used to evict invaders; and the estate where such an eviction led to a massacre in April was expropriated by the agrarian reform ministry. Maranhao incident. Cardoso's tougher line with the Movimento dos Sem-Terra (MST) was partly explained by an incident in the forests of Maranhao state, where three security guards and one landless labourer were killed on 13 June when the guards tried to prevent MST members from re-occupying a logging estate from which they had previously been expelled. Fears that MST tactics would lead to growing violence in the countryside have led landowners to recruit private security guards to protect their estates, and the government is concerned that local militants may be out of the control of the MST leadership. These fears appeared to be confirmed on 21 June, when a Para landowner, Carlos Alberto Oliveira Neto, blamed the MST for the violent occupation of his property near Conceica de Araguaia, in which a foreman was wounded and 13 workers kidnapped. But the MST said the attack was the work of gumnen trying to take advantage of the turbulence caused by pressure for land reform. MST defiant. The MST gave its answer to Cardoso when, on 20 June, 200 activists occupied the local government building in Vitoria, state capital of Espirito Santo state. They had earlier staged several invasions of agrarian reform ministry installations, to the annoyance of minister Raul Jungmann. He had already announced that the Macaxeira estate in Para, where 19 MST members were killed by military police on 17 April, would be taken over and distributed among about 600 people. The agrarian reform institute, Incra, had earlier declined to expropriate the 6,000 hectare estate, after its owners claimed it was properly and productively run. Another Incra inspection subsequently established that this was not true. On 24 June, President Cardoso ordered the expropriation of 21 properties totalling 31,600ha for distribution to 1,239 families belonging to the MST and the moderate small farmers' association, Contag, in Para, Bahia and Minas Gerais. This operation brought the total area of land taken over (with payment to the owners) since Jungmann took over at the end of April up to 427,937ha, for distribution to 11,340 families. Contag leader Francisco Urbano said, however, that he did not believe the government would meet its target of 180,000 families settled on their own land over the next three years. ARAGUAIA BODIES SEARCH A team of Argentine forensic anthropologists has joined the search for 10-15 bodies of the so-called 'Araguaia guerrillas', allegedly tortured and killed during the 1972-76 campaign in Para (see RB-96-05). Operations began in the Maraba area on 29 June.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL REPORT  via NewsNetJuly 11, 1996 BRAZIL: EMPLOYMENT: TWO MILLION JOBS LOST IN SEVEN YEARS: BUT GOVERNMENT INSISTS SITUATION IS IMPROVING The news that manufacturing industry in Sao Paulo state had created 503 new jobs in the second week of June (see Pages 4-5) was of scant comfort to the unions that have been counting the cost of recession and restructuring in Brazil's industrial heartland. It was certainly not enough to persuade the trade unions that called the first general strike for five years on 21 June to drop plans for another such day of action. IBGE figures. Figures from the national statistical institute, IBGE, in late May, indicated that unemployment had increased by 38.62% over the previous year, and by 6.03% in April alone. That at least was lower than the 6.38% registered in March, but well up on the 4.35% in April 1995. More than half of all lay-offs over the past year were in Sao Paulo. The unions' own statistical department, Dieese, calculated in mid-June that more than 2m people were unemployed in April in five of the main cities: Sao Paulo, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba and Brasilia. Unemployment in Sao Paulo was a record 15.9% in that month, Dieese reported. This figure was disputed, however, by presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral, who preferred to lump Sao Paulo in with five other big cities. The overall unemployment figure for those was 5.7% in February and 6.38% in March, he said. Since then unemployment had begun to fall, he added, as government job-creation programmes began to work. The ministry of labour reports that 2.1m jobs have been lost over the past seven years. It attributes the phenomenon to a combination of economic stabilisation, technological change and the high cost to employers of taking on workers. These job losses took place during a period in which the economically active population increased from 64m to 71m, the ministry noted.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL REPORT  via NewsNetJuly 11, 1996 BRAZIL: HEALTH & POLITICS: DEATH TOLL MOUNTS IN HOSPITALS CRISIS: GERIATRIC CLINIC SCANDALS FOCUS SOCIAL POLICY CONCERNS Growing unease among government supporters about its social policies -or lack of them- has found a focus in a series of scandals and disasters in the health service. Health minister Adib Jatene, a leading heart surgeon, threatened to resign when it was rumoured that incoming planning minister Antonio Kandir would veto his pet scheme for funding public hospitals with an earmarked tax on financial transactions. This tax, known as the CPMF, could raise up to US Dollars 6bn a year. Clinic closed. The scale of the problems was underlined at the beginning of June when Jatene was forced to order the closure of a Rio geriatric hospital, Santa Genoveva, where 93 old people had died since April as the result of bacterial infections caused by contaminated water, decomposing food and out-of-date medicines. They were also found to be suffering from malnutrition. One patient told O Globo that they were sometimes given meals containing dog food. Jatene also ordered the transfer of 300 other patients considered to be at risk, and promised to begin civil and criminal proceedings against the owners of the clinic, which he described as in a disastrous state after a personal visit. The proprietors of Santa Genoveva, two wealthy businessmen with interests in 10 other geriatric and psychiatric clinics in Rio de Janeiro, were subsequently arrested in late June. The health ministry and local authorities ordered an immediate inspection of 37 other geriatric hospitals in Rio state -suggesting that such supervision has been absent in the past. The use of substandard and unsupervised private hospitals is one of the many widespread problems in the over-stretched and under-funded Brazilian health system.  Contaminated water was also found to be the underlying cause of a disaster at a renal dialysis clinic in Pernambuco, where 55 people had died by the beginning of June. An investigation by Veja magazine revealed that the Instituto de Doencas Renais (IDR) in Caruaru, in the arid outback of the state, had been using water contaminated with blue algae supplied by tanker lorries that cut corners in the purification process. It was found that the IDR's internal procedures for checking filters were inadequate, and regulation by the health authority was non-existent. It is clear from the above that not all the health service's problems derive from insufficient resources. Further criticism came in a May report prepared by two Brazilian consultants for the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which estimated that the government wasted at least US Dollars 2bn last year through a combination of poor management and corruption. It pointed to a conspiracy by hospital administrators and health ministry officials to divert public funding into their own pockets. One of the favourite wheezes, according to the report, is for hospitals linked to the federal health system, SUS, to claim funding for non-existent patients, or for services that are not provided. Ageing population. Brazil's problems with geriatric care can only become more severe. Old people are the fastest-growing sector of the population (53% since 1980, compared with 44% for the population of working age). By the year 2000 the country will have 8.6m people over the age of 65 and 18m by 2020. As a World Health Organisation report notes, it does not have the infrastructure needed to look after them. On the contrary: the WHO notes that the number of geriatric hospital beds fell from 508,704 in 1994 to 503,461 in the following year. Infant mortality down. The Cardoso government's health policies can claim some successes, however. At the other end of the age scale, Brazil has managed, over the past couple of years, to reduce neo- and peri-natal mortality by almost a third. A church children's commission report found that the mortality rate in the first year of life had gone down by 28.4% in the first quarter of this year, in comparison with the same period last year: from 24.8 per 1,000 live births to 17.8. The improvement was most striking in the poor north and northeast. The church report attributes the improvement mainly to price stability under the Plano Real, which has enabled the poor to plan their expenditure more effectively. An example singled out by the report is that of Jaramataia, a town of 4,700 inhabitants in the interior of Alagoas. In 1994 its infant mortality rate of 359 per 1,000 births was one of the highest in the world. Last year it was down to 176, and to only 27 in the first three months of this year. INDIAN LIVES GROW SHORTER  Life expectancy for Brazil's indigenous population has fallen by 5.5 years since 1993, reflecting deteriorating living conditions and an increase in the incidence of diseases, according to a report by the IMTM tropical medicine institute, published in Folha de Sao Paulo in early June. Last year the average expectancy for the 329,000 Indians was 42.5, 25 years less than for the population as a whole and comparable to that of Sierra Leone. In the Javari valley of Amazonas state the average was 24.3 years for the Canamaris, Matis and Mayoruma, and only 21 among the Matubo people. Many deaths are the result of malaria and hepatitis brought in by illegal loggers, gold prospectors (garimpeiros) and settlers. NGOs reported in May that 3,000 garimpeiros using 35 landing strips had re-established themselves in the 10m hectare territory of the Yanomami, on the Venezuelan frontier, since the authorities stopped patrolling the reserve's boundaries in March.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL REPORT  via NewsNetJuly 11, 1996 BRAZIL: FOCUS: INDUSTRY FACES TAKEOVER BOOM: M&A OPERATIONS UP 54% IN THE LAST YEAR Mid-June brought a small item of encouraging news to Brazil's industrial heartland: the regular survey conducted by the Federacao das Industrias do Estado de Sao Paulo (Fiesp) showed in the previous fortnight, for the first time in thirteen-and-a-half months, a net job-creation figure. It was indeed small (503) and industry is still a very long way from mopping up the huge numbers of dismissals (98,133 over the past 12 months). However, Fiesp experts say that it shows how little an upturn is needed for industry to start hiring again. The turnaround is attributed chiefly to the steady fall in interest rates; they now average about 15% in real terms, compared with twice that much a year ago. Takeover threat. The encouragement derived from the employment figures has not managed to offset a new round of concern about the effects trade liberalisation and 'globalisation' are having on Brazilian industry. Rather, this has been heightened by a report from Price Waterhouse which shows that in the first five months of this year there were 154 mergers and acquisitions, 54% more than in the same period of 1995. In 44% of the cases, the operations involved outright buyouts or acquisitions of controlling stakes. Because not all such transactions are reported, it is estimated that the true total of mergers and acquisitions may be up to three times higher. Brazilian industry is changing hands, and in an increasing number of cases, the buyers are foreigners. In January-May last year, foreigners accounted for just over a third of the takeovers; this year their share has risen to 48%. [Brazilians have already been served notice that a new buyer of companies is to appear on the market. At the recent signing of the association agreement between Mercosur and Chile, President Eduardo Frei announced that Chilean investors, after having lined up investment projects totalling US Dollars 10bn in Argentina, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay, are beginning to target Brazil.] The reasons. Industrialists say that two factors have combined to stimulate the rise in takeovers. One is that many middle-ranking Brazilian firms lacked the capital to operate in a 'globalised' economy. With stockmarkets still too small to do the job, and subsidised lending by the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES) governed largely by an inward-looking approach, companies were forced to rely on their own funds, when they had them, or borrow on Brazil's financial markets. The astronomic interest rates prevailing until recently either deterred companies from expanding, or weakened many of those who tried. The other factor is the relative stabilisation of the Brazilian economy, which has dispelled many of the reservations held by investors in recent years and highlighted again the attractiveness of Brazil as a large, complex economy with potential for rapid growth. Entrepreneurial talent. One fear is that the wave of takeovers is also leading to the withdrawal of valuable local entrepreneurial talent. In late June a report published in the Jornal do Brasil identified three entrepreneurs who had not only sold out recently but had also pulled out of business activity: Adhemar de Barros Filho, who sold his interest in Lacta to Kraft Suchard Brasil, has turned full-time to his political activities as a federal deputy. Mario Adler, who relinquished control of Estrela to a management buyout, has retreated to his activities as a leader of the local Jewish community. Jose Mindlin, who sold his interest in Metal Leve to Mahle, of Germany, has turned full-time to his cultural pursuits. [The case of Metal Leve is particularly poignant, as it was one of the early pioneers of the 'internationalisation' of Brazilian industry, with two subsidiaries in the US.] Past 'internationalisation'. There is an element of irony in the fact that a growing segment of Brazilian industry should succumb to 'globalisation' by being bought out. Though Brazil arrived relatively late (end-1980s) to the wave of trade liberalisation, it was the country which had previously most emphasised the export orientation of its industry. Back in 1970, exports of manufactured goods totalled US Dollars 367m. By 1985 they had expanded thirty-fold, to US Dollars 11.2bn. By 1992 they had almost doubled again, to US Dollars 20.5bn. In that same time-lapse, the share of manufactures in total exports rose from 15% to 52%. Where others, like neighbouring Argentina, often appeared to be engaged in a zero-sum debate (either develop manufacturing or go for primary products, at best processing the latter), Brazil managed to do both. This emerges clearly from the composition of Brazil's manufactured exports, where foodstuffs appear as the second-largest item, slotted between metal products and chemicals. The growing importance of manufactured goods in Brazil's export trade appears to contrast with the sector's diminishing share of GDP, from 33.2% in 1980 to 24.9% in the early 1990s. This partly reflects the expansion of other sectors during a particularly bad period for Brazilian industry: after growing at an average annual rate of 9% in the 1970s, its output shrank by an average 0.2% a year in the 1980s, and the decline got steeper in the first three years of the current decade. Since then, however, it has registered at least two years of growth at rates similar to those seen in the 1970s. During the bad years, Brazilian industry did not only expand outwards through exports: in the 1980s it also started investing abroad. It got into the apparel industry in Portugal and Spain, and into the production of parts for motor vehicles in Portugal and the US. Nor has it been absent from the more recent wave of outward investment fostered by the creation of Mercosur. In 1994 it is reckoned to have invested up to US Dollars 800m in Argentina, where there are already some 300 Brazilian firms (admittedly not all in the manufacturing sector).Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL REPORT  via NewsNetJuly 11, 1996 BRAZIL: POLITICS & CRIME: WHO SHOT PC IN HIS ALAGOAS HIDEAWAY?: WAS IT CRIME OF PASSION OR DESTRUCTION OF THE EVIDENCE? The superstitious think it was the 'curse of the Collors' at work again. Those who put more faith in human and supernatural agency detect a political conspiracy. And the local police know a crime of passion when they see one. But one thing was clear: the murder of Paulo Cesar Farias ('PC') on 23 June put an immediate end to 30 pending lawsuits, and removed from the scene the key witness in more than 100 other criminal investigations, involving some prominent names from the Brazilian social and political elite. Man who knew too much. The conspiracy theory is by far the most beguiling, and the Brazilian press have gone to town on it. PC was said to have been terrified that someone would try to kill him and his family, and had sent his two sons to school in Switzerland to keep them out of harm's way. He was, after all, a man who knew too much. As the central figure in the kick-back and extortion scandals that had finally brought about the downfall of President Fernando Collor de Mello in December 1992, Farias knew where the bodies were buried and the money was stashed. But he had kept his mouth shut. Less than three weeks before his death, the federal police had submitted to attorney-general Geraldo Brindeiro the results of an exhaustive four-year inquiry into the scams and scandals of the Collor era, involving the examination of more than a quarter of a million documents. The report came up with the names of more than 400 alleged beneficiaries of PC's extraordinary fund-raising talents. Former ministers named. Among them were some important figures, not least Collor himself and his wife, Rosane. Ten of his cabinet ministers were also mentioned in the police document, including former finance minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello and presidency minister Marcos Coimbra (Collor's former brother-in-law). On the strength of this evidence, Brindeiro was reported to be preparing 106 further indictments. The authorities had high hopes of pinning something at last on Collor, who had been acquitted of all charges by the supreme court in December 1994 (see RB-95-01). To stand any chance of securing convictions, the prosecution needed to put Farias in the witness box, as they had found no smoking gun in Collor's hand in all the thousands of documents. PC and Jorge Bandeira de Mello, a pilot he had used to ferry cash out of the country, were the only two participants in the so-called 'PC Scheme' to be convicted and jailed in 1994. Surely, once the new evidence started coming out in court, PC would want to set the record straight. He could throw light, among other things, on the favours that big contracting companies might have received in return for the millions of dollars they poured into PC's bewildering network of front companies and phoney bank accounts (see Zelia box). So his death could be regarded as highly convenient for a large number of prominent people who might have something to hide. The elimination of a key witness is not, after all, an unusual event in Brazil ... Rough politics. Besides, they have always played hardball in northeastern politics. Fernando Collor's own father, Arnon de Mello, shot a colleague dead in the senate in the 1960s; he had been aiming at a political opponent, but missed. And in neighbouring Paraiba, current senator Ronaldo Cunha Lima was elected in 1994 after riddling a rival with bullets in a restaurant. The conspiracy theorists were jubilant when, on 25 June, the company that claimed to have made the murder weapon, a .38 revolver, said it had been supplied to the Alagoas military police. If that were proved to be so, it would scotch the crime-of-passion theory right away. And the most enthusiastic proponents of that hypothesis, apart from the Farias family, are ... the Alagoas police. Crime of passion? As far as the forensic medicine department in Maceio, capital of Alagoas state, is concerned, it is an open-and-shut case. The body of the 51-year-old businessman was found in bed in his beach house a few miles from Maceio. He had a single bullet wound in the heart. Beside him was the body of his 28-year-old girlfriend, Suzana Marcolino da Silva, who also had a bullet wound in the chest. (Earlier reports, oddly, suggested she had taken poison or hanged herself.) Tests showed she had recently fired a gun, and the wound in PC's body suggested he had been shot by a non-expert, certainly not a hired assassin. (Police insisted, though, that the gun was hers.) Moreover, there were no signs of an intruder or a struggle. Domestic staff had heard the couple quarrelling violently early on the morning of their deaths (but curiously had not heard the gunshots). PC had recently told an interviewer that he had no intention of marrying again, but was thinking of entering politics, standing in the 1998 congressional elections. Suzana was rumoured to be pregnant, and there were reports that PC had refused to acknowledge the child as his own; he was said to have had a vasectomy. The police are not the only people in Alagoas who subscribe to the crime-of-passion theory. PC's lawyer, Nabur Bulhoes, insists that nobody could have had any interest in silencing his late client, as he had already told all he knew. And PC's brother, federal deputy Augusto Farias, said on 24 June that his brother had recently confided in him that Suzana had tried to commit suicide a couple of months earlier. That is emphatically denied by the dead woman's family, who say she would have been the last person to take her own life. Curse of the Collors. As for the curse of the Collors, the evidence is as persuasive as that produced in support of rival hypotheses -so far. Ill-fortune does indeed appear to stalk the superficially glamorous Collors and their allies. Fernando's younger brother, Pedro, who first denounced the corrupt practices he saw going on around him, developed brain cancer and died soon after his brother's acquittal. Their mother, Leda, suffered a stroke in 1992 -allegedly brought on by the stress of her children's feud -fell into a coma and died three months after Pedro. PC's life had also been marked by tragedy. His wife, Elma, died suddenly, apparently from a heart attack, in July 1994, at the age of 44. She had always insisted that Collor, not her husband, was the mastermind behind the network of corruption. Her view, shared by many other Brazilians, was that Collor's inner circle of Alagoas politicans and hangers-on were intent on accumulating vast amounts of money to invest in expanding the family's regional media empire and constructing a dynasty that would remain in power for decades. Ministry's suspicions. The justice ministry has made clear where its suspicions lie. And it does not trust the Alagoas gumshoes to get to the bottom of things. Minister Nelson Jobim ordered the federal police to assist the local force with their inquiries within hours of the bodies being discovered. 'As Paulo Cesar Farias was involved, we cannot rule out the possibility that this was an attempt to destroy evidence,' said federal police commissioner Vicente Chelotti. COLLOR CLEARED Collor was cleared by the supreme court on 20 June of any part in a Farias racket, in which the Credicard company paid more than US Dollars 800,000 into a fictitious bank account in return for PC's help with the renewal of a contract with the state-owned Caixa Economica Federal savings bank. ZELIA SUMMONED Former finance minister Zelia Cardoso had been summoned by the supreme court, STF, to give evidence in a case involving PC two weeks before his death. Zelia was suspected of accepting a US Dollars 800,000 bribe from the national bus operators' association, Rodonal, in return for decreeing a 17.4% increase in bus fares on 14 September 1990. According to federal police documents, the US Dollars 800,000 was deposited in an account opened under a false name by PC on 13 September. A Rodonal official, Jose Augusto Pinheiro, told the police that the association paid Farias US Dollars 1m, but was told that, unless more was forthcoming, it would have problems with securing fare increases. The police think that the total amount paid out by the transport lobby during the Collor administration was more like US Dollars 3m. ROSANE'S EXTRAVAGANCE Rosane Collor used money from a charity she headed to fly her couturiers, doctor and spiritual adviser to Brasilia while her husband was President, according to a report from the social security department's legal advisers, submitted to the federal accounts tribunal, TCU, on 4 June. According to the report, she should be required to return US Dollars 15,300 to the Legiao Brasileira, a social works foundation traditionally headed by the First Lady.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL REPORT  via NewsNetJuly 11, 1996 BRAZIL: ELECTIONS: SERRA THROWS HAT INTO SAO PAULO RING: MINISTER SEEN AS BEST HOPE OF STOPPING ERUNDINA AND MALUF The decision of Jose Serra, one of the Cardoso government's heavyweights, to resign from the planning ministry and run for mayor of Sao Paulo is evidence of just how seriously the government and President Cardoso's PSDB party are taking the October local elections. They can be seen both as a plebiscite on their performance so far and the first shots in the 1998 campaign. Stop Erundina ... Serra's immediate mission is to stop the candidate of the left-wing Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), former mayor Luiza Erundina, who is well ahead in the opinion polls. But throwing him into the contest put yet more strain on the unstable congressional coalition of the PSDB, Partido da Frente Liberal (PFL) and Partido Progressista Brasileiro (PPB). The right-wing PFL is committed to backing Celso Pitta, candidate of the incumbent, Paulo Maluf (PPB). The PFL immediately withdrew its support for, and participation in, the administration of PSDB governor Mario Covas. On the positive side, Serra moved into second place within a week of announcing his candidacy, with 22% support against Erundina's 27% in a Vox Populi poll. As the senator who secured the highest number of votes in the country in the last national elections, he stands a better chance than anyone else of overhauling Erundina. If he does well, the governorship of Sao Paulo could be his next objective, in 1998. According to Veja, he might even go for the presidency. ... And Maluf. His other immediate task is to stop the presidential ambitions of Paulo Maluf getting off to a flying start. Maluf is said to have decided to support Pitta as PPB candidate, as the latter has no previous links with local government (he has a private sector background). His squeaky-clean image will do no harm to Maluf's plans to run for President in 1998. Part of his strategy is to portray the PPB as modern, innovative and open and Pitta, a black businessman, is seen as the epitome of such values. The political coordination minister, Luiz Carlos Santos, noted that 'without [Serra] in the campaign, Maluf, Erundina, perhaps even Orestes Quercia would move into fill the space.' The mention of Quercia, former governor of Sao Paulo, was a reference to a split in the Partido do Movimento Democratico Brasileiro (PMDB) in the state, where a rebel group has defied the local leadership, dominated by Quercia, and put up deputy Jose Aristodemo Pinotti as its candidate for mayor.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL REPORT  via NewsNetJuly 11, 1996 BRAZIL: POSTSCRIPT INEQUALITY/ Worst in the world. Brazil has the most uneven distribution of wealth in the world, according to a United Nations report. It says that the richest 10% of Brazilians hold 65% of the nation's wealth, while the poorest 40% have only 12%. The UN's human development index, which attempts to put a figure to the standard of living, also varies substantially from one region to another. Brazil as a whole scores 0.797, only fractionally below the highly developed country threshold of 0.8. However, Rio Grande do Sul state stands at 0.871, while Paraiba registers only 0.466, comparable to the poorest countries in Africa. BANKS/ Riskiest in Latin America. A report published by credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's says that the country's banking system is now the riskiest in the region, because of loose regulations and an end to the banks' easy money period during hyper-inflation.  Small banks, the agency claims, are most at risk, while larger ones are on a par with their counterparts in the rest of Latin America.  ALCOHOL-FUEL CARS/ Appeal evaporates. The environmentally-friendly and economical cars which run on alcohol are becoming obsolete, because no-one is buying them. According to figures published by Anfavea, the car makers association, only 602 alcohol-fuelled vehicles were sold in May, 85% down on the May 1995 level, and for the second month running less than 1% of the total number of cars sold. Ten years ago 95% of vehicles in Brazil ran on alcohol; the figure is now down to 3%. INVESTMENT/ US Dollars 20bn in 1996. President Cardoso has predicted that long-term investment will total US Dollars 20bn this year. Figures released to date indicate that foreign direct investment in the first five months of the year had reached US Dollars 3.3bn, a 10% year-on-year increase; FDI is forecast to reach US Dollars 8bn by year-end.  TELECOMS/ Satellite service. Four companies have formed a joint venture called Globalstar do Brasil to offer telephone services via satellite to regions that lack them, starting in 1998. The new company comprises Brasilstar and Globalstar of Brazil, Loral Corp of the US and Germany's Daimler-Benz. Investment worth US Dollars 180m has been earmarked for the project. MEDIA/ Journalist dies. Julio de Mesquita Neto, editor since 1969 of the Sao Paulo newspaper O Estado, has died of cancer at the age of 74. He was one of the strongest critics in the press of the military regimes which governed between 1964 and 1985. CRIME/ Hard graft. Hasmany Ramos, the famous plastic surgeon turned super criminal who threatened to join the IRA to learn the art of bomb-making, has been recaptured by the police. Ramos, who was serving a 22 year sentence for murder and extortion, had escaped from prison after his 11th attempt. He was arrested by Minas Gerais detectives while attempting to collect a ransom payment from the family of an abducted businessman. The authorities, however, did not realise it was Ramos until they took his finger prints. NUCLEAR POWER/ New member. Brazil has been granted full membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The association, which consists of thirty countries who have adopted policies to control the export of goods and technology in the nuclear sector, promotes the use of nuclear power for peaceful means. OIL/ Argentine imports. Argentina has overtaken the Arab countries for the first time ever as Brazil's leading oil supplier, according to a report by the state company Petrobras. Brazil currently imports 135,000 bpd from Argentina, compared with 125,000 bpd from Saudi Arabia and 90,000 bpd from Venezuela. The report adds that Venezuela is likely to overtake Saudi Arabia before the end of the year. Brazil imports a total of 700,000 bpd and produces marginally more itself, some 750,000 bpd. Petrobras search. The state oil copmany is looking for private sector associates to help it develop the rich natural gas reserves that are thought to exist in Amazonia, according to Gazeta Mercantil. The Urucu and Juru reserves are estimated to hold 82bn cubic metres of natural gas, making them the second most important in the country, after Campos in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Petrobras lacks the resources to build a 270km pipeline linking the reserves to the city of Coari, from where the gas could be distributed. The state company's overtures towards the private sector reflect its concern over potential competition from foreign multinationals in 1998, when Petrobras's monopoly in the hydrocarbon sector will end. TRADE/ May surplus. A trade surplus of US Dollars 268m was recorded in May, giving a US Dollars 31m surplus for the first five months of the year. Brazil exported US Dollars 4.5bn worth of goods and imported US Dollars 4.2bn in May, the finance ministry says. In May 1995 a trade deficit of US Dollars 690m was sustained.  Paraguayan contraband. Between 1 May and 10 June 350 tonnes of goods smuggled into the country from Paraguay were seized by the authorities. The products included food, household appliances, tobacco and alcohol, and were valued at US Dollars 4m. Customs officials said they confiscated 50 tonnes of cigarettes, enough to supply 82,000 smokers for a month. Most of the products were destined for Brasilia's informal market. CONSUMPTION/ Spirits rise. Falling inflation and lower import tariffs led to a 25% rise in alcohol sales last year, to US Dollars 23bn, according to the weekly Veja. Wine, champagne and whiskey consumption rose by an average of 34%; beer and rum by 21%. Sales of cachaca, the country's most popular spirit, rose by 1%.Back to Headline List WT03-B03-18IA086-000615-B048-141http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it09.html 205.156.212.5 19970122022631 text/html 50676HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:24:00 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:26 GMTContent-length: 50489Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it09.html Sample Issue Copyright BRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNet July 17, 1991 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES GENERAL ECONOMY JULY: THE TURNING POINT?

(3576 words) CopyrightBRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNetJuly 17, 1991JULY: THE TURNING POINT?As the phased decontrol of wages and prices frozen under Collor Plan IIat end-January proceeds, policy makers in Brasilia are monitoring theinflation trend carefully -- and the early indicators appear favorable.  Therisk, as in past transitions from shock plan freezes, is that repressed pricepressures and high-inflation expectations will lead businesses toimplement sharp markups upon termination of controls, forcing thegovernment to close the vicious circle with implementation of a newfreeze.  But preliminary estimates indicating only a mild rise in monthlyinflation to around 10% in July have bolstered optimism that EconomyMinister Marcilio Marques Moreira will succeed in stabilizing theeconomy without resort to a new shock.Not all economic observers share that view: Cesar Maia, onetime aideto Rio Governor Leonel Brizola and now a prominent economic adviserto PMDB national president Orestes Quercia, contends that Moreiraalready is stumbling into the same traps that ensnared previous financeministers.  And Moreira, whose efforts to restore dialogue with thebusiness community have allowed the government to achieve voluntarysectoral pacts for wage and price restraint, has drawn criticism from theprivate sector for his surprise move in late June to tighten terms forindustrial tax collection.  Rules established under Emergency Measure297, issued in late June, reduce the maximum period for remittance ofindustrial production tax (IPI) collection from 40 days to just five --effectively requiring remittance before most payments from clients arereceived.  Industrialists complain that the measure will cut deeply intoscarce capital reserves desperately needed to finance productiveexpansion at a critical stage in Brazil's economic recovery (seeSPOTLIGHT report in this issue).Moreira's supporters counter that the IPI collection term could prove aneffective and flexible tool to tighten fiscal policy when the pace ofgrowth accelerates to a level that could reignite inflation, and ease whenthe recovery threatens to stall.  Moreover, other provisions ofEmergency Measure 297 could bolster the recovery while posing littleinflationary risk.  EM 297 authorizes creation of foreign exchangedebentures backed by export earnings, which should significantly expandavailability of trade finance to Brazilian companies.Another key provision allows for immediate release of new cruzadofunds blocked at the Central Bank since the original Collor Plan enteredforce in March 1990 for payment of tax and debt obligations to thegovernment incurred through end-1990.  Holders of blocked new cruzadodeposits also are authorized to transfer NCz$ funds to another party foruse in settlement of the latter's tax and debt obligations.  This measureprovides an effective mechanism to bolster the federal treasury even asit diminishes the mountain of liquidity due to hit national money supplyin mid-September, when the government is committed to commencedisbursement of blocked NCz$ funds in monthly instalments over a one-year period.  The option for transfer of NCz$ funds also offers a vehicleto obtain liquidity without waiting for scheduled disbursements -- thoughthe discounts of 15-25% applied by companies and institutions tocruzeiro payments for NCz$ funds will likely discourage smalldepositors.The debate over EM 297 highlights the difficult economic policychallenge confronting the Moreira team in Brasilia.  On the one hand,Moreira must avert a resurgence of inflation as price and wage controlsare lifted -- and that implies a monetary and fiscal policy sufficientlytight to avert economic overheating.  On the other, he must providesufficient monetary and fiscal impetus to prevent the economy fromslipping back into recession.  If inflation can be capped around the 10%monthly level -- as the  preliminary forecast for July suggests -- Moreiracan claim a critical victory on the inflation front, which should reinforcebusiness confidence in the new economic team.  Whether he can maintainthe delicate balance between moderate inflation and nascent recoveryremains to be seen: The economic outlook to yearend is reviewed indepth in this week's SPOTLIGHT report.July also marks a watershed month in Moreira's efforts to push long-stalled debt negotiations toward conclusion by yearend -- a criticalelement in the economy minister's long-term game plan for sustainedeconomic revival.  Moreira's unofficial visit last week to New York andWashington, including talks with US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bradyand IMF Director Michel Camdessus, prepared the ground for the IMFtechnical mission that arrived in Brazil this week for review of fiscal andeconomic performance.  Moreira also conferred in New York withmoney center bankers and the Brazilian negotiating team led by PedroMalan and Jorio Dauster (now charged with handling the Paris Clubtalks), who had just returned from meeting with creditors in Japan andEurope.  Moreira has assured creditor banks that they will be offered abroad menu of options in renegotiation of Brazilian debt, includingsecuritization and debt swaps linked to impending parastatalprivatizations.The technical mission now in Brazil will have to weight the recentprogress made under Moreira against lingering concerns, specificallyover the inflation outlook and a deterioration in the fiscal situation aftersteady improvement in 1990.  The latter problem reflects a sharpreduction in government revenues, caused by restoration of diverse fiscalincentives by Congress and an unexpected plunge in income tax receiptslaid to bureaucratic confusion under the previous economic team.Restored tax breaks alone have cost the federal treasury an estimatedUS$1.77 billion, boosting total giveaways through fiscal incentives to acrushing US$7.82 billion -- or 1.51% of GDP.  Bureaucratic foulups inincome tax collection over the past year have cost the treasury anotherUS$1 billion.Despite these fiscal problems, Moreira stands a good chance ofpersuading the Fund to sign off on a new credit facility so long as he canoffer convincing evidence that the economic situation has been stabilizedand inflation has been brought under control.  In this context, the Julyinflation figures assume added weight as an indicator of the credibilityand effectiveness of Moreira's economic policy management.  His cloutwith US and IMF officials in Washington should also help -- but noamount of influence could overcome a renewed deterioration in theinflation trend.To bolster anti-inflation policy, Moreira has concentrated his formidablediplomatic skills on persuading Congress of the need to resist pressurefor a return to full-fledged wage indexation.  His success in maintainingwage restraint thus far should improve Brazil's case with the IMF.Moreira also can be expected to emphasize the fiscal windfall anticipatedfrom the dramatic shortening of the term for industrial tax collectionsunder EM 297.Assuming July inflation holds below 11%, Moreira is well positioned togain IMF approval of a new letter of intent, clearing the way for signoffon a credit facility.  Moreira's immediate objective is to gain IMFcommitment to an 18-month standby loan, which currently is expectedto total between US$1.5-2 billion.  If Brazil remains on course inmeeting its IMF targets, the economy minister is expected to seeksubsequent Fund approval of an extended fund facility for a three-yearterm, with a credit commitment totaling US$3 billion or more.If the IMF hurdle can be cleared, Moreira remains optimistic that a dealwith commercial bank creditors can be reached by yearend.  The banktalks can be expected to proceed in parallel with renegotiation of ParisClub debt, currently estimated at around US$4 billion.Conclusion of agreements with the IMF, the Paris Club and the banks byyearend would significantly improve Moreira's position to achieveeconomic stabilization and lay the foundations for sustained growth withmoderate inflation.  But the economic risks remain formidable: Witnessthe fact that Brazil has failed to meet targets established in all of its sixprevious accords with the Fund since 1982.  The optimists in Brasiliacontend that Moreira will succeed where his predecessors have failed --the skeptics are deferring judgment for now.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNetJuly 17, 1991COLLOR ON THE OFFENSIVEPresident Fernando Collor de Mello has mounted a powerfulcounterattack against former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia, nownational president of the PMDB and the early front-runner for thepresidency in 1994.  In the first week of July, Collor ventured intoQuercia's stronghold in upstate Sao Paulo to launch a new farm programoffering close to US$1 billion in credit for the 1991/92 harvest.  Theprogram, engineered by Agriculture Minister Antonio Cabrera, alsoslashes taxes on farm equipment sales, bolsters price support levels forlocal producers, and slaps punitive tariffs on subsidized agriculturalimports.  The clear intent is to pull Sao Paulo and other key producingstates out of recession, setting the stage for strong recovery in 1992 --and shoring up Collor's eroded base of farm support in the process.At the public unveiling of the farm program, the president shared theplatform with Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, a politicalunknown until Quercia tabbed him as PMDB gubernatorial nominee lastyear.  The gesture to Fleury appears consistent with Collor's recentefforts to woo the Sao Paulo governor -- not only to secure the latter'ssupport for key elements of the administration's legislative agenda inBrasilia, but also to weaken Fleury's relationship with Quercia and thusundercut the Quercia presidential campaign.Collor also has sought to steal the initiative from Quercia byconcentrating a heavy proportion of federal assistance for local publicworks projects in heavily populated and prosperous upstate Sao Paulo.Already these efforts have triggered a significant number of defectionsby mayors and even congressmen in the state to Collor's small PRNparty, and more desertions are expected.  Collor's generous new farmprogram will accelerate the flow of funds into the region, a center forBrazilian agricultural production.The key figures behind the administration's Sao Paulo offensive areLeopoldo Collor, the president's oldest brother and a Sao Paulobusinessman; Secretary of Regional Development Egberto Baptista, anincreasingly influential member of the president's inner circle.  Theyouthful Baptista, also a paulista, demonstrated his clout with his keyrole in the kitchen cabinet campaign to oust former Economy MinisterZelia Cardoso de Mello, and he is widely regarded as a politician towatch.Collor already has used his control over federal largesse to forge apolitical alliance with Rio Governor Leonel Brizola, a longtime politicalrival.  If he can use similar influence to woo Fleury, he would appearbetter positioned to confront Quercia openly.  That would mark a majorshift from Collor's recent dependence on Quercia for critical support,notably in the recent battle to end the computer market reserve.  An openwar between Collor and Quercia would match two of Brazil's mostskilled political infighters -- and it would be a drama worth watchingclosely.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNetJuly 17, 1991MORE BANKS, MORE LOSSESBank earnings reports for the first five months of the year show anindustry that has grown in numbers -- and deteriorated in profitability.The number of banks in Brazil has reached 239, and 116 -- nearly half--reported losses for the January-May period.In good part, this negative performance reflects the fallout from anexcessive expansion of the industry in 1990, spurred by a flurry ofincorporations of small and medium-size institutions.  Liberalization ofrules for bank incorporation under the 1988 constitution and subsequentregulations issued by the Sarney administration set the stage for lastyear's expansion.  The result was a surge in institutions from 153 in1989 to 239.The irony is that the expansion occurred even as the draconian freeze ofinvestment funds implemented under the original Collor Plan in March1990 drained liquidity from the system.  Total liquidity in the bankingsystem shrunk by nearly 50%, from US$116.5 billion in 1989 to US$59billion in 1990.  In other words, the new banking ventures cameprecisely as prospects for industry profits reached low ebb.Many of the new banks were not well prepared to face the adversities of1990.  Most were founded by industrial and retail groups, restructuredbrokerages and distributors seeking to profit from lucrative margins ofas much as 50% that prevailed in the last months of the Sarneyadministration.  Then came the liquidity crunch, followed by a wave ofbankruptcies in the second half of 1990 and a continued monetarysqueeze that put additional pressure on industry profit margins.Few of the new banks thus far have failed as a result of these financialpressures.  But industry executives believe that many will eventuallyhave to seek mergers to avoid going under, which could reduce the totalnumber of banks by as much as 40% over the next year.State banks remain a continuing source of trouble for the state andfederal governments, with most reporting spectacular losses in the firstsemester.  Even foreign banks with Brazilian operations sufferedsetbacks; Mitsubishi and Bank of Montreal ranked among the poorestperformers in the first half.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNetJuly 17, 1991PRIVATIZATION: NEXT TARGETSWith the debut selloff of the state-owned steelmaker Usiminas set forSeptember, the Collor government is preparing to launch its secondprivatization with sale of the jet-turbine maintenance firm CompanhiaEletro-mecanica.  Celma, with assets officially valued at US$84 million,will be privatized in several stages.  An initial tender of up to 10% oftotal Celma shares will be offered to the company's 2,000 employeesfrom August 1 to September 13, supported by financing from theBNDES.  United Technology, which currently owns a 13% shareholdingin Celma, will be offered the option to increase its stake up to the 40%maximum established for foreign shareholders in the privatizationprocess.  Remaining Celma stock will go on the block for public offeron October 22.One problem that has held back privatization of Celma is the fact that itis the only domestic company qualified to service Brazilian Air Forcejets.  This issue was resolved through inclusion of a clause inprivatization terms guaranteeing such maintenance will be continued.Though the Celma selloff is on a much smaller scale than the Usiminasdeal, its sale breaks a number of nationalistic taboos and paves the wayfor a much more significant privatization: Brazil's biggest aircraft maker,Embraer.  The recent surprise appointment of former InfrastructureMinister Ozires Silva as president of Embraer -- the company he headedfrom its founding until he assumed the Petrobras presidency in 1986 --has been widely interpreted as a mission to get the parastatal ready forprivatization.  Silva was a strong proponent of privatization even beforehe assumed a central role in drafting the Collor government's programfor parastatal selloffs as infrastructure minister.  He has openlyrecommended that the aircraft company be transferred as soon as possibleto private interests.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNetJuly 17, 1991GENERAL OVERVIEWState bank rollovers of debt obligations to the Central Bank have kept thefinancial system under pressure in July.    The financial markets  haveresponded with a gradual backup in interest rates, though liquidity hasremained adequate to prevent a more dramatic surge.  In thisenvironment, CDs and fixed-rate mutual funds have ranked among theleading fixed-income perfomers. The rise in interest rates has dampeneddemand for the dollar, and should also slow improvement in gold pricesin the second half of the month.  The stock market has shown surprisingstrength despite the interest rate trend, bolstered by privatizationprogress, foreign capital inflows and growing optimism over theeconomic outlook and pending debt negotiations.  Stocks have maintainedtheir position in July as the strongest performer among major investmentvehicles. The influx of foreign funds, coupled with share sales in theprivatization process, is critical to sustaining the rally on the Sao Pauloand Rio exchanges.  Market analysts anticipate a new market surge ifinflation remains moderate this month and Economy Minister Moreiracan make headway in debt negotiations with the IMF and the banks.  Therally should be reinforced as interest rates level off in the second half ofJuly.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNetJuly 17, 1991FINANCIAL INVESTMENT FUNDSOverview: Financial investment funds turned in a reasonable showing inthe first half of July, with the 10 leading funds averaging a net gain of3.9%.  Top performers for the period were the Fundo Azul of theFederal Savings Bank and the Fundo Real.  But the range in returnsamong the leading funds narrowed to just 18 basis points, from 4.04%for Fundo Azul to 3.86% for Citiconta.Prospects: Leading funds should average a monthly gain of around10.5% in July.  That would put the fundao roughly on a par withmonthly inflation, and marginally above the pre-fixed TR of 10.05%.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNetJuly 17, 1991CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSITOverview: CDs have continued to rank among the top investmentperformers in July.  Rates for large-lot investments moved up from260% to 330% annualized in the first half of the month, with interbankrates rising from 15% to 17% monthly.  The rising trend has beenreinforced by the market impact as state banks roll over debts with theCentral Bank.Over the longer term, CD returns have been more modest, with nominalgains on large lots of 81.84% in the first six months of the year and340.32% over the past 12 months.  These returns lagged inflation for theperiods, though still outperforming cadernetas.  The tax disadvantage forsmaller lots makes CDs a less attractive vehicle for small or middle-scaleinvestors.Prospects: The money markets will continue to be pressured by theproblems of the state financial institutions, which will keep rates high inthe near term.  But interest rate pressure should begin to ease by the endof the month, and CD yields should also begin to fall by early August.GOLDOverview: In the first half of July, gold prices rose by 4.39%, rankingthird-highest amont investment vehicles and moderately above the officialTR index for the comparable period.  Over the longer term, however,gold remains a lackluster performer, with gains of 77.47% in the firsthalf and 322.51% over the past 12 months.  Though it has outperformedthe black dollar in July, gold price gains have trailed the dollar for theyear to date.Prospects: Market operators expect gold prices to track the government'sTR at least so long as interest rates stay high and international goldprices remain stable.  That implies a price advance of around 10% forJuly -- but gains in August could be lower as interest rates stabilize orfall.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNetJuly 17, 1991BLACK DOLLAROverview: The black dollar recovered from stagnation at the start of themonth to post a 4.01% gain for the first half of July, at a rough paritywith inflation and the TR for the period.  The commercial dollarimproved by 4.33% in the first two weeks of July, while the touristdollar lagged with a gain of 3.45%.  The premium of the black over thecommercial dollar widened to 11.44% by the end of the second week,after narrowing to a low of 10.31% in the first.For the first half of 1991, gains have reached 87.63% for the blackdollar, 83.91% for the commercial, and 85.80% for the tourist.  Overthe past 12 months, the commercial dollar returned 412.52%, comparedwith 295.45% for the tourist and 294.35% for the black.Prospects: The black dollar appears likely to stagnate in the second halfof July.  With interest rates moving up, exporters have grown moreanxious to accelerate exchange of dollars for cruzeiros, boosting dollarsupply.  The Central Bank also has signaled that it plans to intervene tosell dollars if the exchange rate against the local currency appreciatessharply.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNetJuly 17, 1991S&L ACCOUNTSOverview: With the TR pre-fixed at 10.05% for July, gains on acaderneta investment held during July will reach 10.60%.  That offersa sufficiently wide spread over estimated July inflation to make thisinstrument attractive.Over the longer term, the caderneta has not done so well.  In the first sixmonths of the year, gains reached just 69.85%, more than 25 pointsbehind inflation for the period.  Gains for the past 12 months reached243.25%, making the caderneta the worst performer among investmentvehicles.  The paltry gain -- directly attributable to past governmentmanipulation of the official correction rate -- exposes the administration'sdismal failure to date in enhancing the attraction of savings and thusdiminishing pressures for immediate consumption.Prospects: July returns for the caderneta should be positive in real terms.So long as the government continues to fix the TR at a rate close toinflationary expectations, this investment will not be a losing proposition.The risk is that inflation might surge above forecast, leaving investors insavings accounts vulnerable to a hard blow.  Government plans tosweeten terms for caderneta investment appear to have been set aside fornow; the economic team appears confident that most of the new liquidityproduced when the government begins release of blocked NCz$ funds inSeptember will move into financial investments, without need for newinducements.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNetJuly 17, 1991STOCK MARKETOverview: BOVESPA staged a rally in the second week of July,returning the stock market to the head of the pack in investment yieldsfor the first half of the month.  The market rally was triggered insignificant part by heavy share purchases by futures index financingagents, reinforced by continued strong foreign capital inflows.  On July12, BOVESPA closed with a net gain of 10.6% for the week and 6.32%for the first half of July.  The BVRJ also rallied to post a 7.5% gain inthe second week of July.  But heavier losses in the previous week left theRio exchange with a net gain of just 2.64% for the first half of themonth.In the first six months of the year, BOVESPA showed a vigorous gainof 438.01%, with BVRJ staging a healthy 394.7% advance.  Thatcompares very favorably with inflation of around 95% for the period.In the past 12 months, gains were less spectacular but still well aboveinflation, at 668.02% for BOVESPA and 627.63% for BVRJ.Prospects: Stock prices could stabilize or drop in the second half of July.The factors pointing to a correction are largely technical: Finance fromagents to guarantee new credit and roll over existing lines for stockpurchases has temporarily dried up as agents struggle to meetrequirements for large deposits with the Central Bank.  Many investorswill be forced to sell to keep liquid, and this may pressure prices lower.Over the medium and long term, however, the market outlook remainsfavorable -- and stands to improve further with interest rate stabilization,continued moderation in inflation and progress on debt renegotiation andprivatization.  As a result, investors should view a near-term correctionas an opportunity to buy.Back to Headline List CopyrightBRAZIL SERVICE via NewsNetJuly 17, 1991MUTUAL FUNDSOverview: Mutual stock funds continued to lag other investment vehicleswith a net loss averaging 4.09% in the first half of July, repeating thepoor performance of June.  Despite their recent reverses, however, stockfunds have provided a net return of 296.07% for the first half of theyear.  Gains over the most recent 12-month period were less impressiveat 328.34%, breaking even with inflation. Leading fixed-rate mutualfunds ranked as the second-best investment in the first half of July witha gain averaging 4.45%.  Fixed-rate funds also did moderately well overthe longer term, breaking even with inflation with gains of 95.23% in thefirst six months of 1991 and 387.34% over the 12-month period.  Fixed-rate funds for companies fared modestly better with gains of 103.29% inthe first half and 436.14% over 12 months.Prospects: Stock funds could continue doing poorly in the second half ofJuly, but should rebound smartly to make up for lost ground -- possiblyin August.  Fixed-rate funds should continue their moderately goodshowing, which has made them one of the more dependable investmentsin the financial markets.

Industrial production and consumer sales in key sectors have risenin two consecutive months for the first time this year, and businesses arecautiously optimistic that the trends can be sustained in the secondsemester.  Other economic indicators show modest improvement as well-- but not all Brazilian analysts are convinced that the recovery has takenfirm root.One factor that could give impetus to a second-half recovery is theincipient revival in the consumer economy.  Consumer credit requestsare increasing for the first time in six months.  Employment numbers arerising slowly but steadily in the industrial hub of Sao Paulo, and wagesin the region have improved this year in real terms.  The latterimprovement has been preserved in part by the success of the Collorgovernment thus far in preventing a new explosion in inflation as pricecontrols are gradually lifted.The revival in consumer expenditures should gain further momentum inmid-September, when the government is committed to release the first of12 equal instalments from new cruzado accounts blocked in the CentralBank since launch of the original Collor Plan in March 1990.Consumers already have stepped up instalment purchases in anticipationof receipt of funds now blocked at the CB.  Liquidity has expandedmodestly and the credit squeeze has begun to ease for some industrialand agribusiness sectors, further bolstering prospects for sustainedrecovery.External developments on the trade and debt fronts also would appear tosupport the recovery scenario.  Major industrial and agriculturalexporters have continued to thrive despite a persistent overvaluation ofthe cruzeiro against the US$.  International trade credit lines, whilediminished, have remained adequate despite slow progress in the bankdebt talks.  And with prospects for an IMF agreement this summerincreasingly favorable, the government should be in position to achievea comprehensive renegotiation of the bank debt in the second half --which would brighten hopes for greater availability of foreign credit tofinance Brazilian trade.Not all economic portents for the second half are favorable, however.Analysts in Brazil are divided as to whether Economy Minister MarcilioMarques Moreira can prevent inflation from moving well above 10%monthly in the third quarter, which would heighten the odds of a newshock plan to arrest the price surge.  In fact, some critics of the neweconomic team suggest that it already has implemented its first shock inthe form of Emergency Measure 297, issued in late June.  That measureshortens the grace period for corporate payment of the industrial tax,which some business leaders view as a de facto confiscation of funds thatcould fuel private sector recovery.  The emergency measure alsoauthorizes longer credit terms for export financing and use of newcruzado funds blocked at the CB for settlement of debts with thegovernment.  Overall, critics view the sharp tightening in industrial taxcollection terms as negating the reflationary impact of other aspects ofthe measure.On balance, Brazil Service finds the weight of economic evidencepointing toward an incipient recovery.  But both domestic and foreigninvestors should be asking whether this is the beginning of a sustainablelong-term recovery, or merely a temporary rebound induced in part byshort-term government measures.  This SPOTLIGHT report gauges thegeneral economic scenario and specific factors that could influence therecovery outlook.RECOVERY OR ILLUSION?Is the recovery for real, or does the apparent economic upturn maskgathering momentum for a new economic shock?  Opposition economistCesar Maia, the former top adviser to PDT presidential nominee and RioGovernor Leonel Brizola who recently bolted to join the PMDB,enthusiastically supported Collor Plans I and II -- but now has emergedas a leading critic of economic policy under Moreira.  Maia contendsthat the Moreira team remains stuck in the "heterodox shock rut" that hasplagued government anti-inflation policy since launch of the CruzadoPlan in early 1986.  He argues that Moreira already has fallen victim tothe recurring cycle of initial success yielding to subsequent economicdistortions that must be corrected by a new shock plan.  In fact, Maiaviews Emergency Measure 297, which combines tightened corporate taxcollection with expanded trade finance options and release of blockednew cruzado funds for internal debt payments, as the effective launch of"Collor Plan III."Economist and PUC/Rio professor Edmar Bacha, a member of theeconomic team who engineered launch of the Cruzado Plan and now aninformal adviser to Moreira, agrees that previous shocks have introducedeconomic distortions, particularly in the public/private sectorrelationship.  But whereas past price/wage freezes have fostered theunsustainable illusion of lasting inflation control and economic recovery-- and ultimately paved the way for the next shock as collapsingconfidence drove businesses to drive up prices --Bacha is less pessimisticthis time round.  He credits the present economic team for managing theprice decontrol process thus far without provoking a new inflationarysurge or undermining private sector confidence in the government.  Thatsuccess has laid the groundwork for slow but steady recovery -- andimproved prospects that a new shock can be avoided.Former Planning Minister Joao Paulo dos Reis Velloso endorses Bacha'spositive assessment of progress on price decontrol.  He notes that -- incontrast to widespread private sector expectations in the wake of previousshocks that price decontrol would be temporary -- the Moreira team thusfar has managed to retain the confidence of the business community inits capacity to curb inflation without a new shock.The rub is that the government has maintained such confidence in partby maintaining a generally tight monetary policy designed to prevent theeconomy from moving into a premature and accelerated recovery thatwould revive price pressures.  The economic team in Brasilia has grownincreasingly concerned in recent months that an excessively swift andstrong recovery could produce a consumer spending boom, triggering aprice surge reinforced by markups driven by renewed business fears ofan imminent shock.The Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA), the EconomyMinistry think tank, gives some insight into the reasons behind thepresent concern of the economic team over the pace of recovery.  Anewly released IPEA study shows that industrial production in the firstfour months of 1991 was up by 14.5% from the year-ago period -- wellabove levels for comparable periods in previous economic stabilizationplans.  In fact, however, the increase is exaggerated by the comparisonwith the depressed level of industrial activity in the January-April 1990period, devastated by the impact of the massive confiscation of corporatecapital at the start of the Collor Plan.The IPEA recommends that the government maintain a generally tightmonetary policy as the most effective means to assure sustained recoverywithout a new inflationary surge.  That implies that Brasilia will becautious to take measures that might accelerate the recovery, with a stop-and-go monetary policy not unlike that applied in recent months by theFederal Reserve in the US.THE INDUSTRIAL TAX SHOCKSince his appointment as economy minister in early May, MarcilioMarques Moreira has succeeded in repairing government relations withbusiness badly strained by recurring confrontations during the tenure ofhis predecessor, Zelia Cardoso de Mello.  Moreira has consciously takena more conciliatory line in reopening lines of communication withbusiness leaders and offering assurances that he plans no newinterventions in the private sector.  The end result has been a gradualresurgence in business confidence in the government -- but these gainscould be squandered by Moreira's quiet move to tighten corporate taxcollection rules under Emergency Measure 297.At first glance, the emergency measure's more obvious fiscal policychange -- elimination of TR use for tax indexation to comply withconstitutional constraints established by the Supreme Court -- appearedof little relevance to the economic outlook.  But buried in the bureacraticlanguage of EM 297 was a bombshell with powerfully negativeimplications for the private sector: a dramatic reduction of the graceperiod for corporate deposit of receipts from the Industrial ProductionTax (IPI), the most important federal tax source, from 40 days to justfive.  The implication is that companies are now required to remit taxpayments in most cases before they have even received payments fromclients, since few sales are made for cash and most carry a standard 30-to 60-day payment lag.  As a result, industries already strapped for cashsuddenly confront a major new drain on operating capital -- whichthreatens to cut short the nascent recovery.An element of EM 297 with a less predictable impact on recoveryprospects is the authorization for immediate release of new cruzado fundsto pay tax and debt obligations to the government incurred throughend-1990.  Moreira's motivation is obvious: Designation of a substantialportion of blocked NCz$ funds for tax and debt settlements stands tobolster the federal treasury, even as it diminishes the money supplyimpact as release of blocked funds into the general economy begins inSeptember.  The impact on corporate spending would appear a wash,since the funds are not currently available for other purposes.Moreover, the authorization for holders of blocked accounts to transferfunds to another party for the latter's use in meeting tax and debtpayments to the government has effectively created a market for newcruzados.  In theory, such exchange of new cruzados for cruzeiros couldhave a reflationary impact in bolstering consumer spending power.  Inpractice, however, the capital gains tax on NCz$ transfers (currentlyunder challenge in the courts) and the 15/25% discount currently appliedby companies and institutions to payments for new cruzados will leadmost small and middle-scale deposits to wait for disbursement of blockedfunds to begin two months hence.In any event, the abrupt narrowing of the grace period for IPI collectionappears likely to offset any positive economic impact from the measurein the near term.  Moreira retains the option of increasing the graceperiod for IPI deposit by industries should the economy slip back towardrecession, however -- and that could prove a convenient mechanism forextending the stop-and-go strategy to fiscal policy.INDUSTRIAL OUTLOOKMuch of the apparent recovery in June was concentrated in a singlesector -- the auto industry.  Automakers reported a surge in productionin June of 18.06% from the previous month, and 73.53% from June1990.  The government's authorization of a temporary 10-point cut in theIPI applied to car sales -- a concession to gain the industry'sacquiescence in a sectoral pact holding new-car price increases to thegeneral inflation level -- significantly widened profit margins, providinga powerful inducement for expanded production.It would be premature, however, to interpret the impressive Juneperformance as proof of a definitive turnaround for the industry, in partbecause the government is committed to extend the temporary IPI cutonly through August.  Over a longer timeframe, the industry'sperformance has been lackluster, with production in the first half up byjust 1.2% from year-ago levels.  Moreover, monthly production figuresto yearend close to the 67,000-unit average for the first semester wouldput 1991 output at around 700,000 vehicles -- 7.5% below the 1990total.Still, a comprehensive breakdown of auto industry results shows asubstantial improvement in domestic sales during the first semester.  Thattrend compensated for a 25.85% year-on-year fall in auto exports duringthe same period.  The government's extension of the IPI reduction foranother 60 days to end-August should keep auto production stable andprevent layoffs -- but the extraordinary gains seen in June are unlikelyto be repeated.Autoparts suppliers are cautiously optimistic that the recovery in vehicleproduction also will translate into a substantial rise in orders fromcarmakers.  Autoparts sales fell by 20% year-on-year in the first fivemonths of 1991, but a reversal in the trend in May has bolstered industryhopes that sales will return to year-ago levels by August.  The industrycurrently reports capacity utilization in a range of 82-85%.Some durable goods manufacturers have suffered from rushingprematurely to step up production on the basis of a sharp butunsustainable pickup in sales.  Tractor makers, for instance, respondedto improved sales in May by boosting output by 20.9% the followingmonth, only to see June sales fall by 4.2%.  The reversal reflected thebroader trend in the agricultural equipment sector, where productionincreased by 22.9% while sales slumped by 5.8% in June.Despite falling sales in May, the food industry interpreted signs ofgradual improvement in the consumer economy -- including a rise insupermarket turnover -- as sufficient justification to rehire workers andpush up production in June.  The industry's optimism on recoveryprospects is also rooted in the impetus that release of blocked newcruzado funds beginning in September is expected to give to consumerspending.Manufacturers of capital goods, steel, petrochemicals and other industrialproducts generally appear poised for a sustained recovery.  If therecovery in these core industries takes firm hold, it can be attributed insignificant part to long-term government measures undertaken to improveproductivity and profitability of these sectors.The risk -- notably in the capital goods sector -- is that the decade-longpattern of recurring recession interrupted by brief spasms of recoverywill be repeated.  Capital goods production in April rose by 5.7% fromMarch; the 7% rise in inflation-adjusted April sales from the year-agolevel marked the first year-on-year improvement in monthly salesperformance in three years.  But after steady if gradual industryimprovement during the first four months of the year, production fell by2.3% and sales by 1.1% in May from April levels.Luiz Carlos Delben Leite, president of the Association of Machinery andEquipment (ABIMAQ), cautions that a genuine recovery would imply atleast 10 consecutive months of production growth.  Despite theambiguous indicators through May, however, most capital goods makersview the outlook for industry recovery with cautious optimism.  Salesand production of machinery in 1991 could still fall below the industry'sworst-ever performance last year.  But over the longer term, the capitalgoods industry hopes to reap the benefits of new exemptions from IPIand ICMS assessments at the federal and state levels, as well as newfacilities for technology import and credit lines for this purpose.Steel production this year has recovered in relation to 1990.  In the firsthalf, steel output rose by 8.4% from the year-ago period to 10.9 milliontons.  June production at 1.7 million tons was 12.5% above the June1990 total, though down by 11.6% from the previous month.  TheBrazilian Steel Institute (IBS) discounted the monthly decline in June asan aberration due to operational problems at the big state mills thatprovide all basic flat steel.  The IBS prognosis is for continued recoveryin the second half, with annual production expected to hit 22.8 millontons -- up 11% from 1990.  The industry association attributes the gainsto both the nascent domestic market recovery and continued expansionin key export markets.AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOKOne major restraining influence on the overall economic recovery hasbeen the poor performance of the farm sector in Brazil this year.  Duringthe troubled 1980s -- commonly called the "lost decade" by Brazilianeconomists -- agriculture was one of the few economic sectors thatprospered.  In the keystone producing state of Sao Paulo, for example,the economy as a whole grew by just 0.64% from 1981 to 1990, butagricultural sector growth was nearly four times as high at 2.28%.Regions in upstate Sao Paulo and other southern states where productionof top agricultural exports such as soybeans, chicken, beef and orangesis concentrated became islands of prosperity in the midst of recession.But that situation has reversed in the wake of the third consecutive poorgrain harvest this year, compounded by the recent fall in soy productexports and a softening in international prices for orange juice exports.These factors have brought the full force of recession to the farm sector,and producers in most areas show no signs of moving into recoverybefore yearend.  The dampening impact of the agricultural recession hasrestrained consumer expenditures and slowed recovery in relatedindustries.While the near-term agricultural outlook remains grim, prospects forrecovery in 1992 appear more favorable.  The new farm packageannounced by the Collor government in mid-July reduces taxes on farmequipment, expands farm credit facilities and establishes a more rationalmarket-based system of price supports.  The government has alsopromised to accelerate decontrol of prices for agricultural products.  Atthe same time, key farm states such as Sao Paulo have reduced taxes onagricultural exports and production inputs such as fertilizer andpesticides.These positive steps should pave the way for a robust recovery in theagricultural sector next year.  But so long as the sector remainsdepressed, it is bound to slow the general economy's movement intorecovery given the farm sector's continued importance as both a majorpurchaser of durables and other inputs and a source of consumerspending power.RETAIL OUTLOOKThe June surge in new car sales by 25% from the previous month and18% from year-ago levels gave a big boost to overall retail salesperformance.  A preliminary study by the Sao Paulo State RetailFederation estimated June gains in retail sales in the state of 6% fromMay, and 9% from June 1990.  Excluding car sales, however, retailbusiness actually fell by 1% in June from the previous month.  For theentire first semester, retail sales showed moderate improvement with a2% gain from the year-ago level.Final statistics through May confirm the sectoral trend toward recovery.Overall retail sales in May improved by 4.4% from the previous month,the largest gain for the January-May period.  Supermarket sales in Mayposted a robust 13.7% advance from the previous month, though salesfor the first five months of 1991 fell by 23% from 1990 levels.Department store sales in May rose by 22.5% from the April total.Greater demand for credit purchases appears to indicate that the presentmomentum of the retail sector recovery should carry at least throughAugust.  In the first half of July, consumer credit inquiries in Sao Paulowere reported up by 8.5% from a year ago.  That indicator is significantgiven the virtual disappearance of credit purchases in the past two yearsbecause of prohibitively high interest rate charges.  As inflation hasstabilized, retail stores have begun to offer more reasonable rates,whetting consumer appetite for credit.Recovery in the consumer economy should get a new push in Septemberas the government begins disburse-ments in 12 monthly instalments ofnew cruzado funds blocked at the CB.  Many consumers already arecounting on use of this money to finance purchases on credit, and theretail sector is beginning to introduce special promotions aimed atexploiting this emerging source of demand.PROSPECTS FOR RECOVERYAt this early turning point in the recovery, Brazilian businesses still showconsiderable confusion over the near- and middle-range economicoutlook.  Some industries are gambling heavily on recovery: Processed-food companies, for instance, are proceeding with productive expansiondespite present softness in sales performance, in expectation that theconsumer economy will move firmly into recovery in the second half.By contrast, most capital goods manufacturers have been slow to expandcapacity and investment despite promising signals of gradual marketimprovement.  Similarly, foreign investors face a difficult call indetermining whether recovery indeed has taken firm root in Brazil -- andthe answer in many cases will be decisive in determining whether andwhen to enter or expand commitments to the Brazilian market. Moreira'sstop-and-go fiscal and monetary strategy -- encouraging recovery to anextent, but also restraining its pace so as to maintain control of inflation-- will keep prospective investors guessing for some time to come.Despite the apparent contradictions in present policy, notably in EM 297,Moreira has shown considerable skill thus far in lifting price controls andnudging the economy toward recovery without triggering a newinflationary surge.  The next challenge is to fulfill Collor Plancommitments to commence disbursements from blocked new cruzadoaccounts in September while maintaining control over money supplyexpansion.  The mere prospect already is heating up the consumereconomy, which poses an immediate inflation risk.  Moreira's move totighten industrial tax collection terms, though clearly recessionary, couldalso provide a useful brake in preventing the economy from overheating.Brazil Service views prospects for sustained recovery in key industrialand retail sectors as favorable, though a revival in the agriculturaleconomy appears unlikely until 1992.  Moreira's action to maintain ameasure of fiscal and monetary restraint on the pace of recovery couldprovide a more solid base for long-term recovery by preventing aresurgence of inflation, and thus a return to the shock-plan therapy thathas distorted the general economy over the past five years.  It appearsthat the present economic team is less concerned with short-term politicalexpediency than responsible fiscal and monetary management -- and thatmust be regarded as good news for prospective investors.Back to Headline List WT03-B03-19IA086-000615-B048-181http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it156.html 205.156.212.5 19970122022710 text/html 115665HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 02:24:56 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:35 GMTContent-length: 115477Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it156.html Sample Issue Copyright BUSINESS LINE via NewsNet October 2, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES INDIA: Strong buying interest fuels Thermax and affects performance at other companies (705 words) INDIA: National Panasonic launching new products (396 words) Indian Oil Corp unveils Rs. 35,000-cr. investment plans (489 words) Securities & Exchange Board of India insists stock exchanges verify payment of all commissions & brokerages (122 words) Indian Petrochemicals Corp hikes DMT price (130 words) INDIA: Guarantee for Cogentrix "close on line" (139 words) INDIA: PAL-Peugeot lifts lock-out, workers yet to report (114 words) International Combustion India Ltd ties up with US company (156 words) Indian Space Research Organisation moots four medium earth orbit satellites (80 words) INDIA: Smithkline Beecham pact with Serum Institute (96 words) INDIA: Centre reviewing National Textiles Corp mills" revival plan (99 words) INDIA: Stay on Bureau for Industrial & Financial Reconstruction order extended: Deve Paints (97 words) Cotton Corporation of India sales up 10.7%, net down 11% (171 words) Air-India to sue Caribjet over "faulty" aircraft (96 words) INDIA: Nordic Investment Bank to offer IDBI credit aggregating $50 million (179 words) INDIA: Kudremukh Iron Ore exports up 10% (165 words) INDIA: Kopran ties up with United Kindoms company (156 words) INDIA: Mafatlal Industries initiates restructuring exercise (173 words) INDIA: Adidas joint venture with Magnum International Trading to launch global products (144 words) INDIA: Lupin Laboratories shelves diversification plan (122 words) INDIA: TTK Biomed in venture with Maersk Medical (101 words) INDIA: NEPC to acquire 4 aircraft on lease (144 words) INDIA: Citicorp Information Technology Industries Ltd signs contract with Philippine Bank of Communication (133 words) INDIA: Software Technology Group-Lotus tie up (88 words) Microsoft India deal with Virtual Corp. to provide customers with IT solutions (182 words) INDIA: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone develops WebDeFax (208 words) INDIA: STOCK MARKET, 10-02-96 (1211 words) INDIA: COMMODITIES, 10-02-96: Precious metals decline (137 words) INDIA: Costly amputation: Ponni Sugars (153 words) INDIA: Strained margins: Non-disbursal of ad hoc subsidies due to di-ammonium phosphate producers (114 words) INDIA: BSE Sensex continued downward course relentlessly (86 words) INDIA-FAST TRACK: Housing Development Finance Corp (210 words) INDIA-FAST TRACK: Apollo Tyres (299 words) INDIA: Cane diversion may increase in "96-97 (244 words) INDIA: Mr. Philipose Matthai elected Chairman of International Coffee Council executive board (93 words) EDITORIAL: Anti-dumping blues: Major hurdle in the way of India"s exports to Europe (732 words) INDIA: Ramar claim dubbed "dishonest": Herbal fuel (795 words) Southern India Mills Association for strong action to avert European Union anti-dumping duty (815 words) INDIA: Contest likely for top slot in Catholic Syrian Bank (689 words) INDIA: Best and Crompton impasse: Mallya blames financial institutions" "intransigence" (535 words) Indian Statistical Institute to conduct survey on co.s awarded ISO certification (431 words) INDIA: Iomega unruffled by LS-120 drive entry (996 words) INDIA: National Thermal Power Corp posts record sales despite outstandings (601 words) INDIA: Pradeshiya Industrial & Investment Corporation of UP taking tips from ground realities (932 words) INDIA: Chennai housing property still dear (735 words) INDIA: New rubber tapping system (589 words) INDIA: Campco to make, sell arecanut products (552 words) CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996INDIA: Strong buying interest fuels Thermax and affects performance atother companiesfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996by T.B.

Another factor adding to the  indstry'swoes was the plunge in alcohol prices, from Rs. 28 per  litre  in1993-94 to Rs. 4 per litre as on  date,  with  demand  still  notpicking up. This led to a huge pile-up of  molasses  stocks  withsugar mills, which are having inventory problems, he said.[Sugar]Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996INDIA: Mr. Philipose Matthai elected Chairman of International CoffeeCouncil executive boardfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996BANGALORE: The Coffee Board Chairman, Mr. Philipose Matthai,  hasbeen elected as the  Chairman  of  the  Executive  Board  of  theInternational  Coffee  Council,  the  governing   body   of   theInternational Coffee Organisation at  the  ICO  meeting  held  inLondon recently.

Currently, as was made clear at a recent seminar  by  Mr.Harold Wenig, head of the anti-dumping unit of the EU,  ``only  aminuscule 0.05 per cent of Indian exports is  covered  under  theanti-dumping provisions of the  European  Commission''.  But  thefact remains that since the beginning of the current  year  therehas been  an  increasing  trend  of  anti-dumping  charges  beingslapped on India's exports. This has been linked  to  efforts  onthe part of the European industry trying to protect itself in theface of WTO-regulated moves to lower trade barriers all over  theworld.As is to be expected, it is not only European importers  who  aremoving to make the entry of cheap  imports  from  the  developingworld more difficult. In the course of  a  single  month  earlierthis  year,   the   US   International   Trade   Council   leviedcountervailing duties on 15 Indian exporters of  iron  and  steelproducts and anti-dumping duties on as many as 25  exporters.  Inthe  case  of  the  US,  this  is  an  election   year   and   noadministration can  afford  to  alienate  the  powerful  domesticindustrial lobbies whose support is  crucial  for  a  re-electionbid. The EU has begun more than 10 investigations  against  Indiaalone, two of which  have  ended  with  the  imposition  of  antidumping  duties  on  oxalic  acid,  polyester  blended  yarn  andpolyester staple fibre. In March, reports indicated that  the  EUhad taken up  a  fresh  investigation  into  dumping  allegationsrelating to grey cotton unbleached fabric against India and othertextile-exporting  countries  such  as  Pakistan,  China,  Egypt,Turkey and Indonesia. The specific allegation made by  Eurocoton,a European trade lobby, was that the exporters (around 265 Indianproducers are involved) were underpricing their  products  by  36per cent resulting in a decline in the market share  of  Europeantextile manufacturers to 25 per cent from 33  per  cent.  Despitethe fact that an earlier investigation into  the  same  complaintwas, according to Indian officials, ``on the  verge  of  collapsewhen it was withdrawn'', there is now every indication that  antidumping duties will  be  slapped  on  the  exporters,  the  ratesvarying between 3.3 per cent and 27.5  per  cent.  In  fact,  theUnion Textiles Ministry is already reported to have taken up  thematter with Brussels since this specific product category forms asizeable chunk of the country's total textile exports.The argument that the EU should desist from slapping anti-dumpingduties of this magnitude  because  of  their  serious  impact  onIndian exports will, of course, not be effective because Brusselscan argue, equally effectively, that it cannot allow the Europeanindustry to be hurt by  such  cheap  imports.  The  point  is  toconvince the EU authorities that the prices of textile and  otherproducts currently being investigated are not  artificially  low.This can be done only with effective legal support. Indeed,  thisneed has been recognised  to  the  extent  that  a  proposal  hasalready  been  made  to  the  Commerce  Ministry  (when   Mr   P.Chidambaram was the Commerce Minister) to set  up  a  fund  whichcould be utilised by exporters to challenge the levy of  punitiveduties in appropriate courts. The fund could also be used  mainlyby small and medium-size exporters to represent their case beforethe EU for a reduction in the  rates  of  anti-dumping  duty  (asreflected in the varying rates imposed on exports of grey  cottonunbleached fabric). Such consultations  were  encouraged  by  Mr.Wenig  at  the  New  Delhi  seminar,   his   entirely   justifiedapprehension being that in the absence of such cooperation the EUwould be forced to rely on ``estimates which (are) not always  inthe best interests of the exporters''.In short, there is nothing wrong with the  levy  of  anti-dumpingduties as such. India too has slapped similar charges  on  selectimports such as theophylline and caffeine from China.  The  pointis that the imposition should not be perceived as arbitrary,  thelatest example being the duty slapped by the  EU  on  exports  ofplastic woven sacks. The Government has an important role to playin helping exporters in this specific sphere, a task which it hasnot performed satisfactorily till now.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996INDIA: Ramar claim dubbed "dishonest": Herbal fuelfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996Our Science CorrespondentNEW DELHI, Oct. 1MR. Ramar Pillai's claim of a successful  process  for  producing`herbal fuel' has been dubbed `dishonest' by  the  Department  ofScience and Technology (DST), which ostensibly tried its best  tohelp him obtain a patent and prove his method.The DST Secretary, Dr. V. S.  Ramamurthy,  today  said  when  theexperiment at the Chennai IIT  failed  to  produce  any  fuel  onSeptember 26, Mr. Ramar used a hollow metallic stirrer from whichoil flowed into the boiling concoction of herbs, chemicals, etc.The scientists carrying out the test had to stop  the  experimentand were convinced beyond doubt that the wonder fuel  was  not  aresult of the reaction of the herbs  and  chemicals  mixing  withwater, but an external source, Dr.  Ramamurthy  explained  to  reporters.An extensive analysis of samples of the end product generated  byMr. Ramar in the demonstrations conducted at  the  Delhi  IIT  onSeptember 3 clearly indicated that it was a mixture of  kerosene,diesel, gasoline and naphtha which matched with that available inthe country.The Indian Institute of Petroleum  (IIP),  Dehradun,  Indian  OilCorporation's Research and Development Centre, Faridabad and  theNational Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune carried out  the  tests.In fact, the IIP said the sample, with a high content of  60  percent kerosene, naphtha, diesel and petrol, matched with  productsmanufactured using crude oil available in India.The DST was forced to react aggressively because  Mr.  Ramar  hadnot only thrown an open challenge but  had  been  accusing  scientists of not being fair, when in fact all-out efforts were  beingmade to help him get a patent, Dr. Ramamurthy said."Even today, we are open if he comes back with a request to helphim scientifically. Our effort had been limited  to  helping  himfile a strong patent and, since we did not find  scientific  validation for the process, we decided not to proceed further, " theDST Secretary said.`No political pressures':  Denying any political pressures in theentire episode right from the beginning, the DST  Secretary  saidwhat had prompted him to seriously process  the  matter  was  theclaim that herbs were the source for the  petrol,  and  that  toofrom the Western Ghats, and positive  certificates  had  been  received from three Chennai-based organisations.He said the story of Mr. Ramar, as far as the DST was  concerned,began in December 1995 when he wrote to the  Government  that  hehad discovered a herbal fuel that could run vehicles.  The  claimwas attested by three test certificates from the Chennai IIT, thePollution Control Board and the Chemical  Testing  Laboratory  inChennai.In July, Mr. Ramar came to the DST and demonstrated his  process.A sample of the product was then tested at  the  NCL,  Pune.  Thereport said it was pure hydrocarbon. Based on  this  feedback,  ademonstration was organised at the Delhi IIT on September 3  witha full log kept on whatever happened.According to Dr. Ramamurthy, in the IIT test, Mr. Ramar used 1.05litres water, 55 gm leaves and wood, 10 gm common salt, one sliceof lemon, a pinch of ash, 1 ml of secret chemical A, a few  dropsof petrol and a small quantity of secret chemical B.After the experiment was done in a stainless steel vessel and theboiling matter transferred into a bucket and covered with a whitecloth, the resultant product contained 900 ml water,  400  gm  ofthe herbal fuel and 110 gm of other material.Puzzling questions:  The puzzling questions that arose were:  Howdid the clear mass increase of  400  gm  in  excess  weight  comeabout? How did lead, sulphur, which  are  used  in  the  refiningprocess, olefins -- a consequence  of  the  cracking  process  inrefinery -- find their presence in the natural crude product thatwas supposedly produced?Armed with these doubts, the DST got together a  10-member  scientists' team (DST-3, DRDO-2,  IOC-1,  and  IIT  Chennai-4)  and  apatent lawyer and went to Chennai with an open mind to  help  Mr.Ramar file a patent if he could demonstrate his  process  successfully, Dr. Ramamurthy said. The experiment  was  conducted  usingglass equipment provided by the IIT and as directed by Mr.  Ramarin the presence of Ms. Poonkini and her  father,  two  other  keyplayers in the fuel drama. Mr. Ramar, however, could not  produceany fuel. He later told the media  in  Chennai  that  the  entirething was done on too short a notice and  that  his  leaves  werecontaminated.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996Southern India Mills Association for strong action to avert European Unionanti-dumping dutyfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996Our Special CorrespondentCOIMBATORE, Oct. 1THE Southern India Mills Association (SIMA) has urged the  Government to caution the European Union (EU) that  any  levy  of  antidumping duty on grey  cotton  fabrics  from  India  would  inviteretaliatory action from it.In a memorandum to the Union Commerce Minister, Dr. B.  B.  Ramaiah, the SIMA Chairman, Mr. B. K. Patodia, said it was stated thatthe EU was planning to slap anti-dumping levies  on  grey  cottonfabrics imported from India. The levy ranged from 3.3 per cent to25 per cent, the average duty being  around  17.8  per  cent.  Iflevied, it may come into force from next month.He said there was no justification for the EU to resort  to  thisstep and urged the Minister to persuade the EU through  all  channels to desist from its move.Mr. Patodia pointed out that it was not as  if  the  EU  did  notbenefit from trade with India. In 1995, India  imported  430  million-ECU worth of textile machinery from the it. Airbus Industriewas a major supplier of aircraft to Indian airlines.He wanted the Government to send clear signals to the EU that anyunreasonable anti-dumping levy on grey cotton fabric sourced fromIndia would invite reciprocal action.He also wanted the Minister to remove the ceiling on cotton  yarnexports and to link the export of cotton yarn to  the  fulfilmentof hank yarn obligation. He said the annual quantitative  restrictions on cotton yarn exports was based on the wrong premise  thatunlimited yarn export would hit domestic users.While an additional 31.66 million kg of yarn  was  exported  lastyear, the additional quantity supplied  within  the  country  was136.86 million kg.Mr. Patodia said the  hank  yarn  obligation  was  an  artificialrestriction as there was no shortage of it. In 1995-96, hank yarnproduction had been put at 580 million kg but mills were  saddledwith unsold stocks.The SIMA Chairman said the insistence  of  the  DGFT  that  millsgiven EPCG licences should export cotton yarn of  counts  of  41sand above or they should import cotton if  they  were  to  exportlower count yarn was a  retrograde  step,  which  would  hit  themodernisation process.He said the international demand for cotton yarn  of  counts  41sand above was limited. In 1995-96, counts 41s  and  above  constituted barely 16 per cent of the total cotton yarn  exported.  Therestriction on the counts of cotton yarn exported would deny  themills the facility of importing machinery availing of  concessional duty.He also wanted the threshold limit of Rs. 20 crores on  the  dutyfree import of capital goods under the EPCG scheme to be  alteredin so far as the textile industry was concerned and  a  limit  ofRs. 5 crores fixed.Mr. Patodia said Bangladesh was the largest  importer  of  Indiancotton yarn, importing to the tune of Rs. 700 crores to  Rs.  800crores, which  were  routed  through  Petrapole.  Infrastructuralbottlenecks there had caused a delay of 30 to 60 days in clearingthe goods. Of the Rs. 250 crores sanctioned by  the  Centre  lastyear to improve facilities, only Rs. 5 crores had been disbursed.He also opposed any move to permit the  export  of  cotton  underopen general licence (OGL) as it would erode the  competitivenessof the cotton textile industry. He said concrete  efforts  shouldbe made to increase the yield of cotton,  which  at  300  kg  perhectare was one of the lowest in the world.He urged the Centre to permit the import of viscose staple  fibre(VSF) under OGL on a duty-free basis to check  the  price  of  indigenously manufactured VSF. Mr. Patodia said though VSF was  thenearest complement to cotton as a raw material and  fabrics  madefrom it met the needs of the poorer sections, there were only twoindigenous producers of VSF and its price was raised frequently.He said the import of VSF under OGL was being allowed  even  now,but it attracted a duty of 56.21 per cent. He wanted  imports  tobe allowed on a duty-free basis, as in the case of  cotton.  Thiswould help the mills obtain raw materials  at  reasonable  pricesand also steady the  price of indigenously produced VSF.Mr. Patodia said if they  were  to  remain  cost  effective,  thegarment/knitting industry had to use sophisticated machines. But,these industries were reserved for the SSI sector with an  investment cap of Rs. 60 lakhs. He suggested that in view of  the  needfor the latest technology, the investment limit be  scrapped.  Dereservation would attract large-scale industries  to  enter  thisfield.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996INDIA: Contest likely for top slot in Catholic Syrian Bankfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996Our Special CorrespondentKOCHI, Oct. 1WITH the term of the present Chairman of  Catholic  Syrian  Bank,Mr. Alfred Solomon, drawing to a close  on  October  30,  a  keencontest is likely for the top slot. At the recent annual  generalbody meeting, the by-laws were amended for creating the post of apart-time Chairman. Two contenders have emerged  from  among  theexisting directors.Mr. George Chemmanur, one of the directors in the  race  for  thetop post, said several others in the board had been urging him tothrow his hat into the ring. He said that he would be a candidatefor the post.Meanwhile, Mr. Jose Pulikken,  another  director,  told  BusinessLine that the board would come out with  a  consensus  candidate,emphasising that there would be no contest.Being the seniormost director of the bank, Mr. Pulikken  did  notenvisage any contest from his junior colleagues on the board.  Hewas optimistic that the board  would  forward  his  name  as  theconsensus candidate for the post of part-time Chairman. He evadedquestions on whether he would withdraw  his  candidature  in  thecase of a contest.The contest for the Chairman's post will come out into  the  openon October 1, when the Board of Directors meet  to  consider  thenames for the post. Once the Board's choice is finalised, it willthen have to be intimated to the RBI for ratification.Though no outcome is expected at today's (Tuesday)  meeting,  theissue is likely to exercise the minds of board members and figurein board meetings in future.The possibility of appointing a part-time Chairman arose once theBanking Regulations Act was suitably amended to create the  post.The Thrissur-based Dhanalakshmi  Bank  already  has  a  part-timeChairman, Mr. T. S. Pattabhiraman.Though the part-time Chairman is not entitled  to  exercise  muchexecutive powers, he is supposed to convene  and  coordinate  theboard meetings of the bank.Meanwhile, the Catholic Syrian Bank is likely to remain  headlessonce Mr. Solomon reverts to his parent organisation,  State  Bankof India as Chief General Manager.The bank is still in the process of short-listing applicants  forthe post of Managing  Director  from  among  the  respondents  tonewspaper advertisements. The respondents have to be at the levelof a Deputy General Manager in a nationalised bank. The Board  ofDirectors will have to select three candidates  and  forward  thelist to the RBI for the final choice and approval.Several directors conceded that this was a time-consuming processand the slot was likely to be filled well after the exit  of  thepresent Chairman. Even in the  event  of  a  consensus  candidateemerging, the process of selecting a new part-time Chairman wouldbe delayed since the final seal of approval has to come from  theRBI. In the interim period, when the present Chairman leaves tilla new Managing Director or a part-time Chairman is appointed, theRBI is likely to ask a committee comprising  three  directors  todischarge the duties of the head of the institution.Some of the directors expressed apprehension  over  the  emergingcontest for the Chairman's post. They conceded that the  takeovercontroversy in which all the existing directors played a part hadtaken a toll on the fortunes of the bank. It was an arduous  taskre-building the bank from that crisis, they said.Uncertainty continues to persist over the 39 per cent  equity  ofthe bank, which had been purchased by the  Bangkok-based  SurchanChansriChawla. The request to transfer  the  shares  to  the  newpurchaser is still pending clearance from the RBI.In the absence of a clear-cut  status  on  this  large  chunk  ofequity, the bank had written to the RBI stating its inability  toabide by the stipulated capital adequacy norms.The move to go in for a rights issue to shore up its capital  wasstalled on account of the uncertainty over the ownership of theseshares.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996INDIA: Best and Crompton impasse: Mallya blames financial institutions""intransigence"from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996by M. RameshMADRAS, Oct. 1Mr. Vijay Mallya, Chairman of the UB group, blamed  the  intransigence of the financial institutions for the continued impasse  inreviving Best and Crompton Ltd.Talking informally to this correspondent  at  the  extra-ordinarygeneral meeting of McDowell and Co. Ltd here  today,  Mr.  Mallyasaid in just four days after the Best and Crompton AGM  (held  onMarch 27, he had deposited the Rs. 5 crores with the bank  in  anescrow account.The rehabilitation package  was  contingent  upon  the  promotersbringing in their initial contribution of Rs. 5  crores.  At  theAGM, shareholders demanded an explanation as to  why  Mr.  Mallyahad not brought in the money. To which, he replied at  that  timethat any money brought in by the promoters would be taken away bythe financial institutions against the dues to them, and Best andCrompton would not derive any benefit out of it."The financial institutions (ICICI) are just  not  interested",Mr. Mallya said today. He said that within "just 96  hours"  ofthe AGM, he had deposited the required  money  "in  cold  liquidcash". He had also given a commitment in writing  that  the  promoters would bring in Rs.  20  crores,  once  the  rehabilitationpackage is signed, he said."It is six months since  I  have  deposited  the  money  (Rs.  5crores). Where is the rehabilitation package?", he asked.Asked what were the  events  that  followed  his  depositing  themoney, Mr. Mallya  said  financial  institutions  said  that  thecompany's building on Cenatoph Road (in Madras) would have to  besold. For this, there were several  permissions  to  be  obtainedfrom the State Government. Besides,  the  financial  institutionswanted the Rs. 20 crores to be also deposited before the  rehabilitation package was finalised."I am fed up with the whole thing", Mr.  Mallya  said.  "Everybody is blaming me for what happened, but Best and Crompton is  a100-year old company", he said, implying that  the  reasons  forits being in a shambles were historical.At the Best and Crompton's AGM, Mr. Mallya had said that when  hetook over the company, he was  misled  by  the  fudged  accounts.Therefore, he had not realised the extent to  which  the  companyhad gone down. When he attended the first board meeting  of  Bestand Crompton (as soon as the UB group took it over) in  1989,  hewas forced to approve the transfer of funds from the reserves  tothe profit and loss account so that  the  company  could  show  aprofit and pay a 10 per cent dividend. Further, no provision  wasmade for liabilities of Rs. 30 crores, which was against  accounting norms, he told the shareholders, in front of Mr.  V.  Srinivasan, senior partner, Fraser and Ross, which is the auditor of thecompany.He was equally unhappy with the way things were proceeding in thematter of Mangalore Chemicals and  Fertilisers  Ltd  (MCF).  Hereagain, Mr. Mallya  blamed  the  financial  institutions  for  notagreeing to any meaningful rehabilitation package.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996Indian Statistical Institute to conduct survey on co.s awarded ISOcertificationfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996Our Principal CorrespondentCALCUTTA, Oct. 1THE Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) has decided to  conduct  anational survey of the 1,260 companies which  have  been  awardedthe International Standards Organisation (ISO) certification.The exercise was to be carried  out  from  Bangalore,  under  theleadership of Mr. U. H. Acharya and Mr. Sanjit Ray, senior  advisers to the statistical quality control  and  operations  researchdivision of the ISI.The head of the SQC and OR  division,  Professor  Anup  Majumdar,told Business Line that the exercise was to find  whether,  sincethe rush for the ISO 9000 certification began  fours  years  ago,the Indian industry had really achieved a improvement in  qualityor was it just a status symbol that had remained on paper."We also want to evaluate the degree of competitive  edge  whichthe certified companies have been able to gain for themselves, "he said."We plan to assimilate  through  an  independent  analysis,  theexperiences of the big, small,  private  and  the  public  sectorcompanies which went through the certification process, "  Prof.Majumdar said, adding that the exercise to be  conducted  throughclient contacts, personal interviews and  questionnaires  to  theISO companies, had already been launched on  an  informal  basis.The entire exercise was expected to be completed in three months.Pointing out that the three year validity period of  the  certificates would now have matured for around 100  companies,  he  saidthe survey would also reveal whether the corporates had opted fordecertification or had in any way lost their certification due tonon-compliance.Referring to the UK experience in this regard, he  said  the  ISO9000 family of certifications had more followers in the  UK  thanin any other country, even as uncertainty remained about the realbenefits from certification.An in-depth survey of British  companies,  however,  showed  thatonly those which saw certification as an integral part  of  theirmanagement strategies were able to push the quality benchmark  tothe full extent of its possibilities.Stressing that certification did reward investment, he said  thiswas borne out by almost  12,000  UK-based  businesses  which  hadopted for ISO 900  certification.  Their  sales  were  more  thandouble the UK average between  1993-94  and  1994-95,  and  thesecompanies were four times more likely to have survived the recentrecession. Certified companies had a failure rate of 1.1 per centa year, compared with the national average of 5.2 per cent.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996INDIA: Iomega unruffled by LS-120 drive entryfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996by Arun NatarajanMADRAS, Oct. 1IOMEGA Corp.,  the  US-based  maker  of  removable  data  storageproducts, has dismissed any threat to its best-selling Zip  drivefrom the recent entry of  the  LS-120  drive.  According  to  thecompany's Senior Vice President (Europe),  Mr.  Srini  Nageshwar,the technological superiority of the Zip drive  and  its  one-andhalf year lead over the new product  will  ensure  its  continuedsuccess over its competition.The LS-120 has emerged as a potential threat to  the  Zip  drive,with the world's leading PC maker, Compaq  Computers,  announcingthat it will include the LS-120 `flopptical' drive in  select  PCmodels. Mr. Nageshwar, however, downplayed  the  significance  ofCompaq's move and said  the  Zip  continued  to  receive  growingsupport from the rest of the industry."In any other industry, the  market  leader  commands  somethinglike 30 to 40 per cent of the market, and has a lot of clout.  Inthe PC industry, however, where  the  leading  players  typicallyhave 10 to 15 per cent share, the influence of  just  one  playerlike Compaq is not as important, " he said in an interview.The LS-120 disks can store 120 MB of data, as against the 100  MBcapacity of the Zip disks. Mr. Nageshwar said though it would  be"quite simple" for Iomega to increase the capacity of the  Zip,the 20 MB difference would not warrant a change.While the Zip drive uses a purely magnetic technology to read andwrite data, the LS-120, which was developed jointly by 3M,  Matsushita and Compaq, uses a  combination  of  optical  and  magnetictechnology. (The `LS' in LS-120 stands  for  `laser-servo'  mechanism). While optical storage techniques -- like those used in  CDdrives -- provide higher storage capacities, the per  unit  costsof optical media are much higher than those of  magnetic  storageproducts. The flopptical technology attempts to  incorporate  thebest of both."We considered the use of a 21 MB  flopptical  as  far  back  as1990. While in terms of performance it was slightly  faster  thanthe floppy disk, the cost did not come down to  less  than  $100.Companies like IBM and other  PC  makers  said  the  cost  shouldapproach something like $50. That is why we  decided  to  abandonthe flopptical technology, " Mr. Nageshwar said. While the costsof the LS-120 and Zip drives are approximately the  same  ($200),the LS-120 disks are expected to  cost  thrice  as  much  as  Zipdisks."In fact -- and this is not very well known -- it is we who soldthe flopptical to 3M and Matsushita. And it was some of our  guyswho moved to those  companies,  who  developed  it  further.  Thespecifications (of the LS-120) are in fact still almost the same," he added.The LS-120 enjoys an edge in the fact that  it  provides  compatibility with the  currently  used  3.5-inch  (1.44  MB)  floppies.Iomega is, however, confident that the  Zip  will  soon  overcomeeven this handicap.Mr. Nageshwar said the company closely analysed the importance ofcompatibility before deciding to go ahead with a new format.  Forsupport, he pointed to the example of how the 3.5-inch floppy hasalmost completely replaced its predecessor, the 5.25-inch  floppydespite the incompatibility of their drives.Since it began shipping in March last year,  Iomega's  Zip  drivehas become one of the hottest-selling data storage products.  Thecompany has sold more than two million drives in  a  little  morethan one year. It also sold about 10 million Zip disks. In  fact,last year, it could not meet demand and has  since  licensed  outthe manufacture of drives and disks.Iomega says the Zip  is  more  user-friendly.  According  to  Mr.Nageshwar, the drive was created after a lot of  market  researchto identify user requirements and the problems  they  face  whileusing existing storage devices. It comes with a  built-in  backupsystem and the `Zip Tools' software,  which  makes  it  easy  forusers to manage, share and save data.Iomega claims increasing  support  from  major  PC  and  consumerelectronics companies. The list includes IBM, HP,  Unisys,  PowerComputing, Micron Electronics, Acer, Packard Bell  and  NEC.  TheZip is also supported by several of the world's leading drive andmedia manufacturers, including TDK, Fuji, Sony, Maxell, and SeikoEpson.Recently Acer Corp. chose the Zip drive as the storage device forits `AcerBasic' line of low-cost PCs. Also, Bandai Digital  Equipment Corp., one of the  licensees  for  Apple  Computer's  PippinInternet and gaming terminal, has announced that it will make theZip drive an option for its product.Iomega's other storage products include the 1-gigabyte (GB) `Jaz'drives and disks, the `Ditto' tape backup drives and  cartridges,and the `Bernoulli' line of removable  drives  and  disks.  Theseproducts are targeted at home and business PC  users.  The  education and  the  creative  professionals  (animators  and  graphicsspecialists) segments were especially important to  the  company,Mr. Nageshwar said.Iomega has nearly 2,000 employees at its offices  worldwide.  Thecompany's products are available in India through TVSE's  IndmarkInfocom division.The Zip drive was introduced in India two months ago.  The  driveis priced at Rs. 11,500 and the disks at Rs. 1,200. Mr. Nageshwarsaid the late launch here was primarily due to Iomega's inabilityto provide enough units to countries  outside  the  Americas  andEurope. He said the entire range  of  Iomega  products  would  beavailable in India by the first quarter of 1997.Mr. Nageshwar, who heads Iomega's European operations from  Germany, also oversees the Indian market. Hailing from Tamil Nadu,  hehad a long stint at HP in the US before joining Iomega. While  atHP, he was also involved in the development of the standards  forthe 3.5-inch floppy drive.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996INDIA: National Thermal Power Corp posts record sales despite outstandingsfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996Our Senior CorrespondentNEW DELHI, Oct. 1NATIONAL Thermal  Power  Corporation  Ltd  (NTPC),  has  reportedrecord sales of Rs. 8,387 crores during  1995-96  despite  havingoutstandings in excess of Rs. 4,955 crores owed  to  the  corporation by various agencies.Addressing a press conference, the  NTPC  Chairman  and  ManagingDirector, Mr. Rajendra Singh, said that the World  Bank  had  cautioned NTPC to take steps to recover its outstandings or the Bankwould stop the sanction of future loans.He added that total dues, which stood at Rs. 4,047.96  crores  onMarch 1996, increased to Rs.  4,944.4  crores  till  the  end  ofAugust, which is about 4.2 months of billing."This is against the World Bank norm  of  two  months.  We  havegeared our commercial activities and power supply  was  regulatedto major defaulters which include the State electricity boards ofUttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. When  the  Railwaysdo not allow people to travel without tickets, why should we keepon providing electricity without payment?" Mr. Singh asked.Among the States which owed huge amounts to NTPC  include  Delhi,which owes the corporation Rs. 743.89  crores,  UP  with  an  outstanding of Rs. 1,006.5 crores, Bihar Rs.  533.63  crores,  Jammuand Kashmir Rs. 334.02 crores, Rajasthan Rs. 353.45 crores,  WestBengal Rs. 186.85 crores and Maharashtra Rs. 239.37  crores.  Mr.Singh added that the corporation was facing  less  problems  fromthe States of the southern and western India.He said that the corporation had entered into a tripartite  agreement with the Haryana electricity board for non-payment of  dues."The agreement which is legally binding  will  ensure  that  theReserve Bank of India pays us in case the SEB defaults."However, despite such setbacks NTPC has been able to  register  anet profit of Rs. 1,352.61 crores and has declared a dividend  ofRs. 195 crores for the financial year 1995-96, up  from  Rs.  130crores paid as dividend  last  year.  The  corporation  generated93,155 million units of electricity at a  plant  load  factor  of78.80 per cent, Mr. Singh said. He added that  the  total  commercial realisation during the year was 84.54 per cent amounting  toRs. 7,171.59 crores.During the year, NTPC commissioned an additional capacity of  710MW by synchronising one 500 MW unit in Talcher, Orissa,  and  oneunit of 210 MW in Kahalgaon, Bihar. Besides, the corporation alsoacquired 460 MW of Talcher Thermal Power station  of  the  OrissaState Electricity Board. "The total installed  capacity  of  thecorporation rose to 16,795 MW on  March  31,  1996,"  Mr.  Singhsaid.He added that during 1995-96, NTPC generated 93,155  MU  of  electricity and contributed more than  31  per  cent  of  the  entirethermal generation and 24.6 per cent of the total  generation  inthe country. "The availability factor  of  NTPC  coal-based  stations for the year was 85.32 per cent, " he said.He added that the corporation's total approved investment  up  toMarch 1996 was Rs. 27,873.28 crores corresponding to an  approvedcapacity of 19,115 MW.Turning his attention to external assistance, Mr. Singh said thatwork on the second stage of Unchahar project had  commenced  withan assistance of $ 160 millions from the Asian Development  Bank.He added that the Japanese  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund(OECF) had agreed to give a financial assistance  of  19.817  billion Yen for the proposed 1,000 MW coal-based  project  in  Simhadri, Andhra Pradesh.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996INDIA: Pradeshiya Industrial & Investment Corporation of UP taking tipsfrom ground realitiesfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996by Rabindra Nath SinhaLUCKNOW, Oct. 1THE Pradeshiya Industrial &  Investment  Corporation  of  UP  Ltd(PICUP), which is among the top three promotional agencies in thecountry, has sought to strike a balance between  its  promotionalrole and the ground realities in the capital and money markets.With bank and institutional  funds  costly,  the  capital  marketshowing no signs of a sustained pick-up and ICD rates fluctuatingon the higher side, the PICUP top brass found some deviation fromusual practices unavoidable if it were to ensure  that  its  relatively cheap funds were  effectively  utilised  for  the  State'sindustrialisation.Thus, in its fine-tuned scheme of things, term-lending, equipmentrefinance and equipment finance have been  accorded  the  highestpriority, which, in turn, means drastically  reduced  commitmentsfor short-term loans. Also, PICUP has taken the view that workingcapital must be the responsibility of commercial banks.Finally, PICUP, considering ground realities, has  chosen  to  deemphasise the joint sector concept. As it is,  entrepreneurs  arenot showing much interest in the joint  sector  concept.  On  itspart, PICUP has lost interest as subsequent disinvestment  hardlyever takes place and, therefore, the  objective  of  re-deployingfunds in the equity of new ventures is  not  realised.  Moreover,disinvestment in the  present  depressed  state  of  the  capitalmarket is ruled out.PICUP has also minimised the earlier practice of back-loading  asa result of which bulk of the disbursals used to be made  in  thelast four months of project implementation. A strategy of  evenlyspread disbursals is already in place to the benefit of  entrepreneurs who, in the prevailing circumstances, are finding it  toughto raise funds from the capital market.The PICUP Chairman, Mr. Brijendra Sahay, and the  Managing  Director, Mr. Atul Chaturvedi, are optimistic  that  despite  the  prevailing political uncertainties, 1996-97 will prove to be anothersuccessful year for the organisation "which  has  been  able  toearn the confidence of entrepreneurs because of its  professionalism and expertise in  project  formulation  and  appraisal".  Itenjoys `A' rating of IDBI and SIDBI, they point out with a  senseof satisfaction.Against the targeted Rs. 185 crores for 1996-97, sanctions in thesix months to September are placed  at  around  Rs.  134  crores,which is 90 per cent higher on Rs. 72 crores for the  first  halfof 1995-96. Disbursements between April and September are  placedat Rs. 64 crores, against Rs. 63 crores for the  same  period  of1995-96. The mismatch, according to Mr.  Chaturvedi,  is  due  tofact that this year  August  and  September  accounted  for  manysanctions. PICUP's MD feels sanctions for the  current  financialyear may exceed the target if buoyancy  returns  to  the  capitalmarket.Recoveries at around 85 per cent of the target should  be  considered "good", says Mr. Chaturvedi. NPA,  at  9.92  per  cent  in1995-96, was lower on 9.99 per cent of 1994-95 and the aim is  tobring it down to around nine per cent at the end of  the  currentfinancial year. PICUP makes 100 per cent provision  against  NPA,he points out.According to estimates, its net profit in 1995-96  stood  at  Rs.2.87 crores. The net profit for 1994-95 was higher  at  Rs.  5.54crores. A pronounced downtrend in its merchant  banking  activityduring the whole of 1995-96 is a major factor to cause a  dip  inthe net profit. For the  current  financial  year,  expecting  animprovement in the  overall  situation,  PICUP  has  projected  asubstantially higher profit of around Rs.  10  crores.  "We  fervently hope buoyancy will return to the capital  market  and  ourmerchant banking activity will pick up, " says PICUP's MD.An overwhelming majority of the proposals that it  receives  fromentrepreneurs are for setting up units in western and central UP.The western UP areas -- Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater  Noida,  Meerut-- contiguous to New Delhi are  naturally  the  investors'  firstpreference because  of  excellent  communication  facilities  andproximity to markets. Central UP is the next choice of investors;a good number of units are already there and more are  likely  tocome up. Of the new proposals received and being processed by theorganisation, many are for setting up units for auto  components,steel fabrication, castings, bulk drugs and pharmaceuticals.In eastern UP, sugar and by-products continue to be the  mainstayof the economy. PICUP hardly receives any investment proposal  ofthe kind it gets for western and central UP. Mr. Sahay says  thatefforts are being made  to  generate  investments  in  agro-basedindustries including food processing units.While time alone will show to what extent the  efforts  have  succeeded, it is clear that in eastern UP, further breakthrough willbe possible only with integrated sugar  complexes  having  withintheir purview paper making facility, distillery, chemicals  unitsand cogeneration of power.The success of PICUP in its rather limited sphere  does  not  warrant an inference that UP is set to emerge industrially stronger.Because of political instability and socio-political tensions  inthe past five years, the State could not derive benefits from theliberalisation process, despite the fact that its incentives  fornew industries compare  favourably  with  those  offered  by  theindustrially-advanced States of Maharashtra and Gujarat.Much will hinge on the outcome of the ongoing electoral  process.The State's industrialisation prospects will certainly look up ifthe electoral process paves the way for political stability.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996INDIA: Chennai housing property still dearfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996by Deeptha RajkumarCHENNAI, Oct. 1WHILE commercial property prices in Chennai have  plateaued  overthe past 5-6 months after a distinct fall, the prices of  residential property in the city, though not exactly  untouched  by  theslide, continue to rule high.Builders, promoters and surveyors alike  insist  that  there  hasbeen no great slide in residential property prices in  the  city.There are instances where residential properties within the  cityand even in the suburbs have defied the trend.Of late, with a burgeoning middle class, there  has  been  a  conscious shift on the part  of  reputed  builders  to  exploit  thehitherto untapped potential in the suburbs. As such,  the  marketonly anticipates an increase in the supply of housing stock.While conceding that land value in Chennai has  appreciated,  Mr.C. H. Gopinatha Rao, a valuer, however, feels that it is  more  aseller's market. The rules and regulations are more in favour  ofthe promoter.According to Mr. P. Viswanathan, president, Sanmar Properties andInvestment Ltd, the residential property market  is  dictated  byperipheral sentiment. His argument is that any difference can  beattributed to the attitude of the end-user. "I conceive the realestate market as a standard industrial product. As such, I marketa unit apartment as an industrial and emotional product. You  maybuy it as a perception product."Mr. Ravikumar, General Manager, Chaitanya  Builders  and  LeasingPvt. Ltd, agrees that the effect is not so much in terms of moneyas in terms of perception. He is of the  view  that  there  is  a"tendency of late on the part of the end-user  to  postpone  hisdecision".Mr. Viswanathan said, "There is  a  difference  today  in  that,deals which six months ago would have  been  concluded  within  aweek are taking longer to transact and  at  a  slower  pace.  Butthere are transactions taking  place  and  not  at  lower  quoteseither." A tight money market,  a  dull  stock  market  and  theeffects of other financial sectors, are factors that  go  towardsslowing the pace.Flats in Tambaram and Velachery quote at Rs. 800-1,200 a sq.  ft.and in Mogappair around Rs. 1,100 a sq. ft. Flats in  residentialareas like Mylapore and T. Nagar go  for  upwards  of  Rs.  2,5002,900 a sq. ft. and in areas such as Chamiers Road, Landons  Roadand Victoria Crescent, anywhere between Rs. 3,000-3,500 a sq. ft.One reason for the comparative stability is the fact that Chennaiis predominantly an end-users' market, where in most  cases  housing is an investment for life rather  than  for  speculative  purposes. Hence, the degree of  volatility  witnessed  elsewhere  isabsent.Reiterating this factor is Alacrity Housing Ltd, which says  thatit is into housing as a basic need and not into real  estate  perse. With ongoing projects in the city as well as in the  suburbs,the company claims to have remained  untouched  by  the  apparentlull. The company, which has branched out into the suburbs, feelsthat there is a substantial market for housing there. Sales,  thecompany asserts, have in no way gone down.Mr. Navratan Lunawat, Chairman  and  Managing  Director,  ArihantFoundations and Housing Ltd, is of the opinion  that  residentialproperty prices have gone up. In its  forthcoming  projects,  thecompany has targeted the upper segment of the residential  property market. He reiterates that sales were never  a  problem.  "Itall depends on the credibility and repute of the builder."Another point of view is that the lull in the real estate  markettoday is more a process of  technical  correction  than  anythingelse. What follows is swift reassurance that  given  the  currentscenario in the residential property market, neither the end-usernor the long-term investor need worry. Only those  in  for  quickreturns may be affected.Sources in the industry maintain that for the real estate  marketin the city to recoup its former gloss, it  could  take  anywherefrom nine to 12 months. Meanwhile, builders continue to look  forcustomers. There are hoardings across the city  advertising  easycredit. And the response to advertisements shows that not only isthe broker network active, the enthusiasm of  the  landowner  toohas not flagged.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996INDIA: New rubber tapping systemfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996by AravindanUNLIKE most plantation crops, harvesting is a complicated processin rubber. Latex is obtained from the  bark  of  the  tree  by  aprocess of `controlled-wounding' when the shavings  of  bark  areremoved.The response to different tapping systems varies from  one  cloneto another. In general, budded trees are to  be  tapped  on  halfspiral alternate daily (1/2Sd/2) system  and  seedlings  on  halfspiral third daily (1/2Sd/3) system. There are, however,  certainclones such as RRII 105, PB 235 and PB 28/59 which are  prone  totapping panel dryness under alternate daily system.To ward off the incidence of panel dryness, it is recommended  toadopt d/3 tapping system where a high incidence of panel  drynessis encountered. It is preferable to resort to d/3 system at  BO-1and BO-2 stages if high incidence of dry trees is encountered  innew high-yielding clones. Daily tapping will  lead  to  increasedincidence of panel dryness.For high-yielding varieties d/3 systems  can  be  adopted  duringtapping on the virgin bark. Though the yield per hectare  may  beless during the initial period, the return  per  tapper  will  behigher. The difference between d/2 and d/3  system  will  be  narrowed in due course and there will be saving in  the  cost  underd/3 system.The yield from trees varies with clone, age of tree, fertility ofsoil, climatic conditions, tapping system followed and  skill  ofthe tapper.Intensive tapping is generally done on old rubber trees for a fewyears prior to their removal. The methods  of  intensive  tappingdepend on the  condition  of  trees,  previous  tapping  systems,availability of bark and the period  available  for  exploitationbefore felling.When tapping of renewed bark on basal panels becomes  uneconomic,new cuts are opened at higher levels, 180 cm from  bud  union  oreven higher. The tapper uses a small ladder  to  reach  the  cut.Since ladder tapping is more  strenuous  and  time-consuming,  reduced tapping tasks are done.Controlled upward tapping (CUT) is of recent origin.  It  can  bepracticed for longer exploitation of the virgin  bark  above  thebase panel. In the CUT system, instead of using a ladder, a  longhandled modified gouge knife is used for upward tapping from  theground and bark consumption is minimised.  Higher  yield  can  beobtained as there is no bark island effect.In the CUT system, monthly bark consumption is about  3-4  cm  inthe lower half of the panel and 4-5 cm in  the  upper  half.  Thesupport cut may be cleaned 3-4 times a  month  to  prevent  spillover. Since it is difficult to rainguard the panel it is  advisedto rest the panel during the  rainy  season.  With  tapping  restduring rainy season, one panel can be tapped for  more  than  twoyears. Efforts are on to evaluate methods to tap the  high  panelduring rainy season.Special training is required to use the modified gouge knife  andto tap without raising the hands  above  the  shoulder.  As  rainguarding is not a normal practice in  Kanyakumari  district,  CUTcan be practised by small growers and estates. About 50 per  centincrease in yield can be achieved by adopting this method.Trees can be puncture-tapped when they attain 40-45 cm girth  oneyear before normal opening of the tree. But, this  is  restrictedto large estates on an observational basis.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS LINE                                 via NewsNetOctober 2, 1996INDIA: Campco to make, sell arecanut productsfrom BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996by R. MohanMANGALORE, Oct. 1THE buzz word at the Rs. 175-crore Campco, Mangalore is to  diversify. The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing  Cooperative Ltd, has wiped off its modest losses and emerged with aprofit of Rs. 1 crore in 1995-96."The figures are yet being audited.  We  will  improve  our  netprofits this year again, " Mr. K. Ram Bhat, Chairman  of  Campcosaid. Talking to Business Line,  he said it had  already  decidedto reintroduce Campco chocolates in the market as early as  possible.At present, the Rs.  20-crore  chocolate  manufacturing  unit  atPuttur is utilised by Nestle. This agreement will end in 2000 andattractive terms are offered to Campco to let it out on lease for30 years. However, Campco now wants to go it alone.The aim of Campco is to ensure a fair price for arecanut  farmersin Karnataka and Kerala. It  has  been  holding  the  price  linefavourably since 1990. It had bought 25,000  tonnes  of  arecanutfrom farmers last year and this year the target was three  lakhs,he said.There are 64,000 farmer members of Campco in Karnataka  and  Kerala, 465 co-operative members and 129 branches all over  the  country. Though Campco's market share is only about 15 per  cent,  itinfluences the market price.One of the diversification is to make baskets and trays through atechnology developed by the Central Food  Technological  ResearchInstitute (CFTRI) in Mysore. The other is  to  sell  arecanut  insmall pouches of different sizes.Mr. Pramod Kumar Rai, Managing Director of Campco, said  the  Rs.50-lakh facility to produce such pouches was  ready  at  Yeyyadi,near Mangalore. Trial production had commenced and Campco  expected a good domestic market and demand in places such as  Singaporeand the Gulf countries, he said.About 68,000 ha producing 1,00,000 tonnes is  under  arecanut  inKarnataka and 69,000 ha in Kerala producing 80,000 tonnes. Campcohas already signed a tripartite agreement with the CFTRI and  theNext Paradigm in Singapore to manufacture and sell articles  suchas baskets and trays from the arecanut  sheath  and  leaves.  Thesupari pouches will  be  of  scented  and  non-scented  varietiespriced between Re. 1 and Rs.  1.50,  according  to  current  estimates, Mr. Rai said.For years it was manufacturing `Winner' comparable to  Bournvita."From this year onwards we want to repackage it  and  market  itaggressively, " Mr. Rai said.The co-operative approach has helped tackle  pests  and  diseaseswhich affected Indian cash crops. The latest  is  the  `Kole'  or`Mahale' disease, which has affected arecanut  trees  in  Puttur,Sullia and Bantwal areas.Mr. Ram Bhat and Mr. Rai were confident of tackling this  diseaseand have decided to set up a research and development  unit.  Theendosulfan pesticide used killed  the  milibug  and  its  naturalpredator. Further research will concentrate on a cure that  wouldspare the natural predator of these ant-like pests.Campco has invited experts from the Bangalore-based University ofAgricultural Sciences, Horticultural Department  and  PlantationsResearch Institute to tackle the disease which has affected about50 acres this year.Copyright 1996 Business Line (The Hindu)Back to Headline List
