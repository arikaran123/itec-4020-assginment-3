The trouble is, it had happened so many times before that it was difficult to know when the President no longer meant what he said. On 26 July, Menem gave Cavallo the sack. The long-serving minister had been at loggerheads with both President and party for so long that there seemed no reason to suppose the latest episode was any different from earlier ones. Only days before he was dismissed, Cavallo had prevailed upon Menem to push through, by presidential decree, a new round of unpopular fiscal austerity measures. These were in response to figures indicating that tax revenues in the first half-year had fallen well short of what was expected, leading to a fiscal deficit of US Dollars 2.508bn: slightly more than the total agreed with the International Monetary Fund for the whole year. Cavallo had been due to begin negotiations with the Fund in mid-August for a waiver on the targets set in the earlier agreement. He prepared the way by ordering a series of spending cuts and tax increases, designed to cut the deficit by up to US Dollars 1bn a year. Some 2.4m workers stood to lose benefits when state aid for dependent families was cut, and more than 1m may face reductions in food subsidies paid by employers as part of the total wage. The trade unions grouped in the Confederacion General del Trabajo (CGT), traditionally associated with the ruling Peronist party, responded by calling a general strike for 8 August, just before talks with the Fund were due to begin. Unions feel that the workers have been made to carry the can for the failures of government economic policies -just as PJ deputies feel the party suffered the consequences of their unpopularity in the Buenos Aires mayoral elections at the end of June. Relations between government and unions have been made even more strained by the latest unemployment figures, which put joblessness in the country as a whole at 17.1%. The figure last October was an already high 16.4%. The situation is considerably worse in Buenos Aires, at 20.4%. Menem has promised that the replacement of Cavallo by central bank president Roque Fernandez means no changes to economic policy. Foreigners, who loved Cavallo, may take some convincing. Two ministers depart, Page 7, inside.Back to Headline List CopyrightSOUTHERN CONE REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 8, 1996 CHILE: COPPER: SUMITOMO SCANDAL CAUSES HEADACHES: CODELCO RECALCULATES REVENUE PROJECTIONS While the rest of the world has been debating whether or not former Sumitomo copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka was a rogue operator out of the Nick Leeson mould, Chileans in general and the state-owned Codelco copper corporation in particular have been recalculating their projections of export earnings for this year. Price falls. There seems little doubt that the fall in the world copper price in the wake of the Sumitomo debacle will cut Chile's foreign exchange revenues and add to the country's swelling current account deficit this year (see detailed figures in WR-96-28). There will be longer-term effects, too. One of them is that the US Dollars 240m Lomas Bayas mine project is being delayed by Gibraltar Mines of Canada, as it has been unable to raise the necessary financing. The company had been hoping to bring the mine onstream in 1998, with annual output of 60,000-90,000 tonnes per year. Chile currently produces about 30% of the world's copper (1.2m tpy), and investment plans aim to raise that proportion to 40% by the beginning of the new millennium. So any reduction in its revenues, and any delays in investment projects, have potentially serious implications. By mid-July, Codelco had calculated that its income would fall by about US Dollars 500m this year. Profits in 1995 amounted to US Dollars 1.7bn, thanks to an average world price of US Dollars 1.34/lb. This year marketing vice-president Juan Eduardo Herrera puts projected revenues no higher than US Dollars 1.2bn, on the assumption that the copper price will be around US Dollars 1.05-US Dollars 1.10/lb by the end of the year. Original calculations were based on an average price of US Dollars 1.15-US Dollars 1.20/lb. Herrera remains optimistic, however, that the situation might begin to improve from September, by which time the depressing effect on prices of Sumitomo's desperate unloading of its copper stocks, in an attempt to recoup losses of US Dollars 1.8bn, might have begun to work itself out. Military share. One contentious proposal put forward by Codelco to offset the loss of revenues is to stop paying the armed forces the 10% share of gross sales revenues to which they are entitled by law. This idea has already been put forward by Codelco executive president Juan Villarzu, backed by Herrera. The government, however (and of course the military), are not keen. Villarzu sees the transfer of all military financing obligations to the general state budget as the only way to keep Codelco's investment plans -and particularly exploration projects in Peru and Argentina- on track. Codelco paid over US Dollars 340m to the military last year. The government, however, nipped this idea in the bud. 'It's not on our agenda,' said interior minister Carlos Figueroa in mid-June. He added that, however reasonable the proposal might seem, and however much support it might have across the political spectrum, this was not a good moment to suggest it. Another possible way forward for Codelco -privatisation of the company, as advocated by the right-wing opposition- has also been ruled out by the government. It proposes instead a restructuring of the corporation, under which each mine would become an autonomous division, making its own business decisions. Legislation to that effect has been passed by the lower house of congress but blocked in the senate, where the opposition argues that it envisages an unacceptably subordinate role for private capital. The government retorts that private interests are welcome to enter into exploration agreements with Codelco, as Cyprus Amax has done for the El Abra project. But the four big existing mines -Chuquicamata, El Teniente, Adina and Salvador, plus the new Radomiro Tomic project -must remain in state hands. CLUES TO CODELCO FRAUD One positive side-effect of the Sumitomo affair might be to cast some light on the fraud perpetrated against Codelco by one of its traders in 1993. Juan Pablo Davila lost US Dollars 175m for Codelco by unsuccessful speculation in the futures market over a period of about four years, and was imprisoned for his pains. He still faces trial on fraud charges. Codelco is anxious to find out if Davila and Hamanaka had the same international contacts and used the same methods for concealing their operations. The corporation has already suggested that the London Metals Exchange should tighten up its regulatory procedures, which it regards as inadequate to control the activities of skilful speculators. PINOCHET SUCCESSION One reason why the government does not want to rock the boat over military finances is that the delicate matter of the succession to General Pinochet as commander-in-chief of the army is currently under discussion. Defence minister Edmundo Perez Yoma confirmed at the beginning of July that President Eduardo Frei would use a special law to defer the retirement of one of four senior generals for a year to smooth the transition from Pinochet when he finally bows out in March 1998. The four senior generals due to retire on 30 September this year, who might be beneficiaries of the so-called 'Canessa law,' are deputy commander Guillermo Garin, chief of staff Ricardo Quas, inspector-general Jaime Concha Pantoja and the commander of the first army corps, Ramon Castro Ivanovic. ROBOTS IN THE MINES Aware that a low level of technological innovation is one of the weak points of its development model (see WR-96-27), the Chilean government has begun to experiment with automated systems in the copper mines. The El Teniente division of Codelco announced at the beginning of July that it would use Chilean-developed robots in its new Esmeralda mine, which is expected to come onstream in the second half of next year. Economy minister Alvaro Garcia has called for a doubling of the present level of investment in technological innovation, which is only 0.8% of GDP, or US Dollars 480m a year; 23% of that is spent by the private sector.Back to Headline List CopyrightSOUTHERN CONE REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 8, 1996 CHILE: DRUGS: SEVEN HELD AFTER BIG COCAINE BUST: FORMER COLOMBIAN DIPLOMAT AMONG THOSE ARRESTED The seizure of 600kg of cocaine in the port of San Antonio, south of Santiago, on 10 July focused attention once again on the increasing use of Chile as a transit country for drug shipments from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to markets in other parts of the world. It also revived interest in a scandal allegedly involving drug-trafficking in the Chilean congress. Seven arrests. The interior ministry announced a tightening-up of controls at ports, airports and frontier crossings in the wake of the San Antonio episode, for which seven people were subsequently arrested, including two Colombians. One of them, Alberto Botero, was a former diplomat assigned to Santiago who had left the Colombian foreign service in 1995 to go into the clothing import business in the city. His sister, Constanza, was also detained after her arrival from Colombia a few days before the seizure. An examining magistrate, Marcos Felzestein, has been put in charge of the case. Carabineros General Ruben Olivares, head of the anti-drug directorate, said Chile had been selected as a transit country because of the high international reputation of its exporters; the mere fact that goods were from Chile meant that customs checks in the United States and Europe were less rigorous than usual. The San Antonio consignment, the biggest ever confiscated in Chile, with an estimated street value of US Dollars 14.5m, had been bound for Miami. The drugs were concealed in three autoclaves, used for sterilising surgical instruments, all of which had false bottoms. The merchandise had been unloaded in a container a few days earlier from a Colombian-flag merchant ship, belonging to the Flota Mercante Grancolombiana. The Chilean customs authorities did not believe the shipping line was aware of what was in the container. The gang involved had been under surveillance for two months, the police reported. The largest previous confiscation of cocaine in Chile was in 1989, when 500kg of the drug were found in a container in the port of Arica.  Enter Investigaciones. Que Pasa magazine claimed in mid-July that Carabineros had been dragging their feet over the inquiry into the alleged drug-trafficking racket in congress, forcing Valparaiso examining magistrate Roberto Contreras to turn to the plain-clothes police (Investigaciones) for help with phone-tapping and covert surveillance -operations in which Carabineros refused to become involved. The right-wing magazine claims that officials of the ruling Christian Democrat group in congress were implicated, and at least one of those interrogated had agreed to cooperate under a plea-bargaining arrangement. The involvement of deputies, it said, had yet to be established. Distributors and buyers of the cocaine, which was brought into Chile through Arica, appeared to be administrative and security personnel of both chambers. On 28 June the first arrests were made by Investigaciones, including the former secretary of the PDC group in congress, Maria Luisa Espejo. Nelson Mery, head of Investigaciones, said at the beginning of the year that drug-trafficking was his main target, and that he was in favour of all public officials submitting to random drug tests.Back to Headline List CopyrightSOUTHERN CONE REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 8, 1996 CHILE: ECONOMY: INCOME INEQUALITY JIBE UPSETS ANINAT: MINISTER SAYS HIGH GROWTH, LOW INFLATION ARE THE ANSWER Even as a remarkable upsurge in economic activity in April caused the government to revise upwards its projection for GDP growth this year from 6.5% to 7%, concern was growing at the persistent poverty and widening income disparities that are the downside of Chile's economic success. The central bank reported at the end of June that growth in April was 10.2%, and 9.3% for the first four months of the year. The figure for the whole of last year was 8.3%. Aninat regrets. Finance minister Eduardo Aninat hailed the performance as a guarantee of more jobs and higher wages. But two weeks later Aninat was expressing regret that more people wee not benefiting from the economic growth. He said better income distribution was desirable, provided it did not disturb the macro-economic equilibrium Chile had achieved at such cost. The minister was reacting to a World Bank report, released in Washington at the end of June, which said Chile had one of the most unequal income distributions in the world. He asserted that steady 7% growth and low inflation (the target is 6.5% this year) would bring greater equality of incomes. Aninat took exception to the World Bank's interpretation of Chilean statistics, which it said showed that 20% of the population had 61% of the national income. The true figure was 56%, Aninat said. The Bank gives Chile an income inequality index of 0.56 (on a scale of 0-1), which is second only to Brazil (0.60) in South America. The Chilean government's own surveys suggest that 28% of the population live in poverty. An opinion poll in mid-July indicated that 55% of Chileans regard the current neo-liberal economic model as unfair -compared with 46% a year ago. But 55% also approve of the government's performance.Back to Headline List CopyrightSOUTHERN CONE REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 8, 1996 CHILE: INSIGHT: CHILE SORTS OUT BANKS' SUBORDINATE DEBT: IN THE PROCESS, IT LOSES A CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT The recent resignation of Chile's central bank president, Roberto Zahler, was triggered, in his own words, by 'situations in recent months' -which he did not spell out, but which most analysts read as alluding to political pressures for a solution to a particular, longstanding problem: the US Dollars 4.3bn 'subordinate debt' still owed by several banks to the central bank for bailing them out of the crisis of 1982. Zahler is said to have adopted a 'tough' stand on this matter, which left him in a minority of one in the five-member board of the central bank. The precise nature of this stand is not known, but the solutions that the board has been approving are. Of the five banks who still owed substantial sums of 'subordinate debt' at the beginning of this year, one -Banco BHIF- has already repaid its obligations with the proceeds of an issue of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). The state of play with the four that remain is as follows: Banco Concepcion (which owes US Dollars 669m) and Banco Internacional (US Dollars 130m) will be settling their debts soon, with an issue of shares which will be given to the central bank in lieu of payment -and will then be bought back by the shareholders at a substantial discount (about US Dollars 182m, or 78% of their joint debt). Banco de Chile, which owes US Dollars 1.74bn, has struck a deal which will allow it to repay its debt over 40 years, also with a substantial (but as yet unspecified) discount. Banco de Santiago, which owes US Dollars 1.76bn, still has a year in which to reach a settlement -and is also certain to benefit from a hefty discount. Valparaiso-based consultant Armen Kouyoumdjian* reckons that the entire settlement exercise will cost the central bank about US Dollars 1.6bn. Attention will naturally focus on the details of the deals with the two last banks mentioned, Santiago and Chile, who jointly account for 81% of the 'subordinate debt' still outstanding -and which are the two most powerful private banks in Chile's financial system. Jointly they account for just over 21% of all the lending in the Chilean market (11.5% for Chile and 9.6% for Santiago). The only institution with a larger market share is the state-owned Banco del Estado, with 12%. They are also quite unique in that they seem to disprove an item of common wisdom about Latin American banking: that big does not always mean profitable. These two banks, the biggest private lenders, are also the two with the highest returns on equity -if, that is, the 'subordinate debt' is left out of the calculations. (Actually, this holds true for many of the second-tier banks: of the next five in market share, four are among the Chilean system's 10 most profitable banks). The accompanying graphs, which illustrate the position of the Chilean banking system at the end of June this year, show that private locally-owned banks are more profitable, as a group, than state banking, and that the latter is more profitable than the foreign-owned banks -the big exception being Banco Santander, which ranks both among the big lenders, with a 7% share, and among the 10 most profitable in the country. It is among the foreign-owned banks that one finds the only three lossmakers at mid-year: American Express, Boston and Real. *In his privately distributed Occasional Paper No17, The Chilean Financial System, of 19 July -which also provided the statistical base for the graphs accompanying this article. By the way, the appointment of a successor to Zahler may not be announced for another month or so. Among the candidates being mentioned are Carlos Massad, Jose Pablo Arellano, Manuel Marfan, Joaquin Vial and Juan Andres Fontaine. The latter, formerly the bank's head of research, is the candidate of the opposition -their contribution to an 'independence' already compromised by the incorporation of Pablo Pinera.Back to Headline List CopyrightSOUTHERN CONE REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 8, 1996 CHILE: FOCUS: SO HOW MUCH DID CHILE INVEST ABROAD?: A LOOK AT WIDELY DIVERGENT ESTIMATES Chile-watchers are entitled to be somewhat confused. In late June, within four days of each other, two institutions came out with calculations of the amount invested by Chileans in their main foreign market which differed by a factor of four. The central bank reported that accumulated Chilean investment in Argentina, between 1975 and May 1996, had reached US Dollars 1.3bn -almost 42% of the total invested abroad by Chileans in that period. The Camara de Comercio put the figure for investment in Argentina at US Dollars 5.5bn. It did so in the context of a report noting how Peru was growing as the second most important market for Chilean investment, with an accumulated total, to end-1995, of US Dollars 2.3bn -more than the central bank says was invested abroad in the whole of South America. Two reasons have been advanced to explain the huge discrepancy between the two estimates. One, mentioned by Chilean entrepreneurs to the Argentine business magazine Apertura, is that a large portion of Chilean investment abroad was financed from external (non-Chilean) sources, and that the central bank, quite appropriately, was only accounting that portion of the investment which was an outflow from Chile. Another, suggested to us by a veteran Chile-watcher, is that in many cases what was being counted as Chilean investment was actually the entire value of ventures in which the Chileans had only a share, but had also secured the management of the scheme. The central bank figures show that in the first five months of this year Chileans invested abroad a further US Dollars 433.4m, increasing the total stock by 16%. The Camara de Comercio predicts that by the end of this year, Chilean investment in Peru alone will have reached US Dollars 3bn, increasing the stock there by 30%. The chamber notes that 110 Chilean firms are now established in Peru. About a third of these have acquired interests in state companies privatised by the Peruvian government; another 40% have set up subsidiaries of their own. Apart from becoming Chile's second-largest investment market, Peru is growing in importance as an export market: last year Chile exported US Dollars 438m (and imported only US Dollars 147m). Talks on a complementation agreement, suspended since last November, are about to be resumed.Back to Headline List CopyrightSOUTHERN CONE REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 8, 1996 CHILE: ENVIRONMENT: GASANDES CHANGES PIPELINE ROUTE: PRESSURE GROUPS WIN PARTIAL VICTORY IN CAJON DEL MAIPO The protracted conflict between the communities of the Cajon del Maipo and the GasAndes consortium, chronicled in these pages (see RS-96-05, RS-95-07), was resolved at the end of June, when the two sides signed an agreement. The accord with the villages of San Alfonso and Pirque will enable the Chilean-Canadian consortium to route through the community the pipeline that will carry natural gas 465km from Argentina to Santiago and central Chile. GasAndes now expects the project to be completed by May 1977. Partial victory. The accord represented a partial victory for the people of San Alfonso, as the consortium agreed to change the original route of the pipeline, diverting it away from residential areas and the Cascada de las Animas nature reserve, and stepping up security -the two main demands of the local activists. Angel Santander, president of the San Alfonso residents' committee, said he would have preferred the pipeline to take another route altogether, but his committee felt it had made its point, and accepted the agreement to avoid further confrontations. The precedent has been established, as far as environmentalists are concerned, that a community can negotiate directly with a big consortium and win important concessions. Manuel Baquedano, president of the Instituto de Ecologia Politica, said an 'unprecedented advance' had been achieved. Local improvements fund. San Alfonso will appoint its own technical commission to supervise the works, and GasAndes will contribute with US Dollars 1m to a special fund for improving local amenities. The accord was mediated by the chairman of the chamber of deputies, Jaime Estevez, following a clash with police in which several people were injured. 'This is a debate that is only just getting under way in Chile, which basically concerns the contradiction between development projects and living standards in a community. The country has been growing for 12 consecutive years and these sorts of situations are going to arise again and again,' he said. 'NUCLEAR DUSTBIN' PROTESTS  Environmental groups have joined residents of the Palena district, 1,600km south of Santiago, in rejecting plans for a nuclear waste site at Gastre, in Argentina's Chubut province, 160km from the border. Concern about a project that dates back to 1980 has been heightened in Chile by the Menem government's plans to privatise the nuclear power industry. Chile's Comite Pro Defensa de la Flora y Fauna (Codaff) claims that the material to be buried at Gastre is highly radioactive, with a half-life of 250,000 years. Similar protests have taken place in Argentine Patagonia, and the governors of the southern provinces have declared the region a nuclear-free zone. Potential bidders for Argentina's three nuclear power stations (one of which, Atucha II, is unfinished) have made availability of a waste disposal site a condition for their further interest. Legislation paving the way for the sale is making its way through the Argentine congress, in the teeth of fierce opposition.Back to Headline List CopyrightSOUTHERN CONE REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 8, 1996 CHILE: NATIVE WOODLANDS ESTIMATE INCREASED: NEW PULP PROJECT PROVOKES VALDIVIA PROTEST The Chilean ministry of agriculture has upgraded its estimate of the total area of native woodlands from 8m hectares to 11m. The figure emerged from the country's first forest census, and was designed to allay the concerns of ecological groups, which fear that the country's native forests are dwindling fast as a result of commercial forestry. Chile's temperate rain forests begin at Valdivia, 830km south of Santiago, and continue to Tierra del Fuego. Agriculture minister Emiliano Ortega conceded that it was vital to protect the resource in the face of rising world demand for timber, wood pulp and chips. The pulp of native species such as alerce, trepa, coigue, lenga and lingue is regarded as particularly suitable for the manufacture of high-quality computer paper. Chile's exports of forest products totalled US Dollars 2.4bn in 1995. Exports down. Exports were, however, 20% down by value and 11.3% by volume in the first five months of this year: US Dollars 768.7m against US Dollars 960.9m, Jose Antonio Prado, director of the Corporacion Nacional Forestal (Conaf) reported on 17 July. Japan (19.9%), South Korea (11.8%) and the US (11.7%) remained Chile's principal customers, but international wood pulp and chips prices have fallen sharply in the early months of this year. Arauco project. One of the biggest wood pulp plants in the world, a 550,000 tonnes-per-year facility costing up to US Dollars 1bn, is planned for Valdivia. But, taking note of growing concerns about the environmental impact of development projects (see RS-96-03), the government, through the Comision Nacional del Medio Ambiente (Conama), is withholding the necessary permits until environmentalists' objections are addressed. Protected wetlands and a bird sanctuary stand to be affected by toxic liquid effluent from the plant, which is to be built by Celulosa Arauco, Chile's biggest wood pulp exporter. Proposals for a solution from the company threaten the livelihoods of a fishing community further up the coast. Arauco accounted for 18.7% of Chile's total forestry exports in 1995. Second was Celulosa del Pacifico with 10.1%. It is owned by Copec, one of Chile's biggest economic groups.Back to Headline List CopyrightSOUTHERN CONE REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 8, 1996 ARGENTINA: POLITICS: PROTEST VOTE IN BUENOS AIRES POLLS: BOTH RADICALS AND FREPASO TROUNCE OFFICIAL CANDIDATE The first direct elections for mayor of Buenos Aires at the end of June were a triumph for the Union Civica Radical (UCR), a good result for Frente Pais Solidario (Frepaso), a disaster for the ruling Partido Justicialista (PJ) and a wipe-out for the far-left. Comeback for UCR. The UCR, an urban party if ever there was one, has had a patchy recent history in the capital, losing out badly to Frepaso in the last elections. The victory of Fernando de la Rua, who won almost 40% of the votes, was a clear return to favour in the party's traditional stronghold. He takes over on 6 August. 'This should not be seen as the end but the beginning,' De la Rua said, referring perhaps not just to the Radicals' revived fortunes but to his own hopes of securing the party nomination for the 1999 presidential elections. Frepaso did better than expected, in view of its recent splits and internal tensions. Norberto La Porta won more than a quarter of the votes, leaving the incumbent, Jorge Dominguez (PJ) trailing in a distant third, only just ahead of Peronist defector Gustavo Beliz (Nueva Dirigencia), who was backed by former Frepaso leader Jose Octavio Bordon (see table). It was a huge protest vote against the national government, particularly against the corruption with which it has become associated in the public mind. La Porta also noted that the result was the voice of the 'pauperised middle classes' of the capital, who have suffered from President Carlos Menem's downsizing of the public sector. Menem attempted, however, to make the best of things, denying that the result was a plebiscite on his government's performance, and claiming that Dominguez had been the best mayor the city had ever had. He promptly appointed him defence minister when a vacancy arose a few days later (see below).Any hope that the extreme left and assorted green parties might have had of capitalising on the prevailing disenchantment with the government was quickly scotched: they won only 1.9% of the votes between them. Frepaso also secured a majority in the assembly, the 60-seat Convencion Estatuyente, charged with drawing up the statutes under which the capital will henceforth be governed. Chairing the assembly will be Frepaso senator Graciela Fernandez Meijide, who has been outspokenly critical of the limits placed by the federal government on the supposedly autonomous city government's powers. GRACIELA FERNANDEZ MEIJIDE Senator Fernandez, 65, won 34.75% of the votes as head of the Frepaso list, and has established her credentials as a serious candidate for Frepaso's presidential nomination in 1999, despite a late start in politics. She entered the party at the age of 60, and was elected senator for Buenos Aires last October, with 45.6% of the votes. A teacher of French, she became a human rights activist after her son 'disappeared' in 1977, and was a member of the 1984 commission, chaired by writer Ernesto Sabato, which investigated the abuses of the military regime. FERNANDO DE LA RUA The new mayor of the capital is a 58-year-old lawyer from Cordoba. He has served three terms as senator for Buenos Aires and was the UCR vice-presidential candidate in 1973. Ten years later he lost out to Raul Alfonsin in a competition for the UCR presidential nomination, but in 1991 became head of the party's organisation in the capital.Back to Headline List CopyrightSOUTHERN CONE REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 8, 1996 ARGENTINA: MENEM LETS THREE MINISTERS GO: BARRA AND CAMILION PRECEDE CAVALLO AS DISCONTENT GROWS The loss of two cabinet ministers in one week may suggest that President Menem has grown careless, after years of standing by his lieutenants through thick and thin. There are those who believe his willingness to sacrifice first justice minister Rodolfo Barra and then defence minister Oscar Camilion had something to do with finding sacrificial victims to placate a public grown tired of his government. Barra ostensibly went because his right-wing nationalist past caught up with him -though, as our sister publication, Latin American Weekly Report, pointed out at the time, he had also become an inconvenience for economy minister Domingo Cavallo (see WR-96-28). Within days, Cavallo had gone, too. Camilion's departure, on the other hand, had been on the cards for many months. But Menem insisted he would not sack him unless he was charged with wrongdoing in connection with the illegal sale of arms to Ecuador during last year's border conflict with Peru. That moment came when judge Jorge Urso decided there was enough evidence of a cover-up by Camilion to justify requesting the lifting of his ministerial immunity. The air force commander, Brigadier Juan Paulik, said he warned the defence ministry that arms apparently bound for Venezuela were probably being off-loaded in Guayaquil en route, but the ministry did nothing. And one of the suspects in the case, retired army officer Diego Pallares, has,  according to Clarin, told judge Urso that he bribed people with political connections 'at the highest level' to secure permission for the arms to be shipped to Ecuador.Back to Headline List CopyrightSOUTHERN CONE REPORT  via NewsNetAugust 8, 1996 REGION: POSTSCRIPT ARGENTINA/ Bombing probe.

He has also hinted at the existence of a cover-up involving the Buenos Aires police force and Carlos Telleldin, the only person so far to have been indicted.

Bids have been made for 10 of the 19 tranches representing an area of 44,000 sq km surrounding the islands. But industry observers have pointed out that the bids have been made on the assumption that Argentina and the UK will reach a cooperation agreement over the disputed waters. Best quality of life.

Environmental protest groups have criticised the plans to build the Parana Medio hydroelectric dam, which they say will cause flooding, alter the local climate and provide a breeding ground for new diseases. The authorities argue that the project will lead to cheaper electricity, create 10,000 jobs and improve communications between Santa Fe and Parana, as a result of the construction of a new bridge. The plans for the dam have been drawn up by Energy Developers International of the US. Patents row. Deputies from across the political divide have rejected comments made by US ambassador James Cheek roundly condemning the country's record on the protection of intellectual property rights. The government insists that the new patents law, which was approved four months ago, is in line with GATT rerquirements.  UK trade up. Exports to the UK reached US Dollars 155.8m between January and May, a year-on-year increase of 29%. During the same period imports from the UK increased by 13%, to US Dollars 176.1m. CHILE/ Coal strike drags on. The 1,800 striking miners at the Lota coal mine have for the fourth time rejected the agreement reached between union leaders and the government. The miners, who have been out since 17 May, are demanding improved compensation for the 450 workers who would be laid off under the government's rationalisation plan.  Pension funds. The Magister pension administrator is to invest US Dollars 12m in a similar fund in Mexico, in alliance with Banco Alianza. The move anticipates the creation of a private pension system in Mexico on 1 January 1997. Magister executives say they are attracted by the potential of the Mexican system, given the country's workforce of 22m. The company currently controls US Dollars 400m, 1.6% of the total held in AFPs. Top wines. The country has become the region's biggest wine producer, according to experts from the agronomy faculty of the Universidad Catolica, participating at the International Wine Fair of the southern hemisphere, recently held in Santiago. In 1995 wine exports totalled US Dollars 181.7m compared with US Dollars 12.6m in 1986, and the industry is aiming for US Dollars 500m by 2000. The main importers of Chilean wine are the US, Canada, the UK, and in Latin America, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and Paraguay. PARAGUAY/ Rebel without a clause. The legal defence team for former general Lino Cesar Oviedo, who is in prison on charges of rebellion, has renewed its efforts to secure the release of its client, despite the decision of Judge Jorge Borgaran to turn down an earlier appeal. Oviedo's lawyers argue that the charge of rebellion can not apply to only one person.  Population growth. The fertility rate stands at 4.5 per woman, the highest in Latin America, which has an average of 3.2, according to the Centro Paraguayo de Estudios de Poblacion. The survey was carried out among 6,472 women aged 15-49, between October 1995 and February this year.  Welfare weaknesses. Access to social security benefits is denied to 81% of the 4.1m population, and the proportion of those excluded is rising, according to a study by the planning ministry. Around 70% of the system's beneficiaries live in or near to Asuncion. URUGUAY/ Binational pipeline. Work will begin in November on the gas pipeline from the Argentine province of Entre Rios, according to Eduardo Ache, president of the state oil company, Ancap. The gas will be piped to the coastal cities of Salto, Paysandu, Fray Bentos and Mercedes. Overvalued land. Land in the municipality of Colonia is overvalued by as much as US Dollars 3bn as a result of the plans to build the bridge over the River Plate, according to the transport and public works ministry. The land is at present in private hands, and so will have to be bought by the government at a high price. Work on the bridge, which will link the city of Colonia with Punta Lara in Argentina, is due to begin towards the end of next year.

Disputes relating to availability of land for theState's industrial growth should be solved amicably, the ChiefMinister, Mr Jyoti Basu said here today.Some agricultural land must be acquired and this would not hurt theState's agriculture. The State Government had recently set up ahigh-power Cabinet committee to expedite decisions on all mattersrelating to industrial promotion, he added.Speaking at the 109th annual general meeting of the Bengal NationalChamber of Commerce, he said privatization was no panacea for sicknessin industries."How is it that as many as 450,000 private companies are sick?" MrBasu queried in justification of his contention.He said that West Bengal would soon become the nation's top industrialState with 10 per cent industrial growth.Stating that his State now ranked third in the country, after Delhiand Maharashtra, in terms of attracting foreign investments, the ChiefMinister said since the economic liberalization began in 1991, a totalof 1,239 proposals with an investment of Rs 27.741 crore came to WestBengal.Of this, 188 proposals were from the NRIs envisaging a totalinvestment of Rs 10,712 crore, he said.He added that his Government was committed to provide time-boundescort service through the promotional agencies for the speedyimplementation of the industrial and infrastructural projects.The Chief Minister said that the State Government had recently formeda committee of the State Cabinet on industry to provide expeditiousdecisions on all matters relating to industrial promotion anddevelopment.The committee, in the past two meetings had reviewed a number ofon-going projects and taken steps to remove bottlenecks in theirexecution, he added.A high-power committee of Secretaries had also been formed in order tofacilitate and monitor industrial as well as infrastructural projects,the Chief Minister said.Calling for better research and development he pointed out that theCentre had allowed about Rs 30 crore for this purpose. Industry housesneed to improve constantly their productivity and quality for survival,he added.Pointing out that West Bengal had achieved higher progress in terms ofthe State Domestic Product than the national average in recent years,Mr Basu said such growth in the past three years was the highest forany comparable period in the past three decades.Of the proposals received so far, there were 188 NRI/FDI projects withan investment of Rs 10,712 crore. In the calendar year 1995, 387approvals were received for a total investment of Rs 10,261 crore whichwas 469 per cent more than the corresponding figure for 1994, Mr Basusaid.The Chief Minister also said that between 1991-95, 214 industrialunits in the State had begun commercial production involving aninvestment of Rs 6,728.34 crore.At present there are 80 industrial projects under construction havinga total investment of Rs 2,240 crore, he added.Mr Asim Dasgupta, Minister for Finance, West Bengal, said that theState was aware of the requirement for infrastructure development.Regarding the tardy progress of the mega-city project, he said theState was not to blame.He pointed out that State had contributed more than Rs 104 crore fortwo years where it was supposed to give Rs 100 crore. On the other handthe Centre had given only Rs 34 crore.The State Government had allocated Rs 1,500 crore for power and roaddevelopment in the recent State Budget.Reacting to the BNCCI's proposal on SSI units, Mr Dasgupta called fora more "cost-efficient industrialization and employment generation".He referred to the proposals in the State Budget by which 30,000 smallunits would be set up all over the State.Copyright 1996 The StatesmanBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE STATESMAN                                 via NewsNetSeptember 16, 1996Editorial comment: TRIUMPH OF PUERILITYfrom THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996AS a duck, Bob Dole is looking more lame by the hour; if thingscontinue in this fashion, he will be a dead one in November. Hiscampaign is coming apart at the seams. The latest election ploy hisadvisers have thought up in their desperation is to ask for thePresident's medical records so that the American public is sure theyare not going to vote an HIV positive or a drug addict into the WhiteHouse. Have they collectively taken leave of their senses or are theyrehearsing kindergarten games? The idea seems to be to take some of theattention away from Dole's advancing years and beat Clinton at thefitness game: Dole is old but healthy, Clinton is young and degenerate.Questioned about the 21-point lead his rival has established over him,Dole takes out a letter written to him by his father after he waswounded in action in the last World War as proof of his tenacity andability to survive. That was 50 years ago; today wars are nowhere asbad for health as presidential campaigns. If this is the quality of theadvice Dole is getting from his campaign managers, he should sack thelot. All the big ideas have faded into the background, all the smallones, commensurate with the candidate's historical size, are appearingfrom the closet. His campaign is beginning to smell of frustration,meanness and mediocrity in other words, of failure.On the other hand, nothing seems to do any lasting damage to Clinton.The resignation of Morris and the revelations of the whore in questiondid not create even a slight dip in his lead, he remains as strong asever. The latest survey shows that the incumbent's position isunassailable: he leads in 33 States in double figures in about 25 ofthem with 408 electoral college votes. That would amount to alandslide. Clinton is surging ahead even in traditional Republicanpockets in the Mid-West, as well as in California and Florida. As abonus, Saddam Hussein became a media opportunity at the right time.Nobody, of course, is talking about platforms, they hardly seem tomatter. It is a war of images, one ghoulish projection pitted againstthe other. What is interesting about the campaign is what it portendsfor the future. Under Clinton, the commercialization of politics hasmade gigantic strides and very soon American Presidents will bedesigned, packaged, advertised and sold like toothpaste. Dole, for allhis old-fashioned conservatism, is a willing partner in the game, for,being the underdog by a long shot, he is even more dependent onadvisers than his rival. Let Americans sort them out as best as theycan. The world knows or perhaps, does not that the era of traditionalpartisan politics is drawing to a close. New political realities willemerge from the global underground whose advance guard is representedby the likes of Ted Kaczynski,the suspected Unabomber, Iron Mike Tyson,Shoko Asahara, fundamentalists, cultists and thugs of all descriptions,Greens, Vegans and the whole jing-bang lot of loonies crawling justbeneath the surface, to bring down the techno-corporate elite.Copyright 1996 The StatesmanBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE STATESMAN                                 via NewsNetSeptember 16, 1996Voluntary retirement scheme funds for Jute Corp. of India diverted to paysalaries, wagesfrom THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996CALCUTTA, Sept. 16. The funds earmarked for running the voluntaryretirement scheme in the Jute Corporation of India has been diverted tomeet the normal establishment expenditure like salaries and wages ofJCI employees.The diversion of VRS funds has also held up the Government's plan totrim the workforce of JCI by 25 per cent through the VRS route.Documents show that during the last three years JCI received a totalamount of Rs 2.70 crore from the Government towards VRS operation ofwhich Rs 1.80 crore have already been utilized by JCI for the purpose.However, due to non-receipt of funds from the Government for providingthe salaries and wages of its employees, JCI resorted to diversion ofVRS funds to the tune of about Rs 1 crore to meet the expenses towardspayment of wages and salaries to its employees for August 1996.The documents state that JCI had to take this step in order to checkany deterioration of the law and order situation arising out ofnon-payment of wages and salaries to its employees.Of the Rs 1 crore spent from the VRS fund, only Rs 10 lakhs have beenrecovered. The Union Finance Ministry has also inquired with the UnionTextile Ministry on how much of VRS funds have been diverted by JCI tomeet its establishment expenditure.In another extremely significant development, a part of an amount ofRs 5 crore paid by National Jute Manufacturers Corporation to JCItowards part settlement of its outstanding dues to the latter, Rs 1.15crore has been utilized towards giving the salaries and wages of JCIemployees for August 1996.This shows that the Government has not disbursed any sum to JCI forpayment of wages and salary of its employees.Moreover, the Union Textile Ministry has directed the JCI managementto utilize the balance amount of Rs 5 crore towards carrying out theminimum support price operation in case the price of raw jute fallsbelow the support price level.The Ministry also made it clear to JCI that the balance amount (Rs3.35 crore) should not be spent on clearing old arrears. It may bepointed out that the Reserve Bank of India provides funds to JCI forcarrying out MSP operation.Thus it is evident that JCI will not receive any fund from RBI for itsMSP operation and will be derived of its legitimate claim. It may bepointed out that JCI could not undertake MSP operation for the lastthree years due to shortage of funds.NJMC has a total outstanding of Rs 69 crore to JCI of which it hasrepaid only Rs 5 crore after much persuasion by the JCI management andits employees' association. Moreover, the process of repayment hasstarted after five years.The documents also show that between 1980-81 and 1994-95 JCI claimedRs 277.36 crore from the Government towards subsidy of which it hasreceived Rs 216.40 crore so far leaving a balance amount of Rs 60.95crore.However, the Government is yet to pay the amount to JCI. TheGovernment till date has also not agreed to provide guarantee to JCIfor obtaining bank loan to procure jute.Copyright 1996 The StatesmanBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE STATESMAN                                 via NewsNetSeptember 16, 1996Secretary for Textiles holds talks on jutefrom THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996CALCUTTA, Sept. 16.

And yet a British "champagne" torival the classic grandes marques de France has been "created" in aSussex village using traditional French methods, says a report in theSunday Times of London. How did this sacrilege come about! Well, saysthe report, a British couple spent a whole decade trying to perfect thechampagne process and propose to unveil their first bottle of bubbly,Chardonnay Blanc de Blancs 1992 (how French can you get!), come nextmonth.The French will have none of this effervescent nonsense. A Britishvineyard emulating a real champagne? impossible, pronounced the Frenchway, or better still, "faut pas rigoler" (you must be joking!). But theFrench are up against a scientific alibi. According to experts,Europe's climate is shifting, bringing to the south of England the sameclimatic conditions that Champagne enjoyed 50 years ago. So much sothat a wine expert who tasted the British brew described it as a tourde force with a "steely elegance of the real thing". And to think thatthe climate does it!

The Tea Board of India, which has been eyeing therapidly growing demand for iced tea in the USA, is chalking outstrategies to enter the market in a big way.The Tea Board chairman, Mr S.S. Ahuja, who recently completed apromotional tour of the USA and Canada, said: "We are currently workingon a strategy to enter the sizable iced tea market in the U.S." The TeaBoard's director in New York, Mr S.K. Sinha, said the U.S. market wasgrowing rapidly and was maintaining a steady growth rate of more than20 per cent.Mr Ahuja said that the Board will be collaborating more closely withthe Tea Council of the USA, which it has rejoined as an observermember. "We have realized the fruitfulness of the association with theTea Council," he said. Mr Ahuja said that the U.S. market had undergonevast changes in the last decade, but India had positioned i brewing oficed tea."Previously India lacked varieties of tea that were fast in colour, sothey were thought unsuitable for iced tea," he said. "But now we havedeveloped newer varieties of tea (Nilgiri) which are also suitablypriced." Mr Ahuja said the Tea Board was also considering re-joiningthe Tea Council of the USA as a full-fledged member. "In the year sincewe have been an observer member, we are extremely satisfied with theefforts made by the Tea Council," he said."So we are definitely thinking of a comeback." The Tea Boardrelinquished its membership of the Tea Council in 1991, and thenreturned as an observer member last year. India is also working closelywith the Council's Specialty Tea Register (STAR), Mr Ahuja said."It is our primary market, and it has been our endeavour to satisfythis market," he added.He said the STAR was doing appreciable work in promoting specialtyteas, whose demand "is surging, especially in California wherespecialty tea bars (like coffee houses) are gaining popularity."During his visit, Mr Ahuja met Mr Joseph P. Simrany, president of theTea Council, and important buyers like Mr John D. Harney of Harney &Sons.He is also scheduled to visit Toronto, Hamburg in Germany and London.India Abroad News Service.Copyright 1996 The StatesmanBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE STATESMAN                                 via NewsNetSeptember 16, 1996Editorial comment: MORE COMPROMISESfrom THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996WHY did Mr Jyoti Basu leave it to his Home (Police) Minister tocomplain that the Gorkhaland issue had been unnecessarily revived bythe Prime Minister's announcement on Uttarakhand? After the virtualrevolt by the CPI(M)'s district committee in Darjeeling, the ChiefMinister is uncertain how to deal with Mr Subash Ghisingh. The hillleader cannot be taken for granted at any time but the resolutionpassed by 25 of the 29 CPI(M) district committees supporting theUttarakhand idea and, in effect, endorsing the old demand forGorkhaland poses a serious challenge. Mr Basu can hardly wish it awayas an "individual opinion" and proceed to impose Alimuddin Street'swill on the Darjeeling committee. Dissidence is a virtue CPI(M) unitshave acquired from new-found allies. The crucial question is whether inthe new climate of revived hopes inspired by Mr Deve Gowda, andendorsed by Mr V. P. Singh, the CPI(M)'s hill committee can remainoutside the mainstream of popular resurgence. Clearly, it cannot if ithas to protect its rapidly eroding base. Whatever little is left ofMarxist discipline or "democratic centralism" is in head-on collisionwith the instinct for survival.The policy of appeasement was meant not only to check separatistambitions but also to restore peace to the hills. The Darjeeling GorkhaHill Council looked capable of blending the concept of autonomy withthe fulfilment of local aspirations till extraneous ambitions came inthe way and development went by default. Even now it seems possible toretrieve lost ground if the Central and State Governments can providethe funds and the GNLF leader is persuaded to fix his priorities. TheChief Minister makes every sense when he questions whether Nepalese inthe hills have any reason to look for "heavenly" gifts flowing fromStatehood compared to their compatriots in the plains. He might haveadded that they have no reason either to continue to repose faith inleaders who have used the ethnic platform for personal advantage. Now,with the Prime Minister's announcement giving a fresh lease topolitical tensions that had subsided in the last two years, Darjeelinglooks destined to have more splinter groups aspiring to power, moreleaders, more private battles, more militancy, all of which can do thepeople no good. It is a pity that Mr Basu now finds his pragmatismovershadowed by the need to win votes in Uttar Pradesh. He may bebanking on the somewhat nebulous future of the Uttarakhand proposalitself. But, in the meantime, he will be obliged to deal withadventurers and opportunists with the added prospect of fresh violence.He can simply ask the Prime Minister, did he know what he was doing?Copyright 1996 The StatesmanBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE STATESMAN                                 via NewsNetSeptember 16, 1996Sukh Ram held on arrival in Delhifrom THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996NEW DELHI, Sept. 16.

He left in a white ambulance under heavyescort through the gate next to the Air-India office and not by theusual route. Mr Sukh Ram was accompanied by his wife, Mrs Rama Devi.He was intercepted near the immigration counter and his passportseized.

The CBI team was accompaniedby doctors from the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and the AIIMS.Earlier, the Special CBI judge, Mr Ajit Bharihoke, while issuing thearrest warrants, said, there was "prima facie evidence of Mr Sukh Ram'sinvolvement in the case and his presence was necessary." The warrantsare returnable on October 1.The CBI S.P., Mr H.S. Sandhu, in his application said that the formerUnion Minister "appears to be deliberately evading the process of lawand was avoiding his arrest by remaining abroad." The agency said faxmessages had been sent to Mr Sukh Ram through the Indian HighCommission in London seeking his presence for the investigation.The CBI said the accused camping in the residence of his son-in-law,Dr S.L. Vasisht, in London, appears to be deliberately evading arrestby remaining abroad.The agency said Mr Sukh Ram as a public servant in conspiracy with theDeputy Director (Finance) in the Department of Telecommunications, MsRunu Ghosh, misused his official position and caused pecuniaryadvantage to Advance Radio Masts Ltd and a loss of about Rs 1.68 croreto the Government.The former Minister remained elusive for about a month since the CBIrecovered about Rs 4 crore and other valuables from his residences inNew Delhi and Mandi (Himachal Pradesh).(Money meant for Cong: Earlier, the former Minister said at HeathrowAirport before departure that the money seized from his houses belongedto the Congress and was meant for electioneering in Uttar Pradesh."The money was given to me by an important party functionary," hesaid, adds PTI.)

It also said Mr Dar willbe leaving for a five-day campaign tour of the State tomorrow.The party general secretary in a letter to the Commission, pointed outthat Mr Dar has been deputed by the party's central leadership tosupervise the poll campaign in the State. He also said during his tourof the State, Mr Dar had "abstained from using Government machinery."The Election Commissioners later said the poll panel was happy with theMinister's "prompt response". "I am sure others in the Government willnot misuse authority during elections," Mr Krishnamurthy said. "We arepleased to see that Mr Dar appreciated the stand taken by theCommission," he added.Mr Krishnamurthy said the poll panel was not only responsible forensuring free and fair elections but also to dispel any misgivings inthe mind of the people.The Commission had reacted to the Kashmir Government's confirmationthat the Minister was in the State for the last ten days and his partyleaders had been canvassing in his official vehicle.Following this, a communication was sent to the Home Secretary thatthe Minister may be "well advised to come back to Delhi and not bepresent during the day of polling and counting," Mr Krishnamurthy said.During Mr Gill's recent visit to the Valley, political parties,including the National Conference, had complained about the Mr Dar'spresence in his son's constituencies and the alleged misuse of officialmachinery.Copyright 1996 The StatesmanBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE STATESMAN                                 via NewsNetSeptember 16, 1996Cong denies allegationfrom THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996NEW DELHI, Sept. 16.

At issue is a provision being drafted by the Florida Department ofBanking and Finance that would give foreign bank regulators access to thebooks and records of foreign bank agencies and representative offices inthe state. The department had hoped to have the measure introduced when thestate legislature convenes in March.        The language frightened foreign banks, who fear the changes willenable regulators from abroad to enter a foreign bank in Miami and demandto see records of individual customers. Attorneys and bankers are writingalternative language that in effect would require the foreign regulators torely on the reports and records collected by state examiners.        "The question is whether the foreign bank regulator could come inon a fishing expedition and look at each individual account," said BurtonLandy, general counsel of the Florida International Bankers Association andan attorney at the Miami law firm of Steel Hector & Davis. "That (practice)could be subject to abuse."        Fernando Capablanca, FIBA's president and head of the Extebandesagency in Miami, said foreign bankers don't dispute the principle thatsupervisors and regulators should be able to supervise the activitiesworldwide of banks from their country. However, "we don't need to give thehome country regulators any more information than what you give a domesticregulator."        Capablanca said one attorney pointed out the problems that couldarise if regulators from a corrupt regime combed the records of a bank inMiami to see which nationals were rich enough to be shaken down for bribes.An attorney familiar with the complaints said others pointed out that therecords could be used to find candidates for kidnappings. Other, moremundane observers noted the records could be used to spot tax evaders.        Under the language being written by FIBA, home country supervisorswould draw information about foreign banks only by getting reports ofexaminations conducted by the state banking department.."It's not anattempt to limit the supervision or inquiry into the general financialcondition of the bank," Landy said "It's a question of extending it beyondthat point and being able to look at each individual account."        "We're looking forward to seeing what the industry comes up with,"said William Douglas Johnson, assistant director of the state bankingdepartment. Florida oversees agencies of 45 banks and rep offices of 21others, plus a commercial bank owned by a foreign institution. Another 10foreign bank holdings in the state are federally chartered--one agency, twocommercial banks and seven Edge Act institutions.--Craig L. WebbBack to Headline List CopyrightTHOMSON INTERNATIONAL BANKING REGULATOR via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SEGMENT ACCOUNTING RULES NEAR RELEASEAccounting standards-setters in the United States and Canada planto follow their global counterpart this week by issuing draft rulesgoverning when businesses must disclose financial information about theirregional operations and product lines.        The North Americans' exposure drafts on what are usually referredto as "segment reporting" or "disaggregated disclosures" are slightly lessonerous than the one released Dec. 20 by the London-based InternationalAccounting Standards Committee. While the IASC draft could requiredisclosures based on certain parameters, the identical drafts to be issuedby America's Financial Accounting Standards Board and the CanadianInstitute of Chartered Accountants goes no further than to press forcompanies to report segments based on how they break down their operations.        This difference of opinion has been going for at least a year, andofficials from all three groups are expected to engage in more haggling onthe issue this summer. Comments on all three sets of proposals will be dueJune 30.        Once it becomes a standard, the segment reporting rule promises toshed more light on how and where banks make their money. And the rulebecame even more important last month when Deutsche Bank announced it wouldstart publishing its group results according to International AccountingStandards. That will mark the end of the use of so-called hidden reservesto smooth out balance sheets.        Under the IASC's exposure draft, companies would provide at leastone breakdown of risks and returns based on business or geographical lines.In most cases, the actual one used should be whatever way internalfinancial reports are sent to the CEO, the IASC said.        The North American approach also starts with the way a businessviews itself, but unlike the IASC it stops there. "IASC ... recognizes thefact that this information does not always reflect the dominant source andnature of risks and returns," wrote Paul Pacter, IASC's project manager."In certain cases, therefore, information needs to be modified for externalreporting purposes."        The IASC draft recommends segmented reporting whenever a particularpart of the business accounts for at least 10% of total revenue. The NorthAmerican approach doesn't contain a threshold, recommending instead thatsegments be reported when they are "material."        Cally Hunt, assistant direct of accounting standards at theCanadian Institute, told IBR the IASC's position means in effect that anoutside auditor could claim the right to make a company revise the way ittells the world about its business.        "That's a tough argument for auditors to win," she said. oBack to Headline List CopyrightTHOMSON INTERNATIONAL BANKING REGULATOR via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BRIEFSNorway's Christiania BankCloses Seattle Branch        Norway's Christiania Bank og Kreditcasse is down to just onebanking outpost in the U.S. following the closure of its ill-starredSeattle branch. An official at Christiania's New York office said theSeattle branch was shuttered as of Jan. 1, but the Washington StateDepartment of Financial Institutions said the branch was shuttered lastSept. 30.        There wasn't much left by last fall in any case. As of June 1995,the Seattle operation reported just $1 million in assets, down from $125million only six months before. Meanwhile, the New York branch's asset sizejumped to $770 million from $225 million.        Christiania came to Seattle in large part to lend to the West Coastfishing industry, mainly fishing trawlers. But by late 1993, roughly 86% ofits $300 million worth of loans to this industry were nonperforming, makingthe branch one of Christiania's few foreign outposts that significantlyhurt the bank, according to a December 1994 Salomon Brothers report. oN.J. Starts AnewOn Banking Bill        A bill that would have let foreign banks put branches in New Jerseydied with the Jan. 9 adjournment of the state legislature. A newly electedstate Assembly was sworn in the next day for a two-year session, and isexpected to tackle the issue again.        The foreign bank language was part of legislation designed to helpthe Garden State conform with the interstate banking bill passed byCongress in 1994. The measure failed to pass the last legislature mainlybecause of fighting between domestic institutions, but there also wereprotests against a provision that would let foreign institutions create denovo branches, agencies and rep offices.        New Jersey is the only major industrialized state that restrictsnon-U.S. banks from having branch and agency offices. This might seemstrange given the presence of National Westminster Bancorp in the state,but NatWest has only a commercial bank operation in the state. oN.Y. Fed's E-Markets Chief: No Crackdown        The New York Fed's new emerging markets group will be stronglyfocused on information gathering and policy recommendation-and wasn'tcreated to crack down on emerging markets banking and financial practices,the chief of the effort stresses.        "I'm not supposed to blow the whistle. I'm not supposed to smackpeople in the fingers," says Terrence Checki, who last week was named tothe new post of executive vice president of emerging markets.        Checki, whose former title was senior vice president in charge ofinternational banking supervision, has long been the New York Fed's LDCexpert, working closely with both banks and Latin countries during the LDCdebt crisis in the 1980s.        The way to prevent the a new LDC debt crisis is to secure bettereconomic information from third world counties, Checki says, echoing themajority consensus put forth by U.S. policymakers and market players in thewake of the Mexican peso crisis.        "I think we need to see that the information is as available aspossible to as many users as we can," he says. While he believes that theInternational Monetary Fund "should not be in the business of assemblinginformation for the private sector," he does think the Fund has animportant role to play in making sure good financial information isprocured from borrowing countries.--Mary D'AmbrosioBrazil's Banco ExcelBuys Banco Economico        The fate of Banco Economico's $36 million New York branch cloudedlast week in the wake of the announcement that another Brazilianinstitution, Banco Excel, had taken over the failed Economico.        Excel doesn't have a banking operation in the U.S., and to date theFed has yet to determine that Brazil meets its standard for comprehensiveand consolidated supervision of institutions. (Brazil has met the standardneeded to qualify a bank to open a rep office in the U.S.)        This CCS problem likely means that Excel will have to give upEconomico's New York branch. Indeed, when Excel announced on Jan. 6 that itwould acquire Economico, it promised only to maintain services withinBrazil, particularly in Economico's home base in the northeastern state ofBahia. No operations outside Brazil were mentioned.        Economico has been under the Central Bank's control since August.Details on Excel's acquisition were sketchy last week; one report saidExcel's purchase was fueled in part by support from a Swiss bank and fromsome Brazilian pension funds. oFuji To RestructureAsset-Backed CP        Following a downgrading by Standard & Poor's to A-2 at the end ofDecember, Fuji Bank is working to restructure all of its asset-backedcommercial paper programs, bank officials have confirmed.        With around $3 billion in CP outstanding, Fuji Bank is the biggestsponsor of asset-backed programs among the Japanese banks. It alsoparticipates in a number of CP programs as a liquidity provider, whichmeans that many other conduit sponsors will have to find a replacement or"front" bank for Fuji with ratings of A-1 or A-1+.        The downgrading is also expected to affect the bank's  creditenhancement  business because some activities will become more expensive.For example, the rating agencies require that cash collateral loans be kepton deposit at institutions rated at least A-1/P-1, and a bank with an A-2rating would have to fund this enhancement in the secondary market at A-2rates.        Fuji has not yet decided how it will restructure its five CPprograms, officials said earlier this month. Recently, Sakura Bank, whichwas also downgraded to A-2, restructured its CP programs by hiringNorinchukin Bank to act as the primary enhancement and liquidity bank infront of Sakura. Fuji is considering such an arrangement among otheroptions, officials said.        The bank's fully supported programs, Dynamic Funding Corp. A and Band Progress Funding Corp. A and B, were already downgraded to A-2 alongwith the bank. Its partially supported program, Freedom Asset Funding,faces downgrading within a month or so if it is not restructured.--Jeanne BurkeCalifornia Awaits WordOn Which Regs To Cut        California's State Banking Department expects to get word from thegovernor's office later this month on which regs it can try to repeal.        Deputy Superintendent Walt Mix said several regulations affectingforeign banks are part of package proposed to Gov. Pete Wilson, but Mixdeclined to identify them. He said some proposals would require legislativeapproval, while other repeals would have to go through under the state'sadministrative procedures act. That latter process takes several months,while legislative action is a much more iffy proposition, given theturbulence in Sacramento over the past several years. oN.Y. State Lets BanestoSell Extebank Unit        New York State Banking Superintendent Neil Levin announced Jan. 11that the state banking board has approved the acquisition of Extebank byNorth Fork Bancoporation from Banco Exterior de Espa a.

Costello can't say when she's going to leave town.        Costello was promoted as of Jan. 1 to vice president, internationalbanking supervision and regulation, at the Atlanta Fed. As such, she'ssupposed to move to Atlanta from Miami, where she currently is branchassistant vice president. But Costello told IBR on Jan. 11 that she hasn'tset a date for moving to Georgia, and in fact hasn't even started lookingfor a home.        "Whether I'm down here or up there, I still have to be in twoplaces," she said, noting that the majority of the Atlanta Fed region'sforeign banks are in Miami.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHOMSON INTERNATIONAL BANKING REGULATOR via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996OFFSHORE SHELL UNITS GET STUNG AGAINRegulators are finding it increasingly easy to justify entertainingthe notion of barring foreign banks' offshore shell branches. The mostrecent evidence arrived last week, when the U.S. Customs Service said ithad arrested two vice presidents of Banco Portugues do Atlantico on chargesof using an offshore unit to launder funds from its New York branch.        An offshore facility also figured in the Daiwa Bank scandal,prompting the state of New York's chief foreign banking regulator to notelast month that "momentum is building again" among regulators to limit oreliminate offshore shell branches that are managed or controlled by onshoreoffices of foreign banks.        Assets at those offshore shell branches totaled $317.87 billion asof Sept. 30, Federal Reserve figures show. While that's down 6.6% from the$340.38 billion in the branches as of mid-year, it still is roughly equalto one-third of all the assets at foreign banks' U.S. branches, agenciesand commercial banking subsidiaries. Roughly half that decline during thethird quarter stems from a $12.47 billion slump in claims on U.S.-domiciledoffices of related depository institutions.        In the Banco Portugues case, revealed Jan. 11, the Customs Servicesaid that between August 1994 and the present, Antonio Delgado and FillipoValli received in New York more than $1 million from undercover agents thatwere handled as deposits in the Cayman Islands. BPA has a branch in theCaymans.        "The defendants were told and were aware of the fact that thevarious deposits they received from the undercover agents were proceeds ofthe illegal importation and sale of counterfeit jeans from the Far East,and from illegal gambling," the Customs Service said.        "The undercover 'depositor' was assured that his account would bemaintained offshore in order to protect the client and the nature of hisbusiness, and that no records of the deposits would exist in the UnitedStates. In addition ... the undercover agent was offered investment schemesto hide assets from the Internal Revenue Service."        Valli was arraigned Jan. 5, while Delgado will be arraigned thisweek. If convicted on all charges, each could be sentenced to 20 yearsimprisonment.        Banco Portugues' New York branch occupies prestigious territory atthe corner of Wall Street and Broadway. It had $447 million in assets as oflast June 30. Banco Portugues also has an $81 million agency in Miami.        In the Daiwa scandal, offshore branches figured in when it waslearned that the bank's New York trust company lost $97 million ingovernment bond trading during the mid-1980s--losses concealed bytransferring the bonds to a shell company registered in the Caymans.        At a Dec. 4 conference in New York on foreign banks, Donald T.Vangel, senior vice president of the New York Fed, said a committee of bankpolicy supervisors is debating what to do about the unusual facilities."It's a knotty question," he said.

This year was no exception.The 1996 show attracted more than 100,000 people to the exhibitionhall in Taipei's domestic airport from August 22-25. The show movedto Taichung from August 29-September 1, and closed in Kaohsiungfrom September 5-8."Many Taiwan inventors are small entrepreneurs that don't know howto cross the bridge to international markets from the home oroffice," said Johnson Huang, an engineer with Gwo Yann EnterpriseCo., and recipient of the China International Invention Award."The show tries to match buyers and sellers of products, andparticularly aims to help inventors to get their ideas in to themarket," he said.The flavor is local as the show guide is in Chinese, and over eachproduct table is a poster with a photo of the inventor and theproduct, a product description, and contact information. The textis in Chinese, however, and international traders that don't reador speak Chinese may need a translator.Many of the products shown have been patented but not yet launchedlocally or overseas.Taichung inventor, Long Yu-chen was showing a model of alightweight plastic shaft with a clamp on the bottom that can beused to pick up shoes."It's very useful for pregnant women that find bending overuncomfortable," she said. It's also suitable for obese individualsthat have trouble bending down, she said.Mr. Long, who was at the exhibition in search of agents that wouldexport the product, was taking orders for the product at NT$150each.Other inventors present had already launched products in Taiwan andwere looking to expand their overseas channels.Liou Tian-an, for example, displayed shoes that contain air ventsthat allow odors to escape. "I hope to eventually cooperate withNike on this," he claimed. Mr. Liou, vice president of Liou Tian AnTrade Co., said that he got the idea from an interest in massageproducts, and in search of a way to reduce sweat and odor in hisown shoes.Machinery products were also displayed. You Lian Machinery Co.displayed a powered grease applicator. It applies grease quicklywithout air compression. It has already been successfully sold inTaiwan, said W.H. Liu, a sales manager.Sheng Wu Fu Co. displayed an "autocraft power maximizer," which thecompany says boosts mileage by 15 percent in urban driving, byreducing waste connected to air conditioner use.Chai Thou Industrial Corp. displayed automatic car cigarettelighters with music. The product can be plugged into cigarettelighters in cars. Customers insert the cigarette head and it is litautomatically.Copyright 1996 TradeWinds' Industry WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightTRADE WINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996ISO 14000: CONSIDERABLE BENEFITS, COMPANIES URGED TO JOIN PILOT SCHEMEfrom TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996Singapore companies can reap considerable benefits by adoptingenvironmental controls under the ISO 14000 Environmental ManagementSystem (EMS) standards.The benefits include:  Improved operational efficiency;  Better utilization of materials and resources;  Reduced costs and wastage;  Increased access to world markets;  Improved staff morale and working environment;  Assurance to customers, stake-holders and regulators;  Enhanced corporate image.These benefits would be reflected in companies' "bottom lines,"said the Minister for Trade and Industry, Yeo Cheow Tong, at thelaunch of the Productivity and Standards Board's (PSB) ISO 14000EMS Certification Scheme.Mr. Yeo cited as an example an MNC in Singapore, which saved nearlyUS$1.5 million a year by recycling its packaging materials.Urging local companies to join the certification scheme, Mr. Yeoadded: "Apart from material benefits, companies can also gaingoodwill with the community and their customers. Being seen as arespectable corporate citizen enhances a company's image."Mr. Yeo announced that the government would provide financialassistance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for ISO14000 consultancy and certification.Grants to cover 70 percent of consultancy costs (up to a maximum ofUS$40,000) and for 50 percent (maximum US$6,000) of certificationcosts will be funded through the PSB's Local Enterprise TechnicalAssistance Scheme (LETAS)."Singapore has always been conscious of maintaining a `clean andgreen' environment," said Mr. Yeo. "From the early days ofindustrialization, the government has been mindful of the need toprotect Singapore's minimal natural resources and ensure thatindustry is not developed at the expense of the environment."He said that with the setup of the Ministry of the Environment in1972, Singapore became one of the first countries in the world tocreate a ministry specifically for environmental protection."Our sustained efforts at government, corporate and individuallevels have earned Singapore international recognition as a `cleanand green city' but we cannot be complacent," said Mr. Yeo."A growing population and continued economic and industrialdevelopment will impose further demands on our fragileenvironment," he said.Mr. Yeo urged Singapore companies to seriously consider theadoption of ISO 14000 in view of the many benefits that can begained.Meanwhile, to help Singapore companies to adopt ISO 14000, the PSBhas started a pilot certification program open to all companiesuntil the end of this year.So far, seven companies from the manufacturing and service sectorshave joined the pilot program. They will receive feedback on theirEMS implementation, and will undergo trial assessment at no costbefore formal certification by the PSB."I would urge more companies to join the pilot program," said Dr.Steve Lai, PSB general manager for Standards and Technology, whenthe PSB ISO 14000 EMS Certification Scheme was launched on May 28.The objective of the pilot program is to provide a partnershiparrangement between Singapore-based companies and the PSB to ensuresmooth implementation of ISO 14000, he said.The launch, which was organized jointly by the PSB and theSingapore Confederation of Industries (SCI), and supported by theMinistry of the Environment (ENV), was followed by a seminar inwhich experts in environmental management and certification fromJapan, the United Kingdom and Singapore shared their experienceswith local industry leaders and executives.The seminar speakers included Mr. Kimihiro Torisaki, director ofplanning and coordination, Japan Accreditation Board (JAB) forQuality System Registration, Japan; Mr. Clive Mason, deputydirector of the Regional Institute of Environmental Technology(RIET); and Dr. Glen Sunman, director of Asian business, AspectsInternational, U.K.The local speakers were Mr. One Seng Eng, chief engineer (strategicplanning), Ministry of the Environment; Mr. Wu Tek Ming, director,Quality Assessment Centre, PSB; and Mr. Jay Rajangam, seniorenvironmental engineer, Baxter Healthcare Pte Ltd.Companies can call the PSB's customer service toll free hotline at1800-7751167 for more information on the pilot program andcertification scheme.Copyright 1996 TradeWinds' Industry WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightTRADE WINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996MULTI-FUNCTION SECURITY ALARMfrom TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996This four in one personal safety alarm contains an LED flashlight,120dB alarm signal, a stun gun with a 1300V shock capability. and aclip for connection as an alarm  to doors or windows.Super Newtec Co.

Companies like Ingersoll MillingMachine Co. based in Rockford, IL, were showing off their technicalinnovations to the 120,000 visitors of IMTS '96. Its newestproduct, the HVM 600, a grinding machine used in the automobile andaircraft industries, is powered by linear motors. Linear motors arefaster than traditional rotary motors and don't need the bearings,worm screws and gear boxes that rotary motors require. It is allmagnetic.U.S. companies are coming up with innovative ideas that are movingthe machine tool industry forward. The average machinist today is acomputer expert and a math wizard. Skilled tool and parts makersare hard to find in today's job force. Virtually all the machineryat the IMTS show is computerized and automated. That is the futureof the business.Most forecasters expected the machine tool market to be off lastyear's strong pace, but the Association for ManufacturingTechnology is quite enthusiastic about the first half of 1996.Orders for U.S. industrial tools rose 18.74 percent in June fromthe previous month to reach 2.9 million. Orders dropped slightly inJuly down to 2.7 million. The outlook for the rest of the yearcontinues to show a bright picture, especially for exports.U.S. machine tool companies realize they have to keep up the goodwork and innovative technology to keep up with the competition.Copyright 1996 TradeWinds' Industry WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightTRADE WINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996TAIWAN MACHINE TOOL COMPANIES EXCEL AT IMTS '96from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996BY DAN ANDERSONChicago, Illinois  This year's International Machine Tools Show(IMTS) brought together another diverse and impressive group ofexhibitors from Taiwan. Taiwan companies continue to show why theyare leading players in the machine tools industry with their wide-range of quality products at competitive prices. The products ondisplay included: machinery parts and components, ball screws,grinding machines, milling machines, electric discharge machines(EDM),  lathes, and machining centers. It is important to note thatalmost all of these machines are of the highest CNC control-type.With these Taiwan manufacturers increasing their penetration intothe European and U.S. markets it is important that they meet thestringent standards in place, and this is where Taiwan companieshave greatly increased their overall standing. Over 70 percent ofthe Taiwan companies exhibiting at this year's show hold ISO 9000certification or the new European CE standard. These increasedquality standards combined with Taiwan companies' innovation andentrepreneurial abilities may provide the best answers as to whyTaiwan companies are expected to increase their market share overthe next few years.Awea Machantronic Co., Ltd. is a perfect example of a Taiwancompany using indigenous Taiwan technology to successfully competewith the strong competitors from Germany, Japan, Switzerland, andthe United States. Awea has taken technology that was firstdeveloped at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), aTaiwan government sponsored technology institute, and incorporatedthis technology into their Double Column Machining Centers. Thisproduct is competitively priced and Awea has already sold over 20of these machines during the first half of this year. It is alsoutilizing a marketing outreach program by advertising in most ofthe major machine tool trade publications in order to furtherpromote the company and its products.Another strong example comes from Corisma Machine Tool Co., Ltd.Corisma has only been in business for six years but has alreadydeveloped a strong foothold in the machine tools market utilizingits high technology expertise. The company is a three time winnerof Taiwan's Symbol of Excellence (1993, 1995, 1996) and this yearit was awarded the prize of Outstanding Enterprise in Taiwan.During this year's IMTS, Corisma is finding positive responses toits newly developed CNC Wire-Cut EDM. According to a Corismarepresentative, it was the first maker in Taiwan of such a productwith almost all of their competitors coming from either Japan orSwitzerland. Though competition is well-based, the company stillexpressed optimism that because of its stringent quality standards(it has CE qualification) and competitive pricing, it will enjoy apositive penetration into this market segment.Another area where Taiwan companies are looking to excel is thedevelopment of strategic partnerships. By utilizing Taiwan'srelatively low production costs but still maintaining high-qualitystandards, Taiwan companies are increasingly looking to developalliances with their Japanese, European and U.S. competitors,providing both sides with a more competitive product.For instance, Leadwell CNC Machines Mfg., Corp., a leading Taiwanmachine tools company, has developed, in conjunction with the U.S.company Wes-tech, Inc., an automatic CNC lathe using robotic gantrytechnology. Leadwell is very optimistic about this new product andhas expressed a positive opinion towards its partnership with Wes-tech. They think it is a good way to utilize each company'sindividual strengths to develop a better product. In yet anotherexample, Yeong Chine Machinery Industrial Company, a maker ofmachining centers, CNC lathes, and milling machines, is workingwith both Japanese and German companies to sell new machinery tothe global market. By developing alliances they feel confident thattheir competitiveness can only get better.As Taiwan companies continue to achieve better quality and strongermarketing ties they can expect a better position in the globalmachine tools market.Copyright 1996 TradeWinds' Industry WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightTRADE WINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996ITRI LICENSES PATENTS TO MOTORCYCLE MAKERSfrom TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) has signedagreements with two major motorcycle manufacturers, authorizingthem to use ITRI's patents to produce some key components.

In the first eight months of the year, Merida's salesdecreased 25.39 percent to reach US$59 million.The two bicycle giants attributed the sales reduction to lessorders this year from the U.S. due to inventory kept from lastyear.Copyright 1996 TradeWinds' Industry WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightTRADE WINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996KAOHSIUNG LOOKING FOR WAYS TO EXPAND ITS INDUSTRIAL BASE (I)from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996This article is reprinted from the Free China Review. The secondpart will be continued in the same column next week."You'll find us rough," Pegotty told David Copperfiield, "butyou'll find us ready." Pegotty might have been a Kaohsiung man.Students of city polarity will recognize the scenario at once.Paris and Marseilles regularly trade insults. London scoffs atLiverpool and gets as good as it gives. And New York looks down oneveryone. In the blue corner, a bunch of effete, white-wine-imbibing nincompoops wearing silly, overpriced clothes who pretendto run things while messing them up. In the red corner, beer-swilling urban peasants good only for making steel, or whatever itis that they make these days in those nasty, smelly factories. Onthe one hand, Taipei, Taiwan's center of commerce and culture. Onthe other, Kaohsiung, the island's second largest city, anindustrialized behemoth on the southwestern coast that belchesforth smoke, has more container ships than you can shake a stickat, generates money twenty-four hours a day, and is home to 1.4million citizens who are not afraid to call a spade a spade.People who study this power-house for long enough sometimes come tothe conclusion that Kaohsiung may be the island's second city butit ought to be the first. The industries located within its 153square kilometers contribute as much to Taiwan's prosperity asTaipei. It enjoys clear, sunny weather on an average of 270 days ayear, as opposed to about 180 in Taipei. It has mountains, the sea,great seafood, cheaper rents and real estate, and better trafficconditions than Taipei. Question: Why, then, do so few people wantto live and work there?The answers are complex. For all its merits, Kaohsiung still hasserious problems: a lack of cultural facilities, a standard ofliving well below Taipei's, and the worst pollution on the island."It's not pleasant having your living room invaded by some noxiouschemical stench while you're trying to enjoy a quiet evening athome," says Chang Tiao, an architect who has lived in Kaohsiung foreighteen years. Another resident, Wu Chiu-hui, shudders as shetalks about the tap water. "After you boil it you're left with thiswhite, foamy scum on the inside of the pot," she says. "I don'tknow anybody who dares drink the stuff. We all use filters or drinkmineral water." Local burghers hope to make Kaohsiung into aninternational city, and with luck and a lot of hard work it mightone day eclipse Taipei as Taiwan's business hub. But, absent somefairly dramatic changes in living conditions, the odds are thatthose who make these dreams come true will want to commute fromafar.Kaohsiung is one of Taiwan's oldest cities, and its development hasalways been inextricably linked to the sea. In the mid-seventeenthcentury, fishermen from the mainland recognized the harbor'spotential as a fishing port, offering an ideal shelter from storms,and began to settle there. During their respective rules overTaiwan, both the Dutch (1624-1662), and the Japanese (1895-1945),understood Kaohsiung's potential as a fishing center and fosteredits growth. Today, it is the hub of Taiwan's deep-sea fishingindustry and its fleet brings in more than half the island's annualcatch.Kaohsiung Harbor is also an ideal deep-water port. Because Taiwanlacks natural resources, heavy industries that rely on imported rawmaterials have tended to establish themselves in Kaohsiung. ChinesePetroleum set up a refinery there in 1946, and China Steel andChina Shipbuilding both came in the 1970s.Export processing zonesExport industries also took advantage of the harbor. The Japanesehad developed the city as an export center for Taiwan's sugarindustry, and in the 1960s two export processing zones were set upto help send goods made in Taiwan to world markets.This industrial city was not born by chance. It was the policy ofthe Japanese colonial government to develop commerce in northernTaiwan and industry in the south, a policy that was maintainedafter Taiwan's return to Chinese control. And it was a policy thatpaid off: Kaohsiung's industries fueled Taiwan's transformationfrom an island of fishing and farming villages to the world'sthird largest container shipping port.But whether discussing the city with residents or pounding itswide, relatively uncluttered streets, the visitor always comes backto pollution. It is a problem that goes well beyond mereinconvenience. Kaohsiung's pollution positively discourages white-collar professionals from moving to the city, while driving outsome who are there already. As a result, Kaohsiung has never beenable to develop the kind of service industry base that has helpedTaipei become the island's wealthiest city. Hence Kaohsiung'sreputation as a city populated primarily by blue-collar workerswhose career opportunities are limited to industries such asshipping, fishing, steel, and petrochemicals.When Chang Tiao was interviewing architects for a company he usedto work for, he found that very few of them were willing to move toKaohsiung. "Young people always opted for Taipei first, thenTaichung or Tainan," he says. "Many Kaohsiung natives wouldn't workhere if they had the choice." The result is a Catch-22: a shortageof white-collar jobs means a shortage of white-collarprofessionals, which discourages service industries from setting upin Kaohsiung, leading in turn to a shortage of white-collar jobs."If we're going to attract the people we need to develop this city,we have to improve its living environment," Chang Tiao says."Cleaning up pollution must be our first priority."Human nature being what it is, people want to know who to blame forKaohsiung's ills. Government is invariably the first to befingered. When the R.O.C. took control of Taiwan in 1945. Kaohsiungwas administered from Taipei by the Taiwan High Commissioner'sOffice. In 1947, it became a provincial municipality under thejurisdiction of the provincial government, and in 1979 it wasdesignated a special municipality, like Taipei. But that didn't domuch for the place. Some people even believe it hindered the city'sdevelopment. Architect Chang Tiao explains that, unlike provincialmunicipalities whose mayors were popularly elected, mayors forspecial municipalities were appointed by the central government, apractice that ended only in 1994. "The less they did, the lesschance they had of making mistakes, and the brighter theirpolitical future," he says. "So no mayor tried to develop thecity."But many Kaohsiung residents, including Wu Den-yih, its present,popularly elected mayor, say it's not fair to put all the blame onprevious city administrations. Central government policies thatfocus on the development of northern Taiwan at the expense of thesouth are equally guilty. Mayor Wu talks about Taipei as Taiwan'sbrain, and Kaohsiung as the island's heart. The brain gives theorders, but the heart keeps the blood flowing. Since they are ofequal importance, therefore, the central government should treatthem as such. But according to Mayor Wu, while the centralgovernment has taken good care of the brain, it has neglectedTaiwan's heart. He points out that the annual budget allocationfrom the central government to Kaohsiung is only a third ofTaipei's.City officials and residents agree that Kaohsiung has sufferedgrievously from this arrangement, particularly in the developmentof its infrastructure, service industries, educational system, andstandard of living. "Since there are only two specialmunicipalities in Taiwan, most people take it for granted thatTaipei is number one and Kaohsiung is number two," Chang Tiao says."In terms of population, Kaohsiung is indeed Taiwan's secondlargest city, but in terms of family income and standard of publiceducation, Kaohsiung barely makes the to five."To be continued in next issueCopyright 1996 TradeWinds' Industry WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightTRADE WINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996Y.S.

Isuzu of Japan becomes the 11th automaker to enter Vietnam; a market with a modest demand for automobiles is already crowded with Auto Assembly Joint Ventures. Vietnam bought about 5,000 cars last year.    The Joint Venture is a cooperation between two Japanese firms -- Itochu Corp. and Isuzu Motors Ltd. -- and two Vietnamese firms -- Saigon Motors Company (Samco) and the Import/Export Trading Company in Govap district, Ho Chi Minh City.    The $US 50 million Joint Venture, of which the Japanese side has 70% interest, Vietnam 30%, will build light trucks and buses from imported kits.    While Japan's automakers are adding more auto Joint Ventures, Volkswagen of Germany has recently postponed its decision to establish an auto assembly plant in Vietnam. Mercedes-Benz and BMW have already formed car Joint Ventures in the country along with other major names in auto industry from Japan, South Korea and the U.S.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM BUSINESS INFOTRACK via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SANYO PLANS TO PRODUCE WASHERS    Sanyo of Japan is planing to produce fully automatic washing machines for Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) and the Indochina market (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia).    The Joint Venture, Sanyo Home Appliances Vietnam Corp., includes: Sanyo holding 70% interest, Sanyo Electric Trading  20%, and Sumitomo Corp. 10%.    Sanyo plans to invest $US 24-30 million to manufacture 200,000 washers per year by 1997, mostly for consumers in Vietnam.    The Venture also aims to raise the production level to more than 500,000 units per year by the year 2000 for Indochina countries and Myanmar.    The washing machines factory will be located in Bien Hoa, some 40 Km (25 miles) north east of Ho Chi Minh City.    Brand name Sanyo was well-known in Vietnam for its TVs in the 60's and 70's. Sanyo gas cookers have been used by the Vietnamese for the past few years.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM BUSINESS INFOTRACK via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BANKING UPDATE    The World Bank has approved a $US 49 million loan for Vietnam to upgrade its banking services. The purpose is to help Vietnam reform its Inter-banking Payment and Clearance services as well as customer services.    Since October 1993, the World Bank has loaned Vietnam $US 788 million, including this $US 49 million new loan.    Beneficiaries from the banking reform project include Vietnam's State Bank (VSB), Bank for Foreign Trade (Vietcombank), Bank for Commerce and Industry, Bank for Investment and Development, Bank for Agriculture, Eximbank and Maritime Bank.    Before 1988, almost all banking activities in Vietnam were controlled by VSB. VSB is now charged with regulating the country's money supply and preserving the value of the national currency, and the majority of commercial banking transactions are assigned to other state-owned banks.     By and large, most Vietnamese do not see banking institution as a safe place to put their hard-earned savings. Partly due to what happened in 1975 when the communist regime has begun to exert control over the entire nation. The regime naturalized all private businesses and individual bank accounts, including foreign-owned enterprises. These assets, with a small number of exceptions, later became government assets.     Since then the majority of Vietnamese preferred to keep their savings to themselves, usually in gold, US dollars or both.    Many Vietnamese prefer a community loan system called hui, from which a member could get a loan without any officially written contracts. This type of loan is solely based on trusts among group members.    This system of loan is far from providing any security for its members. Although not on a regular basis, defaults have happened but hui tradition continues despite loan defaults.     Another common way to raise money for investment is to borrow from friends and relatives. Both the personal  and hui-type loans usually have higher interest than Vietnamese banks could offer.    Although the interest rates for saving accounts in Vietnam are rather high compared to those of western nations, the percentage of personal banking deposits as compared with personal assets is remarkably low. To date, Vietnam has less than 40,000 personal accounts. The government of Vietnam needs to do more than just banking modernization to persuade its people putting their savings in banks or similar financial institutions.    In order to spur economic growth, following the recent interest rate cut from Vietcombank, Bank for Commerce and Industry and Bank for Agriculture have slashed their interest rates .    For its customers in the service and commercial sectors, Vietcombank now offers a new annual rate of 22.8%, a reduction of 2.4%. For the Production sector, the annual rate is cut to 19.2% from 21.6%.    Bank for Commerce and Industry now charges an annual rate of 19.2% instead of 20.4% for its customers in the production sector.    Bank for Agriculture in Ho Chi Minh City offers different rates for private enterprises and state-owned businesses. For private production enterprises, the annual lending rate now is 28.8%. For state-owned businesses, the current rate is 20.4%.     While lowering the lending rates for businesses, the government is planing to raise interest rates to attract more individual depositors.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM BUSINESS INFOTRACK via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BASKIN-ROBBINS IN VIETNAM     Baskin-Robbins ice cream franchise has been opened for business about a year in Ho Chi Minh City.     The franchise in Vietnam, owned by an overseas Vietnamese, is so successful that the owner is planing to open new stores in Nha Trang, Da Nang and Hanoi. The franchise is importing ice cream from Baskin-Robbins parent company in the U.S.      With Baskin-Robbins in Vietnam, Vietnamese now can have more choices of ice cream from France, Italy and the U.S. Price of ice cream has come down to about 80 cents (US) per scoop.    As far north as Hue (central of Vietnam), the climate is tropical monsoon. Temperatures in the country are usually in the 90's degree Fahrenheit. The weather is humid especially in summer when one could definitely enjoy an ice cream.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM BUSINESS INFOTRACK via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996MEDICAL JOINT VENTURES    Braun of Germany and Hanoi Pharmaceutical Enterprise has entered into a Joint Venture to produce Intravenous (IV) solutions -- drugs or nutrient solutions administered into veins -- for local consumption.    The Joint Venture is valued at $US 1.75 million with the German side contributing 70%  and the Vietnamese firm  30%. The Venture is expected to produce 3 million plastic bottles of solution per year.    Vietnam's hospitals are using IV solutions that are locally made and often do not meet minimum hygienic guide lines specified by World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations.      Recently General Electric (GE) Pacific Ltd., a subsidiary of GE of the U.S. has signed a Joint Ventures with state-owned Medical Equipment Corp. (Megeco) under Vietnam's Ministry of Public Health.    This $US 2.1 million GE Vietnam Medical Systems Joint Venture, of which GE contributes 70% and Megeco 30%, will assemble X-ray and Medical Diagnosis machines to be used in Vietnam's hospitals.

Although the exact mixing portion of the complex has not been decided, the Joint Venture plans to build a complex with 350-room hotel, 165 apartments, offices, retail shops and recreation facilities.    The Joint Venture is a cooperation between the Peninsula Group/HSH with 65% interest, and Giang Vo Hotel Company with 35%. This 40-year term project, valued at $US 103 million, is HSH's second real estate project in Vietnam. The first, an investment of $US 19 million, was the 20,000 square-meter Landmark office and apartment complex in Ho Chi Minh City. HSH's business manager in Vietnam is Mr. John Bidgood.

These six companies were chosen from more than 50 international bidders.    The 280 Km Hanoi-Vinh was divided into two subsections and the contracts were awarded to two foreign companies: China Overseas Engineering of China and Kukdong Engineering and Construction of South Korea.    The 435 Km Nha Trang-Ho Chi Minh City was divided into three subsections and the contracts were awarded to three teams. Each team includes a Korean firm and a subsidiary of the Vietnam's Ministry of Transportation. They are: You One Anam and Construction Corp. No 8, Keangnam and Construction Corp. No 4, Singsung and  Construction Corp. No 5.    The contract for the 150 Km Ho Chi Minh City-Can Tho section was won by BES Engineering of Taiwan.    The project total cost is about $US 316 million, of which the cost for the 435 Km Nha Trang-Ho Chi Minh City section is $US 140 million, and about $US 176 million for both the 280 Km Hanoi-Vinh and 150 Km Ho Chi Minh City-Can Tho sections.     To pay for this project, $US 159 million will be funded by the World Bank (WB), $US 120 million by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the government budget will fund the rest.    US consulting firms, Upham International Company and Luis Berger & DeLeuw Carther, were chosen for this infrastructure project along with a consulting Joint Venture from Denmark, Japan and Thailand.    The project was approved by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet since it is categorized as a "group A" project. The Prime Minister's approval is required for certain project with investment value of $US 40 million and up.    Construction will begin in January 1996 and the expected completion date is by the end of 1998.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM BUSINESS INFOTRACK via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996ELLICOTT MACHINE SELLS DREDGES TO VIETNAM     Ellicott Machine Intl., a U.S. firm based in Baltimore, Maryland, has signed an agreement with the Vietnam Ministry of Transport and Communications (VNMTC) to supply two high-power dredges worth $US 12 million. The dredges will be used by Vinawaco for port development. Vinawaco is a division under VNMTC.     Discussion of an additional contract worth $US 10 million is to be followed.The dredge contract signing ceremony was coincident with the Vietnam visit of US Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Federico Pena. Mr. Pena met Vietnamese Transportation Minister, Mr. Bui Danh Luu, to discuss cooperation between the U.S. and Vietnam in the Aviation, Transportation, Communications and Infrastructure sectors. He also held talks with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet.    Vietnam is expected to spend about $US 8 billion in the next few years to upgrade its transportation system.    Mr. Pena also visited Japan, Hongkong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand in an effort to foster trade between the U.S. and Asia/Pacific countries. He is the second U.S. cabinet member to visit Vietnam after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher opened the U.S. embassy in Hanoi in August 1995.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM BUSINESS INFOTRACK via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996CANADA GIVES VIETNAM MFN STATUS    Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet made his first 4-day visit to Vietnam in November 1995 and was welcomed by Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Mr. Ouellet signed an agreement with Vietnamese Trade Minister Le Van Triet to grant MFN (Most Favored Nation) status to Vietnam.    Canada will provide a $US 15 million aid package aiming to improve Vietnam's economic reforms and help Vietnam to better manage its environment and natural resources. The money will be used in three major projects: the Environmental Management, the Financial Management and the Language Training projects.    Canada resumed its Official Development Assistance (ODA) Program to Vietnam in 1990, and since then, under ODA program, Canada has contributed about $US 40 million.    Trade between Canada and Vietnam was at a humble figure of around $US 42 million in 1994. In term of investment in Vietnam, Canada is currently ranked 22nd with $US 52 million, behind China and ahead of Germany.     Canada has recently elevated its trade office in Ho Chi Minh City to the level of Consulate General headed by Mr. Ian Burney.    Although Canada investment in Vietnam is modest, Nortel of Canada, a telecommunications company, has made its mark in the Vietnam Telecommunications sector. Nortel was selected to install a 3,000 Km fiber-optic Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) system that runs between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (a distance of 1710 Km). Vietnam Post and Telecommunications also contracted Nortel to install a Digital Switching System DMS-100 for the port city of Hai Phong. Hai Phong is about 103 Km (65 miles) from Hanoi on National Highway 5.     Even though the U.S. and Vietnam have normalized diplomatic relationships in July 1995, trade normalization has not been fully realized until Vietnam receives MFN status from the US. There have been talks between the two countries, but no time is set for the U.S. to grant Vietnam MFN status.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM BUSINESS INFOTRACK via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS INSURANCE COMMISSION    (Industry Review) Insurance is still a fairly new concept to an average Vietnamese, even though Vietnamese press has repeatedly attempted to promote it. The Vietnamese generally understand that motor vehicle insurance is necessary, realizing the danger of being bankrupted or being drawn into a court battle when a fatal accident occurs.    However, regarding Life Insurance, their thinking is different. The idea of paying money and expecting family members can collect a large sum should one die is still new and skeptically received among the Vietnamese. Even though making a final financial arrangement is obviously necessary, speaking beforehand of one's death is viewed as superstitiously bad luck.    The Vietnamese would rather buy house, land, jewelry and gold and leave these assets to their loved ones. Like in other developed Asian nations, this view may be changed once they are getting more familiar with insurance concept.    In an effort to exert control over the Insurance sector, the Ministry of Finance issued Circular 76 TC/TCNH dated 25 October 1995 to regulate Insurance commission. Only agents who are licensed to work in the insurance business are allowed to collect commissions.    The commission rate for personal property is the lowest (0.3%) and the rate for Life or Health Insurance is among the highest (10%). Insurance commission is based on the value of the insurance policy.    Before 1993, the only insurance company operating in Vietnam was state-owned Vietnam Insurance Company (Bao Viet). Although this sector is no longer one-company industry, the government still wants a tight control in this business and is not ready to open up to foreign companies.    Currently, foreign companies are not allowed to have 100% ownership of the venture, therefore they must operate through local firms acting as their agents.    Major portion of local insurance firms' revenues is their commissions earned from second tier "re-insurance" rather than direct premiums paid by customers.    At present, there are five non-Life insurance companies in Vietnam. Three state-owned insurance companies -- Bao Viet, Bao Minh and Vinare (National Re-insurance Company) -- are well-known in Vietnam.    More than 20 foreign insurance companies from countries such as France, England, Switzerland, South Korea and Taiwan have opened representative offices in Vietnam.     One of the leading insurance companies in Europe, Zurich Insurance Group of Switzerland, has recently opened an office in Ho Chi Minh City to promote Life, non-Life, and re-insurance. Also LG Insurance Company of South Korea has opened  an office in Hanoi. Both Zurich Insurance and LG Insurance will cooperate with Bao Viet and Bao Minh insurance firms.    Vietnam's Ministry of Finance has asked Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company of Japan to provide insurance training for Vietnamese officials in 1996.     On one hand, the government knows insurance business is lucrative and wants to put state-owned local insurance companies in a controlling position. On the other, they realize that the country lacks capital and desperately needs foreign investments.     The government is facing a dilemma and they have to find ways to overcome it if they ever want to efficiently develop this industry.Addendum to Circular 76 TC/TCNH dated 25 October 1995 of the Ministry of FinanceType of Insurance                                  Max.

Its service is now available in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. AVIS's agent in Vietnam is Peregrine Capital Vietnam Ltd.    Though AVIS is a familiar name in the Pacific Rim, the company is the first U.S. car rental company to operate in Vietnam. Vicarent, a Hongkong-Vietnam Joint Venture, was the first car rental service company operating in Vung Tau. Vung Tau is the beach resort on the South China Sea, 128 Km (80 miles) south east of Ho Chi Minh City.    AVIS plans to expand its service to Mynamar in early 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM BUSINESS INFOTRACK via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996AIRBORNE EXPRESS OPENS THE THIRD OFFICE    US Airborne Express has opened a new office in Hanoi to handle an increasing mailing demand between Vietnam and its trading counterparts. This is Airborne Express' third representative office in Vietnam. The firm has many offices worldwide and is popular for its Express Mail Service. Airborne Express has been operating in Vietnam since April 1994, two months after the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo.    The firm is transporting around 1,000 packages a month to and from Vietnam and the demand is expected  to grow significantly in the years ahead.    Airborne Express is cooperating with state-owned Vietnam Post and Telecommunications to provide mail and parcel services for Vietnam's major cities.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM BUSINESS INFOTRACK via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996AIRLINES PASSENGERS INCREASE 30 PERCENT    By the end of 1995, Vietnam Airlines, a state-owned enterprise, has transported more than two million passengers, of which 40% were international and 60% were domestic. This is an increase of 30% over the 1994 passenger volume. Also about 30,000 tons of cargo were transported in 1995.     As the demand is expected to grow, Vietnam Air lines forecasts an increase to about 5 million passengers and 110,000 tons of cargo by the end of this century.    Vietnam Airlines is making improvement after a major restructuring more than two years ago. Recently, Vietnam Airlines has signed an agreement to lease two ATR-72 from Aircraft International Rental of France; this will bring the total ATR-72 operating in Vietnam to 6 airplanes. These planes are used for short distance flights between Vietnam's cities.    Besides Soviet made aircraft, Vietnam is also using Airbus and some older version of Boeing planes. The government is seeking to eventually replace all of its aging fleet of Soviet made aircraft with planes from Airbus and Boeing.    Due to their modest budget, Vietnam needs to have more Vietnamese pilots who could fly modern jets. Vietnamese pilots' salary is much lower than that of foreign pilots. Vietnam pays foreign pilots on the average around $US 10,000 per month while the Vietnamese counterparts may earn only about $US 3,000 per month.     Aiming to increase the number of Vietnamese pilots by the year 2000, Vietnam has sent its bright young men to Australia for a three-year pilot training program.    In a joined-marketing effort to boost sale, Vietnam Airlines and other ASEAN's airlines: Brunei Airlines, Garuda Indonesia Airlines, Malaysian Airlines, Philippines Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Thai Intl. Airways have recently offered their passengers a 15% discount. Vietnam has become a member of the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) since July 1995.    Vietnam's second Airlines, Pacific Airlines, operates mainly in three largest cities of Vietnam -- Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang and Hanoi -- and between Vietnam and Taiwan as well.

With 4000 years of civilization, they are proud people who like to recite to a myth that they are descendants of an angel and a dragon.    Their manner is casual, friendly and they take pride in their hospitality. Not only are the Vietnamese deeply attached to their families, they also view friendship as a very important aspect in life, so important that in Vietnam, there is a saying " far away relatives are not as important as nearby neighbors."     Personal and business matters could be confined among close friends since friendship is not only necessary for their emotional supports but also for mutual assistance.    Their homes are always open to friends.  No appointments are necessary for casual visits to their homes and visitors are usually received warmly. However, it is best to let them know or phone them in advance if it is a business visit.     If you happen to be in their homes at meal time, they will probably invite you to sit down and share whatever food is available. They may not hesitate to offer you the best portions as a sincere gesture of hospitality and close friendship. Let them know that you enjoy their food is one way in successfully building a better relationship with them.     When they invite you to their homes for a meal, celebration, or special occasion, some gifts -- usually food, fruits, chocolate or liquors (especially American and French liquors are favorite) -- should be offered to the host's family.     Although the Vietnamese may be happy to accept your offer, he usually refuse the first time or even the second time, for fear that he might be regarded as greedy if he accepts your offer the first time. He may claim that he already has or does not need it. It is recommended that you have the patience to repeat the offer once more.     Patience is one of the keys in successfully dealing with the Vietnamese.    On the other hand, when they offer you gift, they will usually speak lightly about it. Even though it is an expensive gift, they may pretend it is of no great monetary value, since boasting is often criticized    Having a few drinks in a social gathering is widely acceptable. Like many other parts of the world, Vietnam does not sanction heavy drinking. Alcoholism is often kept hidden since it is viewed as a social disgrace to the family.     Alcohol drinking is now increasing among men and drunkenness in public does occasionally happen.However, the Vietnamese, at present, do not view this as a social problem because alcohol consumption level per capita in Vietnam is still one of the lowest in the world -- average about 5 liters per person.    The majority of Vietnamese women never drink and it is not unusual if they decline when alcoholic beverages are offered to them. Drinking problem are rare among women.     While smoking is considered the norm among men, even young men; very few women smoke. Women's smoking in public is seen as tackiness and those smoking women are often regarded as " liberal".Back to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM BUSINESS INFOTRACK via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996VIETNAMESE ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIESVietnamese Chamber Of CommerceAnd Industry (VCCI)Hanoi Office33 Ba Trieu St.Hanoi, VNTel:  844-252961Fax: 844-256446VCCI, HCM City Office69 Dong Khoi St.Dist. 1, HCM City, VNTel:  848-292522Customs Office, HCM City2 Ham Nghi St.Dist. 1, HCM City, VNTel:  848-290912State Committee for Cooperationand Investment, Ho Chi Minh City178 Nguyen Dinh Chieu St. Dist. 3, HCM City, VNTel:  848-230339  or  294674Fax: 848-291534Customs Office, Hanoi Nguyen Van Cu St.Hanoi, VNTel:  844-263948Labor Service, HCM City159 Pasteur St.Dist. 3, HCM City, VNTel:  848-291302Back to Headline List WT03-B07-7IA087-000634-B044-57http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it149.html 205.156.212.5 19970122031954 text/html 88372HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 03:17:41 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:25 GMTContent-length: 88185Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it149.html Sample Issue Copyright VIETNAM COURIER via NewsNet September 20, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES VIETNAM: MID-AUTUMN FESTIVAL (626 words) VIETNAM: NGUYEN TU NGHIEM, THE CULMINATION OF AN ARTISTIC CAREER (551 words) VIETNAM: THE HANOI FINE ARTS SCHOOL, ONE OF THE OLDEST IN SOUTHEAST ASIA (560 words) VIETNAM: STOP PRESS (443 words) VIETNAM: MARIJUANA ADDICTION SPREADS TO ALARMING PROPORTIONS AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN (540 words) VIETNAM: REFORM OF STATE ENTERPRISES CONTINUES (241 words) VIETNAM: ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY CAUGHT IN A VICE (946 words) THE LABOUR MARKET IN VIETNAM: MR TRAN DINH HOAN (1073 words) VIETNAM: FIRST ALL-WOMEN ART EXHIBITION (317 words) VIETNAM: ORIGINALITY AMONG PAINTERS OF THE YOUNG GENERATION (1210 words) VIETNAM: GROWING PRESENCE OF YOUNG PAINTERS, A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT (332 words) VIETNAM: YOUTH UNION RAISES PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT HIV/AIDS (295 words) VIETNAM: ELECTRICITY PROJECTS UP FOR INVESTMENT TO 2000 (360 words) VIETNAM: CAN THO BRIDGE PROJECT UP FOR BIDDING (167 words) VIETNAM: PRICES FOR FOOD, MATERIALS AND GOLD & FOREIGN CURRENCIES (184 words) VIETNAM: COMPANY BRIEFS (348 words) VIETNAM: FRENCH COMPANY SELECTED TO SUPERVISE NOI BAI AIRPORT PROJECT (142 words) VIETNAM: COAL INDUSTRY NEEDS OVER 9 TRILLION VND UP TO 2010 (221 words) VIETNAM: LEATHERWARE INDUSTRY LOOKS FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT (180 words) VIETNAM: DAEWOO JOINS IN SOUTHERN HIGHWAY PROJECT (115 words) VIETNAM: NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLASTICS INDUSTRY (687 words) VIETNAM: ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY CAUGHT IN DILEMMA: OUTGROWING THE TIGHT SHIRT (577 words) VIETNAM: MONG CAI BORDER REGION TO TRY NEW PRO-BUSINESS POLICIES (262 words) VIETNAM: PETRONAS INTERESTED IN OXYCHEMS PVC DEAL (162 words) VIETNAM: MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN MOTOR PARTS (203 words) VIETNAM: NEW SEA PORT IN HO CHI MINH CITY (214 words) VIETNAM: SHIP-BUILDING INDUSTRY LOOKS FOR MORE JOINT VENTURES (181 words) VIETNAM: NEW SAMSUNG TV JOINT VENTURE STARTS OPERATION: SAMSUNG-VINA (188 words) VIETNAM: COMPAQ HOLDS 20% OF LOCAL COMPUTER MARKET (178 words) VIETNAM: SIXTY MORE HOTELS GET RANKED (133 words) VIETNAM: DAEWOO INSISTS IN BUS-SERVICE JOINT VENTURE (187 words) VIETNAM BEGINS MAKING DIARRHEA MEDICINE FOR CHILDREN (215 words) VIETNAM: THE LU PEOPLE (382 words) VIETNAM: INVESTMENT PROJECTS APPROVED (464 words) CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: MID-AUTUMN FESTIVALfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996By Thu HanhThere were few domestic toys for sale for the Mid-Autumn Festivalthis year. This is a common comment of shoppers during their buyingsprees for children prior to their festival that fell on the 15thof August of the lunar calendar (Sept.27,1996).Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival is a tradition in Vietnam.Although it is a children's festival, it is a common concern ofsociety, because on this day children in almost every family musthave a tray full of "banh nuong" (pies) and "banh deo" (sticky ricecakes), a grapefruit, a bunch of bananas, persimmons, "com"(steamed young rice dyed green), and toys such as paper lion heads,small drums, star-shaped lanterns, or turning lanterns with a shadedecorated with paper cut figures.,to celebrate the Mid-AutumnFestival.A couple of weeks before the festival, the toys shops along LuongVan Can, Hang Ma and Cha Ca streets and in front of Lenin, Thu Leand Bach Thao parks were already stocked different kinds of papermasks, lanterns, dolls and electronic toys. In general, the toyswere attractive looking and selling at cheaper prices than lastyear. For instance, a small lantern made in China cost 9,000-12,000VND, and a bigger battery-operated musical lantern cost17,000-30,000 VND. A turning lantern sold for 20,000-30,000 VND.During the pre-festival days, even the poorest parents tried to buysome toys they could afford for their children. A mask, astar-shaped lantern, or a small drum cost only 1,500-5,000 VND.Well-to-do families preferred modern toys, each of which might costfrom several hundred thousand to even several million VND.Hanoi's wholesalers sold toys to traders from the outlyingdistricts of Dong Anh, Soc Son and Thanh Tri, Ha Dong town in HaTay province, and Ha Bac, Hai Hung and Nam Ha provinces. However,except for paper masks, lanterns and drums, not many toys were madein Vietnam. Currently, there are only a few toy-making enterprisesin Hanoi such as the Phuc Hung Plastics Company and the Dai Kimenterprise. But these enterprises only produce toys for theeducation programs of kindergartens, and they cannot compete withChinese and Thai toy-makers in terms of quality, designs andprices. Furthermore, these Chinese and Thai products have oftenbeen smuggled without tariffs and, naturally, are sold at cheaperprices. So far, stuffed animals made by the Hung Sang and Binh Tiencompanies have won the trust of customers for their high qualityand diversified designs, but their prices are still high for mostcustomers. For instance, a little Mickey bear costs 7,000 VND, anda bigger one costs as much as 250,000 VND.On the occasion of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the confectioneries,state-owned or private, produced about 200 tons of pies and stickyrice cakes with different fillings: green beans, salted eggs,Chinese sausage, roast chicken and vegetarian. A box of 4 pies orsticky rice cakes costs between 20,000 and 80,000 VND. The pricesthis year were higher than last year because of a 10-20% increasein prices of ingredients. The Thuy Ta restaurant by the side ofHoan Kiem Lake and the Bodega Foods and Drinks Company were themain suppliers of pies and cakes; each produced about 50 tons. Inaddition, Xuan Dinh village in Tay Ho district with 60 years ofexperience supplied 80 tons of pies and cakes. Among the most wellknown non-state confectioneries supplying pies and cakes for theMid-Autumn Festival are the Bao Ngoc, Huong Nam and Duy Tan shops.However, some unlicensed private shops produced poor quality piesand cakes causing a feeling of uncertainty among customers.[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: NGUYEN TU NGHIEM, THE CULMINATION OF AN ARTISTIC CAREERfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996By Pham Thi TuyetNguyen Tu Nghiem, one of the seven prominent painters in thegeneration trained during the war against the French colonialists,received the Ho Chi Minh Award on his 75th birthday. He is one ofthe three living painters in his generation to receive this prizeinstituted by the Vietnamese Government in 1985 to  honour thewriters, artists and scientific workers who have best contributedto national liberation and construction.The old artist was sitting in his small garden  absorbed inmemories as we arrived in  his small flat at the government-leasedTrungTu apartment building.His young wife was preparing dinner."It's a real pity, a real pity, " he repeated as he took us aroundthe small room hung  with recent paintings which serves as hisexhibition room. He said that almost all his paintings made duringthe  anti-French war have been lost. He estimated it wasapproximately one hundred paintings.He recalled with a deep sigh ofregret and a lowered head the loss of hundreds of paintings done byhimself and Bui Xuan Phai,  his alter ego and another winner ofthis Ho Chi Minh Award. The two were preparing an art exhibit whenFrench troops parachuted on the resistance base  in the northernjungle and destroyed or took away all the sketches and canvassesthey had completed during the first years of the war.One thing that intrigued me right after scanning  the scores ofpaintings in his room is the predominance of paintings about"Kieu",  the main character in a novel the same name. Each paintingwas executed differently on a different material. Explained the oldartist:"It is like the haunting of all my life. I made a clayfigurine of Kieu when I was only a six-year-old  kid in my nativevillage in Nghe An province and started to paint its face as bestas I could imagine from the story related by my father. Althoughthe story of Kieu originated in China, the Kieu created by NguyenTu Nghiem's brush, is always every inch a Vietnamese girl, aVietnamese beauty. Another favourite theme of his is the mythicalGiong, the child hero who defeated the aggressors and saved thekingdom after being transformed into a giant with a fire breathinghorse from a heavenly messenger. Nguyen Tu Nghiem also has donepainstaking research into the regional folk dances which hereconstructed so well that some critics called them the mostperfect collection of folk dances of Vietnam. He distinguisheshimself by the original way he executes his lacquer paintings. Afamous case depicts the " Guard of the Temple of Literature" (inHanoi). The whole picture is painted in white lacquer but withvarying thicknesses of paint which create different nuances andshades. The same can be found in his painting titled "The  Gate ofMong PhuVillage during Harvest Time". This work is so evocativethat one admirer exclaimed:" It makes me feel as if I could hearthe croaking of the frogs in the painting."Nguyen Tu Nghiem is one of eight painters and sculptors receivingthe Ho Chi Minh award this time. Five received the awardposthumously.[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: THE HANOI FINE ARTS SCHOOL, ONE OF THE OLDEST IN SOUTHEAST ASIAfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996By Nguyen Luong Tieu BachAssociate Professor, Director of the Hanoi Fine Arts SchoolThe Hanoi Fine Arts School is rightly described as the"cradle ofVietnam's modern arts." Founded in 1925 by the French as the "Ecole des Beaux Arts de l'Indochine," it was the first formal artschool in  Vietnam. Prior to this, Vietnam as well as Laos andCambodia had no institutions for formally training painters andsculptors. There were only small groups of artisans who learnttheir techniques from their parents and grandparents and perfectedthem through extensive work in handicraft workshops. In this sense,the modern arts taught at the Fine Arts School of Indochina weredivorced from the artistic traditions of the nation. Art studentswere given classes chiefly in the European, more particularly theFrench classic arts. But this deviation was soon discovered by thefirst crop of Vietnamese students who, coincidentally, were tobecome also the most prominent artists of modern times. Such namesas To Ngoc Van, Nguyen Phan Chanh, Tran Van Can and Nguyen Gia Triare icons in the pantheon of Vietnamese modern painting.Increasingly, this first generation of graduates and theirsuccessors realized the crucial need of using their art in theservice of the people; this tendency was displayed through theresistance against the French war of reconquest (1946-1954).Teachers and students, sometimes without even an easel, packedtheir minimum indispensable working tools in a rucksack and went tothe front to record scenes of battles or the combatants in thehours between battles, or the seemingly endless throngs of men andwomen transporting supplies to the front. In the twenty-year fightto liberate South Vietnam, the Hanoi Arts School had moreopportunity to concentrate on large scale training. After thereunification of the country in 1975, training was no longerlimited to Hanoi. Now there are also art schools in Hue (CentralVietnam) and Ho Chi Minh City. This has enabled the Hanoi school toraise its  standard and  concentrate on university-level traniningand, eventually, post-graduates training in painting and sculpture.The opening up to the world has also opened broad vistas for theHanoi Arts College to increase its exchanges with artists incountries in the region and across the world. More and morepainting exhibitions have opened in the country and abroad. Highersales of paintings are not only bringing higher material benefit tothe artists but also have raised the profile of Vietnamese arts inthe eyes of local and foreign art lovers.The improved living standards in the country have also expanded themarket for art and motivated artists to make consistent efforts toimprove themselves. Outdated models, styles and genres can nolonger capture the vast horizon of present day life. Artists,mostly  from the younger generation, venture out  into theirchanging environments in search of new modes,  materials, andstyles of expression.Many graduates of the school have won prizes abroad. For example,Nguyen Thu now at the exhibition of realist painting in Bulgaria,and Dinh Trong Khang in the international art expo in the formerCzechoslovakia. 95% of the  awards  at  annual art exhibitionsinside the country are won by artists trained by the Hanoi school.[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: STOP PRESSfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996* Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam has just concluded athree-day official friendship visit to Havava at the invitation ofhis Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina.

According to a report by the Interior Ministry,students began to smoke opium in 1993 and the addiction has beenspreading ever since. In Hanoi over the past year, nearly 80 schoolchildren and college students were caught in the act of usingmarijuana. This figure, of course, reflects only a small percentageof the actual users, but it reveals an alarming social phenomenon.Many schoolchildren lacking the money to buy marijuana have joinedgangs riding high-powered motorbikes to rob people. A report fromthe Hoan Kiem police precinct (Hanoi) said police had captured agang of 8 young robbers who admitted to having committed 50robberies in a period of one and a half months.Who then are the suppliers of marijuana to schoolchildren andcollege students? Tracking down marijuana rings has revealed theavailability of these toxic drugs at tea shops located nearuniversity and college campuses. These tea shop owners eager forprofits have sold marijuana to students, even though they are wellaware that selling marijuana may bring them from 5 years to lifeimprisonment and even the death penalty. In one case, an entirefamily consisting of 11 members from grandparents to grandchildrenwas engaged in drug trafficking. Since the Government issued adecree on strengthening the fight against smuggling and drugtrafficking, smugglers and drug traffickers have adopted morecunning methods of operation to evade the police.Speaking of drug addiction among schoolchildren, Ms. Nguyen ThiHung Cuong, Vice-Chairwoman of the People's Committee of Quang Ninhprovince, said the province has sounded the alarm about drugaddiction among schoolchildren. Quang Ninh province has takenmeasures to prevent addiction by making the commitment between theschools and families to strengthen the management ofschoolchildren, build walls around schools, increase schoolpatrols, and remove tea shops located near schools.Mr. Nguyen Minh Chanh, Vice-Director of the HCMC Labour, WarInvalids and Social Affairs Service, said cigarette peddlers havesold marijuana to schoolchildren and students in hand-rolledcigarettes. When they get addicted, they have turned topickpocketing to get money for drugs.Mr. Tran Xuan Nhi, Vice-Minister of Education and Training, saidthe education service should do all it can to prevent the spread ofdrug addiction among schoolchildren and students. The service hasintroduced anti-marijuana lessons in the school curriculum at alllevels. It has given special attention to such lessons at theschools in mountain eous areas to help prevent the cultivation ofthe opium poppy there.The coordination of anti-marijuana efforts among the police andcustoms services, the schools, and the families is essential tohelp curb the spread of a social vice that is affectingschoolchildren and students now.[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: REFORM OF STATE ENTERPRISES CONTINUESfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996By Doan Huong LanThe reform in the organisation and operation of the State economicenterprises has resulted in a dramatic reduction of State-ownedenterprises from 6,300 entities in 1990 to 516.Meanwhile, the combined liquidity of the State-run enterprises rose3.5 times or an annual increase of 30.1% and output value rose11.3% on a yearly average. Its gross profit almost quadrupled to7,100 billion VND between 1990 and 1994. Meanwhile losses droppedfrom 503 billion VND to 300 billion VND.State-run enterprises are still predominant in key industries suchas energy generation, chemistry, iron casting and food processing,which over the past 5 years have recorded an annual growth of 20%,20,1%, 16.1%, and 13.6% respectively. However, small andmedium-scaled business with old and obsolete equipment stillaccount for a large proportion in the State economic sector. Thirtyfive per cent of all State-owned enterprises are employing lessthan 100 workers each and 50% have a legal capital of less than 3billion VND (270,000 USD).Shortage of capital remains as acute as ever. Liquidity can meetonly 60% of the demand, which is estimated at 20 billion VND,excluding the cost of capital construction and upgrading ofequipment.Only 20% of the value of the industrial products of the State-ownedenterprises have been exported.[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY CAUGHT IN A VICEfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996By Ha LinhThe more than 100 Vietnamese enterprises in electronics are findingthemselves in a vice: If they want to survive the harsh competitionfrom such world giants as Sony, Matsushita, Philips, Samsung andTechnics, they have to accept working as subcontractors for them injoint ventures in which their share is always very far from givingthem a significant say. But if they choose to stay on their own,chances are high that they will meet their foretold death earlierthan they think.In both cases, chances for Vietnamese to develop an electronicsindustry of their own are very slim, if any at all.The quick fix backfiresTo be fair, it is the foreign electronic companies which havehelped the local electronics industry to get to where it is today.In the late 70s and early 80s, Vietnamese enterprises were allowedto import semi-knocked-down parts to assemble TVs and radiocassettes and many of them indeed made a fortune out of it.The policy proved to be an important quick fix, for the country wasthen faced with a dire shortage of consumer electronics goods.Consumers had to import TV and radio cassettes on their own,further straining the country's scarce reserve of hard currencies.The arrival of foreign electronics manufacturers on the market andthe emergence of joint ventures provided a strong stimulation forlocal manufacturers to strive more. But problems soon cropped up,one after another. The foreign companies which used to sellcomponents to Vietnamese assemblers no longer do so if the latterare not their joint-venture partners. But once the Vietnamese arein the joint ventures just to keep their production alive, theylose their autonomy in production because they never have thenecessary capital to hold a controlling share in the ventures. Andall this happened on the same market that the Vietnamese used tohave the last say. Moreover, most joint ventures only sell theirproducts in Vietnam, just as Vietnamese assemblers did in the past.One of the pioneer assemblers of electronics goods in Vietnam,Viettronics Tan Binh, is finding itself at a loss in this dilemma.For years, it had been making a good buck assembling and sellingSony and JVC TVs. But as soon as Sony officially entered theVietnamese market, it had no choice but joining the Sony-controlledventure if it wants to retain the privilege of assembling SonyTV's. Tan Binh was harder pressed for there were many other smallerVietnamese assemblers were waiting on the sideline for a chance totake its place. Experts predicted that when JVC comes in, it islikely that Tan Binh will have to set up a similar joint venturewith it as well.ProblemsIt would be no problem if the joint venture brings more benefits tothe local company and promises it a stronger future development. Inreality, benefits from the joint venture have come to only thosesections of the local company which work for the joint venture. Therest suffer real losses because their market is already taken awayby the joint venture's products. Viettronics Thu Duc, an assemblerof the same calibre as Viettronics Tan Binh, is an example. Itsjoint venture with Matsushita to assemble Panasonic TV hasbenefited only the sections which work for the venture. The rest ofthe enterprises now has enough work for only four days a week.Economists see more problems than that. They said that in joiningventures with world electronics giants, Vietnamese manufacturersare losing at least two opportunities for their own development.First, they said, as foreign companies come, many Vietnameseassemblers have already set up modern assembly lines which are notany inferior to those brought in by the foreigners. Now, that theyare already part of the joint ventures, Vietnamese tend not to makesizable reinvestments in keeping their technological edge. Further,the Government's slowness in taking action to protect localindustries has discouraged them from attempting to keep this edge.The result is a virtual hand-over of the playground to the foreigncompanies.The second lost opportunity is their miss in grabbing the market oftelecommunications products as this industry is fast expanding inthe past couple of years. Experts said that if Vietnamese had beenquick enough, they could have easily taken control of this marketwhich has now become almost a open ground for foreign suppliers.The sole solutionRecently, as the Hanoi Electronics Company (Hanel) announced thatnext year, it will market the first Hanel TV sets with at least 60%local content, the news was received with mixed feelings. Manyother Vietnamese electronics companies may have also thought ofproducing something of their own, but doubts about thecompetitiveness of their products against those made byforeign-invested joint ventures discouraged them from going anyfarther. There are also doubts that any local banks would bewilling to finance such local ventures."As for now," commented an industry expert, "the only choice forVietnamese electronics manufacturers seems to join aforeign-invested venture. But this virtually amounts to anon-the-spot export of labour in which they will sell their skilledlabour for a living and a marginal benefit."This expert also said that the only solution to the problem restswith the local manufacturers themselves. "They need to fend forthemselves, and in the process, they need the Government to providethem with the necessary protection through appropriate policies andfinancial support.[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996THE LABOUR MARKET IN VIETNAM: MR TRAN DINH HOANfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996By Thanh TaiLabour and the labour market are both an urgent, permanent questionin Vietnam. Vuong Thanh Tai, a VNC correspondent, has justinterviewed Mr Tran Dinh Hoan, associate professor,Ph.D candidate,Minister of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs, on this issue.VNC: What do you have to say, Minister, about labour and the labourmarket in Vietnam?TDH: Vietnam has a population of 75 million of whom population of37 million of working age. Each year, 1.15-1.2 million more peoplecome of working age.The rural areas make up 76% of the total workforce and the urbanareas, 24%. The urban areas have a 6.1% unemployment while 30%, andin some places even 40-50%, of the rural workforce is partiallyunemployed. The state-owned sector employs about 3 million workerswho account for 8.5% of the total work force.Since Vietnam began the renewal process, the labour force in thestate-owned sector has been reduced considerably as a result of there-organisation of production. Simultaneously the labour force inthe foreign-invested and private sectors has rapidly increasedthanks to the encouragement of foreign investment in the developingmulti-sector economy. The demand for labour has fluctuated greatlyas the supply-demand process, in each sector of the economy affectsthe wages offered as well as the number and skills of neededworkers.VNC: Is there any contradiction between the availability of labourand the demand for labour as required by the industrialisation andmodernisation processes?TDH: The most noticeable contradiction can be seen in the supplyand demand of skilled workers. Currently, Vietnam has more than 4million trained workers, just 10.7% of the total workforce,distributed primarily in urban centres, in the state-owned sector.As the cause of industrialisation and modernisation demands a largecontingent of skilled workers, the Party and the State haveencouraged diverse forms of job-training. The 8th National PartyCongress in its Resolution called for increasing the skilledworkforce to 22-25% of the total labour force by the year 2000. Itis also necessary to adjust the current training structure whichhas a ratio of 1-1.6-3.6 for university graduates, high schoolgraduates and skilled workers, respectively. The ratio in developedcountries is 1-4-10 respectively.As the foreign-invested sector is developing vigorously, the demandfor skilled high-tech workers will also grow rapidly. Therefore,the system of training centres must  combine formal class roomtraining with on-the-job training and access to the latest inhigh-tech equipment meet this specific demand.VNC: What is the solution to unemployment and a more efficient useof intellectual workers?TDH: With a  market economy, unemployment is common in developed ordeveloping countries. Since Vietnam began to shift over to themarket mechanism, there have been signs of unemployment. Forinstance, a population census conducted in 1989 showed anunemployment rate of 4%. This rate grew to 9% in the first years ofthe 1991-1995 plan. A labour and employment survey in urban areasin 1994 pointed to an unemployment rate of 6.1% in urban areas and7% in major towns. Currently, the jobless in Vietnam are estimatedat 2.5-3 million people.Over recent years, the State has issued policies encouraging jobcreation. The best results were obtained in 1995 when jobs werecreated for more than 1 million persons, equal to the number ofpersons  coming of working age each year. The Ministry of Labour,War Invalids and Social Affairs has, together with the otherministries and branches concerned, built a national job generationprogram and is elaborating an insurance system for the unemployedto submit for Government approval.On the other hand, the solution to a more efficient use ofintellectual workers focuses on 5 causes of the irrational use ofintellectual workers. First, there must be a plan to adapt trainingto the demand of employment. Second, a labour market must becreated to help intellectual workers find suitable employment intheir profession. Third, a policy must be issued encouragingintellectual workers to work in those areas which have a greatdemand for them. Fourth, a suitable wage scale must be developedfor those intellectual workers working in a field outside theirprofession. And fifth, those intellectual workers in thestate-owned sector who have been made redundant by theadministrative reforms and the re-organisation of production mustbe re-employed in other branches.VNC: What comment do you have on the labour market inforeign-invested enterprises? on the strikes by workers and themaltreatment of workers by foreign employers?TDH: Foreign investment is a strategic factor helping to acceleratethe renewal of the economic structure, the industrialisation of theeconomy, and the generation of employment. That's why, over recentyears  the labour market in this sector has developed vigorouslyand now employs more than 85,000 workers. This sector is demandingmore and more skilled workers in industrial production. The demandfor labour by foreign-invested projects in agriculture, forestryand fisheries is growing continually because  the cost ofgenerating employment  in these branches is lower than inindustrial production.During the 1991-1995 period, the demand for labour byforeign-invested enterprises gradually shifted from the South tothe North and the Centre. Because this sector pays higher wages forqualified skilled labour. About 70-80% of the workers in thissector are skilled labour,About 90% of the labour force employed bythis sector are urban workers.Of the 214 strikes since 1989, 79 have been in state-ownedenterprises, 93 in foreign invested enterprises, and 42 in privateenterprises. During the same period, there have been 32 cases ofmaltreatment of workers, including 18 cases in enterprises investedby ROK employers. These cases have all been settled by the agenciesconcerned by means of warnings, imposing fines, forcingcompensation for the economic damage, deportation, and even legalprosecution.To ensure a good relationship between workers and employers, toprevent strikes and to stop maltreatment of workers, it isnecessary to set reconciliation councils, arbitration councils, andlabour courts. For the time being, each province and city must setup a working group composed of representatives of the branchesrelating to labour employment, help to form trade unionorganisations, improve the efficiency of labour inspectionorganisations, and control implementation of the Labour Law.[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: FIRST ALL-WOMEN ART EXHIBITIONfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996By Hoang YenThey are three women who share the same ambition to make powerfulrepresentations of their artist visions on the canvasses. Thus, agroup exhibition of 70 of their favourite paintings was opened ata Giang Vo Street gallery in Hanoi.In fact, none of them is a professional artist. Le Minh Ha works atVietnam Airlines, Vo Thanh Huong at the Archaeology Institute, andNguyen Hong Hanh at the Oil and Gas Corporation. Something thatstands out as one enters the gallery is the variety of subjectsthat have come under the optical as well as visionary perceptionsof the three artists whose well-travelled records are beyonddispute.Another common denominator is their training at the sameHanoi College of Industrial Arts. But the similarities end there.Vo Thanh Huong tends toward a forceful realism which catches hersubjects in their most natural, deepest   self-expression: "Farewell", "Streets", Still Life," and "Palm Trees" are  some ofthe best  illustrations.Nguyen Hong Hanh is more pensive and romantic in her paintings"Young Women Returning from the Market", "Boats on the Red River,"Dusk on Tam Bac River" and "Peacock Displays Its Plumage". On theother hand, Le Minh Ha  prefers stronger colours in her paintingsof "Sundown on the Suburban Village", "Street on the Seashore","Bluebell Flowers".A tentative attempt to venture into the strange waters ofsurrealism can be detected in the "The Mark of Time" by Le Minh Hawho seems to arrange things and feelings according to herperceptions of time and space. For Nguyen Hong Hanh, space becomesmore unreal, more introspective in  Spring Comes over DienBien".Occasionally, Vo Thanh Huong departed from her mainstreamstyle and  reverted  to tradition by making black the dominant hueon her canvasses.[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: ORIGINALITY AMONG PAINTERS OF THE YOUNG GENERATIONfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996By Hoang YenAs the market economy has opened new outlets for all kinds of arts,originality has become a distinctive mark for which all painters,especially those of the young generation, are aspiring and strivingfor. How these young painters are trying to establish theirhallmarks, in other words, to carve a name among the multitude ofartistic displays, is approached by VIETNAM COURIER'S HOANG YEN, inher recent interviews with a cross section of painters.Doan Van Nguyen, 49,  lecturer at the Hanoi Arts College whosespecialization is lacquer painting. Nguyen has had several of hisworks displayed at the Vietnam Arts Museum and the Oriental ArtsMuseum in Russia:"Originality and popularity must go side by side and in most casesmust mingle. Lacquer painting is not unique for Vietnam but itsmaterials and mode of expression must be an original art ofVietnam. In this sense, while preserving the national tradition,lacquer painting has to absorb elements of modernity of the world.I would stress that in any case, quality must come first and thisis what differentiates one artistic work from another.An ever larger proportion of the newly enrolled students wish tolearn lacquer painting, perhaps because this remains a genre of artwhich still opens many windows for innovation. There is, however,the risk of confounding the lacquer painting art with thetraditional craft of making lacquer ware for votive or decorativepurposes."Pham Anh Thuy, 40, a graduate of the oil painting section of theHanoi Arts School:"My first training was architecture and I got my civil engineeringdiploma from the Hanoi Building College in 1980. Frankly speaking,the economic reforms which are going on have offered me a vastopportunity to make a fortune by using my capacity as aconstruction engineer. But I later enrolled inthe Arts Collgebecause I felt that painting, especially oil painting, is myvocation.  I could not live without it even though I know that notall artists are economically secured to devote themselves entirelyto art. In any case, the business world is not my stuff and I feelmuch freer in the world of artistic creation."Van Thuyet, 42, free-lance painter, who lives a spartan life withhis small vendor wife in a 20m2 room in Tran Nhat Duat street,Hanoi:"As you can picture for yourself, the life of a free lance artistis anything but easy.People call me a surrealist, abstractionist orsomething like that. I like to paint things which exist in my ownimaginary world, a world that no living human might havevisualized. Perhaps for this same reason  very few are those whoshare my visions and still fewer are those who bought my paintings.Once I got 1,000 USD for a painting and on another occasion I solda bronze statue for 3,000 USD. But these are my chance once in alife time, so to speak."Ta Hai, Head of the Youth and Children Program of the Voice ofVietnam Radio:"My main job is a radio reporter but I can't do without painting.I take a special liking for painting on dead leaves. I considerthis to be the best method of achieving self - perfection. Itreasure all I have created after weeks, months and even years ofpersistent and laborious work and was always caught between a senseof regret and self - satisfaction when someone asked to buy a workof mine. I do not want to part with my own creations but at thesame time it  comforts me to know that my work has been justlyappreciated. The only material of my paintings are the dead leaves,pressed flower petals, a sheath of an areca leaf, in a wordeverything that comes from the plants and trees. I want to preservenature and make the best of its beauty.Young artists of today are more and more inclined to paintabstractions. Not a few have succeeded but many others have failedbecause they have cut themselves off from the practice of life,that is, from the own source of their creation."Phan Thi Lan Huong, 40,born in Hue city and teaching arts in QuiNhon town,Binh Dinh province, Central Vietnam. She is holding anexhibition at 29, Hang Bai Street,Hanoi:"I paint mainly on silk but I also make paper cuts and also try myhand at lacquer. My favourite colour is black, not because I tooka dim view of life but  only to give greater relief to the brightspots such as red, yellow and white.A  viewer of my paintings said:"Your pictures give me a sense of true relief."That may be tooflattering a word but the fact remains that I want to impart thesense of beauty and relaxation to people around me. This is alsoperhaps why I like to paint women and nature.At this exhibition alone I have sold ten paintings, the highestpriced is 1,000 USD. I consider myself much luckier than mycolleagues in Qui Nhon and other small towns. I'm looking forwardto some practical aid from the Vietnam Arts Association to helppainters in small towns like Qui Nhon also to have access to thelarge public including foreign art lovers and researchers."Quach Dong Phuong, teacher at the Hanoi Arts College:"I have painted all these twenty years and my subjects are nothingbut scenes of daily life: going to the market, replanting rice,family visits.... Some people rightly noted that the conical palmleaf hat is nearly omnipresent in my pictures. I want in fact to"personalize" my works by the conical hat, but not that alone. Ithink that the conical hat is a traditional trait of the nationwhich must be preserved in any form, including painting andsculpture.I am listed among the "richest" among Vietnamese painters. That maybe true or not, but the fact remains that I have sold manypaintings to several countries in Asia such as Singapore, Japan andSouth Korea. Some European countries have also displayed my works.I am told that they like my paintings because they combine verysuccessfully modernity and traditionality."Nguyen Quoc Huy, 25, graduating from the Hanoi Arts College in1994:"Freedom of creation is my guiding principle and my greatest sourceof self satisfaction. It might have been different if I had beenborn in earlier times when everything depended on the government.Now we have opened all the windows to the world, including theartistic window. This enables us young painters and sculptors tobroaden our perspectives through increasing exchanges with theoutside artistic world. Lacquer paintings is my preference and isa relatively safe way of making a living. If you are lucky enoughto sell two, or even one, lacquer paintings, it might sustain youand your family for a whole year. When things go awry, I take upother genres such as designing book covers, or painting posters andadvertisements".[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: GROWING PRESENCE OF YOUNG PAINTERS, A WELCOME DEVELOPMENTfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996By Duong TuongPainters 23 to 40 years of age account for 60% of the membership ofthe Vietnam Fine Arts Association, according to Ms. Vu Giang Huong,General Secretary of the Association.The common and easily discredible trait of all the galleries andexhibition is the growing presence of the young generation ofartists. It is that the older generation of artists has died orsilently withdrawn from the art market. Exhibitions by suchluminaries like Nguyen Tu Nghiem and Diep Minh Chau still attracta large number of visitors, but they are greatly outnumbered by theexhibitions of young painters who accounted for 400 of the 650exhibits in 1995. "That is a welcome development," said Dzu Thanh,a senior member of the Arts Association because they have been, andwill be, the vanguard to integrating Vietnamese art onto the worldscene. They are also the most dynamic force to vitalize anddiversify painting and sculpture in our country. All styles, genresand perspectives are being accepted provided they do not runcounter to Vietnamese traditions. The young artists are eager totest their worth through galleries and exhibitions which openalmost weekly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the two largest artcentres of the country. Their presence might also be the bestinfluence to eliminate all that is extravagant and eccentric.Censorship in the truest sense of the word belong to the public,not to any vested power. Some tendencies toward eccentricity anderoticism have been quickly dismissed by the public even though thepress rarely interferes in these so-called "experimentation".TaHai, an art lecturer commented: "I am a painter myself but I mustconfide that some  enigmatic and eccentric paintings are pastcomprehension or unstandable only to their author. In my view, thesearch for the new must not allow us to disregard the public".[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: YOUTH UNION RAISES PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT HIV/AIDSfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996A two-day conference on HIV/AIDS was held in Hanoi on Sept. 23-24to raise public awareness about the HIV/AIDS disease and itsdangerous effect on youth.Reports made at the conference said over 50% of HIV infected peopleare between 15-24 years of age and in some places the rate ofHIV-infected girls is double that of HIV-infected boys in the 15-19age group.The conference aimed to raise public awareness about the epidemicand seek solutions to prevent it from spreading. Participants inthe conference called for innovative partnerships and efficientassistance among government agencies, communities, non-governmentalorganisations, families of infected people and the private businesssector to help promote efforts against HIV infection.Speaking at the conference Dr. Roy Morey, UN Resident Co-ordinatorand UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, said: "As elsewhere,recognition and acceptance that everyone is at risk, and thereforehas a part to play in overcoming the AIDS epidemic, are key inreversing the trend of rising infection rates".Mr. Steve Kraus, Country Programme Advisor for UNAIDS, called forspecial efforts "To provide this education to all children andyouth, especially those who are harder to reach such as children ofminorities, indigenous people, and street children."A two-year UNDP project launched in early 1996 has selected Vietnamas a priority for its assistance.

Vietnam has in recent yearsbecome a potentially lucrative market for plastic products. Notonly has its need for materials for plastics production increasedsteadily, from 100,000 tons/year in 1992 to 300,000 tons in 1995and a projected 370,000 tons in 1997, but its fast-growing oilindustry is also making it a potentially important supplier ofmaterials for the plastics industry.Growing needIndustry experts are unanimous that Vietnam's need for materialsfor plastics production will increase much faster in the next threeto five years. Auto plants, telecommunications equipment factories,cement plants, and many other industrial projects underconstruction will be requiring quality plastic products.Cement officials, for instance, said that their industry alonewill, by the year 2000, need about 300 million plastic bags.However, all they have now is a small mill in Can Tho whichproduces only 14 million plastic bags/year.For the time being, the country's need for materials for plasticsproduction is being met mostly by imports from Southeast Asiancountries. Only 4% of those materiatls, however, are used inhigh-quality products. But this situation is expected to change ina few years when the country's petro-chemical industry is ready tobegin production.Already, Petronas, the Malaysian oil producer, has invested 4million USD in helping the Vietnamese Government design theblueprint for its petro-chemical industry. Meanwhile, Mitsui ofJapan is applying for a license to invest in building an82-million-USD mill attached to the oil refinery to be built atDzung Quat in central Vietnam.According to a plan being designed by the Ministry of Industry,Vietnam will be producing each year starting in 2010, about 500,000tons of PVC, 330,000 tons of PP, 200,000 tons of PS, and 75,000tons of DOP.Industry experts predict that given its good resources, Vietnam canthen focus more on producing materials for plastics productionrather than manufacturing plastic consumer goods as it has been sofar. The plastic products it produces then should be mostly forhigh-end markets.The needed investmentAccording to the Vietnam Plastics Corporation, Vinaplast, in orderto reach the above targets, the Vietnamese plastics industry shouldinvest at least 1 billion USD between now and the year 2005, mostlyin high-tech plastics. Thus they could reduce the volume of plasticconsumer goods from the present 60% of total output to only 20%.About half of this investment is planned to come from foreignsources through joint ventures or loans schemes.Officials of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) saidthat they have so far licensed 30 investment projects in theplastics industry, with a total capital of 330 million USD. Twelveof these projects are wholly foreign-owned.However, the officials also said that most of these projects aresmall and focused only on producing consumer goods. There have beenso far only two projects for producing PVC compound, two othersproducing PVC resin, and a 15-million-USD project in plasticinsulation for electronic parts, they said.One of the projects to produce materials for the plastics industryis the Oxy-Vina, a 109.4-million-USD joint venture among  Tramasucoand VietGas of Vietnam, Oxychem of the US, and Marubeni of Japan toproduce PVC compound. It is located in Ba Ria-Vung Tau and isscheduled to start operation in 1999. As this article goes topress, it is reported that Petronas of Malaysia is negotiating adeal to take over Oxychem's share in this joint venture.The other on-going materials  projects include the 92-million-USDjoint venture between Vinaplast and Mitsui of Japan which is tostart producing 80,000 tons of PVC resin/year in 1997 and the12-million-USD joint venture between Vinaplast and Lucky GoldStarof South Korea which is to produce 30,000 tons of DOP/year.[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY CAUGHT IN DILEMMA: OUTGROWING THE TIGHTSHIRTfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996By Quynh TrangThe electricity industry is caught in a dilemma. On the one hand,it is being told to produce, between now and the year 2000, about30 billion kWh/year to meet the needs of the economy. On the otherhand, it has not yet acquired the capital to develop both itsgenerating capacity and its electric grid to match the economy'sgrowth, let alone double the 1995 output of 14.6 billion kWh inonly four years.In a recent interview with VNC, Mr. Truong Bao Ngoc, deputy generaldirector of the Vietnam Electricity Corporation (VEC), said thatfor the electric industry to fulfil its plan, it needs aninvestment of about 6 billion USD in the 1996-2000 period. But, hesaid, our biggest problem now is finance. We are not in anyposition to balance our budget and make significant investments indeveloping power resources and a distribution network. Demand hasbeen increasing faster than the supply and this may result in apower shortage in the 1996-98 dry seasons. The power grid is eitheroverloaded or inefficient in many places".In search of a solutionTo help the electricity industry overcome its financial problems,the Government has allowed it to retain all its capitaldepreciation fund for the period from now until 2000 forreinvestment. It is also allowed to increase electricity prices byabout 70% during this period (the maximum expected to be 800 VND orabout 0.70 USD for a kWh) and mobilise funding from other domesticsources. However, experts said, all these new funds will, at best,meet only 30% of the industry's financial needs. The rest will bemade up by loans from foreign banks and financial institutions suchas the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.An important form of investment is coming throughBuild-Operate-Transfer projects  or joint ventures. By now, theindustry has had three BOT projects which are expected to becompleted before 2000. They include the 300-MW thermo-electricpower plant (phase I) in Quang Ninh province, the 600-MWgas-operated power plant II (phase II) in Phu My, Ba Ria-Vung Tauprovince and the 620-MW gas-operated power plant III, also in PhuMy, Ba Ria-Vung Tau. They will be followed by a number of otherpower projects, in both northern and southern provinces. It isprojected that the BOT plants will generate about 30% of the totaloutput of all domestic power plants.A problem with the BOT plants which is being addressed is thetiming of their transfer. Because of the low price of electricityin Vietnam, which is meant to keep it within the reach of mostlow-income customers, an early transfer will make BOT electricitytoo expensive. Meanwhile, a prolonged transfer which would keep theprice low, would result in a relatively higher depreciation 1 onequipment.Whatever the solution may be, it will be carefully balanced to makethe output price reasonable for both the project owners andcustomers, industry sources said.For the immediate future, the industry is taking measures to ensurea stable power supply. These measures include upgrading existingcoal- and diesel-fuelled power plants and accelerating theconstruction of on-going power projects. There are also measuresplanned to reduce the electricty loss in transmission to 0.5% eachyear from now to 2000.[Hanoi]Copyright 1996 Vietnam CourierBack to Headline List CopyrightVIETNAM COURIER via NewsNetSeptember 20, 1996VIETNAM: MONG CAI BORDER REGION TO TRY NEW PRO-BUSINESS POLICIESfrom VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996The Prime Minister has taken bordering Chine a decision making theMong Cai region the place for a trial of new government policies intrade, import-export, services, tourism, investment and industry.The decision which was made on September 18 clarified that tradeand services in the region include import-export, re-export,transit cargo, duty-free shops, trade fairs and exhibitions,product showrooms, manufactured exported goods, and sub-contractedproduction, the establishment of representative offices for bothforeign and Vietnamese companies and border markets.Vietnamese and foreign investors were encouraged to invest inproduction, business and infrastructure development in Mong Cai inconformity with Vietnam's laws on foreign and domestic investmentand domestic investment promotion.In addition to common preferential treatment for investment, theywere offered land and water rents with a 50% discount.

Newthinking is necessary, the chancellor insisted as he promisedthat job creation would be the focus of talks between thegovernment, labor leaders and representatives of industry, "Wewill be able to address the future successfully only if we findcommon answers to the issues that concern us," he said. "Everyreasonable proposal, every forward-looking initiative should beconsidered and not rejected out of hand or subjected to thedestructive effects of sustained public controversy." Givenplans to curtail government bureaucracy and cutbacks at majorcorporations, much of the impetus for job creation will have tocome from small and medium-sized businesses, Germany's famedMittelstand, Kohl went on to argue, and particular attentionmust be given to encouraging new businesses and self-employment. "Anyone who starts up anew business in our countrycreates employment and a living for an average of fouradditional persons," he observed. "In Germany, we need a newspirit of enthusiasm for business start-ups. We need men andwomen who are self-confident and able to translate their ideasinto action."Like the chancellor, Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth (CDU)called for a "unprejudiced" examination of a broad variety ofproposals to boost employment. Suessmuth, speaking in a radiointerview New Year's Day, cited the "Alliance for Work"recently put forward by the industrial union IG Metall as onesuch proposal that warrents serious consideration (cf. TWIG11/3/95, p.4). Last November, union head Klaus Ziwckelsuggested labor would be willing to forego wage increases inexchange for guarantees of job security from employers and anend to government plans to cut social welfare spending. Inaddition to considering proposals like that, Suessmuth said,emphasis has to be placed on investment. That includes not onlyinvestment in the industries of tomorrow, she stressed, butalso in efforts to put people back to work, even if in onlymenial jobs and even if at the taxpayers' expense. That couldlead to higher social security deductions from the paychecks ofthe employed, Suessmuth acknowledged, but otherwise the socialwelfare systems is threatened with collapse as growing numbersof Germans - the unemployed and holders of exempted low-wagejobs (see story page 5) - find themselves unable to contribute.An "alliance for the social state," according to the publicemployees' union DAG, is needed to protect Germany's socialwelfare system against excessive cuts in the interests ofemployers. "Attacks on the social system by employers andpoliticians make it necessary to organize social counter forcesin 1996," DAG board member Lutz Freitag told reporters inHamburg at the year's close. It is incompatible with the goalsset out in the Basic Law, Germany's constitution, that the lessaffluent are increasingly being pushed to the margins of Germansociety, he said. That message was echoed by Bishop KlausEngelhard of Hannover (Lower Saxony), chair of the governingboard of Germany's Evangelical Church. The growing gap betweenrich and poor, the bishop said in his New Year's Eve sermon,threatens Germany's social consensus. He thus welcomedZwickel's call for an "Alliance for Work" and urged labor andindustry to sit down with the government for talks.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEK IN GERMANY via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996HERZOG PROCLAIMS JANUARY 27 DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR VICTIMS OFNAZISMJanuary 27 will henceforth be a national day of remembrance forthe victims of Nazism, President Roman Herzog of Germany hasproclaimed. It was on that day in 1945 that the Auschwitzconcentration camp was liberated. Auschwitz, the presidentnoted in a proclamation he issued Wednesday (January 3), standsas a symbol of the Nazis' racist and genocidal policies. TheNazi terror must never be forgotten, Herzog said, and futuregenerations must be made mindful of what happened in Germanyduring the Third Reich so that nothing comparable will everagain be allowed to occur. The newly designated day ofremembrance will pay tribute to the millions of men, women andchildren who were tortured and murdered by the Nazis, to everyindividual who suffered persecution and disenfranchisementduring the twelve-year nightmare of the Third Reich.The day after Herzog made his proclamation, Bundestag PresidentRita Suessmuth (CDU) announced that the parliament will hold asession to commemorate the victims of  Nazism on January 19.President Herzog, she said, had agreed to address the specialsession.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEK IN GERMANY via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA AFFIRMATIVE ACTION LAW TO REMAIN INEFFECT DESPITE COURT RULINGAn affirmation action law will remain in effect in the state ofNorth Rhine-Westphalia despite a court ruling against it, stateofficials indicated late last month. On December 19, a statesuperior administrative court (Oberverwaltungsgericht) inMuenster rejected a petition from a woman who had been passedover for a promotion in favor of a male colleague. Under NorthRhine-Westphalia's law to advance equality in the workplace,women are to be favored over men with comparable skills andqualifications in hiring and promotion until the office ordepartment in question has equal numbers of men and women. Inrejecting the petition, the court, which had previouslydeclared the law unconstitutional, invoked a recent ruling bythe European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. The European courtruled in October that a similar affirmative action law in thestate of Bremen violated guarantees of equal treatment for allindividuals contained in European Union law (cf. TWIG 10/20/95,p.4).Minister of Women Ilse Ridder-Melcher (SPD) of North Rhine-Westphalia announced that the disputed law will remain ineffect because the superior administrative court does not havethe authority o invalidate a law passed by the stateparliament. Only the Federal Constitutional Court, she noted,can do so. Approximately 40 men have sought to challenge theconstitutionality of the North Rhine-Westphalia affirmativeaction law since the beginning of the decade, but all haveultimately withdrawn their complaints upon receiving promotion.Two men, Ridder-Melcher said, recently filed complaints againstthe law.Comparing North Rhine-Westphalia's law on promoting women withBremen's, Ridder-Melchers told the Frankfurter Rundschau, islike comparing apples and oranges. In North Rhine-Westphalia's,she notes, women are not automatically given preference overmen. Each case must be reviewed individually to assure that theman or men involved are not put under unfair hardship by hiringor promoting women in their place. This clause, in Ridder-Melcher's view, puts North Rhine-Westphalia's law on more solidlegal footing than Bremen's. In 1993, she said, the FederalLabor Court upheld the validity of the law.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEK IN GERMANY via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996NUMBER OF ETHNIC GERMAN RESETTLERS DROPPED IN 1995The number of ethnic Germans resettling in the Federal Republicdropped slightly last year, the Federal Ministry of theInterior announced Monday (January 1). In 1995, a total of217,898 ethnic Germans registered as resettlers in Germany,roughly 5,000 fewer than the 222,591 who did in 1994. Theoverwhelming majority (209,409) came from the successor statesto the Soviet Union. Most of the remainder came from eitherRomania (6,519) or Poland (1,677). During 1995, Germanauthorities received 260,556 applications from ethnic Germansseeking to resettle in the Federal Republic. Approximately100,00 ethnic Germans in the former East Bloc, the ministryreports, have received permission to emigrate to the FederalRepublic but have not yet done so. Ministry officials believemost do not intend to use their entry permits unless anemergency arises.Not all the ethnic Germans leaving their homes in the CentralAsiatic states of the Commonwealth of Independent States areresettling in Germany. According to Ministry of the InteriorParliamentary State Secretary Horst Waffenschmidt (CDU),approximately 10,000 ethnic Germans left Central Asia for theRussian Federation. Many settled in western Siberia, which hasa 600,000-strong German minority. Both Russia and Germany,Waffenschmidt noted, support this migration.The number of ethnic Germans who opt to resettle in Germanyduring the coming year will depend on the political situationin the Commonwealth of Independent States, Waffenschmidt said.Germany's goal is to accept a limited number of resettlerswhile providing development aid to German minorities in EasternEurope and the former Soviet republics. Particular emphasiswill be placed on intensifying ties between Germany and ethnicGerman communities this year. Germany is contributing towardthe construction of community centers which will offer, amongservices, courses in the German language. More aid will also beoffered this year to support small and medium-sized businessesin ethnic German communities.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEK IN GERMANY via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996THE PRESS ON THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEWFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung(January 2) "It seems 1996 will be the year of alliances inGerman economic policy. The chancellor, as part of a generalplan of action, wants to join in the `alliance for jobs,'proposed by Klaus Zwickel, chairperson of the IG Metallmetalworkers union. SPD party leader Oskar Lafontaine wouldlike to bring all the social forces into an `employment pact.'And the Public Employees Union, suspecting that meetings withthe chancellor and employment experts have involved a criticallook at social (security) costs, is making a cautionary appealto the churches of an `alliance for the social state'(Sozialstaat).Those rubrics indicate the right priorities. Reducingunemployment is the most urgent economic issue for Germany. Theconnection between unemployment and social costs is a spiralinto fiscal calamity: social welfare payments increase businesscosts, leading to unemployment, and unemployment requiresincreased contributions to let the social fund bear the costsof joblessness. If there is no action, the society moves towardever higher unemployment, a prisoner of the social spiral itconstructed. The necessity of halting that fateful turn needsno further explanation. That brings up the question how.Zwickel's proposal makes clear, above all, where the risk is ina new collectivism of alliances. Unemployment has occuredbecause the wages reached through collective bargaining don'tcorrespond to the employment requirements of employees and theprofit and loss position of businesses. The errors of thesecollective agreements are now supposed to be cured by an evenmore far-reaching collective agreement. In exchange for apromise vaguely binding them to moderation, the partners ofthe `alliance,' in the stead of business, are promising toprocure hundreds of thousands of jobs, and the state shouldforget about revising the social system. That will not work;high employment won't come out of it.From the point of view of the unions, however, the Zwickelalliance has an entirely different aim: to bring in the unionsas players in the center of a corporative policy. One shouldn'tfall into that trap."Sueddeutsche Zeitung(Munich, December 30) "It's difficult enough to read betweenthe lines, even harder to extract the insinuations. HelmutKohl's New Year's speech will not make it easy for readers orlisteners, at least not those who are interested in finding outfrom the chancellor what the new year will really bring by wayof problems or opportunities.. `Much has gone well, but noteverything.' If that isn't the epitaph of the year! Or maybeeven better: `In retrospective we are looking backwards, butthe future is ours only if we are confident.'Jokes aside, the chancellor is stating the obvious: nobreakthrough in employment. But he isn't what he needs to:tighten those belts a little tighter! Business people shouldstop complaining and get down to business! It's time toredefine and rediscover social consensus in the face of vastlychanged worldwide market conditions! Be more flexible! Lessvacation! More participation in (meeting) social costs fromthose who can do so! And everything else you could put anexclamation point to...Instead, Kohl clothes the need to save and cut down and berealistic in vague terms: `There can't be any exceptions.' Andhe promises a new growth of small and medium-sized businesses.Where will that come from? `Ideas' and the `courage ofindependence' do not suffice. Public policy needs the courageto create the right conditions. But maybe it's too much to askfor anything concrete on New Year's Eve. During the nightfireworks will explode into momentary dreams. Then it soon willbe day again with plenty of time for the truth."General-Anzeiger(Bonn, December 30) "The social state is not the cause ofstructural change (in German society), but rather it makes theconsequences of (that change) - in particular mass unemployment- at least halfway endurable, since it saddles everyone (withresponsibility) for them. Whoever shrinks (the social state)too severely will not only create room for maneuver for newinvestment, but also a different society. But solidarity is nota one-way street, not in the family or in the work place or inpolitics. The French learned this painfully during the weeks ofstrikes before Christmas. It is obvious to say but difficult toput into action: the Germans must act together to meet thechallenges they face."Berliner Morgenpost(December 30) "For better or worse, our leisure and good-timesociety will have to get used to the fact that unified Germanyhas taken on a new role in international politics.

Each fall,six research institutes join in presenting a report on theirexpectations for the German economy. This past October, the sixagreed that growth for 1995 would stand at about 2.25 percentand reach 2.5 percent in 1996 (cf. TWIG 10/27/95, p.4). Threeof the six announced in late December, however, that they hadbeen over optimistic in their outlook for the coming year. Inits December monthly report, the Federal Ministry of Economicslikewise pointed to disappointing economic performance in thesecond half of 1995, but nonetheless predicted continuedeconomic recovery in the next twelve months.The Munich-based Ifo institute announced on December 20 that itnow expects economic growth of 2.0 percent for 1995 and 1.75percent for 1996 rather than the previously anticipated 2.25and 2.5 percent.. The institute cited disappointing capitalinvestment figures for the second half of 1995 in issuing itsrevised forecast, but stressed that it does not expect Germanyto slip into recession. Private consumption boosted by taxbreaks will help the economy, according to Ifo, and investmentand exports are expected to recover from the effects of astrong D-mark and high wage settlements. But unemployment willchange little over the year and probably drop by only one-tenthof a percent o 9.5 percent, Ifo now believes. Hamburg's HWWAInstitute for Economic Research similarly announced that it nowexpects economic growth of only 2.0 percent for 1995, but, likeIfo, it believes the recovery process should pick up in 1996and that the German economy will not slip into recessionThe Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research said itstill expects 2.25 percent growth for 1995, but maintained thatthe German economy is not performing as well as it could. Theanticipated growth, the institute added, will hardly helpchange the employment situation in Germany as a whole; itforesees a reduction in unemployment only in the eastern halfof the country. In the view the Institute for Economic Research(IWH), Halle (Saxony-Anhalt), the eastern economy should growby 4.8 percent in 1996. Limited growth in the west, accordingto IWH, will slow growth in the east.Acknowledging a number of factors slowing Germany's economicrecovery, the Federal Ministry of Economics pointed to othersin its December report that should give the economy a boost incoming months. Low interest rates, stable prices and increasesin household incomes arising from tax cuts should help lift theeconomy after 1995's disappointing fourth quarter. Preliminarydata on fourth quarter production, contracts and wholesaleprices, the report said, suggest that growth in the second halfof the year will stand at about 1.5 percent, a marked drop fromthe 2.6 percent registered in the first six months of 1995.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEK IN GERMANY via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996COMPUSERVE RESTRICTS ACCESS TO 200 IN RESPONSE TO GERMANINVESTIGATIONThe computer network firm CompuServe announced Friday (December29) that it was restricting access to 200 Internet sites inresponse to an investigation by public prosecutors in Munich.In late November, the public prosecutor's office in Munichlaunched an investigation to determine whether the CompuServenetwork was being used to distribute materials that violateGerman law. Specifically, prosecutors believe child pornographyand pornographic materials legally off limits to minors arebeing disseminated via CompuServe's German subsidiary,CompuServe GmbH. To forestall any further violations of Germanlaw, officials at CompuServe's headquarters in the UnitedStates said they were blocking access to 200 sites dealing withsexual topics. The restrictions will affect CompuServe usersaround the world because, as the company explained, it cannotcurrently tailor its services to meet the different nationallaws in each of the countries where it has subscribers.CompuServe says it provides network services to over fourmillion subscribers throughout the world, including 220,000 inthe German-speaking nations. According to the publicprosecutors office, officials at CompuServe GmbH's Munichoffice voluntarily turned over materials to investigators onNovember 22.

Under German law, workers with monthlyincomes of less than DM 580 (about U.S. $400) do not pay intothe social security system that provides pensions, unemploymentbenefits and health insurance. Local courts in Hannover (LowerSaxony) and Speyer (Rheinland-Pfalz) brought the case beforethe European Court of Justice on behalf of three femaledomestic workers. According to the local courts, the German lawis discriminatory because the great majority of those who holdso-called "580 Mark jobs" are women. Dismissing that line ofargument, the European Court of Justice backed the Germangovernment's right to use the exemption to "achieve a socio-political goal." Bonn maintains that without the exemption,low-wage jobs would disappear without any correspondingincrease in full-time, higher-wage employment.The number of people holding "580 Mark jobs" is estimated atbetween 4.5 and 6.0 million. By the calculations of the Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung, about a quarter of them areemployed in private households. Many of the rest hold part-timejobs in retail sales, manufacturing, and the hotel andrestaurant industry.

The Society for German Language (Gesellschaft fuerDeutsche Sprache) proclaimed "multimedia" 1995's "World of theYear" late last month, citing its broad influence on recentpublic discussion and debate. "We found a five hundred-percentincrease in the use of the concept `multimedia' this year,"society spokesperson Gerhard Mueller explained in announcingthe Word of the Year. "Multimedia is the guiding term(Leitwort) for the journey into the brave new media world."There will hardly be an area of everyday life, Mueller and hiscolleagues speculate, that will not be touched by advances ininformation technology in the none too distant future.Another change on the horizon - if Europe's political leadershold firm to newly approved plans - will be the introduction ofa common Eurogeld ("Euro-currency"), the runner-up on the Wordof the Year list. Third place went to the much-discussedKruzifixurteil ("crucifix judgement"). In August, the FederalConstitutional Court ruled that a Bavarian ordinance mandatedthe hanging of crucifixes in public school classrooms violatedGermany's constitution, the Basic Law (cf. TWIG 9/8/95, p.6).The ruling provoked indignation from many Bavarian politiciansand large public protests throughout the state. Prime MinisterEdmund Stoiber (CSU) and his cabinet subsequently draftedlegislation that would change the wording of Bavaria's schoolordinances but still keep crucifixes in the great majority ofclassrooms (cf. TWIG 9/15/95, p.7).Religious concerns also stood behind the society's "Motto ofthe Year," Wir sind Kirche ("We are the Church"). The lineserved as both the name and the rallying cry of a lay Catholicinitiative calling for reforms within the Roman Catholic Church(cf. TWIG 11/24/95, p.6; 12/8/95, p.7). Wir sind Kirchegathered 1.8 million signatures on petition calling for an endto obligatory clerical celibacy and the prohibition on theordination of women, among other changes.Until last year, the Society for German Language designated theUnwoerter ("non-words") of the year, the most unfortunateexpressions to enter the language. The Unwoerter selectioncommittee and the society parted ways in 1994 in the wake of acontroversy over the inclusion of kollektiver Freizeitpark("collective leisure park"), a term used by Chancellor HelmutKohl to criticize Germany's extensive social welfare system,among the Unwoerter of 1993 (cf. TWIG 1/6/95, p.6). The six-person selection jury, a spokesperson reported Tuesday (January2), has received a record number of suggestions from thegeneral public for 1995's Unwort of the Year.

The author ofover 30 pieces for the stage, Mueller also earned acclaim forhis work as director and drama theorist. His professionalsuccess was anything but straightforward, however. Mueller wasa Marxist and long time member of the German DemocraticRepublic's governing Socialist Unity Party, but he wastemporarily forbidden to publish or stage his socially criticalwork in the GDR. From the mid 1960s on, Mueller's plays tendedto be staged more frequently in the Federal Republic and othernations than in the GDR. Yet even though the East Germanauthorities were often less than enthusiastic about Mueller'scynical tone, they nonetheless acknowledged the merit of hiswork. In 1986, he was awarded the GDR National Prize for Artand Literature, one of the country's highest honors. Mueller'sindependent stance before the collapse of the GDR was muchlauded, but not long after unification it was revealed he hadserved as an "unofficial collaborator" - i.e., as an informer -for the Stasi, East Germany's secret police. Mueller,acknowledging that he had been in regular contact with theStasi, said he had tried to advise the authorities and to usehis influence constructively.At the time of his death, Mueller was the artistic director ofthe Berliner Ensemble, the theater company founded by BertoldBrecht in eastern Berlin shortly after the establishment of theGDR. Like all eastern German cultural institutions, theBerliner Ensemble entered a period of change and uncertaintyafter unification. Mueller was appointed to serve as one offour co-directors to guide the venerable company's way into thefuture. The four-person directorship fell apart late in thewinter of 1995, however, and Mueller, despite having recentlyundergone surgery for cancer of the esophagus, accepted aninvitation to take over as sole artistic director.The members of the Berliner Ensemble, joining with the rest ofthe German theatrical and literary community in mourningMueller's death, are honoring Mueller's memory with a marathonreading program.

Theindustrial nations agreed in principle this past spring, nineyears after the accident that made Chernobyl a household wordaround the world, to help offset the costs of closing thehobbled but still operating power plant (cf. TWIG 4/21/95,p.5). At that time, the amount of aid Ukraine could expect inexchange for agreeing to shut Chernobyl was left undetermined;Ukrainian authorities estimated the shutdown would cost a totalof U.S. $4.4 billion. In a statement of intention signedDecember 20, the G-7 nations (Canada, France, Germany, GreatBritain, Italy, Japan and the U.S.) declared themselvesprepared to contribute U.S. $500 million in direct toward thecost of taking Chernobyl out of operation once and for all. TheG-7 and the European Union are also prepared to make availableanother $1.8 billion in credits for construction of powerplants to replace Chernobyl. These figures are "targets,"explained Ukrainian Minister of the Environment Yuri Kostenko.Further negotiations, he added, will be needed to work out thedetails.

If, as somescholars believe, recently discovered notations in a bible camefrom the pen of Martin Luther, the Wuerttemberg State Library,Stuttgart, will be able to boast of a unique treasure. If, asothers maintain, the marginalia was written by a follower ofLuther's, the library is left with an old book containing oldnotes of interest to only a small circle of specialists.In late November, a researcher named Manuel Santos Noyaannounced he had discovered extensive comments in Luther's handin a copy of the Vulgate bible, that is, in a copy of the Latinversion of the bible that was considered the authoritative textof the scriptures in Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages.Santos Noya argued that the copy of the Vulgate he found in theWuerttemberg State Library was the copy Luther had used inpreparing his German translation of the bible. That translationis widely credited with having played a decisive role in thedevelopment of modern written German, much as the "King James"translation influenced English prose. If Santos Noya iscorrect, the marginal comments he found could throw new lighton Luther's thinking as he prepared his translation and thusupon an epochal event in German cultural history.Other scholars have been quick to point to weak points inSantos Noya's case. Professor Ulrich Bubenheimer of theUniversity of Heidelberg (Baden-Wuerttemberg), a theologian whois regarded an authority on sixteenth-century handwriting,agreed that the marginalia Santos Noya found is written in ahand that shows many similarities to Luther's, but also manydifferences, especially in the way Greek and Hebrew charactersare written. According to Bubenheimer, it was not unusual forstudents in the sixteenth century to pattern their handwritingupon their teachers. Luther's close collaborator PhilippMelanchthon (1497-1560), he notes by way of example, wrote in ahand that resembled Luther's.Bubenheimer and other Luther scholars have underscoredadditional  evidence that similarly points to a follower ofLuther rather than Luther himself as the annotator of theStuttgart bible. Some one wrote the date January 28,1528 at thebeginning of the text and November 14, 1528 at the end,suggesting that the annotations were written during thateleven-month period. Luther, on the other hand, did histranslation of the New Testment in 1521-1522. The annotatoralso cites Luther's writings and mentions Luther by name or byhis initials when he does so; Luther is not known to havefollowed such a practice. Finally, the initials IW are writtenat the end of the text. Bubenheimer and like-minded scholarssuspect that they refer to the owner of the bible who made thedisputed annotations.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEK IN GERMANY via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996KOHL REIGNS SUPREME IN EDITIONAL CARTOONSThe figures are in, and now there's no disputing ChancellorHelmut Kohl's political stature. An inventory of 110 daily andweekly newspapers, the German Press Agency (dpa) reports, hasdetermined that the chancellor was far and away the country'smost frequently caricatured political personality during 1995.His distinctively well-fed figure - no doubt a godsend tocartoonists - appeared in a total of 1,127 editorial cartoons,more than twice as many as the runner-up, Federal Minister ofFinance Theo Waigel (CDU). Waigel's luxuriant eyebrows turnedup in just under 500 cartoons, making them about as well knownto newspaper readers as his unceasing efforts to trim thefederal budget. Lest anyone think Germany's cartoonists undulypartisan, Rudolf Scharping, until November the national leaderof the opposition Social Democrats, came in a close Thirdbehind Waigel.Back to Headline List WT03-B07-10IA087-000634-B044-220http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/it151.html 205.156.212.5 19970122032138 text/html 267173HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 03:18:40 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:25 GMTContent-length: 266985Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/it151.html Sample Issue Copyright WINDOW via NewsNet October 25, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES HONGKONG DIARY: At this delicate point in Hong Kong's history, there are strongarguments for favouring an experienced and well-respected legal figure: A Suitable Candidate (954 words) COMMENTARY: SPECULATOR'S DIARY: An Ode to the Market (820 words) ANY OTHER BUSINESS: Tourism Receipts Rising (104 words) ANY OTHER BUSINESS: Hold Your Horsepower (226 words) ANY OTHER BUSINESS: Fun of the Fair (91 words) ANY OTHER BUSINESS: ADB Approved (226 words) ANY OTHER BUSINESS: Li Buys Township: Homes ready by 1999 (176 words) COMMENTARY: AROUND THE SQUARE: No Ifs or Butts (1003 words) BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: CATERING: Harry Ramsden's May Bring Batter to Beijing: Move into China mooted for chippie group (1367 words) BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: REGION: Exports Stifled by World-Wide Malaise: US slowdown affects Asian foreign trade (1418 words) BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: TAXATION: Tax Reforms Take Toll On PRC Companies: Revenue men get more efficient (936 words) BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: PROFILE: Strategic Advances in Financial Marketing: Richard Tsang outlines new firm's role (777 words) BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: INVESTMENT: China Tops Survey of Best Emerging Markets: Asia heads money-spinning opportunities (1637 words) BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: TECHNOLOGY: Taking the Hi-tech Road: Government centre nurtures real-time IT research (1507 words) AROUND TOWN: Ascending the Peak on: Double 9, circa 1930 (244 words) AROUND TOWN: PAST PERSPECTIVE: With SOLOMON BARD (478 words) AROUND TOWN: CHESS (626 words) AROUND TOWN: BRIDGE (294 words) REVIEWS & PREVIEWS: RECORDINGS/Jane Ram: Collaborative, Not Combative, Effort (168 words) REVIEWS & PREVIEWS: FILM: Costner Proves A Winner on Links: Tin Cup (826 words) REVIEWS & PREVIEWS: FILM/Martin Snape: DeNiro Is Up and Down in Thriller: The Fan (541 words) ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: THE WRITING SCENE: A Shopkeeper's Diary: A writer's debut on an outlying island (805 words) ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: TRAVEL: Garlic Spells Trouble: There's no substitute for metal at silver fest (920 words) ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: A Prophet's Rise & Fall: New papers tell more of China's Christ figure: God's Chinese Son: The Heavenly Kingdom of Hong Xiuquan (820 words) ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: BOOKS: A Change of Season: Painful journey to enlightenment: Bound Feet & Western Dress (1003 words) ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: ANTIQUES: First, Remove the Butter: Tibetan furniture starts making its way to Hong Kong (1211 words) COVER STORY: A SEA OF TROUBLES (2698 words) COMMENTARY: The ideal ruler rarely speaks.

Indeed,we would suggest that, of the candidates who have presentedthemselves, he appears to have the best combination of thequalities that will be required for this onerous and responsibleposition.Perhaps we should first define those qualities. The CE should -obviously - be a person of probity and acumen who has distinguishedhimself in the eyes of his profession and has a respected standingin the community.The successful candidate must also go into this election well awarethat the position aspired to is no sinecure. It will be a taxing,arduous job, made more difficult by the fact that there will be noclear precedents to guide him, and any number of carping criticswilling to damn his actions and question his motives.No doubt, even as we write, the knives are being sharpened byvarious factions. The CE's every move will be closely monitored bythe media - both local reporters and the thousands who are expectedto swarm in for next year's ceremony - by the people of Hong Kong,and by all those on the mainland who have the territory's interestsat heart.We would also suggest that the person filling the CE positionshould be someone of maturity, experienced in the ways of theworld, impervious to flattery and who has attained some distancefrom the transitory tug of ego.While virtually every successful person in Hong Kong has businessinterests, the successful candidate should be someone who isclearly not active in the business community, or likely to returnto an active role at some later date.Trust: It goes without saying that the first CE of the SAR must beacceptable to and trusted by Beijing. China reposes great faith inthe people of Hong Kong - after all, the SAR will have a fargreater degree of autonomy than any other territory in China. Webelieve that the Beijing leadership will abide by its pledge thatHong Kong people will rule Hong Kong.But Hong Kong has been harmed by the tenure of its last colonialgovernor. It is now obvious that Chris Patten was sent here byBritain to perform a PR job for international consumption, whilstknowing all the while that none of his political manouevrings stoodthe slightest chance of ever being allowed to carry through beyondthe transition.Nonetheless, Patten's machinations have left Beijing deeplysuspicious as to what seeds may have been sown by the outgoingBritish administration in Hong Kong's politically green soil. TheCE will have to be someone capable of sniffing out any unexplodedbombs left behind by the outgoing colonial power.But the first CE must also be someone who enjoys the wholeheartedtrust of the people of Hong Kong. He should be someone who was bornhere and whose roots are firmly embedded in the territory. To bethe first CE of the SAR will be a lonely job. It is not a job forthe weak, nor one for someone who would seek to appease Hong Kong'snew sovereign.Conciliation is generally much to be preferred to confrontation atsuch a sensitive time and it is in everyone's interest that weabandon the short-sighted discord that has been an unfortunatefeature of so much of the transition.But the CE must also be prepared to stand up and be counted upon bythe people of Hong Kong to defend the valid interests of the SARwithin China. He must be someone who is well-versed in the BasicLaw and is adequately prepared to maintain the rule of law thatunderpins the territory's prosperity.Simon Li has enjoyed a respected career in the legal profession,ending up with his appointment as Vice-President of the Court ofAppeals in 1984 before his retirement in 1987. He maintains adirectorship of the Bank of East Asia, in which his family hasinterests. However, while some of his activities post-retirementhave focused on community involvements such as the Society forHomes for the Handicapped, educational matters and his honorarystewardship of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, much of his energyhas been devoted to working for a successful transition.Beginning in 1985 with his appointment to the Basic Law DraftingCommittee, and more recently with his heavy involvement with thePreparatory Committee, of which he is a Deputy-Director, Li hasdeveloped an intimate knowledge of the details of transition.He evidently enjoys the respect of and a personal relationship withsenior leaders. But he brings to his candidacy something arguablymore important: a detailed understanding of Hong Kong's legalsystem and the Basic Law, and an irreproachable reputation as ajudge.On a personal note, within his own family he has a lawyer son inLondon and another son who is an international news editor with theLos Angeles Time. His daughter, as head of the Bar Association, isboth respected and a well-known critic of some of Beijing'sactions. Nobody could accuse Simon Li of being out of touch withsceptics both within and outside Hong Kong.All those who have put themselves forward for scrutiny in thisunprecedented process deserve our respect. There are those whoargue that, as a financial centre, a businessmen should be thefirst CE. We would argue that at this delicate point in Hong Kong'shistory, there are strong arguments for favouring an experiencedand well-respected legal figure.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996COMMENTARY: SPECULATOR'S DIARY: An Ode to the Market from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By PUNDIT, P.61ARE you a bull or are you a bear?/ Bet against Hong Kong only ifyou dare./ 1997 is the year when greed does battle over fear./ Thevoice of the bear growls but a thought: /Sell this market, it's fartoo overbought!/ 1997 marks Hong Kong's demise./ Under China'srule, should this come as a surprise?/ The voice of the bullreplies in disdain:/ "Listen investor, there is much more togain."/ 1997 is the Gala Ball's start - Hong Kong's celebration -you must buy to take part!/ So, are you a bull or are you a bear?/1997 - We are almost there.Bethany Chan, Worldsec InternationalUNANIMITY of opinion is the biggest single danger for investors.Let enough people say there are too few hotel rooms in Bali, orthat there is a glut of oil in the world, and you can be sure thatglum Indonesian hoteliers will soon be slashing room rates, andairline profits will nose-dive on the soaring cost of aviationfuel.The commodity everybody tips to be in short supply is shares inHong Kong companies. Pundit's friend Fergy the fund manager says:"We are all throwing money at the place. Interest rates are stable,profits will soon jump, politics look great, the dollar is fine. IfWall Street goes up that is good, if it goes down, that is alsogood - more US money will come here. If you absolutely put my feetto the fire, I might risk a few bob in Malaysia, otherwise this isthe spot. Can't think why I didn't buy when it was cheap."For every buyer there is a seller. Carlton Poon and his researchteam at Worldsec International have just carried out a realitycheck on the Hong Kong bourse as the Hang Seng Index hovers around12,500. They summarize the sell case thus: By historic standards the market is not cheap selling at around 14times earnings.The p/e discount relative to other regional markets has narrowed,and the risk-reward balance has become unfavourable in view of theuncertainties that prevail. Valuations here are stretched and profits growth will not be fastenough to underwrite current prices. Earnings quality could welldeteriorate and earnings per share are vulnerable to equity-fundraising. Wild cards that could trigger a catastrophic fall in the marketinclude speculation against the Hong Kong dollar, China's reactionsto any demonstrations against the government in Hong Kong,corruption and breakdown of the legal system, large-scale illegalimmigration from China, Loss of competitiveness, due to most expensive property prices inthe world. Labour costs high and skilled workers in short supply.Ports losing business to China and elsewhere and territory'sposition as a financial centre under threat from Singapore andeventually Taipei and Shanghai.Worldsec ticks off the buy case: The market is cheap because the political discount imposed byMargaret Thatcher's 1983 visit to Beijing will narrow or disappear.That paves the way for an upwards re-rating of the market closer tothe valuation of other Asian markets; Hong Kong economic growth is expected to accelerate in 1997 aidedby a recovery in spending. The momentum will be maintained anupturn in the China economy; Potential reward outweighs the risks of investing in the PRC. HongKong was midwife to the emergence of China in the world economy andwill play an important and profitable future role in nurturinggrowth; Structural change in the territory from manufacturing base toservice centre is a major plus.Worldsec has been consistently positive on Hong Kong equities. InJuly 1995 it was the first broker to forecast 20,000 for the HangSeng Index. The house remains bullish, particularly on thepolitical re-rating argument. It has fed the bull and bear factorsinto a model which produces a Hang Seng Index down to 9,054 at theend of 1997 on a worst-case scenario and throws up a best-casetarget of 16,847 over the same time frame.We are taking a modest punt in the shares of Asia Securities. Thecompany was at one time under the stewardship of Australian tycoonBill Wyllie and the Lau Brothers. It is now China controlled andhas a major stake in a number of Beijing real-estate projects. Oneof these is very close to the Imperial Palace and is planned as theheart of the Beijing financial district. The project is 60 per centowned by Asia Securities and 40 per cent by Beijing Huayan which isin turn controlled by upcoming IPO China Resources Beijing Land.

He noted that he was educated to primary sixin China and had only one-year English schooling in Hong Kong.This is not the first time Leung seems to have received bad advice.Leung and Madam Butt were discovered to have carried out improperdealings in Yanion through an offshore vehicle back at the time ofthe public listing in 1991. SFC investigators found that a shellcompany in the British Virgin Islands had been used to funnel $108million for initial subscription and $31.5 million for sharetrading to support the price in the first few days after theflotation. This activity helped conceal the fact that less than thestatutory 25 per cent of Yanion's capital was in the hands ofgenuine minority shareholders.Yanion was one of half a dozen companies named in the scandalinvolving the Standard Chartered Asia investment bank. It was foundthat the then stockbroking arm of Standard Chartered had advancedsubstantial sums of money to major shareholders and their nomineesin companies going public. The facilities were used to artificiallyinflate the oversubscription level and to manipulate the market inthe shares when they commenced trading.Leung and his sister-in-law, along with another director Leung Tai-shing, were publicly censured by the stock exchange in December1994 for the 1991 dealings. It would appear that Leung has beenskating on thin ice for some time.There are those who would put a political spin on the mitigationargument put forward in the Yanion case. I do not see it that way.Certainly his counsel gilded the lily by suggesting his client was"revered" in China. But he was entitled to raise Leung's positionin the business community and the fact that he is apparently asubstantial employer. Since the majority of Hong Kong companieshave investments in the PRC, and cross-border commercialtransactions have become the norm, insider dealing cases are aslikely to have a China connection than not. Politics areirrelevant.In fact a case has just started in which it is alleged thatTaiwanese businessman Hwang Chou-shiuan bought shares in theParkview property group in Hong Kong in the hope of making a profitfrom his knowledge that China International United Petroleum andChemical Co was buying a big chunk of the company.The tribunal will hand down its penalty decision in the Yanionmatter next week. Leung faces having to cough up some $4.35 million- three times the amount of the loss he was judged to have avoidedby dumping shares. Imposition of the maximum five-year embargo frombeing a company director would put him in the same category asmaestro fraudster George Tan. That might be a bit over the top.I have no idea how prevalent insider dealing is on China's domesticstock markets. What I do know is that Beijing securities regulatorstake a very dim view of the practice. When they eventually codifynational laws for malpractice, the penalties are likely to besevere. Hong Kong share manipulators might well have cause tocongratulate themselves that their transgressions are dealt with onthis side of the border.WE HAVE not heard much lately about the mooted second board forsmall companies in Hong Kong. The perhaps more innovative KualaLumpur exchange hung out its shingle for speculative companies,capitalized as small as US$2 million, nearly three years ago. TheKLSE second board index has doubled to 620 this year and tripledsince 1994.Jardine Fleming tut-tuts over this in its latest unit trustnewsletter and describes the speculative little market as a "deathtrap." That is perhaps going a bit far. The relatively meaninglessprice/earnings ratio stands at 420, and recent Bank Negra action toraise deposit levels for margin trading will no doubt hose thingsdown.Jardine Fleming says "highly unprofitable" small Malaysiancompanies have raised $1 billion on the "rumour-led" market thisyear. No doubt many of these companies will disappear up theSwanee, and the management of some may be probity-challenged.At least the little bourse provides a venture capital avenuesomewhat lacking in Hong Kong. The banks here would require yourfirst-born child as collateral before lending money to back a smartidea. The stock exchange requires a three-year profit track recordfrom IPOs, and it only seems to grant a waiver to Chinainfrastructure companies. Knocking on the door of the Nasdaq marketin the US is not yet a proven route to riches for Hong Kongplayers.That leaves the extended Chinese family as the source for raisingcapital for a new business - if Uncle Chan-wah is tapped out thisyear, tough luck.Not withstanding all this, I find it hard to support the notion ofa nursery for corporate toddlers in the territory. Having seen whatthe manipulators can do with the first board, the blood runs coldimagining what they might do with a second.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: CATERING: Harry Ramsden's May Bring Batter toBeijing: Move into China mooted for chippie group from WINDOW, October 25, 1996From PETER MOSLEY in London, P.57-58ENCOURAGED by the success of its Hong Kong restaurant, HarryRamsden's, the up-market fish-and-chips group, is planning toexpand into China next year.Executive Chairman John Barnes says he is looking to open two orthree outlets there within two years and is considering Beijing,Shanghai and Guangzhou."Next year seems a marvellous time to expand out of Hong Kong intoChina," he says.Window has also learned that Harry Ramsden's has put in a bid for arestaurant site at Chep Lap Kok airport, which it will operate as ajoint venture. This would be its second Hong Kong restaurant,building on the success of the first one in Queen's Road East,which is one of the most profitable in the group.Its partner would probably be Compass Group, with which it alreadyoperates a Harry Ramsden's at Heathrow airport, London.Details of the proposed move into China are still being worked out,says a spokesman for the group. They form part of an outsidefeasibility study now nearing completion for a broad expansion athome and abroad, heady stuff for a group that has grown from a dourback street in a Yorkshire town to see its shares riding high onthe London Stock Exchange.For Barnes, it just goes to show that what used to be thought of asa very British acquired taste can tickle palates around the world.He is sure that fish-and-chips will soon be as international ashamburgers, pizza or sweet-and-sour pork.Barnes is untroubled by any fears that Chinese officialdom mightview the advance of a British fish-and-chips chain as gastronomicneo-colonialism, and put up obstacles."The Chinese love Western brand names," he says.Besides that, Chinese diners rather like a touch of opulence - andHarry Ramsden's, its trademark chandeliers, white tablecloths andwaiters belying the traditionally working-class fare of fish-and-chips, is certainly posh, if not opulent."The restaurant in Hong Kong has been a huge success and it islogical that we should capitalize on that," says Barnes.At first, most of the customers in Hong Kong were expatriates.These days, though, Chinese customers outnumber them three-to-one,even though the menu holds only one rice dish.New dish: Although fish-and chips is generally ranked with roastbeef and Yorkshire pudding as a classic British national dish thecombination is, in fact, relatively new.Fried fish appears to have made its public debut as a conveniencefood back in the London of the 1830s, at about the same time QueenVictoria ascended the throne and the British Empire was stretchingits muscles around the world.But according to Frying Tonight, a history of fish and chips, whoseunlikely author was the late BBC Religious Affairs correspondentGerald Priestland, chips did not appear until 50 years later whenBritain started importing deep-fryers from France.For long years after that, until 1940, the throat-catching odourfrom corner fish-and-chip shops, or "chippies" - also known in theNorth of England as "chip oils" - caused their operation to beofficially designated "an offensive trade," along with blood-boilers and gut-scrapers, respectively selling black sausage andtripe-and-onions.The pungent pong arose from undeodorized fats and cooking oilsbubbling away at often dangerously high temperatures (fish is bestdeep-fried in beef dripping at about 200 C; the dripping catchesfire at 225 C.)To stop the fish becoming fat-soaked it is first dipped in batter,which also enhances the flavour and texture. Some fish-and-chipshops claim to use special secret-ingredient batters like ColonelSanders' Kentucky Fried Chicken recipe.Others, like Harry Ramsden's, put it all down to the freshness ofthe fish and the quality of the potatoes.British officialdom's disdain for fish-and-chips was abandoned atthe start of World War II when it was realized that here was awholesome, high-energy and relatively cheap dish, using localresources and very suitable for consumption by a workforce whosegeneral health was vital to the success of the war effort.Popular: The munching masses, anyway, had always ignored suchquestions of image and continued to queue nightly to buy fish-and-chips, smothered in salt and vinegar to kill the grease and wrappedunhygienically in smudgy old newspaper.This wrapping practice is a thing of the past since Britain enteredthe squeaky-clean European Union. The bureaucrats in Brussels threwup their hands (or maybe just threw up) at the idea of anyoneeating cod coated in printer's ink.These days, many fish-and-chips shops in Britain are run by ethnicminorities, including Chinese. The product is as popular as everdespite its high calorie-count and the challenges of hamburgers,fried chicken, Indian and Chinese foods, and pizza outlets whichhave gobbled up large chunks of the mass market.Few of today's "chippies" fry in the traditional beef dripping -vegetable oil is cheaper and easier to manage, even though it lacksthe flavour.But Harry Ramsden's has stuck with beef dripping. With fears of BSE("mad cow disease") crossing from the bovine to the humanpopulation, however, it has started importing dripping from Irelandand Holland.Harry Ramden's first restaurant opened in a back street ofGuiseley, near Leeds in Yorkshire, in 1929 and down the yearsbecame a Mecca for lovers of succulent, fresh fish-and-chips.On Saturday nights after the pubs closed Harry Ramsden would stillbe frying well past midnight.Today Harry's son, also Harry, aged 72, is a only a shareholder butacts as a "travelling ambassador" for the group, which has 15restaurants in major British cities. The notable and frustratingexception is London; each time they find the right site in thecapital, someone else comes along and grabs it first.Hong Kong is not the only overseas outlet. There are Harry Ramden'sin Tenerife, Dublin and Melbourne, too, all places that can boast aBritish community or heritage.Barnes thinks he might open 25 new restaurants in Britain by 2001,possibly as franchises but with the group holding at least a 50 percent stake.He is also contemplating sites in the Middle East, includingJeddah, and would like to move into South Africa and New Zealand.It was the brave flotation on the London Stock Exchange in 1989that provided the funding and impetus for Harry Ramden's expansion.It also won huge publicity for the group - which still had only oneshop at the time but was thinking big.Since then, turnover and profits have risen on average by 20 percent a year.This week shares in Harry Ramsden, launched at 100 pence (HK$12.34)seven years ago, were trading at 375p after a high of 438p earlierin the year. Market capitalization has risen from 4 million atlaunch to more than 40 million.Much of the success is down to (Michael) John Barnes, a man intotal contrast to the firm's late founder. At 47, and with a smileas broad and gleaming as Labour leader Tony Blair's, he is the verymodel of a modern chief executive.When he took over Harry Ramsden's in 1988 via a new start-upcompany, Barnes already had experience as a brand manager withProcter and Gamble and had also worked for International Playtexand PepsiCo and as managing director of the British end of KentuckyFried Chicken.He has now led the company through seven years of consistentearnings and earnings-per-share growth under the banner "TheWorld's Most Famous Fish and Chips." All has not been entirelyrosy, however.Demand for fish-and-chips tends to be seasonal and was hit by thehot summer in the UK last year, while margins in associated joint-venture companies were trimmed by sharp increases in potato prices.But the group has ventured out into instant fish-and-chip productssold in supermarkets, and a joint venture to create a chain offish-and-chip takeaways under the Henry Higgins brand.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: REGION: Exports Stifled by World-Wide Malaise:US slowdown affects Asian foreign trade from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By SUSAN FENTON, P.54-55JAPANESE Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's re-election triumph onSunday may provide a much-needed boost for neighbouring Asianexporters.While the Liberal Democratic Party's tenuous majority initiallyprompted a slide in the Japanese yen, some analysts see greaterpolitical stability paving the way for sustainable economicrecovery in Japan that will boost demand for Asian goods andstrengthen the Japanese currency.The yen has fallen 30 per cent in real terms against the US dollarin the 12 months to June, making cheaper Japanese goods morecompetitive vis-a-vis other Asian exports and exacerbating a slumpin the region's export performance since the start of the year."The year-over-year impact of depreciation has already started tomoderate and should reverse with yen strengthening expected in1997," says Richard Ligon, an economist at UBS Securities. Apossible spending spree by Japanese consumers ahead of a plannedincrease in sales tax from three per cent to five per cent in Aprilcould also boost business for regional exporters.The need: They certainly need it. After a boom year in 1995 thatsaw nominal export growth exceed 20 per cent in most East andSoutheast Asian countries the same countries face single-digitgrowth this year. South Korea, for example, will have to adjustfrom 30 per cent export growth last year to 7.5 per cent this year,to US$134.5 billion, recovering slightly to nine per cent in 1997,predicts brokerage ING Barings."East Asia's surprisingly rapid deceleration of non-oil exportgrowth in recent months has exposed the region's continuedvulnerability to global supply/demand imbalances," says Ligon. Hedoesn't foresee a real improvement until next year - helped byaccelerated growth in Europe - and then only a moderate one. "Abetter picture will emerge in the second quarter of next year," hesays. "There will be a recovery, yes, but not a boom like thelevels seen in 1995."Hindering a significant improvement in the short term is acontinued downturn in the electronics sector and recent data fromthe US pointing to slower-than-expected growth in the US economy."The US remains the critical factor for a regional upturn in exportgrowth," says Barings in a report. Recent data is in line withanalysts estimates that US economic growth slowed to around two percent in the third quarter, down from 4.7 per cent in the secondquarter.Barings, however, points out that there are already signs thatinventory stockpiles in the US, which have curbed import demand,are now being depleted and renewed orders for manufacturing goodswill prompt a pick-up in imports in the final quarter of this year."The notable exception remains the electronics sector, which isstill undergoing consolidation and is not expected to see a markedrecovery until at least the first half of 1997," says thebrokerage.While this is bad news for the region as a whole, Singapore, whichdepends on electronics for 51 per cent of its non-oil exports, andSouth Korea, where the sector accounts for 35 per cent of exports,stand to suffer most. "Singapore and Korea have been hard hit bythe downturn in the electronics cycle and that will continue for afew quarters," says George Leung, economic adviser at HSBC Markets.Singapore's non-oil exports slid an unexpectedly high 6.2 per centyear-on-year in nominal terms in September to S$7.31 billion,following a 6.3 per cent drop in August.Korea, which is also hardest hit by a weak yen, saw its exportsfall 8.1 per cent year-on-year in September, to US$10.1 billion.HSBC Markets, however, says that new measures introduced by theFinance Ministry to help cut manufacturing production costs,including slashing domestic steel prices and reducing prices ofgovernment land for factories, should in the longer term help makeexports more competitive.The impact of the downturn in the electronics sector, largely theresult of excess inventory build-up in the US, is now being felt byMalaysia as easing demand spreads beyond D-RAM prices toperipherals and related industries.The electronic components industry, much of it shifted from highercost Singapore, generates 27 per cent of Malaysia's non-oil exportsand has helped it consistently achieve export growth of between 17and 26 per cent over the past three years. The slowdown this year,will result in a meagre 9.1 per cent increase in Malaysian exports,to $80.8 billion, and 10.5 per cent next year.Good for some: In contrast, the outlook for the Philippines ispromising. Analysts generally agree that it is set to produce thestrongest export performance in Southeast Asia this year, on 15.8per cent growth to $20.1 billion according to Barings, and in 1997,on 16 per cent growth. "As the Philippines produces very low-techproducts such as consumer electronics like television sets andradios, it suffers little impact from a downturn in the cycle,"says Leung. Growth rates are still well down from last year's peakof 29 per cent, though, partly because of year-on-year declines insales of traditional exports like textiles, coconut oil andfootwear.The only other country in the region expected to post double-digitexport growth this year is Indonesia, with Barings forecasting an11.4 per cent increase in exports to $50.6 billion.Indonesia is something of the odd-one-out among East and SoutheastAsian nations, as the only one not to enjoy an export boom lastyear nor suffer a slump this year - mainly because its exports areraw materials, making it less exposed to the global business cycle."In that sense, Indonesia's backwardness has been a help," saysDominique Maire of UBS Securities in Singapore.If that is the case, does it follow that as Asian nations aremoving into increasingly sophisticated areas of manufacturing,export growth of 25-30 per cent a year is a thing of the past?Not necessarily, says Ligon. "The era of export-led growth in EastAsia is not over, but it is changing," he says.Increasing competition from lower-cost countries means erstwhilesources of cheap labour like Thailand and Indonesia are having toshift to producing higher value-added goods in the way that HongKong and Singapore did before them. But that is not automaticallydepressing their export performance. Indonesia, which has startedto reduce its dependence on textiles and plywood by producing rawmaterial-based but value-added products, is enjoying a mini boom,doubling sales of paper products this year and increasing exportsof industrial chemicals by more than 50 per cent and glass andceramics by more than 20 per cent. The Malaysian Government ispromoting investment in the more cyclical hi-tech sector.Thailand, however, has yet to make the switch. "The most worryingcountry is Thailand," says Maire. "It has had the worst exportslump and requires investment in higher-value added productsbecause it is losing its lower cost competitiveness." HSBC Marketsadds that it also needs to invest in human resources, includingcomprehensive training programmes, to boost export competitiveness."The government has also pledged that it will focus on enhancingThailand's export competitiveness by cutting tariffs for importsand on raw materials for export-oriented products," says HSBC."It will, however, take a long time before these measures come intoeffect." Barings seesThai export growth plunging to a meagre 5.2 per cent this year, to$58.4 billion, from 23.6 per cent last year."Until evidence of an export turnaround is apparent, Thailand willremain the lacklustre story of Asean," says Barings. Aseancomprises Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.Like its neighbours, however, Thailand still stands to benefit fromrapidly expanding demand for exports from within Asia itself. "Themanufacturing boom owes much to Japanese investment, which hasfacilitated the growth of intra-regional trade," says Ligon.He notes that intra-Asean trade, for example, accounted for about afifth of Southeast Asian exports over the past three years, butcontributed more than a quarter of total growth.Last year's export peak and this year's slump were both cyclical,triggered by weak global demand, says Ligon. "Strong foreign directinvestment flows supporting manufacturing growth have not subsided,and export growth is now coming chiefly from within the Asianregion," he says."These factors will provide a substantial cushion to Asianexporters as they contend with rising costs and new competition."Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: TAXATION: Tax Reforms Take Toll On PRCCompanies: Revenue men get more efficient from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By TIM WILSON, P.53THEY were down but never out, and now they are clawing their wayback. China's central tax returns have been rising consistentlysince the tax system underwent a major revamp in 1994. No more thewilting remittances that shrank the tax revenue from 35 per cent ofGDP in 1979 to 15 per cent in 1993. Last week the centralgovernment released the figures for the industrial and commercialreceipts for the first nine months of this year. They are up again- by 20 per cent. And this comes at a time when the economy issupposed to have slowed down.According to the figures, 249.8 billion yuan went into centralgovernment coffers for the period from January to September - ayear-on-year rise of 19.6 per cent. And local governments raised203.1 billion, 22.9 per cent more than this time last year.Although the Chinese economy has grown at a rate only slightlybelow this, the increase, say analysts, is largely attributable tothe reforms of two years ago - and it is a measure of theirsuccess. "Since 1994, the policy framework has been set," says QuHong Bing of UBS Securities, "but in terms of implementation, it'sa gradual process." The effects of this mean different things todifferent people.Networking: The process has involved the setting up of a nationaltax collection network. Prior to the reform, provinces submittedtax, which they collected, on a contractual basis. Since then, thevarious taxes, and the responsibility for collecting them, havebeen divided up between local and national collection agencies. Toachieve this, local bureaus were effectively split in half toaccommodate the new national ones. It is a change which presentedmany logistical difficulties, not least of which was the job ofrecruiting and training a large intake of staff. This took time, ashas the task of delineating more clearly the roles of the nationaland local bureaus.But the reforms are taking hold. Add to this the fact that thegovernment has been taking serious steps to chase up tax evadersand to put an end to the contractual arrangements that have tendedto operate between individual companies and local tax bureaus, andyou have a situation where the fiscal net is noticeably tightening.The central government will be gratified to have rationalized thetax system, and to have ensured itself a more reliable source ofincome with which to make a dent in the budget deficit, which camein at 66 billion yuan last year. There is still the nagging problemof intergovernmental transfers, however, which means that thecentre is obliged to give up the bulk of its receipts to subsidizepoorer provinces. But overall the indicators are favourable.Nonetheless, if central and local governments are increasing theirrevenue, it does mean that somebody else is paying the price.Although China's tax regime has been and remains low ininternational terms, companies in the country have been findingthemselves saddled with new and larger bills. Firms are gettingaway with less, and this has had its own effects.For local companies, says Chen Xingdong of Crosby Securities, itwas a contributing factor in this year's poor interim results."These were awful," he says, "and it is true to say that the taxincrease has been greater than economic growth. And you can add tothis that VAT is a turnover tax, not a profit tax. They pay VAT aslong as they make the product. These enterprises that are unable tosell, still have to pay the tax." VAT was one of the cornerstonesof the reform. Nevertheless, penalizing overproducers is notnecessarily a bad thing.Foreign woes: Foreign-invested enterprises are also getting caughtin the net. Many of them, says Tsang Shu-ki of Hong Kong's BaptistUniversity, were in the habit of bargaining for a lump sum taxsubmission on a contractual basis. "They are under pressure toeliminate that practice, and I know that some FIEs are complaining.I hear that in the Pearl River Delta life is much more difficult."And in general terms, the FIEs will be contributing an increasingproportion to government coffers, not only because the collectionprocess is being revamped. The drop in the rate of VAT refund forexporters - it stood at 17 per cent in the middle of last year andnow stands at nine - would not feature on these tax returnsannounced by the government, for the simple reason that itqualifies as an expenditure. Nor, as yet, will the ending of duty-free machinery imports, which does not really take effect until thegrace period ends in December of this year. But both of these willhave significant consequences both for government revenue andcompany burdens.A recent report by the Economist Intelligence Unit argued thatthese new measures were also playing a big role in keeping propertyprices down. The higher costs of doing business lower net operatingincomes and hence market values. And this phenomenon is worsened bythe government's success at controlling inflation, to the pointwhere the cost of credit in the country has actually enteredpositive territory.So you have the ironic situation where improving macroeconomic andbudgetary controls - both positive signs - are actually depressingthe property market and stopping investors in their tracks. Thegovernment urgently needs to increase revenue, but companies inChina could do without the uncertainty this brings.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: PROFILE: Strategic Advances in FinancialMarketing: Richard Tsang outlines new firm's role from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By CATHY HOLCOMBE, P.52CREATIVE and outgoing, fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English,PR operative Richard Tsang represents the ideal local manager forinternational firms.In an age when such firms are increasingly dependent on thecultural and language skills of native executives, he alsorepresents their worst fears. For like many local directors wholearned the ropes in industries dominated by multinationals, hebroke away to found his own firm.After building up Edelman Public Relations financial relationsteam, Tsang left 15 months ago to form Strategic FinancialRelations Ltd, taking two senior account executives with him.Strategic is one of four companies in a group representing a new,homegrown force in political and media relations: the three othersare run respectively by politico C.K. Lo; radio personality AndyHo; and former Burson-Marsteller director Sam Lam, who merged withWendy Hughes to form a China relations counselling group.Tsang took several senior account managers with him when he leftEdelman, but he did not storm off with a load of clients in tow."We only had three or four clients when we started," he says.Following: Some of his clients have since trailed him, while othersturned to his custom-tailored services to handle new listings.Besides special projects work, these days Strategic has 17 retainerclients, mostly small and medium-sized companies that count onTsang's team to do everything from clipping newspaper articles towriting annual reports, to arranging road shows or media tours.The most important role Tsang plays is in making sure his clientshave investor followings.If you're not a blue chip, it can be hard to get attention in HongKong's family of nearly 500 listed companies. All his clients,whether they've seen their share price fall or rise in the lastyear, have healthy followings by local brokerage houses. Two ofthem, leather trader Dah Hwa Holdings and plastics maker Ngai HingHong, enjoyed share price growth of more than 500 per cent lastyear."We don't tell people how to invest. We help people meet," theenergetic Tsang explains from his sunny office in Admiralty Centre."For low-profile, smaller companies, they may not know how to findthe fund managers and  analysts."He points to the example of tissue paper maker Dransfield. Analystshad a hard time getting too excited about the company that makestissue on behalf of Tempo, those packets snatched up for just over$2 at any newsstand or kiosk.But the company had plans to create its own brand. Tsang putexecutives in touch with analysts who decided such a move was worthfunding and a Nasdaq placement was made, raising money as well asexciting movement in the company's shares."You've got to feed [analysts] as much information as possible,"explains Tsang. "And get them out for visits whenever possible."Lively and loquacious, there are few subjects Tsang will not holdcourt on. He is bashful in one area, however. Asked his age, Tsangpauses before revealing the figure with a shy laugh: he is 30 yearsold, a fact generally greeted with gasps of surprise."People guess I'm something like 38," Tsang says. "I remember allthose nights I never left the office until midnight. I say even if[chronologically] I'm 30, I'm equal to a 38-year-old in workyears."Tsang is the epitome of a generation which came of age at a timewhen the price tag for the skills of locals began to match and thenovertake demand for expatriate talent.He moved quickly up the career ladder at Burson-Marsteller, hissecond place of employment after earning a communications degreefrom the Chinese University, and later held a lead position atEdelman.A little serendipity also didn't hurt his advancement. When Tsangwas first transferred to Burson-Marsteller's financial relationsteam in 1990, the ho-hum department had few business-specialistmedia or even brokerages to whom it could disseminate companyprofiles. But within three years IPO fever had gripped the localbourse, brokerages were flooding the territory and local paperswere spawning expanded financial sections.Today he has a data base of between 2,000 and 3,000 brokers,bankers and media contacts. Most of his senior account executivescome not from a PR background, but from brokerages and banks.Tsang waves away suggestions that breakaways by crucial localexecutives are international firms' worst nightmares these days."It's not like the whole company left with me," he says. He simplyfound his own little niche.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: INVESTMENT: China Tops Survey of Best EmergingMarkets: Asia heads money-spinning opportunities from WINDOW, October 25, 1996From CHRIS JASPER in London, P.50-51A MAJOR new survey into investment opportunities in emergingmarkets world-wide has rated China as the most attractive ofdeveloping economies, with others Asian countries judged to beamong the best of the rest.The report suggests that more than three-quarters of companies withinternational operations are now investing in emerging markets asthey compete to make the most of liberal trade policies adoptedfollowing the demise of state-controlled economies.But though it evaluates where the greatest rewards are to be had,the study from Control Risks Group, an international political andbusiness risk consultancy, also highlights the problems andconcerns facing investors.Based on 100 telephone interviews with managers specificallyresponsible for their company's overseas operations, the surveycovers 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and easternEurope.Leading: Asia dominates the report's top 10, with China heading theleague on a score of 7.2 out of 10 - the rating being an expressionof both the opportunities on offer and the pros and cons of theoperating environment.Not that investment in China is a bed of roses, says the report,suggesting that worries over the eventual succession to DengXiaoping prompt concern about the time frame within which themainland will justify expectations.The study also details worries about the Chinese legal system,corruption, intellectual copyright, counterfeiting, theft, break-ins and whether rural areas will fulfill their potential.Yet despite the hitches, China has one unbeatable advantage: sheermarket size. With 1.2 billion inhabitants, it emerges as way aheadof the pack in offering the most exciting opportunities forbusiness expansion."China's scale alone justifies the number-one spot," says BorisStarling of CRG's business development department. "And were it notfor reasonably high risks, it could have scored a perfect 10."Rating some distance behind China are three more Asian countries.Malaysia ranks second in the survey because of confidence in its"stable and focused political institutions" - although growth hasslowed and the economy remains  relatively small.Third is Indonesia, with investors wowed by an impressive growthrecord. CRG experts, however, express "concerns over the nextpolitical succession" in a country where "politics and businesshave been traditionally intertwined."Next comes India, scoring points for its huge market potential andongoing transition to an open economy. Only continuing worries overbureaucracy and infrastructure and the fact that it starts from alower base prevent India from ranking higher.Thailand ranks sixth, "current political wobbles" not having dimmedconfidence, according to the report, although concern over wagerates, skills and infrastructure could see some investors shift toVietnam.Punctuating Asia's dominance of the top 10 are Brazil in fifth,strong on communications, energy, infrastructure and the extractivesector, and eastern Europe's two brightest prospects - the CzechRepublic (joint sixth and well on course for convergence with theEU) and Poland, placed eighth despite the rise of neo-communism.South Africa, where economic success has outlived initial euphoriaover Nelson Mandela's coming to power, stands alone in ninth, withArgentina, Chile and the Gulf States all tied in 10th.The most notable absentee from the upper reaches of the list isRussia, rating only 20th, partly because of problems with organizedcrime, inadequate legislation and political instability, but mainlybecause of an overall failure to "turn potential into concretecommitments."However, Boris Yeltsin's re-election convinced 62 per cent ofrespondents that opportunities would increase over the next fiveyears, although India rates top in this respect with fully 81 percent expecting an improvement.Other Asian countries were among those which, like Russia, ratednot so highly, but were expected to offer more in the future -predictions not always endorsed by CRG.The authorities in Vietnam will currently allow investment only ontheir terms, and the situation is likely to prevail, yet 67 percent of those polled thought prospects would improve, especially ininfrastructure and energy.Burma, according to 11 per cent of respondents, will also showimprovements, but CRG warns against over-optimism. It suggests that"blindness to the political consequences" of operating there couldleave companies open to "consumer boycotts and even lawsuits."For Cambodia, 39 per cent of investors predicted better prospectsin five years' time, prompting CRG to caution that "there is littleevidence to suggest" it "will emerge as a productive businessenvironment."Asian economics apart, respondents rated the Baltic states (53 percent) and some parts of the former Yugoslavia (38 per cent) as thepoor performers most likely to show improved opportunities.The CRG's ratings and predictions are based on a survey carried outon its behalf by the Industrial Research Bureau in June. The IRBchose, at random, 100 of the 500 biggest companies with a presencein Britain and operating internationally.Sectors covered included aerospace, brewing, chemicals,commodities, communications, construction, electricity,engineering, food manufacturing, health, hotels, insurance, media,metals, mines, paper, tobacco, transport and water.Managers completed questionnaires asking them to rate the emergingmarkets in which they operated in terms of opportunities andprospects, fears and concerns, trade barriers, local partners andother factors.CRG collated the results, analyzed and evaluated them. Theresultant report, it says, is relevant to any business - Western orotherwise - which has dealings in emerging markets.Says Starling: "Our conclusions are based on the experiences ofBritish companies, but the rules apply across the board. I expectthe findings will be studied especially hard by people in eastAsia, who are always very careful."The country rankings apart, the report's real value is likely to bein pointing out the problems faced by those investing in developingeconomics - and in evaluating whether common fears are real ormisplaced.CRG head of research David Battman cites the main challenges tosuch companies as "adjusting to often ambiguous business andpolitical environments, and combating problems of corruption andorganized criminal activity."According to the survey, the greatest concerns of respondents arepolitical stability and the security situation. But CRG claims thatthe security threat is often overestimated and "can be managed,"whereas the degree of political instability is "crucial."Environmental and democracy issues are regarded as much lowerconcerns, but this, says CRG, underestimates their importance, asthey can lead to global repercussions such as boycotts andinsurance withdrawals.The report also reveals that two-thirds of investors favour a localpartnership, but that at least 37 per cent experience some kind ofserious problem with their newly established joint venture.In Guangdong, for example, it claims that foreign executives "arefar more concerned by possible 'official' abduction on behalf of apowerful local partner than by the greatly exaggerated threat ofkidnap by common criminals."However, CRG asserts that though businesses are right to worryabout fraudulent activity and criminal connections when selectingpartners, they should pay more attention to their politicalconnections.This was highlighted recently in Russia, it says, when a number ofcompanies found that their local associates went Awol as theyjockeyed for patronage prior to June's presidential elections.On top: Control Risks is, though, keen to stress that it regardsfew problems as insurmountable."Some surveys just look at potential," says Starling. "That meansthat people get paranoid when problems emerge. But we try toevaluate both risk and opportunity - and we are able to help whenthings go wrong."CRG's 3,500 clients in more than 130 countries can draw on any ofits four main divisions: political and security risk analysis,which compiled the report; confidential investigation, handlingproblems including fraud; security consultancy, which providesadvice and, if necessary, men on the ground; and crisis response,which helps firms cope with emergencies such as kidnap andextortion.The latter role betrays CRG's origins: its original incarnation wasas an adjunct to the corporate kidnap and ransom insurance policyat Lloyd's of London. From that four-man operation it has expandedto 160 staff in 11 offices world-wide.The ending of the Cold War and collapse of old power blocs hashastened CRG's rise, with companies presented with newopportunities and new dangers - although Starling argues that theproblems of dealing with developing nations have been exaggerated."People seem to think that things are more dangerous than they usedto be," he says. "But that's not necessarily the case. Very oftenyou're talking about dangers in countries where a few years agoopportunities did not exist al all."Control Risk is, for example, aiding several businesses in Algeria,which some consider perilous, while only Bosnia and Afghanistanhave ever been declared unsafe, and then solely in times of war."North Korea is perhaps the last closed state in terms ofpolitics," adds Starling. "And people are even trying to go there."Ironically, while CRG finds that investors often magnify problemsencountered on the ground, it concludes that they are oftenalarmingly blind to bigger threats."The world is wide open at the moment," says Starling. "But thereis nothing to say that it won't close up somewhat again in thefuture. We're already seeing the return of communist regimes insome areas, but businessmen seem to think that the clock can neverturn back."He adds: "Neither will companies from developed countries have itall their own way for long. There are going to be big firms from,for example, Russia, China and Brazil coming along, and they won'tbe subject to the same constraints as today's investors."Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: TECHNOLOGY: Taking the Hi-tech Road: Governmentcentre nurtures real-time IT research from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By BRIAN TRUSCOTT, P.48-49FINATECH Ltd - a self-described financial engineering and riskmanagement company pushing the envelope on real-time informationtechnology - could be considered one of Hong Kong's showcaseefforts to create what many believe is a much-needed but under-developed, hi-tech sector.The consensus is that Hong Kong has succeeded in making the decade-long transition from a manufacturing base to a service-orientedcentre; services now comprise 83 per cent of gross domesticproduct, while manufacturing has shrunk to 9.3 per cent this yearfrom 20 per cent of GDP just five years ago.A key player in this transition has been the financial sector,although people employed in wholesale/import and export stilldominate the sector; finance and insurance make up only  about 19per cent of Hong Kong's total services industry.Nevertheless, if a company such as FinaTech can be given thefiscal, managerial and networking wherewithal, then perhaps HongKong can be successful in launching some semblance of a sectordependent on hi-tech R&D.Second centre: The 235,000 sq ft Hong Kong Industrial TechnologyCentre, which the government built in 1994 in Kowloon Tong for $250million, is the forerunner of what is to be a second technologycentre. Price tag: about $500 million for a 350,000 sq ft centre tobe operating by 1999. Chief Executive Officer Dr James Liu saysthese centres will probably show how a government can "simplycreate an industry."Liu says 45 companies will have set up shop by next year, and thatthe addition of a new centre means more than 100 tech-basedcompanies will be operating under the umbrella of the HKITC by theend of the decade.FinaTech is currently just one of 20 fledgling companies so far in-house. Company founder Eric Wong hopes his firm can benefit from alocal derivatives market that could and should flourish in comingyears - given the territory's tax structure, ease of trading, itbeing a strong financial community already delving into thefledgling exotics market and, as always, its proximity to China.And this minnow - which originally started operations in Wong'sflat - has succeeded in attracting some significant partners,specifically Reuters. The news giant recently gave FinaTech third-party development rights, after initially being interested in thecompany's 1993 prototype, Risk Rider, a program designed to keeptrack of Hang Seng Index Options."FinaTech is the only financial engineering firm in Hong Kong thathas joined the Reuters Application Development Programme," saysWong. The company is now in negotiations to perhaps include thecompany's increasing number of financial software applications forrisk management in conjunction with Reuters' products - a move thatwould save it expensive marketing and training costs.The initial marriage between FinaTech and the HKITC started in May1995, a few years after Wong and partner Arthur Man started lookingfor potential business niches in the territory's growth infinancial instruments - options, warrants and various otherderivatives and exotics.He says Hong Kong's derivatives market - in a holding pattern sincethe mid-1980s - has only recently started to take off, gainingmomentum since 1992 when volume and liquidity started to fuelgrowth. Business looks brighter now that brokerages have benefitedfrom a fat year in dealing with the booming market.Wong has surrounded himself with a number of consultants wellversed in finance, marketing, mathematics and software expertise;unlike other traders he has worked with in the past as a trader atCitibank, Wardley James Capel and Credit Lyonnais, his sidelineinterests in software applications and writing have led him intothe field he describes as financial engineering.Wong's oft-published commentaries in such publications as Asia Riskand the Hong Kong Economic Times as well as his seminars andteaching have forged contacts and business for FinaTech. Hisactivities have also helped fund an enterprise that has surpassedthe $5 million mark in start-up funds.By placing himself at the heart of Hong Kong's expandingderivatives market, he has also been instrumental in bridging thegap between the West's sometimes opaque options market for Chinesebrokers, again by giving seminars, lectures and writing books(Options: a Primer with Professor Raymond Chiang in 1993, forexample)."There has been trouble in the past in finding Cantonese [andMandarin] speakers on the subject; I have invented many of thefinancial terms in Chinese," he says, adding that language skillshave helped set up initial ties with the Shenzhen and Shanghaimarkets - another fount of business opportunities in the future, hehopes.While a handful of those also in residence at HKITC are financialinformation-based ventures, the others comprise a variety of hi-tech enterprises. Liu expects a number of them to flourish oncetheir initial three-year "incubation" period is completed - afterwhich time, they have to leave and "enter the real world."The director describes those 1,100 days as a sort of "MBA on thejob," as the centre ensures that the company - apart fromdeveloping the core business - learns an array of managerial,marketing and networking skills.There is also seed money involved, to the tune of $1 or $2 millioninitially being doled out from HKITC's $50 million annual budget.Companies which continue to expand are earmarked for additionalcapital and, finally, a concerted move to attract local orinternational venture capital if a company and its business ideascontinue to attract interest.Besides FinaTech, Liu points at other HKITC occupants for biggerthings to come - SuperLogic Communications, for example.The company is developing FaxMail, multi-networking systems andInternet applications. Company representatives say that computerfax means "directly sending and receiving a facsimile through thecomputer." But in a local area network, one PC must be dedicated asthe fax server and a fax card must be installed."The key feature is the fax LAN software which controls thehardware," says a company spokesman. Hence, its FaxMail componentis merging fax technology with LAN technology, highly useful wherethere is heavy fax traffic.The hope is that such companies will do what traditionalmanufacturing-based middlemen did for Hong Kong years ago: attractbusiness and technological exchange from foreign multinationals aswell as China-based companies.Nevertheless, Liu believes Hong Kong's hi-tech development will beunique, unlike a Taiwan, Singapore or South Korea. Research anddevelopment, he says, fuels any hi-tech venture. Liu says Hong Kongwill be used as a managerial storefront operation: financialstrategists and policy makers located here, with most of thelabour, both R&D and production, eventually being carried out inChina, or more specifically, the Pearl River Delta.The reason is simple. China is starting to churn out well-trainedengineers in increasing numbers; a company can hire five or sixPRC-based engineers for the price of one Hong Kong engineer. Giventhat China is just 40 minutes away, Liu believes Hong Kong'scomparative advantage will ensure that the hi-tech sector continuesto grow; China's elephantine presence beside mouse-like Hong Kongalso makes a consistently compelling argument.It's interesting to note how Wong and Liu come to the sameconclusion about why Hong Kong has only recently seen thedevelopment of a credible hi-tech industry.Liu says that while entrepreneurs have the drive and a fundamentalgrounding in various hi-tech disciplines, the underlying focus orinitiatives did not truly exist in Hong Kong until this decade,when the government started making fiscal overtures for thecreation of a hi-tech sector.Liu says the networking potential, seed money and simple policydirection instilled by the government acts as a catalyst forbusinessmen wanting to enter Hong Kong's hi-tech sector.Formula: Wong says it has taken a number of synergies, such assoftware knowledge and stockbroking expertise, to create usefulreal-time risk management products for market players. Thatcombined with what the HKITC provides - everything from cheap rent,cost-free air conditioning, free access to seminar rooms tointernational trade junkets such as the one last month to Seattle,where the itinerary included visits to Boeing and Microsoft -suggests a winning formula.Liu also suggests that Hong Kong entrepreneurs remain focused onsouthern China, Hong Kong's true hinterland. Currently, Hong Kongmanufacturers employ fewer than 400,000 people in the territory,but more than 3 million in China. That disparity should continue togrow simply because Guangdong province - as well as the potentialbusiness from two new railroads between Hong Kong and Beijing - isa gold mine waiting to be exploited, he says."And why be greedy? There's enough in the Pearl Delta foreveryone," he says, conceding that for the moment, growth in theprovince looks flat. "Guangdong is like Hong Kong 10 or 15 yearsago; you have to transform yourself and you need time for that."Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996AROUND TOWN: Ascending the Peak on: Double 9, circa 1930 from WINDOW, October 25, 1996THE "Double Ninth" was originally the Day for Climbing the Hills,the festival when all good Chinese believed they must visit highplaces. Today, the pragmatic Cantonese combine it with the Ch'ungYeung - the Autumn Festival, when ancestral graves are visited,swept clean, and offerings placed on the graves (similar to theCh'ing Ming Festival in the spring). In North China, the twofestivals are observed separately.The origin of the "Climbing the Hills" festival is obscure, but isreputed to have originated during the Han Dynasty (220 BC-224 AD),when a virtuous scholar was advised to ascend the mountain with hisfamily in order to escape an impending disaster.Visiting and attending to the graves of the departed ones is anextension of the all-important tenet of ancestral worship, servingalso as welcome family reunions.The photograph shows a long procession of people ascending thePeak, on Hong Kong Island. The small building, in the centre of thephotograph, is the gatehouse of the Governor's Peak residence -theMountain Lodge. The gatehouse is still standing, but the MountainLodge was demolished after World War II, and a public pavilionbuilt on its site.Several sedan chairs can be seen in the centre, waiting forcustomers, and a few can be seen ascending with the crowd.

A few poorresults in the last few rounds was almost negated by an emphatic 3-1 win over Belarus (with Boris Gelfand) in the last round. Still,on rating China was only placed 30 at the start of this spectacularbiennial event. The other strongest Australasian nations finishedas follows: 19th Uzbekistan (32 points), 26th Philippines, 27thVietnam and 28th Australia (all 31 points), 30th Kazakhstan and39th Turkmenistan (both 30.5), while Indonesia came 44th on 29.5points. The small number of points difference indicates theunreasonableness of the Swiss system being used, and at the sametime the importance of scoring well in rounds 12, 13 and 14; thisis often more of a lottery than a real draw. One of the PRC menteam's finer wins occurred in round 3 against Hungary with 3-1.They then briefly occupied first spot ahead of Cuba, and evenconsolidated this next round by beating Castro's team by 2.5-1.5;the eventual winners Russia overtook them then by a hard-fought2.5-1.5 result in round 5. Here the two games that showed thatChina are on the right track. Hungary were rated third and gold-medal winners in 1978. Peng Xiaomin on board 3 contained ZoltanAlmasi, while Zhang Zhong on board 4 also drew with up-and-coming17 year old GM Peter Leko (see also next week).

(She's poetic, my wife.) When we gothome I looked in Right Through the Pack by Robert Darvas and Normande Villiers Hart. The deal related by the club four featuresSherlock Holmes. And, as the detective nearly said, "Come, reader,come! The game is afoot."West leads the spade four: five, seven, king. Declarer plays a lowdiamond to dummy's jack. After winning with the queen, Eastswitches to the heart king. Declarer wins with the ace, cashes theace-king of diamonds and exits with the club four. West wins withthe ace, but South has the rest of the tricks - and 11 in all -with the spade ace, the queen-jack of hearts and his four diamonds.What is the contract?Don't be misled by my auction, which reaches the right finalcontract, not the one in the book.The first deduction you should make is that diamonds are trumps.Otherwise, after West won trick six, declarer couldn't claim fourmore diamond tricks as he has no side-suit hand entry remaining.So, is the contract five diamonds? No, because then South couldn'tafford the safety-play in diamonds, which guarantees only one trumploser against a 4-0 split. For all he knows, West has the heartking, and he will lose three tricks even if diamonds are 2-2 or 3-1with a singleton queen. Could it be three diamonds? No, becausethen South doesn't need the safety-play. Therefore, the contractmust be four diamonds.

It isa ponderous and deliberate game, a game for those who like toconsider all the ramifications before making a decision, a game forthose who enjoy a wander near woods and lakes while the sun slowlygoes down.And it is exactly this leisurely, relaxed atmosphere that Tin Cupmanages to capture while at the same time providing the beleagueredKevin Costner with the kind of role he was born to play. Costnerhas too soft a face to pull off post apocalyptic warriors(Waterworld) or mucho macho mediaeval outlaws (Robin Hood Prince ofThieves).In such overblown epics as these his lost-little-boy personabecomes swamped and we lose sight of just how charismatic, in a"gorgeous boy next door" kind of way Costner is.Costner also excels in a role with humour. As he had begun to viewhimself as a "serious" film-maker since his success with DancesWith Wolves, he has recently nixed humorous scripts. One supposesthat the trauma of Waterworld saw him just desperate to take onmore light-hearted projects.And light-hearted (delightfully so) Tin Cup most certainly is.Costner plays Roy McAvoy, a naturally gifted player who justcouldn't take himself seriously enough to make it as a pro. He candrive like Daly, and putt like Faldo. If he could only do it on amore regular basis, he would be up there with the best. But to be atop golfer requires an enormous amount of dedication andconcentration, and Roy just doesn't possess those qualities.Like a wayward Steve Ballasteros, Roy also has a penchant for thespectacular, going for a birdie where he should take a par,refusing to play a percentage game, even though a percentage gamemight bring him success and riches.Glory shots and entertainmen - that, for Roy, is what the sport isabout.But now his tournament days are behind him, and Roy has settleddown into a life of middle-aged indolence. He owns a run-downdriving range in Nowhereseville Texas, where he gives the oddlesson in between drinking beers with his mates.It looks like Roy will make his way to the grave in such fashion,until he is shaken out of his complacency by Dr Molly Griswold andDavid Simms (Rene Russo and Don Johnson).The former tickles his fancy, the latter, an old golfing chum whois now a slick pro, hurts his pride by asking him to caddie in amajor competition.Sure enough, Roy rises to both challenges, but, thank goodness,does so in unpredictable fashion. He refuses to be tamed, either byMolly, who would have him "extend his follow-through" a little(what's the point of making a sport's movie if you can't use thesport's terms for a little double entendre?) - or by David, whosmugly insists that the only way to win is to take the percentageshot. Instead, Roy goes all out to win, both his lady and the golfgame of his life, on his own terms.The movie delights in watching Roy take on the challenge ofseducing '90s woman and psychologist Molly in an old-fashioned way,and in its climactic scenes, manages to instil more excitement andtension in a fictional golf match than I have ever seen in a realone. By the time its climax comes around, the movie becomes a realnail- biter.Director Shelton hasn't had a big hit in a while now, but with thismovie, and with Costner at his very best, he looks set to winworldwide. What is more, by making his heroines intelligent andfull of character he is set to explode the myth that only bimbosfollow sport.Dr Molly in this movie is as quick-witted and pithy as SusanSarandon was in Bull Durham.It is Molly who provides Roy with the key to success thanks to hersuperior understanding of his character. No cheerleader this lady.All in all, a smart, exciting, character-driven comedy that shouldkeep everyone, golf fan or not, thoroughly entertained. Even if youhate the game, you should try to take this charmer in.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996REVIEWS & PREVIEWS: FILM/Martin Snape: DeNiro Is Up and Down in Thriller:The Fan from WINDOW, October 25, 1996P.44-45Director: Tony ScoffStarring: Robert De Niro, Wesley Snipes, Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn,John Leguizamo, Andrew J. Ferchland.Robert De NirO is doing an awful lot of work lately, some of itgood (Casino) some of it mediocre (Heat). In The Fan hisperformance vacillates between the two.Nobody does a "psycho" quite as well as De Niro. Has anyonebettered his portrayal of a troubled Vietnam vet in Taxi Driver?Has anyone personified violence better than he did in Scorses'supdate of Cape Fear?Here he plays Gil Renard, Mr Middle America, with a screw loose.Gil has the worn outlook of a man who has too often confrontedfailure. His hair looks like it has been styled using a knife andfork, his clothes and brow are rumpled, his sales patter matey andoutdated.During the film, De Niro sells: a lot of knives. He is an expert onthem. Big ones, small ones, hunting ones, combat ones, all of themlovingly cared for and sexily captured on celluloid, thanks todirector Tony Scott's trademark glamorous style,It's all very phallic, and once you've seen the camera linger onGil's highly polished wares, you know it's only a question of timebefore he unsheathes one and gets stuck into cutting up a victim ortwo.And it's not long before you realize that target number one willultimately be Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) a swaggering,loudmouthed baseball player, the latest addition to Gil's favouriteteam the San Francisco Giants.Bobby is everything Gil always wanted to be. He is talented,effortlessly successful, a perfectionist who can attain perfection.Gil sees himself as a bit of a perfectionist too, the only problembeing that he isn't really very good at anything, not even atflogging knives.He can't meet the sales figures laid down by his unforgiving boss,he has a failed marriage and an ex-wife who despises him (nicelyplayed by Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn), a son (Andrew J Ferchland) hecan't relate to and as a result, an awful lot of pent-up anger.A degree of this he dissipates at ballgames, as during a father/sonouting to a ballgame where his anger continually bubbles to thesurface as he lectures his unfortunate child on the game.De Niro's performance is perturbing, amusing and at times touching.To see a man who is so far removed from what he wants to be ispoignant, and this is the key to the film's success. To an extentwe can understand the frustrations that leads him to be obsessedwith the arrogant millionaire baseball player, the man whopersonifies everything Gil feels he ought to be.But as Gil's actions become increasingly violent, he becomes lesssympathetic and the film begins to resemble just anotherpsychothriller. This, combined with Tony Scott's overly slickimages sees the film descend into areas that are the familiar andglossy realm of Hollywood. Ironically, the more The Fan turns intoa thriller, the less it thrills and as De Niro's character becomesmore psychotic he becomes correspondingly less complex andtherefore less interesting.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: THE WRITING SCENE: A Shopkeeper's Diary: Awriter's debut on an outlying island from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By JANE RAMWhen outlying island dwellers say where they live, most citydwellers react in a predictable way. The typical first question is,"How do you do your shopping? Do you have a supermarket?""We don't have a supermarket, but we do have Green Cottage!" LammaIslanders reply.Within less than two years, the little shop on Yung Shue Wan's MainStreet has become an institution. Rustic wooden seats or the nearbysea wall have made it a meeting place as well as the source ofeverything from aroma therapy oils and wholemeal bread to steamingespressos or glasses of fresh orange juice.These days Green Cottage has diversified further, selling Birds inthe Sky, to give a direct translation of the title of  the $48 bookwritten by Queenie So Lai-chun.Professional translator, former city dweller, dedicated greenie,tireless farmer and full-time observer of human nature, So is theowner and manager of Green Cottage. "I always wanted to writesomething about Lamma," she says. "This funny community is uniquein Hong Kong."Changed topic: She originally wanted to write about being a farmerbut once she became involved in selling green products, she foundherself spending so much time in the shop that it seemed onlynatural to write about life on Main Street. The result is acollection of short stories, which provide glimpses of Lamma life,and the major concerns of the island's inhabitants.Some of the stories are based on readily identifiable, real lifeYung Shue Wan characters - the Pizza Lady among them. Others havebeen distilled through So's imagination and emerged in new forms.Directly, or indirectly, everything in the book relates to Lamma,she says, although less than a third is actually about keeping ashop. Most stories touch on environmental issues. "I hope the bookwill encourage people to value Lamma and keep it beautiful."Three power station chimneys dominate Yung Shue Wan's scenery, butinstead of complaining, the long-suffering residents are inclinedto joke about them. So collected some of the comments - life'sexclamation marks, according to the philosopher; Salem cigarettes,according to the chain smoker; blunt pencils according to theprofessor; fingers with black nail polish, according to thesecretary; and so on.Different viewpoints can transform the subject matter. So tells thestory of two Lamma residents, each with a big tree in his garden,one to be doted over, the other to be torn down. Arguments betweentheir respective overseers ensue - to be put into So's record.And then there was the 40-year-old who was proud to announce herpregnancy - and her 50-year-old husband who arrived later tocomplain his pension would be chewed up bringing up the baby.So says hers is the first book in Chinese about Lamma, and it'salmost certainly the first book of any sort about Hong Kong's thirdlargest island. "Most people seem amazed at the idea that anyone onLamma can even read, let alone write," says So.Birds in the Sky is boldly labelled "Islands Series No 1" and morebooks are already in hand, including one being written by So'spartner, David Sheel, based on the diary of one of his forebearswho worked on the southern coast of China a century ago. So plansmore volumes of stories, although she says her next book willprobably be about the turtle who recently laid her eggs on a remoteLamma beach: before anyone could really appreciate what a specialevent this was, the eggs were dug up and eaten.Main Street has certainly been an education, So says. "On the farm,everybody I dealt with was so nice, it was like being cut off fromthe real world, like being in an ivory tower. The problem was thatthe ivory tower was getting smaller and smaller!"The reality of Main Street was quite a shock. Suddenly I had todeal with the real world of drunks and suppliers. After six monthsI realized that it was impossible to carry the farming mentalityinto the street. I learned to be more business oriented, morepractical and less idealistic to be able to survive. I'm not a shopkeeper by nature and I paid a heavy price for that lesson. I workvery hard, but I'm not very good at it. I've been writing all mylife and I continue to collect ideas and stories. I plan to do morewriting in the future: all I need is the time."For the moment at least So does not plan an English version of herbook. "There are too many Cantonese puns for a successfultranslation."Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: TRAVEL: Garlic Spells Trouble: There's nosubstitute for metal at silver fest from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By PHILIP REEVE, P.42-43A solitary drum began to beat. The simple rhythm, booming over andover, soon became hypnotic. And then the air was filled with theethereal sound of hundreds of tiny bells jingling. One by one, outof the surrounding houses, young Miao women appeared - dressed tothe nines in silver: magnificent headdresses, necklaces and thickneck chains, bracelets, earrings, and tunics fringed with bells.They surrounded the older woman, tirelessly drumming out the beat,and began to dance in a slow, shuffling circle around the drum.This was one of the highlights of the annual Sisters' Meal festivalof the Miao people, held amidst the camel-hump hills and foldedterraces of Guizhou's Shidong district. An extravagant courtshipritual, it allowed the eligible young women to show off theirbeauty to the men and at the same time their families' wealth -invested in the fabulous silver costumes they wore. Families begincollecting silver jewellery and headdresses for their daughters assoon as they are born. Over 60 types of intricate silverwork canmake up a full costume including tiaras, coronets, combs andphoenix crowns.Wearing the heavy costumes for hours is gruelling for a young womanbut the more silver she can wear, the greater the prestige for herfamily. Many silver costumes weigh as much as 15 kilograms.All the men formed an admiring audience around the dancers,preparing to make advances, proposals, and, for some, thebeginnings of courtship. The women prepare multi-coloured "sisters'rice" for the young suitors, with symbols hidden inside to signaltheir true feelings. A pair of red chopsticks means she hasaccepted a hand in marriage; a garlic or red chilli, that the manshould look elsewhere; pine needles, that the man present silks andcolourful threads for further consideration.The Miao people are surely one of China's most colorful ethnicminorities, certainly the most festive. The "Black Miao" alonecelebrate 448 different festivals during the year. The hundreds ofdifferent types of Miao in southwest China have been placed in fivebroadly-defined categories - Black, Blue, Red, White and FloweryMiao - though these convenient classifications do little justice tothe enormous diversity that exists in their customs, festivals anddress (over a hundred prominent types). They are spread over anarea roughly the size of Germany and France, inhabiting sevendifferent provinces, though half of the Miao population of sevenmillion are concentrated in Guizhou.Nobody knows their exact origins and this has led to a good deal ofconjecture. Some Chinese scholars have pointed to Tibet, Mongoliaand even Lapland as the Miao's original homeland. It seems morelikely that they inhabited the valleys of the Huang He (YellowRiver) around 4,500 years ago; scholars have even suggested theywere the first farmers in the Yellow River valley, terracing theland to grow rice. The waves of invading Mongols from the north ledto a gradual migration southwards and it is estimated that theybegan settling in Guizhou from at least the Qin and Han periods(221 BC - AD 220).During the Song (960 - 1279) and Ming (1368 - 1644) Dynasties, theMiao were pushed further south into even more remote and ruggedareas by the advancing Han Chinese troops and settlers, eventuallyreaching Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand - where they still livetoday, known internationally as the Hmong. Allies of the Americansin the Vietnam War, many of the Hmong were permitted to settle inthe US. Recently, Japanese scholars have been studying Miao customsand language in detail as it has been suggested that the twocultures may have common roots. The Miao of southeast Guizhou havea much more imaginative explanation of their origins; the firstMiao man, according to legend, hatched from the eggs of a butterfly(married to a bubble!); a water buffalo, a dragon, an elephant, asnake, a tiger, a thunder god, and more abstract phenomena such ascalamities and ghosts, also figure in their richly storiedbeginnings.Exactly when the Miao started producing silver jewellery andcostumes is also not known but it is thought to have been duringthe Ming period. Never having mined silver themselves, the Miaopurchased it from traders usually in the form of silver coins whichthey then melted down.At the time of the Cultural Revolution in the '60s, the Miao fearedtheir wealth would be confiscated by the Red Guards and so manyfamilies buried their heirlooms in the hills. Luckily, that provedonly an interlude.The central government, not unsympathetic to local traditions,established annual silver quotas for the Miao way back in 1949.Today, the "silver" tends to be a silver-plated base metal or oneof various silver alloys.It is in the southeast of Guizhou, in districts like Shidong, thatthe silverwork is the most outstanding and intricate. Manyvillages, such as Tang Long near Shidong, have a number of skilledsilversmiths fashioning up to a hundred different types of silverjewellery and adornments for their womenfolk. The Miao women, withequal workmanship, produce exquisitely-embroidered textiles, oftenfull of colourful mythological figures and scenes.In recent years Guizhou has opened up as an exciting destinationfor the more adventurous tourist, and the Miao with theirextravagant silver costumes and lively festivals almost every dayof the year, are the province's prime attraction.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: A Prophet's Rise & Fall: New papers tell more ofChina's Christ figure: God's Chinese Son: The Heavenly Kingdom of HongXiuquan from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By Jonathan SpenceNew York: HarperCollinsExtraordinary dangers may flow from a book as volatile as theBible, writes Jonathan Spence by way of an introduction to one ofthe most amazing periods of Chinese history, the TaipingRevolution. The prolific Yale history professor argues in hislatest book that more than anything else, it was one man'sinterpretation of Christian scripture than turned China upside downfrom 1851-64, bringing the Ching Empire to its knees. Spence echoesmany other sources when he writes that in the process, at least 20million people were killed in battle or starved to death.The author says he would never have contemplated adding to theample literature on the period were it not for the fact that about10 years ago, new texts were discovered in the British Museum.These volumes record purported visions of God and Jesus relayed toHong Xiuquan and some of his fellow believers. They also offer adetailed description of life and events in China in the mid-18thcentury.Spence gained access to the books and went to Beijing to consultwith the man who had uncovered them, Wang Qingcheng. He decidedthere was room for a book focused on Hong himself and the mechanicsof his enormous sway over thousands of followers.Hong's introduction to Christianity came by a circuitous route.Western missionaries were active in China in the 1830s,distributing Bibles and related tracts. One Chinese convert, LiangFa, translated parts of the Bible and liked to give them awayoutside the hall in Guangzhou where Confucian examinations wereheld. Hong, at the time a schoolteacher from a small Hakka village,happened to pick up one such handout on his way home after anunsuccessful attempt to pass the exams in 1836.Heady stuff: These random translations - particularly of OldTestament prophets, the teachings of Jesus and the book ofRevelations - ultimately had a profound effect on Hong, who wasalready sympathetic to the harsh lot of peasants like his father.Following another failed attempt at the examinations, he grew illand fell into a delirious state on the 50km walk home. He laterdescribed this experience as a journey to heaven where he wasreunited with his relatives, learned that he was the youngerbrother of Jesus, underwent a heavenly baptism and was instructedto banish evil from the earth.By the time Hong failed the exams for the third time in 1843,China's defeat in the Opium War had thoroughly discredited theManchu rulers and Confucius, too, in the minds of many.Hong began his movement (called Tai Ping, or great peace) to drivethe forces of evil from the land and establish a New Jerusalem. Ahandful of followers grew to thousands, despite incrediblehardships and setbacks and draconian codes of conduct, and theTaiping took control of Nanjing as the seat of their HeavenlyKingdom.Spence takes pains to show that Western religious influence wasonly part of the story. He asserts that "millenarian" thinking wasa phenomenon that evolved independently in different parts of theworld, including China. For example, until about 1500 BC, Egyptian,Mesopotamian and Indo-Iranian cultures saw death as a finaldarkness. Then through Zoroaster (Zarathustra) belief grew thatanother worldly existence could come about following an apocalyptictriumph of good over evil. This was the root of biblicalapocalypse.In China, Spence points to accepted certainties first establishedin the fifth century BC Lao Zi - paradox, balance and the absenceof dogmatism - later undergoing a similar erosion. Between thethird and sixth centuries AD, he writes, new Taoist and ChineseBuddhist ideas combined to create an apocalyptic vision where acelestial saviour and his chosen ones on earth would survive aperiod of terrible destruction to form an ideal, peaceful society.Even trying to narrow his focus to the inner workings of one man,Spence must deal with a large cast of characters and manycomplexities. He succeeds in bringing his material to life,particularly through an inventive use of the present tense thatgives his narrative a journalistic feel.Whether Hong emerges any more fathomable is open to debate.Certainly the Western missionaries who met or corresponded with himremained largely mystified by him, unable to reconcile his veryliteral religious interpretations and uncompromising mission withtheir own. Hong did not take kindly to their criticism.But Spence does succeed in adding dimension to this historicalfigure. Elsewhere, generally, he is portrayed simply as a Chinesehero. Here, his fleshed-out story has the elements of tragedy; agreat man of noble purpose brought down by a fatal flaw. For Hong,singleminded belief in his own infallibility bred dissension in theranks. That was his undoing.GINNY McCORMICKCopyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: BOOKS: A Change of Season: Painful journey toenlightenment: Bound Feet & Western Dress from WINDOW, October 25, 1996P.40-41By Pang-mei Natasha ChangNew York: DoubledayI flipped through Bound Feet & Western Dress and put it down,dismissing it as yet another yarn from some festering banana,whingeing about being neither American nor Chinese. I rememberedenduring The Joy Luck Club, only to see a succession of charactersclimb further down their navels, and concluded this cross-culturalconfessional stuff was spinning right out of control.There was another problem with Bound Feet. It mixed the story ofone generation with the story of another, something a friend didnot very successfully accomplish in retracing the travels of hisgreat grandfather tramping through 19th century Europe. On thesurface, it was a simple "then and now" exercise, but it became agame of matching wits, with my friend in charge of allocatingspace. The device pitted one-off but sometimes eloquentobservations of a dead diarist against the musings, snoozings morelike, of a young writer who recast every phrase till it was tooclever by half.As it happened, I inadvertently picked up Bound Feet thinking itwas something else, and headed for San Francisco airport. By thetime we touched down at Pearson in Toronto, I had finished the bookenthralled.Rare for a debuting author, Natasha Chang neatly avoids bothproblems, reining in her own story to the barest, thought-provokingessentials, and using these to bridge different chapters of hergreat aunt Chang Yu-i's fascinating life. Yu-i was the daughter ofa prominent Shanghainese doctor, a prolific dad who produced eightchildren, including one son who would become president of the Bankof China.She was also, more to the point, the wife of one of modern China'smost celebrated poets, Hsu Chih-mo, who comes off as a creep inthis tragic story. But Yu-i herself was clearly a figure ofhistory, too, having been the first in her family to escape thehideous practice of foot binding, after a few agonizing days' trial- and being the first in China to be divorced. Unfortunately, thatprecedent-setting split didn't seem to free her emotionally to geton with other relationships. And unravelling the psychologicalknots tying her up reveals the various cultural and socialconundrums that make Yu-i's such an interesting story.Enlightened as her father was for the times, Yu-i was not given theeducational opportunities lavished on her brothers, and basicallytracked for an arranged marriage.She didn't see her husband-to-be till the big day, and didn't thinkshe was winning much of a prize when she did finally lay eyes onhim. Hsu, going through the motions of honouring his parents'wishes but really hungering for a modern, educated woman, dismissedYu-i as a bumpkin from day one.If that wasn't a clue of more unpleasantness to come, we soon learnthat he rarely talked to her and stayed abroad as much as possiblebefore finally abandoning her. This he did a few years later, likethe guy who went off to buy a quart of milk never to return, aftershe joined him to resume their partnership in England.Son number one: Even the birth of a son, Hsu Chi-cai, and a second- the tra-gic Peter, who was born in Germany and died at three -failed to warm him to her. Indeed, he suggested she abort hersecond pregnancy. But he seemed to dote over Chi-cai when he was inChina, which was rare. Chi-cai, in fact, spent his earliest yearswith his paternal grandparents, as the story flips between Chinaand Europe, with tangents following Yu-i's brother to America.After England, Yu-i went to France to live with her student brotherfor a time before moving to Germany where, having nailed down theessentials of German, she found work in a Berlin kindergarten. Thisperiod in some ways seems both the happiest and saddest part of herlife. Berlin was where son Peter was born, forming the centrepieceof her live-in friendship with Dora Berger. But that happyinterlude disintegrated with Peter's death, Dora never to be seenagain.In Germany, Yu-i acceded to divorcing Hsu, desperate to marry hislatest flame and literary soulmate. She returned to China butdivorce didn't free her from familial bonds with the in-laws, justas Hsu's desertion failed to spur her to act on mating signals shegot from a Chinese she met in Germany.In the end, we have a woman caught between social and political seachanges, prepared to explore the new, but not deeply enough toleave the old, which includes a form of reconciliation with Hsu,not long before he dies in a plane crash.Hoping ties with her by-now Bank of China GM brother would pay bigdividents, the directors of the Shanghai Women's Savings Bankappointed her a vice president. She proved astute in business, butwith civil war heating up, she moved to Hong Kong in 1949 and laterremarried. But with the death of her second husband in 1974, shedecided on New York, where she was to live out her days with herson always close at hand.There were probably many women like Yu-i trying to cross that gulfseparating imperial and republican China. The hope is they didbetter than achieve what seems the worst of both worlds.We are lucky for Natasha Chang writing Yu-i's story down, a processthat involved years of interviews and intricate interpretation andediting.A victim of racial taunts growing up in America, Chang foundherself on her own journey of self discovery.But unlike most second-liners warming up rock fans for the mainact, Chang's story is compelling, too, laying out her ownconundrums. One suspects that at least some of them were confrontedand overcome in the process of working on Bound Feet.JOEL McCORMICKCopyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: ANTIQUES: First, Remove the Butter: Tibetanfurniture starts making its way to Hong Kong from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By HILARY BINKS, P.38-39It was a painstaking process, gently removing the thick layer ofgrime built up over centuries of exposure to the smoke and greaseof yak butter lamps in a Tibetan monastery. But gradually thebeautiful colours and gold leaf of the painted chest beneath wererevealed. Miraculously, the decoration was largely intact."A layer of butter covers almost everything in Tibet," says ShaunKelly of Zee Stone Gallery, "and in this case it protects thevaluable painting. The very dry climate in Tibet also means thatfurniture can be preserved for centuries without looking old. Aslong as you clean the pieces carefully and patiently, so as not toremove the gold, you can restore them to their original state."Traditional Tibetan furniture is the least researched field ofTibetan art. While art forms related to Buddhism, such as statuesand thangkas, Buddhist scroll paintings, have been popular for sometime, until recently few furniture pieces have been availableoutside Tibet. Over the last four years, however, a handful ofdealers in the US have pioneered the import of Tibetan furniture,and now at least three Hong Kong galleries - C.P. Ching, PlumBlossoms and Zee Stone - offer good selections.Late market bloomer: Neglect of this branch of Tibetan art was notsurprising when one considers the practical difficulties andexpense involved in getting pieces to Hong Kong. It is one thing toimport thangkas, which can be easily rolled up and carried by hand,quite another to arrange safe shipment of furniture from the highTibetan plateau first to Katmandu in Nepal, and from there to HongKong."It certainly demands an act of faith to get the pieces out," saysStephen McGuinness of Plum Blossoms, who has just held his firstexhibition of Tibetan furniture at his galleries in Hong Kong andSingapore. "But my interest is both personal - my wife is Tibetan -and professional. I have a deep interest in Buddhist art and Ithink people will appreciate the incredible Tibetan craftsmanship."Both Plum Blossoms and Zee Stone are also making the most of theirnewly expanded gallery space to show the furniture to bestadvantage.The three main types of Tibetan furniture are chests, cabinets andtables. Because of their largely nomadic existence, most ordinaryTibetans had little, if any, furniture. There were no chairs inTibet, as the people preferred to sit on a rug on the ground or ona low platform. But small tables, some of them portable, were usedto serve food and drink, especially butter tea, and the householdshrine would have a stand or altar table on which offerings couldbe placed. Chests were used to store precious things and wealthierhouseholds might possess larger cabinets.Monasteries, centres of Tibet's wealth and economic power, no doubtneeded more furniture in which to store the vast quantities ofprecious silks, thangkas and Buddhist scriptures they accumulatedthrough trade and donations. Some cabinets housed images ofdeities. A smaller type of cabinet, the torgam, was made to holdtorma, sacrificial sculptures made from butter and flour.  Pegamcabinets, unique to Tibet, had scalloped panels on three sides tosupport heavy wood-covered Tibetan texts. But by no means allfurniture was made for monasteries, says Kelly. "I have seen chestsstacked up in private houses, and everyone needed small tea tables.Apart from cabinets with a Tantric or obviously religious theme, Idon't think there is very much distinction between domestic andmonastic use."In contrast to Chinese furniture, where the main focus was on thequality of beautiful hardwoods such as huang hua-li , in Tibetanfurniture the wood was of little consequence. On one of the highestplateaux in the world, mostly above 4,500 metres, the only timberavailable were softwoods such as pine and cedar. Joinery techniqueswere basic but still clever locking systems and hinges, always withan emphasis on practicality and efficiency. Fittings were of brassor iron.The really important thing about the furniture was its painteddecoration. Sometimes the wood was covered with a soft cottonmaterial to prevent cracking before sizing, water-based mineralcolours and gold paint were applied. Many pieces also had gesso (awhite ground, like plaster) applied to give a raised delineation ortexture. Finally, pieces were coated with a shellac-type ofvarnish.Annie Marcz-Ching, of C.P. Ching, recalls the first time she sawTibetan furniture in Katmandu: "I was excited by the vividness ofthe painting. When I buy, my first criterion is that a piece musthave life. That is, it has to be a painting, rather than justpainted.  When the painting is good, it feels completely differentfrom when somebody has just decorated the piece with another motif.I was also fascinated by the different influences I coulddistinguish. I could immediately see Chinese characteristics,sometimes Indian ones also, and even Islamic elements in thebeautiful floral patterns - and yet the furniture is unmistakablyTibetan. That is the charm of it."Clues to dating: While no definitive guidelines have yet beenestablished for dating pieces, foreign influences can providevaluable clues. From the 15th century, Chinese influence becameparamount in Tibet and many of the designs used on furniture,including floral and dragon motifs, can be compared to those seenon Chinese textiles and porcelain.On this basis, Kelly believes that many Tibetan chests date fromthe 17th century or even earlier, pre-dating more elaboratecabinets which were more numerous during the heyday of themonasteries in the 18th century.But many features are uniquely Tibetan. Marcz-Ching points to thepainted flower cabinets, which she says are in particular demand atthe moment. "You can really see the character of the Tibetan peoplehere, very warm and cheerful. They love to use bright colours -red, green, gold and blue. I think it has to do with the mountainclimate - when they see the flowers in spring they are very happyand this is communicated in their art."Chests used to store precious goods often bore auspiciousdecoration associated with wealth, such as dragons bearing a trayof jewels. Typically the central cartouche was encircled by ageometric design with corner scrollwork. The sides of chests werefrequently painted with a tiger pelt design, believed by Tibetansto possess protective powers. Buddhist emblems, such as the lotus,the vase, and the endless knot, were also popular.Tibetan Buddhism, incorporating the Mahayana or "Greater Vehicle"school, Tantric practices from India, and elements of theindigenous animist "Bon" religion, also had its own darker imagery."In this case," says Marcz-Ching, "what is wonderful is not whatmeets the eye, but the symbolism."For the moment, people are only just becoming familiar withTibetan furniture, but in the long term, when they understand itmore, I think Tantric Buddhist pieces will represent part of a moreserious collection."C.P.

Speakerswill address such concerns as destructive fishing practices,pollution, increasing threats to biodiversity and low levels ofenforcement of current legislation to protect the oceans. Window,which has regularly covered these issues since it was founded fouryears ago, is a co-sponsor of the symposium. Neil Colclough reportsthat the organizer - the Hong Kong Marine Conservation Society -hopes to make people more aware of their stake in the marineenvironment and the role they can play in protecting it.UNSEEN and unsuspected by many Hong Kong people, there are desertsscattered around the territory - beneath the sea. Years ofoverfishing, including dynamite fishing, as well as pollution,dredging and a general lack of environmental management have leftareas of the seabed a virtual wasteland."Divers in Hong Kong know there are hardly any fish to be seen," isthe grim picture painted by one local diver. This is particularlychilling when the southern China region, including Hong Kong, is atthe edge of the world centre of marine biodiversity - the Indo-WestPacific. Conservationists fear this diversity faces collapse unlessurgent action is taken. Species such as sea turtles, lobster,several species of grouper and sea cucumber are already as good asextinct around Hong Kong.Trawlers working in pairs can regularly be seen ploughing the samearea within hours of one another, in some cases depleting fishstocks below a recoverable level. Perhaps even more destructive isdynamite fishing. Divers from conservation groups describe areassuch as those around Rocky Harbour, where the coral lies in heapsof rubble, with only crusty species of algae surviving. Dredgingand dumping have turned other areas into swirling mud pits.Until recently, there were few laws protecting Hong Kong's marinelife. Even though the government has now legislated fines fordumping, critics point out that it is hardly enforced, with littlepolicing and usually low fines imposed on transgressors.There are some encouraging signs: marine conservationists havestarted to win a few battles. In 1992, a sand-dredging project inMirs Bay was halted in the face of an environmental impactassessment of the potential damage to coral reefs, backed up byextensive lobbying from green groups. It was the first time such ascheme had been stopped because of possible biodiversity loss.Sanctuaries: In addition, the Marine Parks Ordinance was passedlast year, creating four protected marine sanctuaries.But such measures are not enough, according to marineconservationists, who say more public support needs to be createdto force the government to make more improvements. They believe thegovernment's primary environmental focus should be to formulate andadopt a comprehensive, coordinated plan to save the territory'smarine life.As part of the drive to put the public spotlight on the state ofHong Kong's marine environment, the territory is hosting its FirstInternational Symposium on Marine Conservation at the University ofHong Kong this weekend. Organized by the Hong Kong MarineConservation Society, the two-day event has attracted local expertsand those from the US, the Philippines and Vietnam.The symposium brings together scientists, politicians, lawyers andmedia representatives in an attempt not only to highlight theproblems, but also to offer some solutions.Society chairman Dr Brian Darvell says there has been a tendencyover the past few years to restrict the environmental debate to adialogue between green groups and government agencies, excludingthe general public."People in general need to be involved in these discussions becauseit is their quality of life which is being affected," he says. "Yetall the lobbying tends to be done in the opposite direction,towards the administration, and argued on technical grounds. Ourintention is to make people aware of what's going on, enthuse themto take action and then empower them to take that action."Given the state of Hong Kong's marine environment, much action isneeded, according to conservationists. While terrestrialconservation began in earnest in the mid-1970s with theestablishment of Hong Kong's country parks, the marine environmenthas been largely ignored until recently.A government commission was set up in 1965 to study conservationneeds. It formulated a plan for both terrestrial and marineconservation but only the former was acted upon, initially with thepassage in 1976 of the Country Parks Ordinance.This lack of action, combined with the effects of pollution,overfishing and dredging, has proved devastating, according to DrGregor Hodgson of the Institute for Environmental Studies at theHong Kong University of Science and Technology.Essential: "Biodiversity loss is occurring at an unprecedented ratein Hong Kong and southern China," he says in a paper to bepresented at the symposium. "It is essential to move forward toimplement a conservation process now, or there will not be muchleft to preserve."A major cause of this loss is overfishing, say conservationists.They argue that intensive fishing over the past few decades,fuelled by technical improvements to trawlers and equipment, hasleft very few edible or larger species of fish in local waters.Hong Kong fishermen now focus almost exclusively on "trash fishing"- smaller species, such as sardines, pony fish and anchovies, whichare sold as feed to fish farms at high prices: $2.5 per kg. Thesespecies are now also being fished too intensely, according toconservationists, who say the devastation is spiralling down theecological chain. Not only are stocks of the smaller fish beingseverely depleted, but the techniques employed in trash fishingalso catch the fry of bigger species.Bottom trawling with small mesh nets catches high levels of fry ofsuch fish as bream, croaker and goatfish, which are commercially aswell as ecologically important."The fishing fleet in Hong Kong is far too big. Pair trawlers aregoing through the same areas several times within hours of eachother," says Darvell. "How can we justify that intensive fishingeffort when the returns are negligible? This activity is denudingeverything in the areas where it takes place. It's just getting outof hand."Darvell and others argue that the Agriculture and FisheriesDepartment has known for years about the decline of large fish inlocal waters but has refused to admit there is a problem or attemptto tackle it by limiting fishing activity.However, in a report to be presented at the symposium, departmentofficer Keith Wilson concedes not only that current levels of trashfishing are "alarming," but that few bigger fish are being caughtinshore. Conservationists believe Wilson's report is the firstpublic confirmation by a department offical of what they have beensaying for years.Inshore: "The impacts of the Hong Kong fry fishing industry onfisheries resources may also be unsustainable," Wilson's papersays. "The low proportion of demersal fish [those that live nearthe bottom] in the inshore catch taken by vessels less than 15metres is indicative of very high fishing pressures."The demand for trash fish took off when the number of fish farms inHong Kong expanded enormously throughout the 1970s. Today more than1,500 licensed farms in 26 fish culture zones produce just under aquarter of all the live fish consumed in Hong Kong.The knock-on effect is that of the fish caught in Hong Kong waters,roughly 80 per cent are trash fish sold to farms. Less than 10 percent are higher value demersal species, according to Wilson'sreport.In addition to overfishing, other capture practices are damaging tothe marine environment. Dynamite fishing also kills non-target fishsuch as the fry of larger species, particularly as it is usuallyconducted where fish congregate, such as spawning and feedinggrounds. Police fear dynamite fishing is on the increase: so farthis year they have uncovered 368kg of explosive used for thispurpose, compared with 15kg for the whole of 1993.Also destructive is the use of vacuum suction and dredging devicesto harvest clams, a practice increasingly common, according to theAFD.The suction method pulls up everything in the target area, whiledredging - dragging heavy steel frames covered with steel meshesalong the seabed - ploughs deep into the mud, seriously disturbingthe environment. Such dredging has angered fishermen in Wong ChukKok Hoi where most clams are harvested. But unlike dynamitefishing, the practice is legal.If overfishing is indicative of a lack of initiative taken by thegovernment in protecting the marine environment, someconservationists also claim that even where laws have been enacted,this has largely proven a hollow effort.Earlier this year, areas at the bays of Yan Chau Tong and Lai ChiWo in the eastern New Territories and Hoi Ha Wan just off Sai KungCountry Park were designated as marine reserves. Hong Kong has morethan 50 species of coral - as many as in the whole of theCaribbean. Sixty per cent of them occur at Hoi Ha Wan alone.As marine parks, the areas are theoretically protected from dumpingor other damaging activities. However, there is a grace periodallowed for fishing, which has angered many conservationists whosay fishing should be stopped now.Patrol: There is also concern that there will not be sufficientresources to ensure the integrity of the parks - police haveprivately admitted they may be unable to patrol the areasregularly. "Its no use introducing laws unless you're prepared toback them up," says Darvell.The government's environmental protection programme in general hasbeen marked by a lack of willingness to enforce legislation or takethe initiative in practical terms, according to Brian Baillie,lecturer in professional legal education at the University of HongKong.In his paper to the symposium, he says Hong Kong has adopted "arhetorical approach" to enforcement of environmental laws.Baillie argues that environmental objectives and policies, in termsof the written law, are at least adequate. Similarly there areclear enforcement powers and suitable penalties at the disposal ofthe courts. "But the government has paid lip service only to itsown standards and powers," he says. "Its rhetoric aboutenvironmental care is just that: rhetoric."Under the various local laws the Environmental ProtectionDepartment has the power to: License polluting, discharging or dumping. Monitor emissions and discharges. Investigate sources of pollution, including entering privateproperty. Prosecute offenders. In some circumstances, where the area comes under the WaterPollution Control Ordinance, it can order an offender to clean upor pay the cost of cleaning up.But despite an increase in the number of prosecutions over the lastfour years - there were 249 under the Water Pollution ControlOrdinance last year - Baillie believes there is an overall lack ofresolution on the government's part to enforce environmental laws.Even before the EPD was given the power to prosecute polluters,Baillie argues that the attorney general could have done so usingthe common law remedy of public nuisance. "The fact that the AGnever bothered to do so, despite overwhelming evidence of illegaldischarges continuing for years, as with the Tuen Mun River, issimply another indication of the government's tradition ofplacating the business community to the detriment of theenvironment," according to Baillie.Even now, he claims, the EPD's own manual says that prosecuting anoffender should be the last option.When offenders are prosecuted, Baillie says, with few exceptionsthe fines handed out by magistrates are pitifully low and havelittle deterrent effect. He says the average fine for environmentaloffences from May 1995 to May this year was about $13,000. Thiscovers first and second offences - fines for repeat offences aresupposedly heavier.For one of the most common offences of illegal discharge of wasteinto public drains, the first fine is $400,000. For subsequentoffenders the maximum fine is $1 million, with provisions forculprits to be imprisoned and fined $40,000 per day for acontinuing offence.Baillie says heavy fines are occasionally imposed by moreenvironmentally enlightened members of the Judiciary, but thegenerally low fines are probably the result of the lack ofprecedent for environmental convictions.When the EPD first launched prosecutions, the fines were low andfew if any cases went to higher courts, which traditionally providepenalty guidelines to the lower courts, where such cases aregenerally handled."So it is very difficult for magistrates, who hear all first-instance environmental prosecutions, to work out where on the rangeof possible penalties they should pitch each offender," saysBaillie.Slows: Other critics of the government's environmental record claimthat bureaucracy often slows down the pace of implementingeffective measures.So what is the way forward in the drive to protect Hong Kong'smarine environment?According to Hodgson, there needs to be a move away from ad hocpolicies and action towards a comprehensive strategy to preserveand manage Hong Kong's marine life. He says an "integratedbiodiversity management plan" would be based on zoning and toughregulations to protect marine life. Following its implementation,there would also need to be continuous and comprehensive monitoringof biodiversity changes over time.Hodgson says in his paper that conservation needs to be viewedholistically - "from mountain top to seabed." He adds: "Forexample, common sense tells us that marine parks should not beplanned in areas adjacent to heavy industrial zones, where thethreat of pollution will be high." He also says that conservationneeds to have realistic aims, with the assumption that manyproblems will not be solved in the near future.Survey: As a first and urgent step, Hodgson believes a fastreconnoitre rather than a prolonged in-depth study needs to be madeto establish the state of the marine environment - what is left,what has gone and what can and cannot be saved. This is necessarydespite the fact that such a swift survey might result in mistakes."Given the rapid rate of biodiversity loss now occurring, unlessimmediate decisions are taken on what should be saved, then it willbe too late," he says. "The alternative, to wait until everyspecies and its ecological role is known prior to taking action,would be catastrophic."Hodgson argues that ultimately conservation, if it is to besuccessful, cannot be restricted by political borders, and HongKong will have to combine its efforts with southern China.Closer to home, Baillie believes that changing the law to allowprivate citizens to take legal action against polluters and thegovernment for failing to prevent illegal pollution would be amajor step forward in ensuring environmental laws are enforced. Hesays such provisions in the US have proved effective."Indeed, the major victories for the environment in America sincethey first embarked on their environmental legislation in 1969 havevery often been due not to the EPA's [the quasi-governmentEnvironmental Protection Agency] vigilance or initiative, butrather to the efforts, via litigation, of concerned citizens'groups," he argues.For this to happen in Hong Kong he believes three "foundationpillars" are necessary. These are: Rights for citizens to sue both offenders and non-performinggovernment agencies. No awards of legal costs against unsuccessful plaintiffs inactions brought against government agencies. Genuine, comprehensive, inexpensive freedom of informationlegislation and procedures.Baillie argues that a clean and protected environment should beviewed in the context of basic human rights.Linking all the recommendations and proposals to clean up HongKong's marine environment, most conservationists and theirsupporters agree that their success largely depends on getting thegeneral public involved. Not only does public awareness need to beincreased, but people generally need to be involved in the planningprocess.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996COMMENTARY: The ideal ruler rarely speaks. When a good thing is done, thepeople will say 'We did it': Catching up with Lao Zi from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By GERALD CHEN, P.31FOR THE moment let's forget about floods and the disgracefulpollution man has brought to our planet's rivers, lakes and evenseas. Let us also pause to consider water - that life-givingelement as perceived by ancient Chinese thinkers more than 2,500years ago. To Lao Zi (who lived around 571 BC), founder of Taoism,water symbolized the very essence of Tao, the Great Way."Supreme goodness - Tao or Taoist - is like water," says theDaodejing (one of China's great contributions to understanding ofthe universe and humanity), which literally translates as Virtuesof the Tao, or figuratively as The Great Way. "Water benefits allcreation but never contends. It stays in places that most menavoid. The Taoist prefers to be in the company of the lowly. Hedoes not err because he never contends."In another reference to water, the Daodejing says: "Nothing is moresoft and pliant than water, yet it is capable of subduing thestrong and breaking the powerful. The weak can conquer the strongas softness can conquer hardness. Although everyone knows thistruth, no one ever practises it because truth often appears to beuntrue."As symbolism in the philosophical thinking of Lao Zi, it wouldnaturally be wrong to judge his concept of water as we understandit today. But its value lies in the insight it gives into the wayour world moves and fulfils itself and, indeed, how human beingsshould behave towards nature as well as towards fellow humans.In this space it is unnecessary to go into what seem to be theabsurd extremes of Lao Zi's outlook, such as his vision of an idealsmall state which has absolutely no contact with its neighbours, orhis rejection of knowledge and learning on the grounds that theyare twin sources of evil.What many pundits have found intriguing are the numerous glitteringsparks of Lao Zi's philosophic thought which still ring true today- despite the fact that they seem contrary to conventional wisdom.Philosophical opposites: A contemporary of Confucius, Lao Zi wasfounder of one of the two most important schools of thought todominate Chinese culture down through the ages. Although apersonalized god is absent in both Taoism and Confucianism, theirideas on what constitutes good government, virtue and the meaningof life are distinctly different. In fact, they are opposite.In the final analysis, it might be said that in the dialectics ofboth schools, Confucianism, with its stress on studying theclassics and aspiration to official duties, takes a positiveattitude towards life whereas the Taoist position, with its stresson inaction and affinity with nature, the meek and lowly, istotally negative.The alternating dominant positions of Confucianism and Taoism inChinese history have not obliterated the fact that both continue toexert profound influences on Chinese culture. It is well said thatChinese intellectuals prefer to observe the loyalties and ethicalvalues of Master Kong's teachings when serving as officials. Poetsand writers, on the other hand, draw inspiration from the subtlefeelings and romanticism of the Taoist gospel. But this does notrule out the possibility of Taoist officials showing great respectfor Confucian ethics in their public life, while continuing torelish their Taoist thoughts in private. Nor can it be overlookedthat disgraced or disheartened Confucian officials often turn toTaoism to find solace in a quiet life away from worldly worries. Ineffect, it really is quite possible for a Chinese to be now aConfucianist and now a Taoist.That the legacies of Confucian and Taoist thinking are part andparcel of contemporary Chinese culture is evident from the factthat traces of their influence can be found among Chinesebusinessmen, Buddhists, Christians, artists, scientists andcommunists.Grades of rulers: The subtleties of Lao Zi's thinking are stillfrequently manifest in his maxim that truth often appears untrue."The best ruler of a state," he said, "is he whose subjects are notaware that he is there. The next to the best is adored, the next isfeared while the worst is despised by his subjects. The ideal rulerrarely speaks. When a good thing is done, the people will say: 'Wedid it'."It might be argued in the present day that both the first and lastforms of such governments are democratic. Although "invisible," thefirst case is effective, which is what matters. The last, worst,case - while an adversarial form of government - is also ademocracy. But the first is an example of the effectiveness of"doing nothing" (inaction), the most important tenet of Taoistoutlook.The ways of nature are to take from excesses to replenish thedeficient. Man behaves the opposite way by taking from thedeficient to enlarge the excesses. The Taoist seeks to balance theinequality by adopting the ways of nature. Although "doing nothing"can result in "accomplishing everything," the Taoist has no wish orreason to feel proud or jubilant. Simply, he has done nothing.The wise appear foolish, great straightness bends, great clevernessappears clumsy, great eloquence is short on words, loudness issilence, speech is poor before ideas, and misfortune is the seed ofblessing (and vice versa).Said Lao Zi: "When common folks hear what I say, they just laugh.Why shouldn't they? Greatness comes belatedly. Great sounds soundfaint. Tao cannot be named. Had they not laughed, I would not betalking about Tao."Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996CHINA: SPORTS: Warming Up to Sports: Fujian people's route to health from WINDOW, October 25, 1996From ZENG XIANCHENG in Fuzhou, P.28-29EARLY morning sunlight finds numerous people in Chinese citiesjogging, playing ball or dancing in public parks or by theroadside. At this time of day, all these people - of differentages, various occupations and diverse interests - seem to befocused on a single goal: achieving a long and healthy life.Freed from the old worries about lack of food and clothing, moreand more Chinese, as those in Fujian province shown in thesepictures, are becoming health conscious and spending increasingamounts of money and time on sport.As with almost anything in China, the history of sport can betraced back aeons through a colourful range of traditionalactivities and styles. The Fujian area used to be called Min. TheMin people were an ancient ethnic group who were integrated withthe Han - the majority of the Chinese race - centuries ago. As aresult, many traditional sports, such as Chinese martial arts anddragon boat racing, were adopted by the Min as well.Today, many Western sports - golf, snooker, aerobics to name just afew - are becoming increasingly popular with the younger people inFujian. Well-equipped gyms are being opened in many cities in theprovince, attracting large numbers of eager exercisers.The fitness trend is also fuelling a spending boom and sales ofsporting goods, including home exercise machines, are risingrapidly.Fujian's provincial government has spent handsomely on buildingsports facilities and supporting sporting events. More than 400stadia and gyms have been built across the province in the last fewyears. The cities of Quanzhou and Xiamen have each constructedlarge, well-equipped sports centres, ending their chronic shortageof such facilities.Local governments in Fujian are keen on waging campaigns toencourage people to participate in both traditional and moderngames. Sports meets are held frequently across the province andlast summer a number of "thousand-people" games were held in Fuqingcity. In each of these events a thousand participants competed inswimming, jogging and martial arts exercises.Photos by Zheng ZuoshengCopyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996CHINA: BOOKS: Unmitigated Butchery: Vivid re-telling of Nanjing's 1937nightmare, when 300,000 died at Japanese hands from WINDOW, October 25, 1996P.27Nanjing Massacre, 1937Xu ZhigengPublished by Chinese Literature PressON December 13, 1937, units of the invading Japanese Imperial Armyoccupied Nanjing, at that time the capital of China. They enterednot as a disciplined force engaged in modern warfare abiding by theGeneva Convention and other accepted moral and legal codes thatgovern conflicts, but rather as ravening foxes into a hencoop. Thesoldiers, encouraged and abetted by their leaders, began a campaignof slaughter, torture and pillage that lasted for months on end.Informed conservative estimates of the number of dead conducted atthe time, and immediately upon the expulsion of the Japanese, putthe death toll among a subdued and captive population at more than300,000, the majority occurring during officially sanctionedinstances of mass slaughter and gratuitous violence.Appalling as this was, does this one instance in an expansionistperiod during which the Japanese slaughtered and pillaged acrossAsia, merit a book to itself? Or is this merely an example of acitizen of one country caring more about what happened tocompatriots than to the inhabitants of Vietnam, Burma, Hong Kong,Singapore and Indonesia, to name but a few? Many other accountsexist which document the planning and cruelty that went intoJapan's thwarted aggression, including the preparation of spyrings, drug dealing, subornment and cruelty in the extreme.The author justifies his publication on the grounds that, once theidea had been suggested, he found it remarkably hard to uncover thefacts. Despite anecdotal evidence from survivors, historians seemedto have largely passed over the event. Indeed, as a second editionwas being prepared for translation and press, Japan's justiceminister went on record to claim that the Nanjing Massacre "was acomplete fabrication" - a staggering denial that in itself makesthe need for a record such as this the more necessary.It would seem that, at a time when ignorant youngsters in Fujianprovince are buying Japanese military replicas, when Japaneseright-wing militarists are gaining press attention, and whentextbooks are claiming that Japan "entered China" rather thaninvaded, there is an insistent need to put the facts on record,lest we forget.Neither designed as, nor perhaps desirable as, a work of literaryaccomplishment, this account tackles the topic in analytic anddispassionate fashion, despite the fact that even the Japanesetranslators "found [their] eyes filling with tears" and were often"ridden with a sense of crime."Ordeal: Opening with an account of the (inadequate) defence ofNanjing against military superiority, set in a time of dividedloyalties and poor communications, the author shows the peculiarblend of heroism and scarce resources that characterized theChinese resistance to the Japanese occupation. From this he moveson with chapters detailing aspects of the ordeal, not in a temporalchronicle but as an examination of each outrage in turn.Despite the inevitable repetition this entails, the themes arestrongly buttressed by eyewitness accounts from differentperspectives, leading the reader from house to street to riversidein a never-ending orgy of carnage, waste and inhumanity.We learn of thousands machine-gunned, hundreds doused in petrol andset afire, groups buried alive, and rape and disembowelment asdaily occurrences.The citizens of neutral powers and the Red Cross tried to enforcesafety zones for non-combatants, but to only limited avail. Thestreets and rivers ran red while property was looted, destroyed orshipped to Japan.Perhaps the most spectacular instances of unnecessary crueltyinvolved the beheading of innocent civilians in competitionsbetween Japanese officers testing the edges of their swords forfun, accounts of which were published in Japanese papers for theamusement of those unable to take part in this savage apology forsport.But was this any different from other wartime atrocities? The pointthat the author wishes to leave us with is emphatically "yes."While waste and plunder have historically accompanied armies,modern sensibilities have given rise to accords and regard for thewell-being of civilians under occupied rule: these were disregardedpointlessly and comprehensively. It can be no defence to the chargethat the occupiers behaved atrociously by saying, as did Japanesecommander Iwane Matsui: "The struggle between Japan and Chinashould be regarded as the unavoidable conflict between twodeveloping nations, and the rivalry between the national ideologiesof the two cultures."Modern proponents of terrorism as warfare might seek to justify theJapanese behaviour, saying that by terrorizing the occupied areasthey were following militarily sound principles of seeking todemoralize the opponent. But, as one reads further into thisaccount of the massacre, such pleas appear hollow and specious: whyadopt a policy of stupidity and waste?At a time when nationalisms and ideologies again threaten to clashin Southeast Asia over territory, we would do well to read thisaccount and, even if we cannot agree on what the ethicalconsiderations are, to call to mind Sun Tzu's observation, made inThe Art of War, probably compiled during the Warring States period(475-221 BC): "Generally in war the best policy is to take a stateintact; to ruin it is inferior to this."MARTIN BARNETTCopyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996CHINA: HEALTH: Vast Majority Ignore Need to Clean Teeth: Toothbrushes usedby only half population from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By JAMES NING, P.26IN THE West at least, it has long been as essential a personal-hygiene instrument as a nailbrush. Infants as well as adults use itat the start and finish of each day, and wouldn't dream oftravelling any distance without it. It's as prominent in TVadvertisements and print ads as on the shelves of pharmacies. Therewas even a song written about it - quite a tribute for a stick ofplastic with a few dozen bristles stuck on one end.Take a bow, toothbrush.But while its use is widespread in developed countries, it is stillfar from ubiquitous in China. Only about half the population of 1.2billion use one, even though it was first imported from the Westearly this century.Old concept: Not that the concept of cleaning one's teeth wasearth-shatteringly new to the country. The well-to-do werepolishing their molars, sans toothbrush, with lumps of rock salt asearly as the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), though the practice wasnever widely popularized.Currently, say national public health officials, about 60 per centof China's 700 million rural dwellers have yet to adopt the use ofa toothbrush, while 10-20 per cent of urbanites also ignore it.Then there are, at a rough count, some 400 million infants andsenior citizens who have no need of one because they have no teeth.The end result: only about 300 million mainland citizens brushtheir teeth regularly.The fact that only one-quarter of the population actually do so hasfor years been of major concern to dental and medical authorities.But shortage of funds has hampered large-scale publicity drives ondental hygiene where it is most needed - in underdeveloped countryareas, most of whose people have never seen a toothbrush, let aloneused one. Many rural folk who now clean their teeth picked up thehabit after seeing town-dwellers doing so.Poverty is another factor that prevents people from adopting suchhealthy habits, lack of money rather than ignorance depriving themof these fundamentals. Equally, strapped-for-cash local healthauthorities are unable to hand out free toothbrushes andtoothpaste, or to mount promotional campaigns. Meanwhile, themajority of people continue to spend surplus money on householdgoods rather than dental hygiene. Their teeth receive attentiononly when giving them problems.China produces some 800 million toothbrushes a year, the majorityof low quality and thus cheap. Those who retail them invariablyhave large inventories because customers tend to use theirtoothbrush for some years before replacing it. A snap survey by themunicipal product-quality monitoring office at major departmentstores in the Haidian district of Beijing last year showed thatmore than 30 per cent of non-brandname brushes had serious defectsand should not have been allowed onto the market.Potential risk: Many users of these brushes are unaware of thepotential risk to their health - an ulcerated mouth or infectedgums, for example. But, say health officials, even much-hypedimported and domestic-brand brushes are not necessarily of aquality that justifies their price tags. And medical experts inBeijing continue to warn that new designs, promoted on TV as being"recommended by most dentists overseas" are not necessarilysuitable for Chinese, or other races for that matter.Last month, reporting China's seventh annual Tooth Protection Day,the Economic Daily carried a special report on dental matters. Itobserved that moneyed people tend to opt for expensive imports inthe belief that dearer is better, while those on tight budgets areoften of necessity forced to disregard quality. The bestdomestically produced toothbrushes, said the report, are just asgood as their foreign counterparts but sell for half the price.Other points:p Of toothbrushes replaced daily in hotel guest rooms, includingsome top hotels, more than 90 per cent fall short of state qualitystandards in one aspect or another, if not completely. This isbecause managements keep such costs to a minimum.p The report's writer could not specify the number of China'stoothbrush producers, but did learn that more than 30 are membersof the Association for Daily Necessities Industry. (Members of suchtrade groups are usually major state-owned enterprises trying tostay in business against the competition of far wealthier jointventures.) Combined, the domestic manufacturers would be aformidable force; currently, most struggle by on their own.However, several toothbrush firms in Wuhan, capital of centralChina's Hubei province, recently formed an industry group to form aunited front.p Most manufacturers have been making the same models since theirfirms were founded years, even decades, ago. Lack of funding andtechnical know-how has prevented them from launching better modelsusing modern materials. Those who have contrived to come up withfresh designs in recent years have found themselves with littlecapital left over to promote their new products. Many of thesematch the design and product quality of those from overseas.p China's toothpaste producers are generally far more successfulwith sales than brush makers. Thus, suggests the report, the twoshould merge their operations in the same way as their powerfulforeign rivals to become more competitive. But this is not possibleat present because the two sectors belong to different industrialareas. Toothpaste manufacturing is part of the chemical industry,toothbrushes the Ministry of Light Industry. Central government,assumes the report, would not be against a merger.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996CHINA: Move West Proves Yugur Salvation from WINDOW, October 25, 1996THE Yugur originated from an ancient nomadic tribe, the Ouigurs,which roamed the Erhun river valley in northwest China during theTang dynasty (618-907). Dogged by foul weather and constant attacksfrom the neighbouring Turkic Kirgiz people, the Ouigurs beganmoving westward in separate groups in the mid-9th century. One ofthe groups emigrated to today's Gansu province, and settled inGuazhou (today's Dunhuang), Ganzhou (Zhangye) and Liangzhou(Wuwei). Because the three places were all in the Hexi Corridor,the former nomads became known as the Hexi Ouigurs.From the mid-11th to 16th centuries, many of those in Guazhouassimilated with local people, thus forming the community now knownas the Yugurs. During the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), the rulersmoved a large number of Yugurs further east to today's Zhangyearea. Through such gradual contact with the neighbouring Hancommunity, the Yugurs started to learn farming and animalhusbandry.Today, about 90 per cent of the 12,000 Yugurs live in Sunan YugurAutonomous County, founded in Zhangye in 1954. A small number ofthem can be found in Huangnibao township, in the Jiuquan area thatborders Zhangye. Blessed with abundant grassland, most Yugurscontinue to work in farming and animal husbandry. Others areengaged in industry, mainly carpet-making, the fur trade and foodprocessing.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996CHINA: FOCUS: Minority Yugurs Profit From Old Cultural Ways: Zhangye resortcontrasts industrial base from WINDOW, October 25, 1996From ZHONG ZHENGXIANG and CHEN JIAN in Zhangye, P.24-25BUSINESS people know Zhangye in China's northeast Gansu province asa burgeoning industrial town. Tourists, however, are drawn to itsLan Hua Ping resort with its picturesque scenery and friendlyYugurs, a culture numbering some 12,000.A recent tour of the resort, 3,000 metres above sea level, whichattracts about 200,000 visitors a year, proves a rewardingexperience.Our approach to the entrance was to the sound of folk songs by agroup of young Yugurs in ethnic dress. Their first greeting was ahada (a piece of white silk used as welcoming gift) and a full cupof qingke wine fermented from highland barley. According to localcustom, we took a sip, dipped the third finger of our right handinto the wine, then flicked it three times to symbolize respect forheaven, earth and the person serving the wine - in this instance aYugur woman. It seems that many tourists, failing to appreciate thedrink's potency, gulp the whole cup and become drunk.Happily we remain sober, and are invited to eight tents bordering ameadow slope, there to be served a Yugur meal. The tents are simplyfurnished with a carpet and low tables and stools. Once we areseated, young women wearing fancy head adornments matching theircolourful dresses serve the steaming hot buttered tea and roastmutton, true highlights of Yugur cuisine.Because the tea is mixed with parched flour and milk as well asbutter, it tastes rich though surprisingly not greasy. The unbonedroast mutton comes in large portions and, as we are reminded, isbest eaten by hand - a greasier experience than the tea andremindful of the bacchanalian heroes of the Chinese classic WaterMargins. But pulling the meat apart requires more skill than we hadrealized.The most delicious part of sheep - the tail and tendons - are byYugur custom usually given to guests, while the shank is forchildren. The tender thigh is reserved for the elderly for obviousreasons. A chef explains that the best roast mutton is neither toolean nor fat. If the former, it will have an unpleasant smell, thelatter too greasy.At meal's end a young man and five girls hurry into the tent. At agesture from the man, the girls start to sing, and when they're infull flow he proposes individual toasts to each visitor in ourgroup. In return, guests have to finish half a cup of the qingkewine. Although the host's warm hospitality is difficult to refuse,we quickly realize the the wisdom of taking only sips, for girlsfollow on his heels to propose their own toasts. The good news isthat the Yugurs will not force a guest to get drunk.Yugur women are very particular about their headwear, whichrepresents their marital status. Married women's headwear is oftentheir precious dowry, inlaid as it is with pearls, diamonds andagates. These form various patterns on a one-metre piece of cottonflannel, which is circled turban-like around the head, with a shortstretch hanging down the back. Unmarried women wear far lessluxurious headwear, characterized by strings of beads adorning theforehead.The Yugurs are divided into two major groups, known as east andwest. The groups share the same language but, verbally, useslightly different delivery. Women's headwear is the mostnoticeable difference between the two groups. The easterners wear aflat-topped design, westerners a "pointed" design.Fortunate tourists - alas we were unlucky - might be invited to alocal wedding ceremony, unique to the Yugurs from time immemorial.On the eve of the wedding, the bride's family hosts a dinner duringwhich a few married women place new headwear on the bride whilegirls sing appropriate songs. When the bride and her attendantleave their tent home the following morning, the bride's face isveiled by a scarf. En route to the groom's tent, the bridal partyis greeted by the groom's friends and relatives, who provide wineand introduce those who have made preparations for the wedding. Bycustom, the bride's family is allowed to be critical of thepreparations, and even turn back if dissatisfied - an embarrassmentthat rarely occurs.As the bride approaches her new tent home, a "battle" breaks out,which ostensibly shocks the guests. Seven or eight young men onhorseback from the bride's side of the union gallop around the tentthree times in a feigned effort to collapse it. The groom and hisfamily remain inside in an equally feigned effort to protect it.When the battle is over, the groom's family takes the horses fromthe riders.When the bride enters the tent's flap, the groom shoots threeharmless "arrows" at her. If one strikes, it means the couple willforever be happy together. Then it's on with the real ceremony,conducted by a senior member of the groom's family. The youngcouple, sitting on separate sides of a carpet, first worship Buddhaand then indicate their respect for each other.Simultaneous with the start of music and singing, guests begin todrink. Then uncles and aunts of the bride officially hand theirniece over to the groom's family. Celebrations continue until thelast guest leaves.Yang Yuxia, a young local tour guide, says that Yugur girls arethese days allowed to marry Han men, a practice that had alwaysbeen forbidden. The change reflects increasing cultural and socialexchanges between the two cultures.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996CHINA: Same Trip Yesterday from WINDOW, October 25, 1996PROBABLY the most famous trip ever made from Xi'an to Lhasa wasmore than 1,300 years ago by a princess on her way to marry theKing of Tubo (now Tibet). As early as the seventh century, Tubo wasestablishing close ties with the Tang dynasty (618-907AD), the mostprosperous in feudal China. In 614, Tubo's King Songtsan Gambo madean offer of marriage to the Tang through Emperor Taizong, andPrincess Wencheng was selected to be the bride.It is not difficult to imagine the hardships of such a long(2,700km) trip, which took the princess and her handmaidens andescorts - headed by special envoy Li Daozong - more than two yearsto reach Lhasa. There, the king had renovated the Potala Palace asa welcome to his bride.Now, with the opening of the Xi'an-Lhasa air route, travellers cancomplete the same distance in little more than the time it takes towatch a movie, about two and half hours. Meanwhile, those who arecurious about the details of the princess' legendary trip canretrace her route, though in far greater comfort than the princess.Now available is a tour called "Princess Wencheng Entering Tibet,"developed by the Tibet Tourism Bureau. Tourists are taken by roadfrom Xi'an to Lhasa in about two weeks. En route they make fourmajor stops for sightseeing and special events.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996CHINA: AVIATION: Jets to Roof of World: A new air route connecting Lhasa toXi'an is expected to harvest tourist gold from WINDOW, October 25, 1996From ZHANG DAN in Xi'an, P.22-23TOURISTS and business travellers are taking advantage of a new,third, air route to Tibet. Recently inaugurated by ChinaSouthwestern Airlines, the sole civil service to offer round tripsto the roof of the world, the new service is between Xi'an -capital of northwestern Shaanxi province - and Lhasa. Its averageseat occupancy rate since starting has been 57.3 per cent.While this rate is still almost 10 per cent below the annualaverage for China's civil carriers overall, a spokesman for ChinaSouthwestern, which ranks fourth among the country's six majorairlines, says it is confident of filling more seats during thenext peak tourism season, summer 1997. "It's a new route, and maystill be unknown to many tour and ticketing agents," he says.The maiden Xi'an-Lhasa flight was by a 198-seat Boeing 757 whichleft Xianyang International Airport, 25km north of Xi'an, with 159passengers. Just two-and-a-half hours later it touched down atGongar Airport, 100km outside Lhasa. The plane returned to Xi'anthe same day with 38 passengers.As of September 11, more than 4,000 passengers had used the newroute, whose opening gives Tibet-bound travellers both a convenientand interesting option to China Southwestern's two establishedroutes. Previously, people had to choose either Chengdu, capital ofsouthwestern Sichuan Province, or Chongqing - also in Sichuan - astheir starting point for Lhasa. Now, those beginning their journeysin the north, Beijing for example, are finding it more convenientto fly from Xi'an.In marketing potential, the airline and China's tourist agenciesvalue the Xi'an-Lhasa route above the two Sichuan options. AfterBeijing, Xi'an is high on most tourism itineraries because of thefamous terra-cotta warriors and horses of Emperor Qin Shihuang,dating back 2,200 years.This acknowledged wonder of the world helps make Xi'an one of thecountry's most popular tourist destinations. In 1995, it receivednearly 400,000 international visitors, a number that is growing byseven per cent every year. Meanwhile, at the other end of theroute, Lhasa, with its splendid Potala Palace, is an irresistibleattraction to countless tourists. Last year, Tibet received morethan 30,000 international tourists. It expects some five per centmore this year.Golden Route: China Southwestern press officer Yi Shizhong says theairline is actively promoting the new flight to international anddomestic travel agencies and ticketing agents. "We believe it willbecome a golden tourism route" - a view confirmed by the fact thatseveral Chinese airlines competed for the Xi'an-Lhasa licence. TheCivil Aviation Administration of China's decision to grant it toChina Southwestern was due to the airline's 40-year, accident-freerecord in flying over the Tibetan Plateau, where blizzards andjagged snow-clad peaks combine to test the nerve of pilots. "Weimpose the strictest safety regulations to ensure that our flightsover the 'third pole on the planet' are safe," says Yi. "Fourdecades of safe flying speaks for itself."To date, the airline has made more than 24,000 flights to and fromTibet, carrying a total of 2.8 million passengers and 10,000 tonsof freight.Since 1994, China Southwestern has opened two other Tibet airroutes. One of them, Chengdu to Bangda in eastern Tibet, was madepossible by the construction of an airport encircled by 4,000m-highmountains. The other is Chongqing-Lhasa. Prior to 1994, the airlinehad only two routes: Chengdu-Lhasa and Lhasa-Kathmandu, the capitalof Nepal.At present, the airline operates 44 Boeing 757 flights a week onfive routes over Tibet. "They are the newest and most reliableplanes in [our] fleet," says Yi. Some 300,000 passengers per yearfly China Southwestern to and from Tibet, a vast increase againstthe services' early years.Independent tourists: Yi believes the new Xi'an-Lhasa service willfurther promote Tibet's economic and tourism growth. However, forforeign independent tourists, visiting Tibet isn't simply a case ofbuying and flying. A little planning and paperwork is necessary inadvance.According to the Tibetan Autonomous Region's tourism bureau - "toensure foreign tourists' safety in Tibet" - international touristsmust travel in organized groups with special visas. Ticketingagents can decline to sell air tickets to Tibet to individualtravellers without proper visas.Tibet-bound visas: There are more than 40 travel agencies in Tibetwith government authority to receive tourists organized by theirbusiness partners abroad. These agencies are responsible fornotifying Chinese embassies in foreign countries to issue visasdirectly to Tibet-bound tourist groups.But, for the convenience of independent tourists already in Chinawho wish to visit Tibet and may be unaware of the restriction, theTibetan Tourism Bureau has opened information offices in Chengdu,Xi'an and Golmud, a railhead in northwestern Qinghai province whereoverland travellers transfer to buses for the long onward ride toLhasa. There is also an office in Kathmandu. All these offices canissue visas on the spot to foreign travel agents and foreignindependent tourists who have grouped together, after necessarycontacts have been made with local Tibetan agencies."In principle, Tibet doesn't allow nor receive individualinternational tourists," says an official of the Tibetan TourismBureau. "However, quite a number of them just travel overland fromports on the China-Nepal border or Golmud." The local governmenturges such tourists, who often display their adventurous spirit bymanaging to travel across the formidable but challenging TibetanPlateau by bus - or even bicycle - to form groups upon theirarrival in Lhasa. To provide for their likely needs, a specialtravel agency was set up in 1994. Called Lhasa Minjian (meaningnon-official) Travel Agency, the unit can make travel arrangementsfor their further exploration of Tibet."A lot of individual international travellers come and go withoutletting us know," comments a Tibetan tourism bureau official,surmising that most are either unaware of the regulations orworried that the procedure for obtaining a special visa is toocomplicatedHowever, because Tibetans are eager to boost their tourism industryand enrich the regional economy, they interpret the term "touristgroup" in the most-flexible way possible. "As a matter of fact, asfew as two people can make up a group," observes one official, "soit's not a difficult thing.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996CHINA: POLICY: Opening up In a New Era: China stays open to foreign funds,with some policy adjustments from WINDOW, October 25, 1996From Chen Gengtao in Beijing, P.20-21SEVENTEEN years into the country's opening to the outside world,more and more Chinese can barely get through a day without usingsomething whose origin was in a foreign land. They may ride in aSantana car to work, make long-distance calls with a Motorolacellular phone, drink Beck's beer and wash their hair with Luxshampoo.These products have two things in common: they are all foreignbrands, and they are all made in China - mostly by joint ventures,a few by wholly-owned foreign manufacturers. The car, for example,is made by Germany's Volkswagen and its Chinese partner inShanghai.The open policy advocated by retired leader Deng Xiaoping, andvigorously implemented by the government over the years, hasbenefited the Chinese as well as their country. More than 17million people have found generally well-paid jobs in foreign-funded enterprises, increasing numbers of them now boasting USdollar accounts in the bank. Products they consume and use,including table wines, toothbrushes, shoes, elevators, televisionsand cars, are of far better quality than ever before.Thanks partly to the presence of foreign businesses which havebrought with them investment capital, technology and managementexpertise, the Chinese economy has been able to grow at an annualaverage rate of 12 per cent in the last five years. In 1995 alone,foreign-funded enterprises paid close to 70 billion yuan (US$8.4billion) in taxes, almost one-tenth of national tax revenues. Alsolast year, with its total imports and exports amounting to $280billion, China ranked 10th among the world's top trading nations.Its dramatic emergence as a trading nation is due largely to itsopen policy: foreign-funded enterprises accounted for about 40 percent of total imports and exports last year. In the first quarterof this year, they rose to 45.9 per cent. And by May this year,China's foreign exchange reserves reached $85 billion.The open policy is one of two legs with which China is to achievemodernization, according to Deng Xiaoping's design. The other legis economic reform, which has entered the phase of establishing amarket economy. As China begins to execute its 9th Five-Year Planthis year, and with the 21st century only five years away, thegovernment has formulated a development programme covering the next15 years - a blueprint adopted by the National People's Congress atits general session last March.Wider opening: Consistent with the open policy, the programme laysdown a number of principles for the future, the most general onebeing to "open wider to the outside world," as Premier Li Peng toldthe NPC. Says Lin Qihui, an official of the Special Economic ZonesOffice under the central government: "This means primarily thatChina will increase its openness in terms of geographical area andbusiness scope."Geographically, we will promote more foreign investment in citiesalong major transport lines, and establish foreign investment zonesin provincial capitals. In [terms of] business scope, we willgradually allow foreign businesses to play a greater role in fieldswhere they have been more or less restricted, such as mining,banking, retailing and insurance."Another principle is to "improve quality" in the actualimplementation of the open policy. This, according to Lin, meansbroadening the economic efficiency and returns of all projectsinvolving foreign investment. Simply, China will become choosier inapproving new projects. "[Those] that use new and high technologieswill be encouraged, and those which pollute the environmentrejected," Lin says, adding that the administration and taxation offoreign-funded enterprises will be reinforced.Other major principles include the operation of foreign-fundedinvestments in accordance with market economics, with future growthrelying mainly on improved management and the use of advancedtechnologies rather than on the launching of more projects.Tariff slash: Preferential policies too will be substituted by"increasing the vitality" of enterprises, thus giving them theimpetus for future growth. Indeed, from April 1 this year, foreign-funded enterprises have no longer enjoyed tax exemptions onimported manufacturing equipment. China has also slashed its tariffrates from an average 35.9 per cent to 23 per cent.Economists predict that the revocation of preferential treatmentwill not affect foreign-funded operations that rely mainly ontechnology. But it will create difficulties for those that have allalong relied mainly on tax breaks for profits. Revocation of thesebreaks also means that Chinese and foreign-funded enterprises nowcompete on an equal footing, the government says.With political stability and a huge market, China is confident ofits continued attraction to foreign investors. The governmentexpects to receive a further $150 billion in foreign directinvestment in the next five years. That is big money indeed, thougha continued influx of such investment is seen as but a naturalwidening of foreign interest in China over the past 17 years.By the end of 1995, China had approved a total of 260,000 foreign-funded enterprises, almost half of which have gone into operation.Aggregate foreign investment reached $135 billion, making China theworld's second-largest recipient after the United States.Coastal zones: Over the years, China has established five SpecialEconomic Zones along its coast, opened Pudong New Area - aSingapore-size piece of land wedged between the East China Sea andShanghai proper - and established Suzhou Industrial Park, also nearShanghai, with the Singapore Government as its partner. (Window,August 9) All have become major centres of foreign investment.Also playing host to foreign largesse are 32 state-level economicand technological development zones, mainly in coastal cities. Manyof them have become economic powerhouses, too. In the economic andtechnological development zone of Tianjin, a port city in northChina, for example, America's Motorola has been making pagers andcellular phones in huge quantities and will soon make computerphones and chips. Its investment in the zone has reached $1billion.Foreign-funded operations can now in fact be found almosteverywhere across the country, from Xinjiang in the far northwestto Hainan Island in the South China Sea, Tibet to Inner Mongolia.Thanks to paramount leader Deng's open policy, the PRC has becomeincreasingly economically integrated with the rest of the world.Now, with the "open wider" policy adopted by the government, thereseems no limit to what the country can achieve in the future.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996CHINESE MEDIA: What The Chinese Papers Say: Qian Misquoted: Distortion ofwhat Qian said during interview: From a commentary in the Ta Kung Pao,October 18 from WINDOW, October 25, 1996IN REPLY to questions from staff reporters of the Asian Wall StreetJournal as to whether demonstrations to commemorate the June 4incident be allowed in Hong Kong after 1997, Chinese ForeignMinister Qian Qichen said: "Hong Kong should not hold thosepolitical activities which directly interfere in the affairs of themainland of China."On the question of Hong Kong media being critical of Chinesepolitics or leaders, Qian replied: "They can put forward criticism,but not rumours or lies. Nor can they put forward personal attackson Chinese leaders."As it is clear from the context of the report, Qian said no morethan to reiterate China's consistent position of implementing the"one country, two systems" scenario and the principle of Hong Kongpeople ruling Hong Kong.But it should be remembered the vital importance of respect for therule of law and the counsel of "keeping well water and river waterseparate" if the "one country, two systems" scenario is not to beundermined.While it is important that the mainland should not interfere in thecapitalist system and way of life in Hong Kong, nor should HongKong interfere in the mainland's socialist system. Respect for eachother provides the space for each to conduct their affairs in theirown way.Enshrined in the Basic Law, the letter and spirit of theseprinciples, are accepted by the vast majority of Hong Kong people.In reiterating these principle, Qian had no intention of suggestingthat the China is tightening its control of Hong Kong. There is nocause to stir up a storm in a teacup from what Qian told the staffreporters of the AWSJ.The incident of Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe and the media fervourit created in Hong Kong is blatantly a case of interfering inChina's internal affairs. Moreover it also violated the territory'simmigration laws.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996CHINESE MEDIA: What The Chinese Papers Say: Time to Move: It is time toseek return of the Diaoyus: From an editorial in the Sing Tao Daily News,October 16 from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By GERALD CHEN, P.19SO FAR the moderate stance maintained by Beijing with regard to theDiaoyu issland issue has caused considerable misunderstanding amongChinese within China as well as abroad. Under these circumstances,we were heartened by news conveyed recently by Hong Kong members ofthe Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from topChinese leaders that Beijing is prepared "to lose a thousand ouncesof gold, rather than give in an inch to territory" - quoting aChinese proverb. This reassuring message can be understood to meanthat all necessary strategic precautions have been put in place byChina.It was disclosed that Chia did not refrain from from demanding theimmediate return of the Diaoyus for economic reasons. Moreimportant, it was because of the wrongful involvement of the US inthe Diaoyus issue that a settlement must wait until "an appropriatetime," although it is still unknown when that appropriate timewould be.In his written reply to the Japanese media last week, Chinese Vice-Premier (and foreign minister) Qian Qichen stated that in bothagreements signed between China and Japan in l972 and 1978 it wasagreed that the Diaoyu issued should be shelved and its settlementshould be left to posterity. This commitment was the greatesthindrance to efforts seeking the return of the Diaoyus.But now that Japan has categorically denied that there ever wassuch an understanding, it stands to reason that China no longerneed to feel bound by any commitment and would be in a position toseek the return of these islands. Indeed, it might be taken as asign of weakness to be taken advantage of by Japan if China were tocontinue with its hitherto mild stance on the issue.It is true that China must tread carefully because of the USinvolvement. However, as one can gather from the US spokesman'sstatements on the subject, Washington does not wish to get furtherinvolved in this issue, most probably because it has realized itsmistake in placing the Diaoyus under the administration of Okinawain 1971.The present international climate makes it mandatory forterritorial disputes to be resolved without the use of armed force.In the case of the Diaoyus, resorting to the use of force can onlygive Japan additional excuse to expand its military build-up, whichwould not be in interest of regional stability.Many are in China's favour in its dispute with Japan over theDiaoyus if the issue is sorted out without the use of force.Historians know that the Diaoyus used to be under the jurisdictionof Taiwan. The island group never had anything to do with Okinawaat all. This is not only because the Diaoyus were formallydesignated as a part of Taiwan in 1862; evidence of this can alsobe found in Okinawan and Japanese  history books.Japan most probably first decided to seize the Diaoyus in 1894,although it was the Shimonoseki Treaty signed at the end of Sino-Japanese War of 1895 which ended in China's humiliating defeat thatput the Diaoyus under the administration of Okinawa. Taiwan wasalso annexed by Japan as a result of the Shimonoseki Treaty.When the US took over Okinawa after World War II, the Diaoyus werealso considered within the administration of Okinawa. Okinawa andthe Diaoyus were "handed back" to Japan by virtue of an US-Japaneseagreement signed in 1971.The point is, Japan's claim to the Diaoyus was already nullifiedbecause the unequally Shimonoseki Treaty had been abolished (by theCairo Agreement of 1943 and the Potsdam Agreement of 1945). Thereis no legal basis whatsoever to Japan's sovereign claim to theDiaoyu islands.Although, properly speaking, administration of the Diaoyus shouldstill belong to Taiwan, it stands to reason that any diplomaticeffort seeking the return of these islands can only be conducted byChina with Japan.No doubt Japan is not about to give up it claim to the Diaoyuseasily.But all reason is on China's side, in the light of internationallaws and otherwise, even if the issue goes before internationaltribunal.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996COMMENTARY: BACKSTREET JAPAN: Child Abuse from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By R.J. GUTHRIE, P.18UNSOLICITED solicitations in the daily post for everything fromhome-delivered masseuses to bargain leases on BMWs is anotherunwelcome sign of Japan's wealth. Many make interesting reading.Some are downright scary, like a recent deluxe mailing telling meabout a pre-kindergarten for one-year-olds. Since our youngest isin his third year at university I almost threw it away. But then Inoticed the glossy colour pictures showing something that lookedmore like an upscale athletic club than a creche. So I read itspitch.It seems this particular school is telling Japanese mothers thatit's never too young to get on the education treadmill; that theirchildren should start learning something now and begin masteringthose particular skills eventually needed to get them accepted byTokyo or Waseda universities. Some may call this progress. I tendto see it as child abuse, and another example of a society blessedwith more money than sense.Preschool education has been a big business in Japan for quite sometime and has become a lucrative business for entrepreneurs moreconcerned with bottom lines than children. At last count, therewere 8,600 privately run kindergartens in Japan with 77,800teachers and an enrolment of 1.47 million.. This is more than fourtimes the number of public-run facilities.Some of the "top rated" kindergartens have unofficial ties withuniversities in that X kindergarten is a stepping stone to Xelementary school, then X middle school, and finally X high schoolleading to entrance in X university 15 years later. Thesekindergartens can cost up to US$1,300 to $2,000 per month,including "unofficial" and supplemental fees, and entrance is ascompetitive as it is at Oxford or Harvard.Education mamas: Sound ridiculous? Well, it doesn't to Japan'smillions of kyoikyu (education) mamas, the hybrid Japanese nounused to describe and decry those mothers whose sole purpose in lifeis to ensure their children pass the entrance examinations at a topuniversity. These are the mothers that send their six-year-old tojuku or privately run cram schools for around three hours a dayafter school, six and sometimes seven days a week.The accent is not on personal enlargement or even acquiringknowledge. Rather it is on rote mastery of the material of and waysneeded to pass entrance examinations to the more desirable schoolsthat requires living for 15 years in the "examination hell'" as theJapanese themselves call this process. This disquieting phenomenonhas now, it seems, filtered down to the toddler level.Kiysohi Takara, a clinical psychologist, recently published a bookwith the rather ponderous title Warning! Dangerous PreschoolEducation - A Clinical Report condemning the sort of services beingprovided by the kindergarten that sent me its glossy catalogue. DrTakara says that while education at a young age is not the onlycause of children's problems, it does cause them to lose any spiritof independence. It puts heavy pressure on them and drives them onto a sort of mental treadmill. Parents are forcing their youngchildren to become "smart" and the children feel an immensepressure to do what they are being told - to live up to "A-grade"expectations at their kindergartens, for example. This, in turn,places a terrible burden on the parent-child relationship. Aspreschool education drives children to go faster and higher thanothers, they lose self-confidence in the process and feel morerestless. This accumulates a tremendous amount of stress and moreand more children are even "losing the ability to cry as an SOSsignal."Other, equally respected experts have been saying for years thatchildren who are forced to use their brains too much in the earlystages of development lack emotional stability. There are dozens ofpublished case studies on three-year-olds suffering from stress.This is disturbing, even in a country where dying of overwork isofficially classified as an "occupational hazard."Even more worrying is that a vast number of parents see nothingbasically wrong with the present accent on education, and believethat schooling is the means to all desirable ends. As Japan'swealth has multiplied and the extended family declined, manyparents have abrogated their responsibilities for child-rearing tothe schools. Whatever the reason, the young people today areworrying their elders like never before. The first, spoiled progenyof Japan's economic boom and the sons and daughters of theprototype "education mamas" are now in their early twenties. Theysee themselves as Japan's first "lost generation."Several immensely popular television shows make big advertisingdollars by making fun of them. One regularly spotlights fashionableyoung women who take an almost perverse pride in not being able toboil an egg or fry rice. While presented as comedy, such shows aregiving a once-satisfied older generation another reason to worryabout where they have gone wrong.Critics more serious than those who appear on television - which inJapan includes your average cabdriver, bottle washer, and noodlecook - see the rise of the Aum Shinrikyo subway-gassers and dozensof less homicidal yet equally strange cults as natural outgrowthsof fallen educational and parental values.Today's younger people feel a spirit-sucking emotional andphilosophical vacuum in modern Japan. Most of my son's moreintelligent friends have no intention of becoming part of theeconomic juggernaut that their elders worked so hard to build. Ilike to think this is a hopeful sign, and that tomorrow's Japanwill be a lot more human, a little more green, and a lot less self-centred. I do know for certain that none of them will ever dream ofsending their one-year-olds to a fast-track kindergarten.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996COMMENTARY: WINDOW FORUM: Arrogance of a Ruler from WINDOW, October 25, 1996P.16SZE CHEUNG PANG: Member of the Chinese People's PoliticalConsultative Conference and one of the earliest investors in China.Sze is an authority on economic development in China and Hong Kongand has published many articles on the subject.SOON after Governor Chris Patten came to Hong Kong, he pushed forpolitical reform and set in motion a Sino-British argument. Thiswas condemned by former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser,writing in an Australian newspaper, who said that Patten was tryingto teach China how to manage its own country, and pointing outPatten's ulterior and destructive intention.Patten immediately rebutted, explaining that he only wished tostage a "fair election," and not teach China how to administer. ButPatten completely forgets this statement and continues to dictateto China how it should manage the Hong Kong Special Administrativeregion. The degree of arrogance and ignorance is simply beyondforbearance.Patten uses the term "successor" throughout his policy address forthe first chief executive of the SAR. This is also a demonstrationof utter stupidity. The resumption of sovereignty of China overHong Kong means an absolute end of British colonial rule, and astart of a new era for Hong Kong.There is nothing in the handover that suggests a political natureof continuance or succession between the governor and the SAR chiefexecutive. Handover of sovereignty is to be carried out betweenBritain and China, and the first chief executive will receive hisauthority from China, and not from the governor.Patten's statement violates the rules governing the handing over ofHong Kong's authority as stipulated in the Sino-British JointDeclaration. He is continuing to stir up public opinion on"returning rule to Hong Kong people."Patten's rule of Hong Kong is not up to standard. He is thereforenot qualified to talk about "Hong Kong's success story" or "theprinciples of governing Hong Kong."Basic Law guide: Furthermore, he deliberates on the necessity ofChina signing two international covenants. This is absurd. In hispolicy address, he listed out 10 key elements for future SAR plansand 16 benchmarks for judging the future Hong Kong. The chiefexecutive has the Basic Law as guiding principles ofadministration; the Basic Law is also the best benchmark forappraisal. The 10 elements and the 16 benchmarks are alreadyembodied in the Basic Law.In the section on the 16 benchmarks, Patten let himself go and inmany places talks about "pressure by Peking; "objectives dictatedby Peking" and makes other high-sounding but meaningless points. Hespeaks as if the decisive factor for Hong Kong's future successlies in whether it can act against Beijing. His ulterior motive isobvious, and is particularly strong at this moment when his leavingis imminent.Patten refers to Hong Kong's autonomy several times in the policyaddress. He says that before Britain leaves Hong Kong, it, besidestrying its best to retain a certain value, will also strive to makesure that Hong Kong will enjoy autonomy in social and economicaffairs as at present.He also insists, "my anxiety is this: not that this community'sautonomy would be usurped by Peking, but that it could be givenaway bit by bit by some people in Hong Kong," and calls on HongKong people to "defend and assert" for autonomy. An Englishgovernor, endowed with absolute power to fulfil colonial rule inHong Kong, deliberates on autonomy!Slave-master: This is just like a slave-master talking aboutautonomy to his slaves, and is the most ludicrous farce underheaven. It is simply deceptive to say that Hong Kong has autonomy.Hong Kong people don't even have the right to elect their governor,and final judicial judgement lies with Britain; where does autonomycomes in?Hong Kong will have autonomy only after its return to China. Atpresent there does not exist a problem as to who has ruined HongKong's autonomy. Hong Kong's autonomy is granted by China, so therewould not be a problem of its being "usurped by Peking." Pattenbases these opinions on visits by some Hong Kong people to Beijing,which he calls "surreptitious appeal" or "closed-door lobbying,"and that "it draws Chinese officials into matters which should fallsquarely within the autonomy of Hong Kong."This is simply absurd. It is in Hong Kong people's interest tostand by the Chinese Government to counteract the damage andinterruption caused by Patten on Hong Kong's smooth transition.This is fair and embodies Hong Kong people's responsibility asmasters of the place. We who have been under colonial rule will nolonger be submissive subjects at Britain's beck and call. In theeyes of Patten, this is the worst heresy. This clearly reveals histrue picture as a guardian of colonialism.That an ignorant and arrogant British politician has a chance tofan flames of disorder at the final stage of Hong Kong's transitionis in itself a misfortune brought about by history.What is fortunate is that Hong Kong people are more and more awareof the real colours of Patten, and have completely forsaken him.Lu Xun, a great Chinese author, once said: "Some people wish to beimmortal, but rot more quickly than the earth." Patten is exactlysuch a figure.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996HONGKONG: HEALTH: Patten Dogged by UK Rabies Control Law: Pet pooches facelong confinement from WINDOW, October 25, 1996From CHRIS JASPER in London, P.15CHRIS Patten has once again been accused of exploiting his positionas governor of Hong Kong in order to intervene in British politics- this time on behalf of his pet dogs Whisky and Soda.In November last year Patten backed UK tax cuts and theConservative Party's lurch to the right in a move seemingly incontradiction of his required neutrality as a civil servant. Thecomments led to calls for his resignation.And last week the governor threw himself into UK politics for asecond time when he gave a high-profile interview in which hecalled for the scrapping of quarantine laws aimed at keeping thekiller disease rabies out of Britain.Patten had made remarks critical of quarantine in the past - and inMay he was accused of making a personal plea to former cabinetcolleagues for a change in the law, the details of which Window cannow confirm.The governor's most recent outburst followed the revelation thatBritish agriculture minister Douglas Hogg had proposed a review ofthe world's toughest rabies controls, in force since 1901.Passports: Details of the proposed move to a "passports-for-pets"scheme - featuring strict vaccination and blood testing and animalidentification by means of implanted microchips - were circulatedto cabinet ministers last month. And when the controversial planwas later leaked to the press, Patten popped up to endorse it."Like thousands of diplomats, service and business families aroundthe world, I feel the present British quarantine rules arepreposterous," he told The Times in an interview conducted onOctober 13. "And yes, I have told the prime minister what I think."Patten added: "There is just no scientific basis for them and theyrisk cruelty to animals. But with new safeguards we can get rid ofthe rules without undermining public health."Unfortunately for the governor and his two Norfolk terriers, eventhe reformers envisage abandoning quarantine only for EuropeanUnion countries and rabies-free islands such as Cyprus and Malta.And though Hong Kong is notionally rabies free, it is no island.Desperate to win his pampered pooches a reprieve from thecompulsory six-months behind bars - cost around 2,000 (HK$24,000)per dog - Patten was moved to call for the extension of the schemeworld-wide."I think it would be very curious if they applied it just to the EUand not generally," he said. "Provided the animals carry amicrochip, have been inoculated, have a certificate, and are testedon arrival in Britain, it should not make too much difference whichcountry they come from."In its front-page article, The Times also indicated that Pattenhoped Britain would reach cross-party consensus on the issue beforehis dogs were forced into kennels next summer, while GovernmentHouse sought to make light of his remarks. "The governor hasbasically said the same thing over and over again," said aspokesman. "And though he's definitely going to bring Whisky andSoda back to UK, he understands that any change in the law will betoo late for him."Perhaps - but a personal approach made by Patten earlier this yearand reported in The Spectator on May 25 suggests that he will notgive up that easily. Discussing the quarantine debate, the magazineremarked: "The word in Westminster is that Patten has been makingnoises on the subject to Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine."Window can now reveal that those "noises" were made when thegovernor was visiting Britain and had a private chat withHeseltine, during which he suggested that diplomats and othersshould be partly exempt from the quarantine law.Says a source: "What Patten wanted was some sort of fast-trackthrough quarantine of the type being demanded by army officersserving in Cyprus. They seem to think they are more deserving than- let us say - the 70,000 Britons living in Spain."Significantly, new government pointers this week suggest that auniversal fast-track quarantine of just two months is underconsideration, and that Patten may get his way - although whetherany changes could be made before next June is debatable. Eitherway, the governor's stance on the issue has already made him newenemies in Britain, with Guy Tamplin, chairman of the QuarantineKennel Owners Association, accusing him of a "gross misuse of hispublic position."Says Tamplin: "He's abusing his job to campaign in his owninterests. And he's a government appointee, so it's not even as ifhe can claim to be expressing the views of constituents. Let's hopehe didn't employ public funds or time in pursuing this personalcrusade.""One of the animals once went missing for four days," he recalls."And the other was locked up for biting someone. On top of thatthere is virulent hook worm in Hong Kong, so I don't think theircase is very strong." Tamplin also calls into question theeffectiveness of anti-rabies vaccines, claiming that in many casesthey fail to produce enough antibodies. Yet his objections willcount for little if the Ministry of Agriculture has made up itsmind.But though new legislation may be in the pipeline, Patten mustplace Whisky and Soda in kennels in January to be sure of a Julyreunion. And as the pair will be required for myriad photoopportunities when he resumes his political career, their earlydeparture still seems likely.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996HONGKONG: WELFARE: Home-alone Law Plea: Handover hampers Legcodeliberations from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By JUANITO CONCEPCION, P.14WHEN home-alone Chan Chi-ho, aged five, almost burned to death aweek ago in a padlocked public housing flat in Kwai Chung, thecommunity was understandably outraged - rightly feeling thatlocking up small children and leaving them unattended, even for ashort period, is unforgivable because it is a blatantlyirresponsible invitation to tragedy.Despite the appalling burns to 60 per cent of the child's body andthe collective outrage it generated, chances are that a similar oreven more serious accident will occur in coming months, warn childwelfare activists. For Chan was far from the first child to be leftin such a situation, witness the prosecutions and resultant widepublicity of recent years, but some parents never learn.Activists' fears stem from three major factors: the ineptitude ofrelevant government departments, glaring loopholes in differentpieces of legislation on child welfare and protection, and theirresponsibility of parents themselves.Under current laws, a parent or guardian who leaves a childunattended is not liable to any penalty, even if the victim dies oris injured in an accident - serious or otherwise.Grey area: Says Cynthia Luk, division supervisor at St JamesSettlement: "It's [the practice of leaving children unattended] agrey area, and it's not prosecutable right now because it doesn'tfall under any ordinance. Unless it's defined clearly in the law asa form of child abuse, I don't think there will be a strong andeffective deterrent against this malpractice." She says St Jameshas yet to firm up its position on this issue.In the past, the group has always advocated education rather thanprosecution as a more effective tool in addressing problematicissues. The volunteer agency believes that prosecuting erringparents can be counter-productive as it can generate theirhostility and anger, and make reunion with their children moredifficult.Luk concedes, however, that while some parents change througheducation, others do not respond despite reminders and warnings ofthe consequences of leaving their children unattended. "There arehindrances in Chinese society and culture in resolving problemsinvolving parents and their children," she says. "Chinese peopleare moderate, and very reluctant to resort to legal action."If legislation is passed, the consequences of penalties that wouldbe imposed on adults, or the parents, would have to be carefullyconsidered as they may adversely affect the welfare and interestsof their children."The community's ambivalence over this issue was clearlydemonstrated when the government sponsored a public consultationmore than a year ago on how home-alone children could best beprotected. Luk recalls that the consultation exercise failed toproduce a consensus on a way forward.Against-Child-Abuse director Priscilla Lui argues that the act ofleaving children unattended should fall under neglect - one of thefour classifications of child abuse currently punishable under thelaw. The others embrace the physical, psychological and sexual.However, the Home Affairs Branch is reluctant to define home-alonesituations as a form of child abuse, Lui asserts. HAB isresponsible for overseeing the implementation of the package oflegislation, passed in July last year on child care and protection.She says: "Nobody wants to penalize anybody, especially if a home-alone child dies. Nobody wants to impose a further burden on theparty who is responsible for a tragedy. What we're saying is thatdefining home-alone situations doesn't mean jailing anybody. It'ssimply putting a problem in focus which can be likened to a doctormaking a diagnosis that helps him determine the right remedy to amedical problem."She stresses the importance of classifying home-alone cases as aform of child abuse because it will set a baseline in the communityon how young children should properly be taken care of. "Our realintention is to see better and more effective protection forchildren, not erring parents and child minders being placed behindbars."ACA has recommended an increase in the options for punishing erringparents and guardians of home-alone children. These include adviceor reprimand; payment of fines; rendering community service; andjail.Luk complains that Hong Kong, unlike the US, Canada and otherWestern countries, does not have comprehensive legislation forprotecting and promoting the rights of children, as well asvigorously tackling the problem of child abuse.As Legco's agenda is full for its final session before next year'shandover, the prospects of it adopting new legislation thataddresses the home-alone problem does not look promising, says Luk.ACA's Lui concurs, even as she laments the seemingly high level oftolerance among policymakers and the community over tragic thetragic incidence of children being badly injured while locked up athome and left unattended by their parents or guardians.At its 13th conference in Geneva early this month, the UnitedNations Committee on the Rights of the Child attacked Hong Kong'spoor record in protecting and promoting the rights of children. TheUK, a signatory to the (separate) UN Convention on the Rights ofthe Child, filed a report on behalf of Hong Kong.Legco also slammed the government's shortcomings in a report ittabled at the Geneva conference which criticized the government'sstatistics on child abuse and neglect as incomplete anduncoordinated. It is thus doubtful if the figures, says the report,"present a true picture of the problem."The Legco report also quoted the coroner's 1994 statistics whichshowed there were 113 deaths between 1989 and 1994 involvingunattended children under the age of nine.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996HONGKONG: EDUCATION: Instilling the Blithe Spirit of Learning: Plan todrive boredom out of classroom from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By ANNA YUE, P.12-13A BLACKBOARD revolution is set to sweep over the curriculum forlocal secondary school students - a wide-ranging EducationDepartment initiative to make their studies more fun, thus moreeffective. As a result, bored-with-school youngsters could findthemselves chalking up far better grades than ever before.The fun-factor innovation was disclosed by Brenda Lo, secretary ofa department steering committee set up in mid-1993 to "coordinatethe design and implementation of appropriate curricula and relatedactivities to promote pleasurable and effective learning" - aconcept whose various components are geared towards the common goalof making learning a happier experience.A joint survey by the Education Department and the University ofHong Kong's curriculum studies department of 610 students from alltypes of school shows that only 30 per cent of secondary pupilsfind studying enjoyable. Sixty per cent describe it as "OK," whilethe remainder confess to being unhappy about studying anyway.The majority of respondents agree that a school's study environmentand the relationship between friends, family members and teacherscan greatly affect their study mood. The most important factorsaffecting their motivation to study were the teaching method andatmosphere of the school.Experiences: Conducted in 1994, the survey was in two parts. In thefirst, students were asked to list and rank their pleasant andunpleasant experiences, and factors leading to them. Questionnairesfor the second part were set according to the results of the first.The final report of the survey, still under review, will beproduced late next month. Its release will coincide with a November29 seminar for secondary school principals and teachers who willdiscuss the findings and share experiences on the promotion ofpleasurable and effective learning.Lo emphasizes that the focus of the survey was both how muchstudents enjoy studying, and how effectively they learn - bothaspects being of equal importance. She says there is a chance theEducation Department will change the design of the curriculum toreinforce students' learning motive, and make studying fun. "Thisis exactly the goal of the survey," she says. "Because it foundthat the relationship with friends and teachers can influencestudents' interest in learning, we would bear these factors in mindwhen redesigning the curriculum to make learning fun and effectivefor them."Betty Wong, who has taught Form 1-4 at Chinese Holiness College forthree years, believes many students do not find studyingpleasurable because of off-school attractions such as karaoke andvideo games. "Another reason is related to the problems thatteachers face. The curriculum is often boring and difficult, andnot many teachers are able to make it lively for students," shesays. "Teachers have a very heavy workload; apart from teaching,there is a huge amount of administrative work, so there is no timeleft to prepare interesting, motivating material for students."Wong also points to parent-child relationships as a cause ofstudents' lack of motivation. Many of her own students have nosiblings. "They are neglected by parents, and usually brought up bygrandparents. They are spoiled and lack discipline. During class,some day-dream and others talk or sleep." She feels that suchchildren lack self-confidence, and are deserving of the concern andencouragement of teachers.She recalls a successful case with a student who had a pooracademic record. After he was charged with organizing some extra-curricular activities, his self-esteem greatly improved -triggering pleasure in his studies and better academic results.Ankey Wun, a teacher for six years and currently involved inteacher-training for target-oriented curricula, agrees there aremany reasons for students' inability to learn happily andeffectively. For example, the Education Department's limitedresources restrict secondary students with poor academic recordsfrom repeating a grade more than twice. "Some students need torepeat more than this," he argues, "but as the system does notallow it, they cannot catch up in an upper form. This adverselyaffects their enjoyment of study."Wun also points to the transitory teenage years, when boys andgirls are developing independence. "But the Hong Kong educationalsystem does not encourage independent thinking," he says. "Thislimits their strengths and preferences, such as creativity. As theyare not allowed to develop independence in school, it leads todissatisfaction." He notes that as many teachers do not holdeducation certificates, they may not know the correct way to teacheffectively.Wun's solution: a more flexible curriculum, which is part of hisrole in his current post in aiming to improve the level ofhappiness and effectiveness in learning. Under target-orientedcurricula - at present restricted to primary students - youngstersare taught through activities such as games and competitions, usingexamples from daily life to better explain concepts and ideas.Ultimately, it is believed, students' interests are aroused andtheir performance improved. Wun says the Education Department plansto introduce this method to secondary schools in 2001. Meanwhile,he hopes more clerks can be employed to relieve teachers'administrative burdens.Student view: Window spoke with various secondary studentsincluding, during his mid-morning break, Daniel Kwan, who is in F2at Kowloon Wah Yan College. Kwan says he is happy with school life,and particularly delighted with the new-found freedom he finds atsecondary level. "In primary school there were so many restrictionsand lots of regimentation, like forming proper lines to go intoassembly" he recalls. "But now that I'm here, I'm free. I don'thave to queue any more, which I always hated."He also enjoys classes because "teachers are very humorous andoften tell jokes, which make us laugh. I enjoy studying [here]since the environment is very good. The teachers are concernedabout us, and talk to us individually to see if we are coping withour studies. And there is a quiet library when we want to study,and a basketball court, soccer pitch and swimming pool when we wantto play with our classmates, who are also our friends." Kwan admitshis parents pressure him about his studies, but says hisrelationship with them is good.In contrast to Kwan, Wong Wing Ho and Dan Ny Luk - F1 students atChong Gene Hang College - view their study environment merely as"OK" because they are unhappy with some schoolmates' behaviour."When we queue for lunch at the canteen, some of them always jumpahead of us," complains Wong. Adds Dan: "Some often chat with eachother during class, and this interrupts our learning processbecause the teachers have to stop teaching to scold them."Monica Wan, an F7 science student at St Gloria Girls' School, alsoclassifies learning as "OK," claiming the tight syllabus of theHKCEE and A-levels "suffocate" her. "Both public exams require meto digest a large volume of information within a very short time,"she says. "Unfortunately, some teachers do not have the patience toteach. They just prepare a whole bunch of written material and askus to read it by ourselves. It's really hard to learn without theirguidance. But as an upper form student, I think I should learn tostudy independently."Noting that most of her science teachers are male, she wonders ifthey know how to express concern toward students. This said, she ishappy with her relationships with her family and classmates.F3 students Joey Lau and Fiona Leung of True Light Girls' Collegesay their school life is "below average" since they think theirschool too small and because there are many dictation sessions,mini-exams and other tests every week.Agreeing that a school's teaching methods affect their studymotivation, they say: "Some teachers give daily life examples,personal experiences and even tell stories to explain ideas. Thismakes studying fun. But some teachers just read straight frombooks."Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996HONGKONG: WELFARE: Elderly Not Fed Up With Daily Allowance: Life at thebottom on SWD allocation from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By BETSY MAY VELOO, P.10-11IT IS as far a cry from a banquet as you can get when 75-year-oldsNg Hing-sing and friend Pang Chak-kui seat themselves at a smalltable in the former's tiny Shek Kip Mei flat and dig into theirevening meal - rice with hints of scrambled egg and tomatoes, and ashared four-cm sliver of salted fish left over from some daysbefore.No soup, gentlemen? "It would cost $40 to $50 if we made soup,"says Ng. "We will wait until there are more friends with us, then Ican cook soup" - shorthand for the poverty-line reality that makinga pan of soup is a finely balanced economic proposition as much asa nutritional need. But that's how you think when the daily foodallowance doled out to you by the Social Welfare Department iscalculated at $23 per day - or $7.60 a meal.The diners had bought their eggs for a dollar apiece, though theycould have saved a whole 20 cents on each had they scrabbled aroundstalls in other districts. But that would have entailed transportcosts.Inferior stuff: The slightly discoloured tomatoes are part of apack of five bought by Ng for $4. Had the men wanted pork,unavailable in the tiny amounts suitable to their budget, it wouldhave cost $8-10. Fish too is expensive at their level of existence,so for one meal it would have meant something low grade at around$10.Salted fish, the friends note, can cost $60-70 so it is eked out intiny amounts over a few weeks. Fresh vegetables are a rarity onthis particular table. But that doesn't stop them from sometimessplashing out $2 or $3 for some stale greens.Ng can cook - which makes him luckier than most of the singleelderly. He lives in public housing and has a refrigerator whichSKM Kei Oi Social Service Centre, run by volunteers, helped himacquire. Thus he is able to economize slightly by buying "thatlittle bit more" and keeping it relatively fresh.Friend Pang's world is a bedspace cubicle, where cooking is banned.Unless invited for tea or a larger meal by Ng, he has to shop forhis own food. A lunch box of plain white rice with a string ofgreen vegetable - and perhaps two pieces of meat - sets him back$18-20. A plain soup noodle with two wonton dumplings costs aboutthe same.Thus he buys $2 buns for breakfast, sometimes plain congee for $4.If he wants fried flour sticks (yau char kui) to go with hiscongee, it costs an additional $4. Pang says in order to stretchhis finances he has only two meals a day.What about fruits? Ng and Pang reply with one voice: "Tooexpensive." But they say they try to buy a few grapes or oranges"once in a while." What then about yum cha, for which Hong Kong isfamed? "I can't remember when I last had it," says Pang, withoutrancour. "It's been so long."So can elderly people reasonably be expected to survive on $23-worth of food a day (and disregarding that Hong Kong is one of therichest but most expensive cities in the world)? A governmentreport on the Review of the Comprehensive Social SecurityAssistance Scheme says they can. (The scheme was set up to helpthose in financial need.)According to Dr M. F. Leong, president of the Association ofGerontology, people must - in order to maintain a healthy body -have at least two main meals a day, comprising cereals or rice,bread, meat or meat-related products, vegetables and fruits.The government report's arithmetic is that a single elderly personcan survive on $688-worth of food a month - hence the average $23 aday, or $7.60 a meal.Survival: Professor Stewart MacPherson of City University agreeswith the report's findings, but only to a point. "An elderly personcan survive on $23-worth of meals per day," he says. "That is clearfrom the many thousands who do so every day in Hong Kong. But canthey live? My calculation of the 'minimum acceptable' level of foodgives a figure of $34 per day for an elderly person at today'sprices. This is still not generous, and is a minimum standard."He explains: "The major difference between SWD calculations andmine is that they exclude all food except that required forsurvival. I try to take some account of real life to allow somedignity in social life for old people."Suvan Law of the voluntary social service centre is "appalled" atthe SWD allocation. "I don't know what [the government] wasthinking. Imagine having only $7.60 to spend on a meal. This may beone of the reasons why old people have no money to buy healthyfoods." She has on earlier occasions accused the government ofignorance in its calculation of people's basic needs. "Governmentofficers really don't know how the elderly live, what they eat orhow they try to save by buying low-quality food," she charges.In scrimping, many of the elderly forego social events such aspicnics or trips to other districts. "That is why so many of themare found in parks - their only social life," says Law.Dr S. Y. Au, president of the Hong Kong Geriatric Society, relateshow his elderly patients save money. "I received some tips fromthem, like don't boil water," he says. "Just drink tap water tosave energy. When cooking, prepare enough for two meals so that,again, fuel is saved. Afterwards, don't put leftover food in thefridge as more energy is required to warm it up."While the inventiveness of the elderly in cutting financial cornersis admirable, it should not detract from the harsh fact that aproper diet is as important to them as a babe in arms. As Au says:"These people are more prone to disease, and so have to payparticular attention to their diet."But, given the amounts they are presently expected to manage on,can they do so, ask social workers? The CSSA payment for a singleelderly person was increased last April to $1,935 per month from$1,810 - a jump of seven per cent, said by the government to bepegged to inflation."But things today are so much more expensive, especially for theelderly," argues Law. In addition to higher quality food, they byfar prefer Chinese herbal medicines which can cost anywhere between$100-150. And while public hospital services are virtually free forCSSA recipients, the queues are long.Au says that, sometimes, the problems of the elderly might not somuch be lack of money as lack of knowledge about the availabilityof resources. "The problem is that many may not know what theseresources are, and how to access them. We therefore need toincrease publicity," he suggests.There is another side to receiving welfare, he says. Many of theelderly can be quite proud when it comes to seeking financial aidfrom the government. One example is a 76-year-old woman who buys asingle fish for $5, making it last for two days. She consistentlyrefuses help, says Au. "She says she has no financial problems, andsays she is used to eating half a fish a day - which she regards asa good habit." Even an offer of help over a new set of dentures(minimum cost $800) was refused. "She said she had enough money tobuy her own," says Dr Au.Law agrees that many of the elderly refuse to live on what theyperceive as charity. Sometime, she admits, social workers have toconvince them that it is their right to ask for financial help fromthe government. "It's often a tug-of-war between charity and theirrights. We have to convince them that it is their right to have abetter life after all their years of contributing to society- theirright to live with quality and dignity."Current SWD payments being what they are, she adds, "dignity"appears to be a foreign word.Perhaps, she says, the government should heed MacPherson when hesays that the so-called Basic Needs Approach adopted by the SWD is"inappropriate in a wealthy modern society such as Hong Kong," andthat it should re-think just how much an elderly person can live onwith dignity.Says MacPherson: "We should be using standards and measures whichreflect the society we live in. A society may be judged by the wayit treats its old people."Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996HONGKONG: POLITICS: Li Enters CE Race: Heavyweight contenders ready forbattle from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By BRIAN MACLEOD, P.8WITH the announcement on Wednesday by retired Appeal Court judgeSimon Li Fook-sean - a 10-year behind-the-scenes veteran of keytransition events and positions - that he has officially joined therace for the chief executive post, and a similar confirmation byshipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa last weekend, the contest has begunto take on some really interesting dimensions. In joining ChiefJustice Sir Ti Liang Yang and businessman Peter K.C. Woo, it can besaid that there are now true heavyweights in the ring, giving thelie to those who proclaim that the selection process would amountto little more than Beijing bestowing its blessing on the pre-ordained candidate of its choice.Although Li has been the last of the four to declare his candidacy,his decisiveness in doing so stands in marked contrast to the coyinitial approaches made by other aspirants - a decisiveness that nodoubt comes naturally to a former Appeals Court judge.Firm stand: And decisiveness is not the only quality that setscandidate Li apart. While all the contestants in the race so farclaim that, as chief executive, they would consider comprehensiveconsultation with the community-at-large in aid of reachingconsensus, Li has taken a firm stand in favour of governing HongKong as it has always been governed: "I think that the Hong KongSpecial Administrative Region's chief executive's administrationblueprint should include a comprehensive and detailed policyprogramme. But this should be based on the existing tradition ofpolicy-making which has served Hong Kong so well," he says.He is also candid in saying that he believes this programme cannotbe spelled out in detail at the present time, given that so many ofthe variables on which it will ultimately depend will remainunknown until after the formation of the first SAR government. Buthis declaration in favour of maintaining the status quo differsfrom the rather more prescriptive policy ideas being put forward bythe other candidates in laying out their vision of Hong Kong'sfuture.As Li sees it, the chief executive's primary role will be tofaithfully implement the Basic Law. Otherwise, while he supportsthe setting up of the Provisional Legislature simply out of legalnecessity, he would limit the scope of its activity to enactingonly the legislation needed to allow the new SAR government tofunction; other legislation would wait to be dealt with in detailafter the establishment of the first elected SAR LegislativeCouncil.Li also stands for preserving the apolitical role of the CivilService (including the disciplined services,) and ensuring thatcivil servants have a solid grasp of the new concepts inherent inthe basic law as a prime expedient in maintaining Hong Kong'spromised autonomy. As well, he takes a holistic view of the way theSAR will have to be governed, safeguarding the livelihood andinterests of the grassroots on the one hand while ensuring thatHong Kong remains the investment destination of choice for bothlocal and international investors. And, not surprisingly, as aformer judge, he is a strong advocate of upholding the rule of lawin the territory.Tung Chee-hwa, in his long-awaited policy testimonial, wants tobuild the new Hong Kong's relationship with the mainland in aspirit of seeking consensus built on mutual trust: "To stand up forthe interests of Hong Kong does not mean confrontation," he says.He also laid emphasis on the need to ". . . talk more about ourduties, rather than our rights."Key role: In his view, the SAR has a key role to play in themodernization of China, helping it to take its natural place as aninternational leader. At the strictly political level, he hopes toelicit support in achieving the necessary consensus from allpolitical parties, including the Democrats. More broadly, he feelsthat paying closer attention to traditional Chinese cultural valuescould go a long way to ensuring a much more harmonious transition,and they remain, according to Tung, ". . . as relevant today asthey have ever been."What is more interesting is that the race, in the end, will belikely to boil down to a choice between a candidate from either thebusiness or legal communities. And in choosing, Hong Kong will havetaken that all important first step in its journey of a thousandli.In predominantly business-oriented Hong Kong, it might seem obviousthat a businessman would be ideal, if only to ensure that one ofHong Kong's major assets - its profitability - is preserved. Butthe very things that make a businessman successful - an intense,and perhaps somewhat narrow concentration on the bottom line -could amount to disadvantages in executing what will certainly bean arduous and many-dimensioned task in heading up the first SARgovernment.A legal person, on the other hand, particularly one who has devoteda lifetime to serving society on the bench, has of necessity take abroader view of the complex interactions of society, and throughthis is likely to have a more cogent view of the interests of thevarious sectors that make it up, both in a local and internationalcontext.This basic, fundamental choice is what will now make the contest ofcompelling interest, both inside and outside Hong Kong.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996HONGKONG: CRIME: A Haven for Horrors: Killers lurk among Lantau's hordesof visitors from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By TOM IGGULDEN, P.6-7LANTAU is becoming a haven for murderers and kidnappers, police onthe island say. With just one recorded murder last year, six bodieshave been discovered so far this year, according to the LantauNorth Assistant District Commander for crime, Liam Scally.The island draws thousands of visitors every weekend, attracted bycheap holiday villas and remote countryside. But the features thatlure the leisurely also make Lantau ideal for those who would avoidthe prying eyes of the cramped city.Scally says the New Territories used to be the place of choice forkidnappers to hold their hostages, and for murderers to dump theirvictims' remains. But as development encroaches on Yuen Long,Fanling and other traditional hide-out grounds, criminals are onthe lookout for less conspicuous places to pursue their activities.Stranger: "With so many visitors coming here anyway, no one isgoing to notice a stranger who stays for a weekend or a week," saysScally. The island's steep hills, remote beaches and out-of-the-wayroads also make ideal terrain for body-dumping.The body of Chan Lan-kiu, a 34-year-old insurance agent, was thefirst to be discovered on the island this year. Her dismemberedcorpse was found in about 10 pieces on February 16, more than aweek after it was dumped on a hillside at Ngong Ping.It may never have been found if one of her alleged killers, Lo Yau-fuk, 28, had not led police to the site in mid-February, 10 daysafter Chan went missing. Chan's meticulous diary allegedly detaileda scheduled meeting with Lo the day she disappeared.He was detained at the Lo Wu border crossing attempting to leavethe territory.Lo and Cheung Moon-keung, 29, are said to have shot Chan, loadedher body into a van and driven to Shum Wat Road late at night todispose of the remains. They are alleged to have held her hostagein a Mui Wo holiday villa, demanding a $300,000 ransom from herfamily. Their trial is scheduled for January.They have also been charged with two other murders on the island.Police say they were led to two more bodies, those of Yung Tse-lunand Chan Chik-yee, bound in cloth and buried under bushes inshallow graves on a remote hillside at Lai Chi.Though the area is sparsely populated, the bodies were found about100m from the doorstep of resident Keith Addison, who has sincemoved to Mui Wo."Certainly I would never have found them, even though they were soclose," he says. "They were buried and the area is very thick withvegetation. It was scary to think that someone had come up andburied these bodies 100 yards from my front door."In early August, the body of a construction site foreman was foundin an abandoned hut near Tong Fuk pier. He was dressed only inunderpants, his throat had been slashed and he was covered in asheet of iron, his clothes beside the body.Tong Fuk is a popular beach village with several holiday villas.Police are still working on the case.Later that month the body of Tam Ngan-hung washed up at Shap LongKau Tsuen, also on the popular southern Lantau beach strip. Tam'snaked body had been folded into a nylon bag, and red nylon stringhad been tied around her head.Kowloon West police are still investigating her killing. Theybelieve her body had been dumped into the sea at another beach onLantau.The sixth killing on the island came to light early last month. Twomainland workers had apparently fought over money - one batteredthe other to death with a spade and later put the body in a plasticbag and threw it into the sea. It floated for weeks until washingup at Tung Chung New Town. The surviving mainlander later pleadedguilty to the murder.Worried: Addison says island-dwellers are worried about the suddensurge in violence on Lantau. "They are concerned that among allthese visitors there are murderers and kidnappers. I think mostpeople think that as long as you leave them alone, they'll leaveyou alone, but that doesn't mean they like it."Andy Tsang, Senior Superintendent for Crime for New TerritoriesNorth, who is leading the investigation into the triple killing,agrees Lantau is now more attractive to criminals than the NewTerritories."People in the villages here aren't used to seeing a stranger, soif they do they are more likely to remember it," he says. "Iwouldn't say we have seen a decline in murder in NT North, but Iwould imagine it would take a lot longer to discover a body if itwere dumped on Lantau."However, he says there is insufficient evidence yet to establishwhether a change is in progress. "The sample [six bodies in a year]is too small too make a trend out of," he adds.Scally says the island's holiday villas are also used by triaddebt-collectors to hide kidnap victims. "Let's say you run up agambling debt in Macau, then you return to Hong Kong rather thanpay it. The loansharks in Macau will sell the debt to theircontacts in Hong Kong, who are a lot more ruthless about collectingit."This usually means kidnapping either the debtor or a member of thefamily for ransom. Scally says Lantau is increasingly playing hostto these kidnappings.Tsang says the island is not necessarily the perfect place forhiding a hostage or dumping a body. The ferry is the only access toLantau unless you have your own boat. Tsang says that if police areable to follow a kidnapping trail to Lantau, finding the hostageand the kidnapper is easier on the island than in the city. If acriminal knows police are closing in, a quick getaway from theisland is almost impossible.Tsang says murderers or kidnappers must also first lure theirvictims to the island. A Lantau murder, he says, must be properlyplanned and the murderer must have established some sort ofrelationship with the victim before setting off for the island.Extra police: Scally says stationing extra police on the islandwould do little to contain the murder rate. All but one of thekillings this year were investigated by non-Lantau police divisionsbecause the victims were not residents. With throngs of visitorsevery weekend, extra police at the Mui Wo ferry pier could dolittle to identify "suspicious" characters.Meanwhile Addison says the sudden jump in murders is a blow mainlyto the island's permanent residents. Addison, a long-time Lantauresident, says he has always appreciated the island's slow pace ofchange, even with the construction of the new airport at Chek LapKok. "I do worry about things like this, though. I think it worrieseveryone here."Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996HONGKONG: Getting Down To Basics: Basic Law: Annex II: Method For TheFormation Of The Legislative Council Of The Hong Kong SpecialAdministrative Region And Its Voting Procedures from WINDOW, October 25, 1996Part II:Procedures for voting on bills and motions in the LegislativeCouncil.Unless otherwise provided for in this law, the Legislative Councilshall adopt the following procedures for voting on bills andmotions:The passage of bills introduced by the government shall require atleast a simple majority vote of the members of the LegislativeCouncil present.The passage of motions, bills or amendments to government billsintroduced by individual members of the Legislative Council shallrequire a simple majority vote of each of the two groups of memberspresent: members returned by functional constituencies and thosereturned by geographical constituencies through direct electionsand by the Election Committee.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996SPORTS: Rafter Smashes And Grabs Title from WINDOW, October 25, 1996P.5Australia's Patrick Rafter stole the hearts of tennis teenyboppersand netted US$200,000 as he powered his way to victory in the rain-delayed final of the Marlboro Championships at Victoria Park onMonday.The 23-year-old Queenslander overcame American Vincent Spadea 6-2,3-6, 6-2, 7-5 to take his first singles title since 1994. Rafter, aformer top 20 player now ranked 56th after an injury-plagued year,was a clear crowd favourite. Scores of young female fans whooppedat every point he won, and were "rewarded" by the sweat-soaked T-shirt he threw into the crowd after clinching victory. Rafteradmitted the fans had given him a boost. "It's the kind ofattention I like. I'd be lying if I said I didn't." Hisconcentration was also tested by the prospects of a fat pay cheque,the largest in his career so far. "I was thinking about the sum ofmoney [during the match] I have to admit. It's hard when you've gotthat in your mind and it does make it difficult to play."Rafter's blistering serves, clever drop volleys and accuratesmashes kept 22-year-old Spadea on the defensive. Ranked 65th inthe world, Spadea pocketed $65,000 for his gritty but, at times,petulent performance. The American was a lucky entry into the semi-finals, replacing injured fourth-seed and compatriot RicheyReneberg to beat Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman.The championships proved one of the most dramatic in its nine-yearhistory. Despite one of the strongest line-ups ever, none of thetop four seeds made it into the semi-finals. Lacklustreperformances saw the early exits of world No.1 Pete Sampras of theUS, No.3 Thomas Muster of Austria, and French Open champion andNo.4 Yevgenev Kafelnikov of Russia.Sampras seemed as stunned as the capacity 4,000 crowd when he bowedout to world 47th Byron Black of Zimbabwe in straight sets, 6-4, 6-2. He later reflected: "I just couldn't get my game going. I wasdigging a hole deeper and deeper with a lot of unforced errors."But he denied that as it was a non-official ATP tournament, hisheart hadn't been in the match. "I play to win, I don't want tolose to anyone. It hurts just as much as, say, losing the US Open."Black, whose masterful return of serves constantly outwitted thenumber one seed, failed to find the same form when he met Rafter inthe next round. The champion won 6-2, 5-7, 6-3.Unseasonal heavy rains postponed the final by a day, allowing 2,500fans to watch for free. The unseeded finalists proved the silverlining in the dark clouds as higher-ranked players would have beenunlikely to play beyond Sunday due to other commitments.ALISON DUNNCopyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996CHINA DIARY: Making arduous efforts for the success of a new Long March:Long March Commemorated from WINDOW, October 25, 1996By DAVID CHEN, P.4CHINA celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Long March this weekwith President Jiang Zemin calling on the nation to carry forwardthe revolutionary spirit of the epic event and push forward thegreat undertakings initiated by old revolutionaries.The event was marked by a soiree and a commemoration ceremony onMonday and Tuesday in the Great Hall of the People, reportedXinhua.Sixty years ago, the Red Army, forerunner of the People'sLiberation Army, covered 12,500km, trekking through more than adozen provinces and municipalities, defeating numerous attacks byKuomintang forces and became strong through their historic feat.It was in the critical Long March period that the Chinese CommunistParty held the Zunyi meeting, during which Mao Zedong was made theleader of the Red Army and the party Central Committee, signallingthat the party had become mature, President Jiang told thegathering at the commemoration ceremony.He described the Long March as "a brilliant chapter in Chinesehistory and the military history of the world."The president, who is also general secretary of the Communist Partyand chairman of the Central Military Commission, urged party cadresto follow the examples of the revolutionaries and learn to makesacrifices, but not to seek comfort."It is completely wrong to think that now that we are materiallybetter off, we no longer need to strive hard and struggle," Jiangadded.Spiritual force: "The spirit of the Long March," he said, "is astrong spiritual force that guarantees our marching from victory tovictory."Looking forward to the next century, President Jiang said the partyhad created Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism withChinese characteristics, and established the basic line and aseries of principles and policies, as well as a developmentstrategy in three phases, and a cross-century blueprint."The crux of the matter for the moment," Jiang said, "is to fullyimplement those lines, principles and policies and make enormousand arduous efforts for the success of a new Long March."It has been a busy week for President Jiang on the diplomaticfront, greeting heads of state and senior foreign governmentofficials as well as prominent businessmen.The most notable meeting he has had was with the German ForeignMinister, Klaus Kinkel, whose planned visit scheduled for earlythis year was postponed because of the adoption of a resolution bythe German parliament on the Tibet issue. China regarded theparliamentary action as interference with the country's internalaffairs. Discussions and exchanges during the intervening monthshave resolved the controversy and Kinkel's visit signified thereturn of the very warm relationship between the two countries. Notonly did Kinkel have a series of intensive and fruitful sessionswith his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, but the visitor was alsoreceived by President Jiang and Premier Li Peng.Noting the resumption of the friendly ties, President Jiangobserved: "As long as the two sides earnestly abide by theprinciples of mutual respect, seeking a common ground while puttingaside differences, non-interference in each other's internalaffairs and equality and mutual benefits , there will be goodprospects for relations between the two countries."He welcomed the minister to China, noting that Kinkel's main taskwas to make preparations for the German president's visit."President Roman Herzog's visit is an important event in bilateralrelations," Jiang said, adding that he was looking forward tomeeting with him.Premier Li said that Sino-German relations should be oriented tothe future, recent twists and difficulties in these ties havingcoming to an end.Economic and trade cooperation between the two countries hadachieved marked results and bilateral cooperation in various fieldshad brought about benefits for both sides, he added.Li also met German businessmen in Kinkel's entourage, noting thatGermany's business circle had made positive contributions to thehealthy development of bilateral ties.President Jiang also met the chairman of the Russian FederationCouncil, Yegor Semeonovich Stroyev, expressing the belief that thelatter's visit would become a milestone in exchanges between theparliaments of the two countries.Copyright 1996 WindowBack to Headline List CopyrightWINDOW via NewsNetOctober 25, 1996THIS WEEK: Last Run for Long Rally from WINDOW, October 25, 1996THE 555 Hong Kong-Beijing Auto Rally got off to a rousing start onSaturday from Stonecutters Island, in Hong Kong, on what will bethe last race under the present format.

Individuals who are not insured by theiremployer have the option of buying private plans.  In response, someinsurers have introduced a range of low cost schemes to accommodatebusinesses and individuals unable to finance more comprehensive cover.Despite energetic marketing by provident associations and insurers aswell as increasing criticism directed at the National Heath Service(NHS), the market for private medical insurance has not grown for manyyears.  Peter Mannion, assistant actuary, Munich Re, told a recentconference in London that only 11% of the UK population was insured,with market share being gained by new entrants largely at the expenseof the leading providents.He identified flaws in private medical cover and suggested somesolutions.* With products varying considerably in coverage, it might be helpfulif each type of product had guaranteed minimum cover.  There wouldstill be scope for competition in coverage above the minimum and inother areas such as service and premiums.* Insurers often adjust cover at renewal, sometimes limiting it orintroducing lower monetary limits.  This can be confusing forpolicyholders and other routes might be tried to protect theunderwriting result.* Private medical cover is not really designed to cover chronicconditions, particularly those resulting from ageing and most insurersturn off such claims when treatment becomes of a palliative nature.  MrMannion suggested insurers consider whether cover could be extended orwhether a cash benefit could be offered in such circumstances.* Medical insurance has a reputation for rapidly rising premiums; aswell as inflation in medical costs, policyholders have to cope withheavy premium hikes when they move into a new five year age band,meaning that cover may become unaffordable as people age.  One solutionmight be designing long term contracts with level premiums (other thaninflation increases) throughout, as offered by the Exeter FriendlySociety.  There is also scope for life insurers to enter the market viathis route.Private medical expenses cover is a significant part of the UKhealthcare market which includes other products such as incomereplacement benefit, critical illness cover, long term care insuranceand major medical expenses.  Income replacement benefit sales havefallen in the last five years despite reductions in state disabilitywelfare benefits last year.  The other three - critical illness cover,long term care insurance and major medical expenses - have so farfailed to make significant inroads in the market.Major medical expenses insurance was introduced in 1992 as analternative to private medical expenses cover.  A number of insurersoffer this including Canada Life, GAN Life, Lincoln National, OldMutual and Scottish Mutual.  Generally cover is marketed in combinationwith life assurance and some other benefits such as income protection.Future prospectsThe private medical expenses insurance customer base should expandduring the remainder of the 1990s, according to Laing's Review ofPrivate Healthcare 1995.  However, the rate of growth will depend on anumber of factors including: price of cover; the impact of newdistribution channels for individual paid cover; product innovation;government policy, and public perception of the NHS.The review also looks at whether commercial insurers are poised to takea substantially larger share of the market during the 1990s.  It saysthat in the early 1990s, the company sector - traditionally dominatedby the providents - became more ready to switch insurers.  By 1992,commercial insurers' share of the company paid market reached 22.2%although, with the exit of ITT London & Edinburgh, the share droppedback to 19.1% in January-June 1994 (the last period for which figuresare available) as ITT London & Edinburgh's book of business transferredto other insurers including the providents.  "The effect of this exithas now worked its way through the system and it is likely, thoughcomplete figures are not yet available, that the commercials' share ofcompany paid PMI business has started to grow again".Commercial insurers' penetration of the individual paid market,including small groups, initially grew more slowly with switchingbetween insurers being discouraged by pre-existing conditionsexclusions used by most insurers as a means of avoiding anti-selection. Laing's puts the commercials' share of such subscription income as18.8% by June 1994 but suggests it has probably increased further sincewith the continuing growth of Norwich Union's individual business.Scope for further fragmentation of the market depends on barriers toentry and economies of scale.  Industry sources suggest that asubscription income of #50m to #100m per annum may be necessary to takefull advantage of the fixed costs of setting up a comprehensive in-house claims administration system.   "Ultimately, the key to whethercommercial insurers will sustain and consolidate their position in theindividual and corporate markets will depend on whether they can keeptheir administrative overheads and new business acquisition costs lowenough to remain competitive in the long term."Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EUROPEAN TRENDSIn this report - European healthcare trends: towards manged care inEurope - Coopers & Lybrand describes and analyses health reforms in17 countries.There are wide variations between European healthcare systems but thereare many shared perspectives and themes in their reform programmes,because they are responses to common pressures and the possibilitiesoffered by modern management and information systems.  However, thereport does not imply that a single model of health reform has emerged;each country has responded to features of its own health system.The starting point for most healthcare reforms has been concern tocontrol escalating costs.  Other objectives, such as to improve thestate of public health, to ensure equitable access to health services,to improve the quality of health services and to make health servicesmore responsive to public preferences, have been major determinants.While central measures to control cost have had an important impact,the main aim of health reforms has been to change the way decisions aremade about the direction and management of health services.  The aim isto create a self-regulating system, which reflects an appropriatebalance between the desired level and quality of service and affordableresources.The report states that the impacts of European health reforms can beseen at four levels in decision making* health objectives, policy and responsibilities are more clearlydefined* health purchasing (insurance) decisions are separated from heathprovision and in some cases general practitioners are involved inpurchasing* the management of health service provision integrates the managementof medical practice and the management of resources, in response topatient needs* the management of patient treatment and care is based upon evidenceof best practice regardless of settingThe merging themes in healthcare management can be seen as trendstowards a European form of managed care which supports: national healthtargets; community health gain; disease management, and patient focusedcare.Some of these reflect trends in the US but they are being given newmeanings because European healthcare systems have social welfareobjectives and reflect a concern with community as well as individualhealth.ConclusionsFollowing detailed discussion and analysis, the report concludes thatthe experience of European healthcare systems during the 1980s revealedthe limitations of a reform strategy that concentrated almostexclusively on macroeconomic measures for cost containment.  Managementof European healthcare in the 1990s has changed its primary focus tostructural reform to ensure cost reduction (or cost inflationcontainment) without compromising basic healthcare quality and access.Successful healthcare management needs to reconcile the interests ofindividuals with long-term health gain objectives of a community.  Thekey to achieving this is to develop service strategies which aremonitored on a case-by-case basis to ensure that they are continuouslyimproved to meet national and community targets for health.  Europeanapproaches to managed care achieve this by a balance of competitivechoice and controls and incentives.The report says that implementation of competitive choice requires well-informed individuals and agencies capable of assessing cost benefitchoices for the community.  Both individuals and agencies must have theability to influence the performance of healthcare providers.Competing choices must be exercised within a framework of controls andincentives which ensure that minimum standards are met and improvementsare recognised and rewarded.In many social insurance based systems, the sickness funds are facing achange from being regional administrative organisations (payers) tocommissioners (strategic buyers) or risk-sharing enterprises thatoperate nationally.  Both tax based and social insurance systems arerecognising the importance of primary care physicians as gatekeepers tosecondary and community care.Provision of secondary healthcare in European countries, with orwithout internal markets, is increasingly being based on contractingmechanisms and performance oriented payment using case-mix groupingsand quality specifications.  Reforms aiming at more effective hospitalmanagement in many European countries involve clinical participation inmanagement, including devolution of budgetary management accountabilityto clinical level.  In primary care, physicians are developing newskills as gatekeepers and fundholders, resulting in a substantialchange of emphasis from secondary to primary care.Equity is an issue because an increasing gap between resources anddemand is forcing priority setting and rationing which has to bejustified by reference to social values.  Since all European healthcaresystems must be seen as elements of social welfare, equity is animportant issue in all countries.  Health reforms with or withoutpurchaser-provider separation make rationing more explicit so it istherefore essential that the basis for rationing should be accepted asfair.The report also concludes that purchasing of healthcare services isincreasingly being based on knowledge derived from epidemiologicalneeds assessment and measures of outcomes research and qualityassurance programmes.  On the provider side, effective diseasemanagement strategies are increasingly based on medical treatmentguidelines.  Knowledge based purchasing and provision of healthcare inthe 1990s will be heavily dependent on information systems.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996INTERNATIONAL MARKETINGAtIBC's Healthcare Industry Conference last November, Neil Horseman,market manager, BUPA International, looked at the feasibility ofinternationally marketing products.Referring to international concern about current trends in statehealthcare provisions, Mr Horseman discussed whether or notinternational marketing of healthcare insurance products was arealistic goal.  "From small, mature markets like Spain and theNetherlands, to the vast populations of China and Brazil, peoplethroughout the world are taking a very serious look at the potentialfor private healthcare.  The market has already grown substantially inrecent years, and is set for further continued expansion well into thenext century."However, while international marketing can be achieved, there are anumber of important considerations.  Markets must be consideredindividually as they vary enormously.  "Even countries that seem verysimilar in many respects can represent very different marketingpropositions - perhaps due to a minor difference in legislation."* The impact of local legislation must be taken into account.  In theUnited States, for example, legislation makes it virtually impossiblefor a non-US company to break into the market.  In other countries, theregime is slightly more relaxed in theory, but made impenetrable inpractice by a maze of rules and regulations, with the EuropeanCommunity being a typical example.  Products need to be tailored tosuit local requirements.* Access is an issue with problems arising from time differences,different languages, different cultures and different businessenvironments.  The change in political climates around the world ishelping to ease problems to a  certain extent.  In developed countries,in particular, the trend towards de-regulation is opening up many newopportunities.* Cultural complexity is a major issue in itself.  Differing culturalvalues can affect not only marketing but even the validity of theproduct as, for example, in Saudi Arabia where the concept of insuranceis somewhat alien to the local culture and could be interpreted asinterfering with destiny.  In Vietnam, most people do not use the statehealth service, preferring self-medication or traditional healers.  "Ifpeople don't take advantage of the free state health service, they areunlikely to be inclined to pay for private treatment."Mr Horseman stressed that essentially private medical expenses insurersare selling peace of mind, rather than a tangible product, so buyingcover is as much an emotional decision as a practical one.  Any marketproposition must take account of the fact that people's emotional viewof life is coloured considerably by cultural factors such as religionand lifestyle.In a competitive market, there will also be competition from localhealthcare insurers so new entrants must invest in building a brandimage in which people can have total confidence.  "That means havingthe people, resources and capability to deal with customers' problemsquickly and efficiently.  It means having the right structure in place,from distribution through to service delivery."  Customer service is akey issue, as is cost.Mr Horseman emphasised the importance of research, product definitionand service, distribution and marketing strategies.  He concluded thatinternational marketing is a realistic goal - but only for thoseprepared to make the effort to get things right.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996INDUSTRIAL FIRE PREMIUM DOWNGerman industrial fire insurers expect premium income in 1996 to dropsharply due to price reductions leading to even higher underwritinglosses than those expected for 1995, Klaus Nowitzky, chief executive ofJaspers Industrie Assekuranz GmbH & Co KG (JIA), Frankfurt, told apress conference in Dusseldorf recently.  Industrial insurers were"displaying their irrationality", he said.  "The same insurers whorecently still praised the Konsortialkommissionen (Kokos) are nowheating up competition by substantially undercutting existing premiumlevels."Peak risks in particular had gone down in price, he said.  "Good peakrisks are now quoted 25% below their former price; on average all peakrisks pay 20% less," Mr Nowitzky claimed.  In some instances rate cutsof 40% had been granted, Ottokar Engelhardt, another JIA executive,added.  The market for smaller risks was also softening rapidly.Overall, income in industrial fire in 1996 will be down by more thanDM300m on the estimated DM4.2bn for 1995, the JIA executives said."We wonder whether the industrial insurance market went out of controlby accident, or whether it was a conscious decision to force someinsurers out of the market," Mr Nowitzky said, commenting in Allianz'decision to leave the German fire tariff.  Manufacturing industry washappy to receive premium reductions but was worried that small andmedium-sized insurers would leave the market eventually.  "We would beleft with an oligopoly, and this is certainly not in the interests ofindustrial insurance customers," Mr Nowitzky said.  He added that theirrationality of the situation was underlined by examples of companiesimposing premium increases for 1995, "always with the justificationthat higher prices were urgently needed because of the risk situation",a position new undermined in fresh price talks for 1996.  There waseven talk of reinsurers planning a new round of market rehabilitationmeasures for 1 January 1997, keeping the industry on a roller coasterride.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996GUJARAT CONTINUES CROP COVERThe Gujarat government has continued the Comprehensive Crop InsuranceScheme (CCIS) for the rabi (winter) 1995-96 season in the state subjectto certain conditions.

EMSs are new tools by whichinsurers may be able to assess and quantify the environmentalperformance of their clients.  The LPC says that governments andinternational agencies agree that continued, sustainable economicdevelopment depends on the availability of adequate insurance cover forenvironmental risks.  However, insurers are said to be wary of suchrisks, particularly because of past experiences in the United States.A three-year study entitled The Response of the Insurance Industry toDevelopments in Environmental Management Systems recently began at theCentre for Environmental Technology at Imperial College London.  Theresearch is aimed at analysing the response of insurers to theintroduction of EMSs as expressed in their attitudes towards theirclients' environmental performance, as well as supplying insurers withinformation gathered during the study on the usefulness and benefits ofEMSs.The study will also address the following questions.  What are the mainconstraints on the environmental insurance market?  Are these caused byuncertainties in technical assessment, or other problems such as long-term uncertainty in legal liability?  How do insurers currently assessthe environmental performance of their clients - if at all?In the medium term, the study aims to determine whether and to whatextent compliance with EMSs standards supports insurers' own assessmentsystems, and also whether and how insurers might effectively use EMSsin their assessments.Further information is available from the Loss Prevention Council,Melrose Avenue, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire WD6 2BJ, UK.

This is a matter ofsome concern for insurers, because of the growing movement of insuredsbetween underwriters.  So far the BAV has shared the view of theindustry that for "old" contracts ie those signed before July 1994(when liberalised laws came into effect) a three-month notice periodwas required.  As most German motor policies begin on 1 January, thiswould have meant that the majority of German motorists could not haveswitched insurers in January 1996 unless they had decided to terminatetheir policy before 1 October 1995 - when the current price war hadjust started.Only for "new" policies signed under the new law was a one-month periodlegally binding, ran the old interpretation.  But in mid-November,shortly before the final date for the one-month notice, BAV suddenlychanged its mind and said that "after scrutinising the legal situationagain" it had come to the conclusion that all policyholders, old andnew, could cancel with just one month's notice.  This, at least, is theview with regard to TPL contracts; it remains unclear whethercomprehensive policies are also included in this interpretation.Many insurers, including leading provider of low price motor cover HUK-Coburg (Haftpflicht-Unterstutzungs-Kasse Kraftfahrender BeamterDeutschlands aG), have already voluntarily offered the possibility oftermination after one month to their customers.  But HUK-Coburg chiefexecutive Rolf-Peter Hoenen is also head of the motor committee in theproperty and casualty insurers' federation Verband der Sachversicherer(VdS), Bonn, and in this role he is critical of BAV's changed view,because it has confused the situation.  He believes that the courtswill have to settle the argument.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NEW PREMIUMS INTRODUCEDA German insurer has introduced new premiums for all cars to takeeffect from the beginning of this month.

However, despite the minister'sguarded optimism that the average increase would be 20%, the realfigure is expected to be around 30%.  Large private insurers areexpected to set an even higher rise in premiums.The increases will not be uniform for the whole of the country.  Forexample, the largest public insurer, National Insurance (EthnikiAsfalistiki), will adopt different tariffs for the Attica prefecture(+29%) than for the other regions (+19%).  Other insurers were alsoreported to be planning greater increases in the large urban areas,smaller ones in the country and even smaller ones in the borderregions.The increases relate exclusively to the compulsory civil liabilityelement of cover.  However, the premium hikes are expected to lead to adrop of up to 50% in complementary covers such as fire and theft whichmost motorists bought before.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996RATES WARNINGA specialist UK motor insurer warns that changes in reinsurance ratesand the need for bigger reserves will inevitably put pressure on rates. Recent legal developments have introduced the use of actuarialevidence in determining multipliers and the adoption of a discount ratelinked to the yield of index linked government securities.  Thesecombined factors will have an enormous impact upon the claims burdenfalling to UK motor insurers and reinsurers, says the insurer.Relevant developments are the production of the "Ogden" tables and theCivil Evidence bill in October 1995 which permits courts to adopt Ogdenmultipliers in the assessment of personal injury damages in all futurecases brought before them.  This means that if a personal injury claimfor an accident that occurred in, say, 1988 now comes before the court,Ogden multipliers may be applied to the assessment of that claim.It has been estimated that these new multipliers will produce a generalincrease in claims of between 15% and 25% but could be as high as 50%.Not all claims will be affected but plaintiff solicitors are currentlypleading Ogden level multipliers in approximately 10% of all cases.This percentage is sure to rise very quickly, warns the insurer, asotherwise there could be implications for solicitors' E&O policies.The insurer states that the overall effect will be an increase ininsurers' reserves for outstanding claims, which will be seen in manyreinsurance programmes now under negotiation as well as those in thefuture.  As the introduction is retrospective, the 1996 revenue yearwill see adverse developments due to increased reserves on prior yearclaims.Significant effects are already being shown on quotations forreinsurance for 1996.  The insurer concludes that these increases,coupled with the deterioration in claims reserves, will almostcertainly force appreciable premium increases on the industry earlythis year.Further information is available from Insurance (GB) Ltd, AmbassadorHouse, Brigstock Road, Thornton Heath, Surrey CR7 7JA, UK.

The study, compiled from thelatest EU government and insurance organisation statistics, comparedthe number of cars stolen in 1994 in each country with the total numberof cars in use.The UK has by far the worst record for car crime, with an average of 22cars per thousand on the road stolen in 1994.  That is nearly doublethe level in the next worst country, France, where 12.5 cars perthousand were stolen in 1994.  The study found that car theft is lowestin Austria where less than two cars per thousand were stolen in 1994.The next most secure country was Switzerland, where just three perthousand cars went missing.Overall, a lower proportion of cars were stolen in 1994 than in 1993.The European average fell from 11.7 thefts per thousand cars to 9.7.In the UK, the proportion was down from 29 to 22 per thousand.Further information is available from Eagle Star Insurance, Eagle StarCentre, Montpellier Drive, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire GL53 7LQ, UK.Telephone 01242 221311, telex 43259, telefax 01242 255671.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CARGO TARIFF RETURNSThe General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) has re-introducedtariff regulations for a wide variety of commodities.

The intention reflects the fact that the increasing role of theprivate sector in infrastructure has led to demand for credit ratingsuch projects.  Since financial guarantee insurance helps in achievinghigher rating for debt instruments, it would allow the promoter of aninfrastructure project to market infrastructure revenue bonds moreeffectively than on a stand alone basis.  Potential for financialguarantee insurance is also enhanced by the capital adequacyrequirements for financial institutions and banks, likely emergence ofa municipal bond market and initiatives taken to activate the asset-based securities in the country.Mahesh K Kotecha, managing director of CapMac, said that CapMac'sregional financial guarantee company, Asia Ltd, plans to underwriteinfrastructure revenue bonds and asset-based securities to theinternational rating agencies' high non-investment grade standards.The company will also refer deals it guarantees for additional creditenhancement to triple-A rated agencies such as World Bank, AsianDevelopment Bank and CapMac.Traditionally, the supply of infrastructure has been the responsibilityof the government.  However, because of the ballooning fiscal deficit,the government has had difficulty in allocating adequate resources andso has facilitated entry by the private sector by offering a number offiscal and tax incentives.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD POLICY GUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996MANDATORY COVER FOR BANK DEPOSITSThe Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, has passed a law introducing amandatory insurance scheme to protect private investors against lostbank deposits.

Chief executive Dr Jan Boetius is convinced that HealthMaintenance Organisation (HMO) models similar to those used in the USwill be necessary.  Cost control within the industry, which coversaround 10% of the German population, is a problem, not unlike thestatutory system of health funds, Dr Boetius admitted, and new methodsof providing care will have to be found."At present, people only think about spreading the costs, not avoidingor controlling them.  It is our principle that cost control and costavoidance should come before cost distribution," Dr Boetius told WPGsister publication, World Insurance Corporate Report.  "At the momentwe have two dual relationships, patient/doctor and patient/insurer.The patient goes to his doctor and gets treatment, receives the billand sends it to us.  Only at that point can we say anything and, forexample, check whether unnecessary treatment has been carried out orwhether the charge has been properly calculated.""We cannot break away from this mechanism, as long as we are alwaysbehind the event.  Therefore we have to turn these two bilateralrelationships into a trilateral one.  We need to have direct contactwith the doctors and therapists," Dr Boetius said.  He could imagine,for example, a Gatekeeper model - setting specific sums per patient fora doctor.  From this sum he will also pay any specialists to whom herefers the patient.  "The American models cannot be transferred to usas they are, but we need the basic principle.  In order to reallycontrol costs, the people who provide the services have to be closelyconnected with those paying."Concerns about increased claims were also reflected by a premium rateincrease introduced by another insurer, Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse(AOK) of Lower Saxony, this year.

The prospects for foreign oil companies investing in thesecountries are bright as well. To the surprise of pessimists, thesituation in Saudi Arabia will be among the most stable. Thefollowing is a review of prospects in each of the OPEC countries,based on information obtained by highly placed APS sources:Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996ALGERIAThe state concern Sonatrach has signed a deal securing the largestinvestment by a foreign oil company in Algeria since it won itsindependence from France in 1962. Several such agreements are undernegotiation with some of the world's largest oil companies.The deal, signed on Dec. 23, 1995 in Algiers, commits BritishPetroleum to invest in a $3.5 billion programme to develop andmarket huge gas reserves in the In Salah region. Exxon is amongmajors negotiating a similar deal (see Gas Market Trends).Sonatrach is producing 780,000 b/d of oil, and its quota from OPECis 750,000 b/d. Atlantic Richfield is investing about $1.3 billionto expand production in south-eastern Algeria. A number of major oildiscoveries were announced by Sonatrach recently after four years ofexploration by Anadarko of the US, Agip of Italy, Repsol and Cepsaof Spain and BHP of Australia.The business community in Algeria and foreign investors are puttingtheir faith in Liamine Zeroual, the former army general who waselected president on Nov. 16. He won a five-year term with 61% ofthe vote as well as a legitimacy he lacked in his previous term,which he had secured with military help. His Islamic opponents havelost support, weakened by a government crackdown and by internaldisputes (see News Service of this week's APS Diplomat). Donorstates are giving Algiers new credits and the government is toaccelerate the pace of economic reforms inspired by the IMF.Foreign oil companies operating in Algeria are satisfied with thesecurity measures and special flight facilities to and from thehydrocarbon-rich south. Since mid-1995, the government hasestablished four exclusion zones in the south with the armyproviding protection against sabotage. There are about 5,000expatriates working in the south, mainly in the hydrocarbon sector.Their number will increase with the advent of BP, Exxon and otherforeign operators.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996GABONProducing 370,000 b/d, against a quota of 287,000 b/d from OPEC,Gabon still has good prospects for E&P investors and its capacity in1996 would reach 400,000 b/d.At OPEC's ministerial meeting on Nov. 21-22, which rolled the 24/52mb/d production ceiling over to end-June 1996, Gabon reiterated thatit would leave unless its annual contribution to the organisation'sbudget has been reduced in line with the size of its quota. Thismatter was shelved until the next OPEC conference on June 5.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996INDONESIAPolitical stability and rapid economic growth in Indonesia areinter-dependent and the prospects for 1996 are good. There is agreat deal of new foreign investment pouring into the country. Thelist of investors for 1996 is long. For new private oil refiningprojects, as one example, there were 33 different investmentproposals made in the past two years and the Board of Investmentonly approved eight of them.These include a $1.1 billion, 150,000 b/d export refinery to bebuilt by the private Saudi firm, Nimir Petroleum, in partnershipwith Mitsui & Co. of Japan and PT Gigaraya International, a privateIndonesian company. The JV would be using Saudi crude oils. A largerrefining venture, for export, is being proposed by Indonesianinvestors including a son of President Suharto, to be using MiddleEast crudes.Despite the country's gradual shift to natural gas, oil consumptionin Indonesia is exceeding 700,000 b/d and will reach 1 million b/dby 2000. The country may become a net oil importer by 2005 orshortly thereafter, if no major oil discoveries are made in themeantime.At present, Indonesia's oil production excluding condensates andNGLs is averaging 1.33 million b/d, in line with its quota fromOPEC. The biggest investment in natural gas this century is to bemade by Exxon at Natuna, where it holds a major stake, withPertamina having agreed in principle to grant a 13% stake in this toMobil.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996IRANAgainst an OPEC quota of 3.6 million b/d, Iran during the pastseveral weeks has been able to produce more than 3.75 million b/d.Production from some onshore fields has improved, due to extensivefield work done by NIOC since early 1995, and offshore output hasrisen as well.The political situation in Iran will depend on the outcome ofgeneral elections in April/May 1996. The current parliament, electedin April/May 1992, is dominated by traditionalist hardliners whohave proved to be more negative towards the West than the ultra-populists on the left who lost in the 1992 elections. In theprevious parliament, when the latter had a strong presence,President Rafsanjani's pragmatic faction used to benefitconsiderably from his balancing acts between the traditionalists andthe ultra-populists. Rafsanjani lost that balance in 1992 and hassince become weaker, with the traditionalists' behaviour doing theircountry's economy more harm than its real enemies.The confrontation with the US in late 1995 culminated in a newmeasure by congress to punish those non-US companies which continueto assist in Iran's hydrocarbon sector. In June 1995, Washingtonimposed sanctions against Iran and in March had forced Conoco tocancel a $900m deal to develop two of the Sirri offshore fields -with Total of France having since signed a $600m agreement todevelop them. Although Tehran now says the US measures would notharm Iran, in reality the country has begun to suffer more seriouslyand its financial difficulties are getting worse. While France wouldback Total and the Sirri development might go ahead as planned, noother major project in this country would be financed by OECD statesor companies in the near future; none of the major banks willfinance any of the oil or gas pipelines proposed to pass throughIran from Central Asia.In November 1995 the oil ministry and NIOC held a four-day seminarin Tehran and attracted about 40 foreign companies. The latter werepresented with 11 new oil and gas development projects worth over $6billion, all requiring foreign investment on "buy-back" basis.The foreign participants were told they would provide finance andwould be repaid in crude oil, gas or products from the completedproject. The profit margin offered was a bit better than the onewhich the Japanese rejected in 1991, when a small offshore oilfieldat the Strait of Hormuz was to be developed and Japex was to act asa competitive banker. NIOC asked the participants to come up withbids by Jan. 1.All those who are still interested in Iran are awaiting the outcomeof the April/May elections. By then they will have seen how the USapplied the tougher sanctions and how President Rafsanjani managedto free himself from barriers imposed by the traditionalists. If thetraditionalists win again, the situation in Iran could worsenfurther (see News Service).One of the problems is that Iran is moving steadily to a point whenits oil consumption will exceed its exports. According to itscentral bank governor Mohsen Nurbakhsh on Dec. 27, Iran's oilconsumption from March has risen to 1.4 million b/d - compared to1.1 million b/d in the previous fiscal year to March 1995. This hasraised the "oil burden" on the state to almost $10 per annum. In itsnew budget to March 1997, the government has forecast oil exportrevenue at $15.9 billion, up 18% over March 1995-96 earnings.The budget is based on an average price of $15.50/barrel for Iraniancrude oils, compared with $15/barrel for fiscal 1995-96. This seemsto be a bit optimistic, as the prospects for crude oil prices in1996 are not very promising.From March to end-1995, the actual price of Iranian crude oilsaveraged slightly higher than $15/barrel. But in 1996 oil prices mayfall below that average.Key factors of uncertainty for crude oil prices in 1996 include: (1)Iraqi oil, with Baghdad under heavy pressure to allow partial salesunder a UN plan; (2) an increase in non-OPEC supplies, which isalmost certain if no major accident occurs (see study to beserialised as from next week's Review); and (3) deflation in OECDcountries, if it continues.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996IRAQThere is no way that the UN sanctions against Iraq will be lifted in1996 while Saddam Hussein is in power. The situation worsened afterJordan's Dec. 26 announcement that it seized several kilos of three"extremely dangerous" chemical components bound for Iraq, one monthafter Jordan's seizure of a machine tool capable of fabricatingmissiles and other weapons. As soon as the Iraqis learned of thenegative consequences, their dinar collapsed. At the same time,pressures on Baghdad mounted from all directions; and France ispressing hard for the Iraqi government to accept the UN plan forpartial oil sales which, among other things, should help finance UNoperations, as well as bring in food and medicines to the Iraqipeople.Last week there were signs that Baghdad might soften its tone onthis. If Baghdad allows partial oil sales, to involve about 300,000-400,000 b/d in 1996, prices would fall. This is because most OPECmembers are exceeding their quotas, with non-OPEC exportersincreasing their supplies in 1996 to take much of the 1.1 millionb/d boost in world oil demand. The prospects for Iraq might brightensuddenly in 1997, after the US presidential election of November1996, if Baghdad and Washington strike a deal related to the MiddleEast peace process and other matters.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996KUWAITExceeding its 2 million b/d quota by a mere 45,000 b/d, Kuwait is nolonger happy with formula pricing based on sweet Brent and WTIcrudes. KPC wants to see a sour crude marker develop to replaceDubai and become the benchmark for the pricing of its crudes as wellas those of Saudi Arabia and other Middle East exporters. At aLondon conference last November, KPC marketing official Abdel SamadAl Awadi suggested that Gulf producers sell part of their exports onthe spot market to create their own sour marker. But this depends onacceptance by Saudi Aramco, whose pricing formula influences worldoil prices (see Downstream Trends).Kuwait's political stability has improved in recent months andfurther improvements are anticipated in 1996. Its oil productioncapacity is being expanded according to plan, with downstreamoperations overseas to be expanded further in 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996LIBYAExceeding its 1.39m b/d quota by about 30,000 b/d, Libya has anumber of internal problems caused primarily by UN sanctions imposedsince April 1992.

One of its leaders,Shaikh Abu Munther Al Saidi, has said the bloody events in June,August and October 1995 were only "the beginning of the Jihad".However, European oil companies have not stopped operating in Libya.In fact several of them have increased their investment in the pastyear.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996NIGERIAThe political situation in Nigeria is very bad, because its militarydictator Abacha is holding on to power and is isolatedinternationally.

In the following months Hamad and his chief aidesbegan to upset Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in many ways and some ofthem were too arrogant for the Egyptians, the Syrians and others.They were too cordial to Israel and the US to bother with theSaudis.

The issue of succession to the thronehad been resolved prior to President Clinton's visit to the kingdomin October 1994, and now Crown Prince Abdullah is the acting head ofstate. To be the next king, he is the person who presides overcabinet meetings and receives foreign leaders.An air-tight power sharing agreement with "The Sudairi Seven" is yetto materialise. But political stability is top priority for both theconservative camp of Prince Abdullah and the progressive camp of"The Seven". Washington will be happy with whatever arrangement bothsides may have in the coming months, provided that the outcome isfavourable, and there is a lot of horse trading going on in thebackground.The trend-setter for the neighbouring countries and the oil market,Saudi Aramco has raised its crude oil prices for US customers inJanuary by 35 cents/barrel for Arabian Heavy and by 10 cents forExtra Light.

The JV will build a $320m plant toproduce Orimulsion, Venezuela's trademark boiler fuel excluded fromthe OPEC quota. Production is to begin in 1998 at the rate of 5million tons/year. About 80% of the output will be sold to FloridaPower and Light Co. and the remainder will be marketed in Europe.In this JV, Bitor will hold 40%. Conoco will have a 30% stake andStatoil will hold 20%.

Higher oil prices and reforms boostedtheir economies in 1995 despite lower government spending and adecline in some sectors. But the six states are entering the 16thyear of their alliance with no signs that their targeted economicmerger will materialise anytime soon.According to local officials and bankers, the oil sector alone inthe GCC has grown by around 8% as crude oil prices averaged nearly$17/barrel in 1995, compared with $15.50/barrel in 1994. Oil pricesin 1996 may fall if Iraq returns to the market for partial oil sales(see Oil Market Trends).Khalid Al Fayez, chief executive of the Kuwaiti-based GulfInvestment Corporation (GIC), which is owned by the six GCCgovernments, says: "The performance of GCC economies recordedpositive rates and the results have surpassed expectations. Suchresults were much better than in 1994. This is because the rise inoil prices hastened growth rates". Bankers have estimated thecombined GDP in the GCC would grow by around 2.1% to $207.6 billionin 1995, from nearly $203.2 billion in 1994.A study by Henry Azzam, chief economist of the Saudi NationalCommercial Bank, shows Saudi Arabia's GDP, which accounts for nearlya quarter of the total Arab GDP, would likely rise to around $122billion from $120.8 billion in 1994. Kuwait's GDP would increase to$24.2 billion in 1995 from $22.9 bn and the UAE's to $38 billionfrom $36.6 bn. Oman's GDP surged by more than 12% in the first halfof 1995 and was projected to grow by over 3% by end-1995. Theeconomies of the two other GCC members, Bahrain and Qatar, are alsoset to grow.This is in contrast with 1994, when most of the GCC economiesdeclined due to low oil prices. The decline occurred mainly ingovernment sectors.According to the state-run Emirates Industrial Bank in the UAE, theimprovement in crude oil prices would boost the GCC's income byaround 10% to $77 billion in 1995, from around $70 billion in 1994.The oil sector's contribution to the GDP ranges between 30% and 40%in the GCC. The other key sectors are construction and trade.Mahmoud Al Jarwani, director of the Muscat Stock Exchange, said inlate 1995: "I believe all GCC economies have grown because of theoil price improvement and government measures to restructure theeconomy. But some sectors have slightly retreated due to a drop ininvestments and government expenditure". Most GCC states cutspending in 1995 as part of reforms aimed at tackling their budgetdeficit and reviving their economies after they were hurt by low oilprices. From $71.4 billion in 1994, spending was trimmed to $68.79billion in 1995, with most of the cut made by Saudi Arabia.Lower government spending has a direct impact on the GCC economy, asthe private sector still relies heavily on such spending given itsrelatively small contribution to the GDP. But such a contribution,estimated at 35-40%, is set to surge in the coming years as regionalstates are pressing ahead with reforms, which cover privatisation,incentives for industries and improvement laws. The sale of keyinstitutions to the public is expected to fetch the governmentsbillions of dollars and ease the burden of subsidies.GIC's Fayez urges GCC states to pursue privatisation plans and otherreforms to repair their economies and lessen reliance on volatileoil earnings, which still account for more than 80% of their income."GCC countries should be fully committed to privatisation toliberalise their economies and end bureaucracy and red-tape. Butprivatisation needs changes in the existing economic laws. It meansnot only the transfer of the ownership from the government to theprivate sector, but also a change in the structure of companies andtheir dealings".Obstacles To Merger: The GCC states are yet to agree on a customsunion, a joint currency and other steps required for a commonmarket. Bahrain, which has little oil, fears lowering its tariffscould hit its economy in view of its heavy reliance on taxes. SaudiArabia is also sticking to selective high tariffs to protect itsburgeoning industries as a means of lessening dependence on oilexports. Although the six members have eased customs barriers amongthem and facilitated the entry of their citizens, inter-GCC tradehas remained as low as 10% of their total trade of more than $100billion per annum.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Egypt-Libya Trade Is Choked By Harsh New MeasuresEgypt's Marsa Matruh, the once thriving market in Libyan goods hasbecome a ghost town after strict measures taken by Tripoli chokedoff trade across the border. There used to be 5,000 travellers a daycrossing the town. Now there is only 50 at most. Sometimes it iscompletely empty.Mohammed Al Adl, head of customs at Egypt's Salloum border post,said last week Libya "imposed a number of strict controls whichstopped the flow of trade between the two countries". Libya slapped100% duties on merchandise entering from Egypt. Libyan officials atthe Misaed border post "confiscate without any reason all goods andlarge amounts of money from travellers" coming from Libya, Idris EidAli, who crossed into Egypt said. He added: "The economic situationin Libya is collapsing and every hour there are new contradictory(customs) orders issued".The Salloum border crossing has been a vital trade outlet for Libya,under a UN air embargo since 1992 for its alleged support ofterrorism. Travel between the two countries has always been simplefor their citizens, leading to a profitable trade in cheap Libyanmerchandise in Egypt.In the coastal town Marsa Matruh, 250 km from the border, themarkets where most of the goods from Libya were sold are all butempty from the cut-off. A trader who deals in Libyan merchandise inMatruh said: "The town used to be packed with people and cars andthe trading went on 24 hours a day. Now there's not a singlecustomer after nine o'clock. On the best day, a merchant (at Matruh)might make about 10 Egyptian pounds ($3). There are no customers andno new goods coming in".Besides random confiscations of goods, Libyan officials impose heavyinsurance on merchandise leaving Libya. But then it is verydifficult for the traveller to get back the insurance. One Egyptiancustoms official added: "There is no system and no (Libyan) officialto turn to to complain. Every bureaucrat small and large considershimself unsupervised and can do whatever he wishes".The Libyan authorities have begun refusing to fill extra petroltanks in travellers' cars, in a bid to crack down on drivers whosold Libyan gasoline at "enormous profit" in Egypt. Libyan customsalso force entrants to pay 50 Libyan dinars ($15) for a healthcertificate in response to an Egyptian decision to give arrivals ahealth test, after reports of a cholera outbreak in Libya.Egyptian exports to Libya in 1994 amounted to $44.2 million. Importsfrom Libya were worth $47.8 million. Libya has been Egypt's thirdlargest Arab trading partner, after Saudi Arabia and Syria.Trade was dealt a heavy blow in September 1995 when Libya decided todeport the 30,000 Palestinians living on its soil. Up to 1,000 ofthe several thousand Palestinians expelled were refused entry byEgypt and settled into a tent camp in no man's land between the twoborders.The crisis stifled trade across the border even after Libyan leaderQadhafi decided to stop the expulsions until 1996. Over a hundredPalestinians still remain in the tent camp under harsh conditions.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Algeria Gets BP For Its Biggest Gas Project; Talks With Exxon BeginOn Dec. 23, 1995, Sonatrach and British Petroleum signed anagreement whereby BP and the state concern will invest about $3.5billion to develop and market natural gas from seven fields in theremote In Salah region. The gas will be marketed in Europe,particularly in southern European countries, and will increaseAlgeria's gas exports by more than 10 BCM/year from 2002. Furtherincreases in gas exports are envisaged for the following years.The deal with BP represents the biggest foreign investment inAlgeria since it gained its independence from France in 1962. Itcomes on the heels of President Zeroual's electoral victory (see OMT& News Service of this week's APS Diplomat.It paves the way for other international investments in Algeria'senergy sector, which accounts for virtually all the country's exportearnings, with Exxon negotiating a similar agreement for In Salahgas.Explored by Sonatrach, the seven fields lie in the hithertoundeveloped In Salah District Three, about 1,200 km south ofAlgiers. They are believed to be rich in natural gas and someliquids.In the initial phase, 30 months, BP will spend about $100 million onan appraisal of the fields' known gas reserves, exploration andanalysis of the chemical composition of various gases in thatregion. The aim of exploration is also to find other fields inDistrict Three. The $100 million spending will be borne by BP alone.In Salah, a vast desert region, has 30 fields discovered bySonatrach. Their reserves have been estimated at between 150,000-280,000 MCM. But BP has had doubts about these estimates and willcarefully re-assess data and the deposits at the seven fields foundin District Three.The deal took five years to negotiate and an initial agreement in1993. It involves a complicated arrangement relating to productionand the quality of the In Salah gas, which is poor relative to thegas being produced at Hassi R'Mel, Algeria's main gas productioncentre to the north. It includes a swap of In Salah gas for HassiR'Mel gas.After the 30-month exploration phase, if the results are positive, afive-year development programme will be launched. BP will produce 10BCM/year from 2002 or 2003.With gas treatment facilities to be set up at the fields, a 520-kmpipeline will be built from District Three to Hassi R'Mel. Thepipeline will cost about $1 billion. At Hassi R'Mel, the gas will bereinjected to free more of the higher quality of the centre's gasfor export.From there, the gas will be linked to Algeria's export network: (a)the Trans-Med pipeline to Italy, and (b) the pipeline to Spain andFrance which will pass through Morocco and the Strait of Gibraltar.Joint gas marketing companies will be established in Europe bySonatrach and BP. The British major is expected to provideconsiderable assistance in markets that will have become totallyderegulated by 2000 (see reports on following pages). There will beemphasis on Germany, the largest gas market in Europe, where BP hasa stake in a major gas company.The BP-Sonatrach partnership will last 30 years. The agreement wassigned at a ceremony in Hassi Messaoud, Algeria's southern oilcentre, by BP's CEO John Browne and Nazim Zouioueche, the head ofSonatrach. The ceremony was attended by Ammar Makhloufi, Algeria'sminister of energy and industry.Accordingly, BP will provide 65% of the total investment. In return,it will get about a third of the profits. There is a confidentialportion in the agreement which provides for other companies to usethe pipeline for a fee.Makhloufi said the BP deal would be a model for future gasdevelopment and marketing agreements with other internationalcompanies. Browne said: "It is the first major gas joint venture aforeign company has signed with Sonatrach. It has the potential toopen up a new area of gas production in Algeria. He added that thedeal should raise by 30% BP's natural gas production worldwide,which in 1994 amounted to 1.12 BCM (13 BCF).BP will set up its own quarter at the heavily-guarded HassiMessaoud, where most of the 32 western oil and gas companies have abase. It will post 25 of its staff members there and in DistrictThree, which will be heavily guarded by the army as well.Browne and his aides had flown direct from London to a smallairstrip at Hassi Messaoud, where the army has heavy fortificationsagainst Islamic militants. BP will be hiring its own securityexperts there and in District Three, and will be chartering its ownaircraft for the staff - as the other foreign operators in Algeriahave done.At least six army units guard the installations in and around HassiMessaoud. At the air strip, soldiers with AK-47 assault rifles standsilhouetted at the top of the surrounding, honey-coloured sanddunes. The area is part of four exclusion zones in the south,established in mid-1995, requiring special permission for entry byvisitors. Soldiers are stationed outside many pumping stationsacross the desert. Helicopters routinely monitor the pipelines,which are buried 3 to 4 metres under the sand.Exxon Negotiations: Initial negotiations between Sonatrach and Exxonbegan in the past week with the aim of signing a gas partnershipdeal similar to BP's. If an agreement is signed, which MinisterMakhloufi hopes would be within 1996, Exxon would take some of theremaining In Salah fields.After an initial period for field appraisal and exploration, if theresults are positive, Exxon would develop the structures.Eventually, it would use the 520-km pipeline to Hassi R'Mel which BPwill build from In Salah. Makhloufi says there would be a total ofthree to four partnerships with foreign companies for In Salah gas.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Total-Sonatrach Gas DealSonatrach and Total of France were this week expected to sign acontract for the development of a gas field at Tin Fouye Tadankort(TFT). The field lies in south-eastern Algeria near the Libyanborder.The contract involves a production sharing arrangement. The Frenchcompany will cover most of the investment required and projectsthere include a pipeline to link the gas with Algeria's network.On Dec. 22, Minister Makhloufi and officials from Sonatrachinaugurated oil and condensate processing facilities at Bin Rebba,part of the Hamra field development undertaken by Total. They alsoinaugurated Total's new gas treatment complex built at Hamra. TheHamra project, to produce LPG as well as condensates, includes ajoint Sonatrach-Total company to market the LPG.Zouioueche, the head of Sonatrach, says Algeria is taking steps tomaintain the momentum of foreign interest and investment. Newexploration acreage will be offered for foreign companies, althoughAlgeria appears more interested in negotiating specific arrangementswith individual companies than in launching a new internationalbidding round. He says there is a continual reassessment of thefiscal terms being offered to foreign companies. "We think thecurrent ones are attractive enough, but we must be prepared to adaptto growing international competition", he adds.Zouioueche has ambitious plans to revitalise Sonatrach. "Our goal",he says, "is to have a state company that is managed like a privatecompany". He is keen to expand international activities. Algerianofficials say part of the attraction of the BP deal, and the onewith Exxon to follow, is that it opens the prospect of moving intonew "middle stream markets" in Europe, such as power generation.Zouioueche says Sonatrach, which already has a stake in Anadarko,the US oil explorer, is keen to acquire additional overseas assets.That could include taking equity in other companies, including gasmarketing companies in Europe. "We're open to any possibilities tobecome more international", he says.At home, Sonatrach will be offering more opportunities for foreigncompanies to take part in rehabilitating existing oilfields.Zouioueche says a $1.3 bn contract on enhanced oil recovery beingnegotiated with Arco will form the basis for future oilfieldrehabilitation projects. "But we can't do other ones until the Arcodeal is signed", for the Rhourde El Baguel oilfield (see details insurvey of Algeria in Review's Vol. 44).Anadarko, meanwhile, has begun negotiating with Chemical Bank andother banks to finance the development of 1.5 billion barrels of oilreserves it has found in Algeria. Its partners in these reserves areLasmo of the UK and Maersk of Denmark.The reserves lie in the group's Hassi Berkine fields which, ifdeveloped as planned by Anadarko, would produce 40,000 b/d from late1996 or early 1997. A full-scale development, to cost over $1billion, would raise its production to 300,000 b/d by 2000. Thefields will produce natural gas as well.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996The European Gas Market Develops; The British Could Buy From RetailShopsA spot market in natural gas developed in 1995 at Bacton, on theBritish east coast, is becoming the main price market for spottrades in Europe. With the players having acquired experience fromtrading in North Sea oil, it provides forward contracts. Eventuallythis would lead to a gas futures market similar to that of NYMEX inNew York which was launched in 1990.However, the new spot market has caused the gas industry a seriouscrisis. As a result of free competition in less than six months, gasprices fell to about 10 pence a therm ($1.55/million BTU) inNovember 1995.To compare, the value of natural gas in Britain in November 1994 wasalmost 20 pence a therm ($3.10/million BTU).Further pressures on gas prices in Europe would be expected by April1998, when the UK gas and power businesses will be totallyderegulated. From then on, British consumers could buy electricityor gas at the supermarket or in chain stores. This form of tradewill influence price trends at Bacton.Many big retailers have already had talks with the Britishelectricity regulatory body, Offer, about plans to sell power asfrom 1998. They have had negotiations with British Gas for theretailing of both gas and electricity, though BG is having its ownretailing plans.The British electricity regulator, Prof. Stephen Littlechild, saidon Dec. 28 that many retailers were considering the sale ofelectricity and gas once regional distributors lose their monopolyin supplying households. The market for 20 million Britishhouseholds is worth about $12.5 billion per annum. He told 'TheTimes': "All of these (retail) chains realise that they havestrengths and the resources which could be of use in the electricitymarket".No new wires for power or pipelines for gas will be required.Retailers would use their purchasing power to buy large supplies ofgas and electricity at bulk discounts, and then could sell theunused surplus to customers. The gas or power distributor wouldreceive a fee from the retailer to reroute the supplies.According to Littlechild, supermarkets are well placed to sellelectricity in the free-for-all consumer market about to be created:they are used to driving hard bargains with suppliers and makingslim margins on large volumes. As large-scale customers, theseretailers have been able to achieve savings of 30% or more on theirbills through a competitive tender process. This involves thevarious private sector suppliers.British Gas, the former state monopoly, is already bracing for thetough new competitive market. It has secured a licence to supplyhouseholds with both gas and electricity, in the expectation thatconsumers would prefer one major and reliable supplier.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996NYMEX Begins Trading New Futures Based West Texas GasThe New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) this week was expected tobegin trading a new gas futures contract based on delivery at thePermian pool of El Paso Natural Gas Company in West Texas. Thecontract is partly similar to the one trading on the NYMEX marketsince 1990, with its gas based on the Henry Hub in Louisiana.The difference is that the Louisiana-based contract expires on thesixth to the last business day of the month, whereas the new near-month contract expires on the third to the last business day. Thenew contract competes with the Western gas futures contract of theKansas City Board of Trade (KCBT), which is based on the Waha Hub inwest Texas. The KCBT Western contract expires on the fifth to thelast business day of the month.NYMEX has promoted the idea since mid-1995. It wants to give tradersin natural gas futures an alternative site to trade.

"But [Florida StateBoard] is a large complex organization with a variety of activities andconcerns, not all of which are investment related, and the board has selectedsomeone who can put together a solid team, deal with all the activities andpull the whole thing together."Prior to joining the board, Mr. Herndon was president of Tom Herndon &Associates, a government lobbying and consulting firm. His public servicerecord included positions as chief of staff under two Florida governors-currentGovernor Lawton Chiles and Bob Graham, now senator-where for five years he wasdirector of the governor's office of planning and budgeting. Besides serving onthe Florida House of Representatives, he also spent two years as the executivedirector of Florida's Department of Revenue."I guess the need was for a seasoned [manager] with strong oversight ofexternal forces affecting the pension, i.e., the legislature, and he was bestsuited for the part," said a source familiar with the pension who asked not tobe named.At the time of Mr. Williams' departure, the Florida legislature was reviewingits current restriction on partnership investments, possibly paving the way foran expanded program (BUYOUTS June 10, p. 4). The pension also was reviewing itsprivate equity program and was considering new strategies to broaden itsalternatives investment portfolio, including buyout funds and directinvestments.Before its September commitment of $200 million to The Carlyle Group's CarlyleLeveraged Capital Partners II, L.P. (BUYOUTS Sept. 30, p. 9),  Florida hadnearly $800 million earmarked for buyouts that was primarily invested byLiberty Partners, New York.Mr. Herndon was picked over other candidates with strong investment trackrecords, sources said, because the pension did not expect to rely on the newdirector to drive its day-to-day management. Mr. Herndon said he expects to setbroad policies and structure a new program where the monitoring will be left todeputies with more investment experience.Currently, Lan Janecek is the board's chief of equities, and Irwin Loud is theprivate equity portfolio manager.The board has not set a formal timetable for the review. "During the transitionfrom Ash to myself, which took six months, my sense is the board was sitting ata red light on the street," Mr. Herndon said. "Now its a flashing yellow light,and I'm proceeding with caution.

He said it would be difficult to continue toattract and to keep top industry professionals without giving them a chance tobuild equity ownership."It worked well for 15 years, and it might have continued to work a whilelonger, but the economic rewards and controls had to shift in a direction tothe people that give a value to the investors," he said.The price of the transaction has not been finalized.Following the transaction, the new entity is expected to continue investing andmanaging Hancock Venture Partners' existing $2.2 billion in assets undermanagement, including all prior funds the firm has raised, Mr. Zug said.Commitments from parent John Hancock Mutual Life accounted for only 3% ofHancock Venture Partner's assets under management, and industry sources saidthe firm's rebirth is unlikely to diminish the team's existing clout.The new entity has yet to finalize its name. Although it may include areference to Hancock, it will likely be used temporarily and for a short time,Mr. Zug said. "All details are not ironed out, and there is still some work tobe done," he said.L.P. sources who have invested with Hancock said the firm's general partnershad been working on the move for some 18 months, and may have held off theofficial launch of its fifth domestic fund because there are investors who maybe waiting for the changes to be finalized before they make their commitments.The fear, an L.P. source said, is that some of the Hancock general partners mayleave should the acquisition fall through.Mr. Zug said he does not believe the investors will be unduly concerned aboutthe change in ownership and name."I view the spin-off as positive, and if we chose to invest in them again, itwould be contingent on the deal," said Robert Borden, chief investment officerat Louisiana State Employees' Retirement System.U.S. Fund V May Breach $1 BillionDarrell Allen, the investment officer at Denver Public School Employees'Pension & Benefit said the establishment of the group as a separate firm isunlikely to negatively impact the plan's existing relationship with the Hancockteam. Investors said the launch of a new domestic fund-of-funds likely will beannounced the same time the ownership change is finalized.L.P. sources said the new vehicle, Hancock's fifth domestic fund, will featurea $750 million goal and will be capped at $1 billion.Hancock's previous U.S. fund, the $353 million Hancock Venture Partners IV,L.P., was launched in 1993 and is fully invested. New partnership and secondaryinvestments represented $196 million of the fund and direct investments $156million.The only fund not fully invested by Hancock Venture Partners is the $950million fund-of-funds Hancock International Private Equity Partners II, L.P.,(BUYOUTS July 8, p. 23) which held a final close early this year. It is now 40%invested.More than half of the $2.2 billion under the management of Hancock VenturePartners is targeted for international funds, and Mr. Zug said his group willcontinue to offer its investors both domestic and overseas opportunities."The two parts of our business here have always been integrated,"  Mr. Zugsaid. "We've never contemplated splitting them apart."* By Josh KosmanBack to Headline List CopyrightBUYOUTS via NewsNetDecember 09, 1996Despite LBO Firm Neglect, Mezzanine Funds ThriveWhen Boston's Bain Capital found itself with an oversubscribed equity fundearlier this year, its partners came up with a way to tap investor interestwithout biting off more equity than it could chew, and Bain Capital V MezzanineFund, L.P. went from concept to closing."We thought there was a shortage of mezzanine," says Geoffrey Rehnert, a Bainmanaging director. And given the oft-touted perception of mezzanine funds asignored by investors and squeezed out of deals by aggressive senior lenders androaring junk bond and 144(A) markets, it seems a sound rationale.But subordinated debt funds were not so much a dark horse as a quiet one. Likeequity funds, these partnerships have experienced a record fund-raising year in1996 and, like buyout funds, have been busy finding under-the-radaralternatives in order to put their money to work.Whether their approach will be successful as they wait for more equilibriumwith other debt sources remains to be seen. What is certain, however, is thatwhile a strong mezzanine contingency is not what buyout funds need right now, alack of established sub-debt funds could have serious repercussions for thebuyout industry should the public market and senior lenders pull back.So far in 1996 there have been roughly a dozen mezzanine-fund closings thathave raised about $2.3 billion, a 143% increase from 1995, according toBUYOUTS. The sponsors are Capital Resource Lenders, Canterbury Capital, L.L.C.,Crescent Capital Corp., LPNY Advisers, Retail & Restaurant Growth Capital,L.P., Frazier & Co., Bain Capital, Green Mountain Advisors, Brown BrothersHarriman & Co., Summit Partners and Cigna Investment Management.On top of that there have been five other funds launched this year, includingthose by August Partners and GarMark Advisors L.L.C., looking to raise anadditional $1.475 billion.The wealth of fund raising in 1996 follows several years of slow struggle. In1992, $786 million was raised among mezzanine funds, which was followed by a39% drop in 1993 to a total of $482 million.But beginning in 1994, mezzanine funds began to show a turnaround. In 1994, thefunds totaled $909 million, an 89% increase from the year before. In 1995, theaggregate was $945 million, not accounting for the $1.425 billion raised byForstmann Little & Co., which is being excluded from the data because the firmuses the fund for its own deals and does not lend to others.What seems to be driving the mezzanine fund-raising market, sources say, is thegreater appetite on the part of foreign investors."[Domestic investors] looking at mezzanine funds ask themselves 'Why would I dothat if we get [a return of] 20% to 25% when we could put it into privateequity and make 50%,'" relates Bob Mast, a placement agent at Boston-basedMonument Group.International Investors Drive MarketConversely, many investors from overseas have more modest expectations."Many international investors are attracted to the current yield a mezzaninefund provides," says Robert Gould, a senior manager at Brown Brothers Harriman& Co., which is  raising a mezzanine fund. "Additionally, it provides goodreturns even if the IPO market doesn't do well in the next five years."The fund, called 1818 Mezzanine Fund, was launched in May and is expected toclose in the first two weeks of December with more than $200 million (seestory, p. 6).At first glance, the rise in mezzanine fund raising seems paltry compared tothe skyrocketing levels of pure equity. Buyout funds have raised more than $20billion so far this year, already exceeding 1995's final tally of $18.4 billion(BUYOUTS Oct. 14, p. 1).But a closer look at the proportion of mezzanine to equity shows that mezzaninepools have been gaining ground. In the early '90s, for example, the pool ofmezzanine capital ran at about 8% of equity funds. Although that dipped toabout 5% last year, 1996 has reversed the trend. Mezzanine fund raising thisyear totals 13.4% of the aggregate total of buyout funds raised.While most sources and the numbers agree that it is a good time to raisecapital, not all mezzanine funds have had immediate success. August Partners,based in New York with a fund launched in late winter, has yet to hold a firstclosing on its $100 million target. A much more ambitious target, $750 million,was set by New York's GarMark, which also has not held a close althoughindustry sources had hinted earlier this year that they were very close(BUYOUTS April 8, p. 6). GarMark could not be reached for comment at presstime.Both these funds are debut efforts, which may be influencing their ability todraw investors. But GarMark's fund, one of the largest mezzanine partnershipscontemplated, may be a victim of its own size.Sources that are successfully raising and deploying mezzanine funds say theyare doing so because of their approach: searching for smaller deals orrestructurings where they can put their money to work."We are looking for deals at the lower end of the spectrum with smaller fundsor possibly individual deals," says Nicholas Dunphy, a managing general partnerat New York's Canterbury Capital. "I maintain that if you stick with smallerdeals, and create good relationships, there will be enough worthy deals to makea good investment."If GarMark reached its target, the fund may be too large to go after thesmaller deals that mezzanine funds are eyeing, and the larger deals that couldeffectively put GarMark's fund to work currently are more interested incheaper, public debt.Taking Advantage of the Little DealFollowing a similar story to the equity-fund dilemma of having lots of investorinterest but limited avenues for deployment, mezzanine funds, too, have beenreinventing the kinds of deals they pursue.For instance, many mezzanine funds that initially were conceived as supportingstructures for buyouts are instead going after their own smaller deals orhelping out companies that need capital for a purchase of another product line,not a buyout itself."The funds that can do this can handle [any squeeze]," says Jim Reinhardt, amanaging director of the California-based Pathway Capital Management.For instance, Mr. Dunphy says Canterbury's strategy has been to look forsmaller deals rather than to try to provide mezzanine financing for mega-deals.His firm's fund, Canterbury Mezzanine Capital, L.P., which was launched lastSeptember, most recently held a first closing on $135 million (BUYOUTS Sept.25, 1995, p. 1, p. 16) and is looking for a final close by January at $150million.For its first deal, Canterbury committed $5 million in subordinated debt toChartwell Investments's acquisition of Petro Stopping Centers (BUYOUTS Nov. 11,p. 6).Canterbury Capital looks for deals between $2 million and $15 million and, witha range like that, "you will always find a company looking for growth capitalor debt," Mr. Dunphy adds. Canterbury's overall return objective is 20% to 25%.While the Brown Brothers mezzanine fund takes a larger approach-seekinginvestments between $25 million and $75 million in company worth between $150million to $200 million-the strategy still is to complete deals that are toosmall for its second buyout fund, 1818 Fund II, which closed last year on $475million."Mezzanine is the appropriate tool for investments we want to make with smallercompanies, because you can't be as confident that companies will go publicafterwards," Mr. Gould says.A large part of the mezzanine fund's strategy is to find investment situationsthat would not be appropriate for a financial sponsor, such as a family-ownedbusiness where no one wants to replace the financial structure. "There is someopportunity in leveraged buyouts, but that is not where our focus will be," Mr.Gould adds.A Maturing Mezzanine MarketEven as mezzanine funds are finding new footholds to bridge the gap betweeninvestor appetites and financial sponsors' interest, there are signs themezzanine market is coming into its own.LPNY Advisers, based in New York, has dedicated a recent fund raising tosecondary interests in mezzanine funds. The fund, which was launched earlierthis year, closed on $225 million this summer, exceeding its $200 millioninitial target. So far, commitments have been drummed up from PennsylvaniaPublic School Employes' Retirement System, BancBoston Capital, HoustonFiremen's Relief & Retirement Fund, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance, IBMRetirement Plan, Wolfson Equities and Paris-based Euristech (BUYOUTS Aug. 5, p.7)."Certainly, mezzanine does get a little squeezed when equity providers have somuch money," says Monument's Mr. Mast. "But even if all discipline goes out thewindow, [mezzanine] will still have a place in the market."That mezzanine funds are a maturing market also readily can be seen by buyoutfirms, riding high on equity but delving into sub debt as well. Besides BainCapital and Brown Brothers Harriman, Boston's Summit Partners is raising amezzanine fund called Summit Subordinated Debt Fund II, L.P., which is readyingits first, and perhaps final, closing at between $250 million and $300 million(see story, this page).But, because of the abundance of cheaper forms of debt, even some of thosebuyout firms that might have first anticipated using their new mezzanine fundsto bolster their own deals may be rethinking their plan.To date, Bain has used its mezzanine fund, which raised about $250 million, forits own deals-but now is interested in using the fund for mezzanine lending toother buyout groups, Mr. Rehnert says."I think we are trying to market mezzanine and come up with a formula to pricedeals but with better risk," he says.

He declined to name the individuals, but said they shared astrong operational background.The move follows a decision by Kidd Kamm partners to go their separate waysover a disagreement about the firm's investment direction. While Kidd Kamm willcontinue managing its existing portfolio, partners Kurt Kamm and Terry Theodorewill launch a buyout fund early next year under the banner Kamm, Theodore & Co.(BUYOUTS Oct. 14, p. 1), while William Kidd has opted to tackle ad hoc dealsthrough his own buyout shop, Kidd & Co. (BUYOUTS Oct. 28, p. 3).Mr. Hamburg declined to add further comment on the Kidd Kamm split, except tosay the firm had reached a point where it became apparent the decision wasappropriate.Industrial Renaissance will target leveraged build-ups of middle-marketmanufacturing companies in fragmented industries, as well as of stand-aloneacquisitions of under-performing businesses. Industries the firm will focus oninclude industrial and consumer products, and low- to mid-tech manufacturing.It will steer clear of retail and service companies.Target businesses will have sales between $15 million and $150 million."We're looking for companies with weaker systems and operational processes wecan upgrade-the type of deals we can understand and which a truly financialbuyer may not get their hands around," he added.The firm has enough committed capital-from individuals, corporations and thepotential partners-to approach deals, he said, and does not plan to raise afund. "We don't want to be money managers."Industrial Renaissance owes much of its operational bent to Mr. Hamburg'sbackground. Before joining Kidd Kamm in 1993, he spent eight years at AndersenConsulting, where as senior manager he led and managed the implementation ofbusiness turnarounds.

That decision is pending the final agreement with thePhiladelphia-based consultant, which should be presented to the board inJanuary.The pension has determined, however, that the Hamilton Lane relationship willbe a discretionary one, similar to its prior arrangement with Chancellor.Mr. Locke said the pension staff had been satisfied with Chancellor'sperformance and the switch in consultants was at the direction of the board. Asource close to the board pointed out, in an earlier interview, that some boardmembers thought Chancellor did not fairly review certain key partnerships theboard had been interested in.Despite a current 6% allocation to private equity, Mr. Locke said Chancellor'srecent mandate was to invest about $350 million annually, and, Mr. Locke said,Hamilton Lane likely would be targeting the same amount, "depending on themarket and circumstances."Historically, Chancellor committed some $540 million of new capital from thebeginning of its tenure with LACERA in December 1991 through Sept. 30 of thisyear, in addition to reinvesting distributions.The LACERA definition of alternative assets is oriented solely on privateequity, including buyouts, venture capital, mezzanine, secondary purchases anddistressed and turnaround situations. Real estate has a separate allocation andis considered by the pension to be a mainstream, traditional investment.Mr. Locke said he expected Hamilton Lane to establish on an annual basis itsown investment plan that would be reconciled with an overall strategic plan foralternative assets that is being developed by LACERA staff, aided by FrankRussell Co. According to Mr. Locke, the majority of the plan has been drawn upand is being fine-tuned; it should be unveiled and implemented around themiddle of the first quarter, he said.Jennifer Lea Reed.Back to Headline List CopyrightBUYOUTS via NewsNetDecember 09, 1996Advent Kicks Off Third International EffortAdvent International Corp. last month launched a third international buyoutfund targeting established European and Asian markets, said Douglas Brown,president of the Boston-based firm.Offering documents for Global Private Equity III, L.P. feature a $600 milliongoal, although the firm hopes to raise a figure closer to $875 million-enoughto invest $250 million annually for three and a half years, said Tom Armstrong,an executive vice president.Half of the new fund likely will be invested in Europe, with 33% in America and17% in Asia, Mr. Brown said. The fund will not invest in Latin America, whichalready is the focus of Advent's $200 million Latin American Private EquityFund, L.P., which closed this fall (BUYOUTS Aug. 19, p. 7).The new Europe- and Asia-focused fund will target 35 to 40 companies in the $10million to $30 million range, focusing on low-risk investments in establishedmarkets. "For example, we won't do deals in China but have invested in Taiwan,Malaysia and Singapore," Mr. Brown said.The minimum investment is $5 million, with $20 million being the averagecommitment. Co-investments alongside the fund will be encouraged, Mr. Brownsaid.More than half of the fund will be invested in buyouts, with the balance inrecapitalizations and growth financings, he added. This represents an increasein the percentage allotted to buyouts. In previous efforts, the firm investedone-third of its funds in acquisitions (BUYOUTS Oct. 23, 1995, p. 5).The general partners will commit capital amounting to 1% of the fund.Advent's second international fund raised $313 million in 1994. Global PrivateEquity II, L.P. is now 85% invested in 50 companies, with returns in excess of50%, Mr. Brown said. An additional $47 million will be invested by the end ofthe year, he added.The fund recently invested $35 million in Technologistica, an Italianoutsourcer of logistics management (BUYOUTS Nov. 11, p. 16).

"We look at the debt chunk as anadvantage for our investors that will give a bigger kick in terms of returns,"said Stuart Lissner, a vice president of PPM's special investments group.PPM sources said leveraging the fund conservatively also does not significantlyincrease its risk profile; at the same time, it helps boost the fund size forthe first-time vehicle."We're paying 9% on one-third of our capital," which is only marginally higherthan the 8% hurdle rate paid to the fund's limited partners, said BrianSchinderle, another PPM vice president. "The issue is how you want to structureyour capital."According to the offering documents, the fund's strategy involves targetingmajority control positions in debt and equity of financially troubled companiesand other special situations. Approximately 80% of the fund will be deployed indistressed debt, Mr. Lissner said, taking advantage of an inefficient marketfor distressed securities.The Chicago-based firm also has recruited in the past months a team ofinvestment professionals to help raise the fund and put it to work. Theyinclude Mr. Schinderle, who until August was a founder and manager of SanwaBusiness Credit Corp.'s special situations group; Bradley Scher, a formerdirector of distressed loans for Teachers Insurance; Levoyd Robinson, who untilMay oversaw First Chicago Capital Corp.'s distressed portfolio; DavidDieffenbacher, a former associate with First Chicago; and Brian Baldwin, anassociate and formerly an auditor at Grant Thornton LLP.The team is headed by John Stark, a senior vice president who founded PPM'sspecial investments group in 1990.Kopin Tan.Back to Headline List CopyrightBUYOUTS via NewsNetDecember 09, 1996Gen Cap America Readies $25 Mil.

Already, the firm has repaid most of the $35 million debt incurred bythe restructuring, Mr. Megrue said.The firm opted to take Hibbett to an IPO because it can more aggressively fuelthe company's expansion, Mr. Megrue said.Since the buyout firm's recapitalization, Hibbett has opened 19 more storesacross the country, taking the total to 82.Saunders Karp paid for the acquisition with equity from its first vehicle, SKEquity Fund.The firm currently is raising its second fund, SKM Equity Fund II, whichfeatures a goal of $400 million (BUYOUTS Sept. 30, p. 8).T.B.Back to Headline List CopyrightBUYOUTS via NewsNetDecember 09, 1996Amendment Widens  The 100 Investor RuleAn Oct. 11 amendment to the 1940 Investment Company Act that will take effectwithin the next six months is expected to give buyout firms greater flexibilityin future fund raisings.Whereas general partners previously had to restrict the number of investors ina fund to less than 100 to avoid registration and regulation under the Act, theamendment creates a new exemption allowing firms to target an unlimited numberof "qualified purchasers"-individuals with more than $5 million in investmentsor institutions with more than $25 million under management.As a result, buyout firms soon will be able to raise funds from a larger numberof investors, instead of targeting a few limited partners with deeper pocketsin order to keep its investor list to 100, said Paul Schreiber, a partner andhead of asset management group at Shearman & Sterling, a New York-based lawfirm."[The 100 investor rule] hasn't been a problem for most fund raisers," said JayApplegate, a veteran placement agent now with Brittany Capital Group, "but ithas precluded some funds from taking in smaller pieces because each piece isstill counted as a slot."Impact on Fund RaisersBuyout firms raising large funds from a long investor list would appreciate theflexibility, a G.P. source said. For example, TA Associates' TA/Advent VIII andMadison Dearborn Capital Partners II, L.P. both had L.P. rosters numberingclose to 100. Still, not all buyout firms will jump at the opportunity due tothe inconvenience that comes with managing an extensive L.P. list.Placement agents said the amendment likely will have more impact onfunds-of-funds and vehicles targeting individuals and wealthy families, untilnow comparatively minor players in the fund-raising scene due to their smallercommitments. Also, G.P.s who have complained of the slow approval processes ofpublic pensions can bypass them for a greater number of individual investors,although public pensions are still crucial to firms raising sizable fundsbecause of their larger investments.At its inception in 1940, the Investment Company Act had been criticized forits broad inclusion of certain pooled assets whose regulation is not justifiedfor public policy reasons.  Congress at that time created what was called "the100 investor rule," excluding a fund if it had fewer than 100 beneficial ownersof its securities, and G.P.s have lived with the rule ever since.The new amendment will take effect within 180 days from the date of the signingof the Act or when the Securities and Exchange Commission establishes thenecessary rules and definitions, whichever happens earlier, Mr. Schreibersaid.K.T.Back to Headline List CopyrightBUYOUTS via NewsNetDecember 09, 1996Momentum Holds In U.K. Buyout MarketThe U.K. buyout market is showing clear signs of overheating, according to theCentre for Management Buyout Research (CMBOR). The proportion of debt andmezzanine in funding structures is now at 50%, the highest since 1989, and theprice-to-earning ratio-particularly in larger divestment buyouts-is continuingto rise.CMBOR's preliminary analysis of third quarter activity showed volumes downslightly from the second quarter but significantly greater than in 3Q 1995. Inthe last quarter, 140 deals with a value of #1.25 billion ($2.092 billion) wererecorded, an increase of 16% by number and 30% by value over last year's thirdquarter (see table below). The third quarter also saw, for the first time, thevalue of externally generated transactions exceed that of management buyouts.Total deal value for the year to date stands at more than $9.3 billion, andwith several completions since the end of the third quarter and othersubstantial deals expected to close before year end, CMBOR predicts the totalmarket value for 1996 could equal the record $12.5 billion chalked up in 1989.The combination of high prices and the uncertainties in the face of theforthcoming general election is expected to prompt venture capitalists to adopta more cautious approach, but CMBOR predicts that buyouts of privately ownedcompanies will continue at a relatively high level until the election.Meanwhile, many transactions are taking a long time to be completed, withextensive due diligence being undertaken to ensure the high valuations soughtby vendors are realistic.Jennifer JuryBack to Headline List CopyrightBUYOUTS via NewsNetDecember 09, 1996Pantheon Readies European Fund-of-FundsPantheon Ventures is adding a European fund-of-funds to its stable. Althoughformal marketing has not yet begun, Pantheon director Carol Kennedy said thefirm has lined up  #80 million ($134 million) in interest, and a first closingis to take place soon.Pantheon ultimately expects to raise around $250 million for investment inexpansion capital, buyout and mezzanine funds in Western Europe. As much as 10%of the fund may be put into direct investments although Pantheon does notintend to target vehicles that offer co-investment rights. The fund also maytake a small number of secondary positions, with due regard to the prioritythat Pantheon International Participations, the group's quoted vehicle, has inthis area.To date, Pantheon has backed approximately 50 European funds. Pantheon  raisedits second U.S. fund-of-funds this year and is planning a second Asianfund-of-funds for mid-1997; it currently has more than $1 billion undermanagement in the private equity asset class.J.J.Back to Headline List CopyrightBUYOUTS via NewsNetDecember 09, 1996Cinven Lands $500 Mil. For Debut Buyout FundCinven can count its first third-party fund-raising exercise an unqualifiedsuccess: It took the U.K.'s most prolific investor in larger buyouts barelyfive months to raise #300 million ($500 million) for The Cinven Fund from some20 institutions in North America, Continental Europe and the Middle East.Merrill Lynch was lead placement agent for the Cinven Fund, with Cazenove & Co.and JO Hambro Magan the co-agents.The vehicle's original target was $333 million, to be invested  alongsideCinven's four existing institutional clients; the fund was to make commitmentsaccounting for 25% of each transaction. The level of investor appetite ledCinven to up the target to nearly $417 million. Subsequently one of Cinven'sinvestors, Royal Life Insurance, decided to commit through the fund foradministrative convenience following its merger with Sun Alliance. As a result,the fund now will invest about 30% of transaction prices alongside investorsBritish Coal Pension Schemes, Railways Pension Schemes and Barclays BankPension Fund.The 10-year partnership has a five-year investment period. One of the fundsfirst investments will be in Newsquest's $508 million acquisition-jointlyfunded by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.-of Westminster Press.

The effort will include NatWest Markets Mezzanine Finance'steam-comprising Barrie Moore, Tina Sharp and John Sealy-which has joined ABNAMRO Causeway.The fund will hold the first of three scheduled closings immediately on $22million drawn from ABN AMRO and other sources, according to Causeway ManagingDirector Lionel Anthony.The ABN AMRO Causeway Mezzanine Fund was structured to operate independently ofthe parent bank and the group's equity funds. "We think joint equity andmezzanine investment is the wrong approach, since it offers potential forconsiderable conflict of interest," Mr. Anthony said.Given the aggressive lending policies of U.K. banks at present, the groupexpects the bulk of the new fund's deal flow to originate in ContinentalEurope, although the portfolio ultimately will be evenly split between the U.K.and the Continent.J.J.Back to Headline List CopyrightBUYOUTS via NewsNetDecember 09, 1996Approaching the New, Hancock Keeps the OldDespite the pending ownership change and the $750 million-plus domesticfund-of-funds looming on its horizons, Hancock Venture Partners likely willmaintain a conservative approach to investing, sticking to the tried and truestrategy that has worked for the team since 1978.Brooks Zug, a co-founder and general partner of the Boston-based firm, says thenew firm, with the same staff of investment professionals, will continue tomanage and invest the assets the team handled as Hancock Venture Partners.Discussing investment strategy, Mr. Zug says domestic buyouts will continue torepresent between 25% and 30% of Hancock's portfolio. The majority of thatpercentage, nearly 60%, will be directed at partnerships and the rest in directinvestments, which has been the case for much of the last five years.So far, Hancock has raised four domestic fund-of-funds that targeted buyouts,including the $200 million Hancock Venture Partners III, L.P., raised in 1989,and Hancock Venture Partners IV, L.P., which raised $353 million in 1994.This fourth fund-of-funds is fully invested, with partnerships and secondaryinterests accounting for $196 million and direct investments another $156million. The lead investors in the fourth fund included Colorado PublicEmployees' Retirement Association and Oregon Public Employees RetirementSystem, whose commitments each accounted for between 10% and 20% of thefund-of-funds.Some buyout firms Hancock has invested with include Bain Capital, BerkshirePartners, Charterhouse Group International, J.W. Childs Associates, Golder,Thoma, Cressey, Rauner, Inc., Vestar Capital Partners and Welsh, Carson,Anderson & Stowe.Mr. Zug says the increasing amount of money being directed towards buyout fundsdoes not make him feel uncomfortable.Besides establishing itself in the domestic arena, Hancock has carved a nichein the international private equity business as a fund-of-funds manager.The firm this year raised $950 million for its second internationalfund-of-funds, Hancock International Private Equity Partners II, L.P., which is40% invested. Mr. Zug says that the fund is on pace to be fully invested inthree years.The first international fund-of-funds, Hancock International Private EquityPartners, L.P., raised $250 million in 1991.Mr. Zug says buyouts account for 51% of Hancock's international investments.This percentage likely will drop to between 40% and 50% as the fund steps upits investments in Asia, which is not an investment destination targeted bymany buyout firms.Mr. Zug says that 85% of the international fund will be invested inpartnerships, with the balance in direct investments. To date, Fund II hasinvested $225 million in 11 partnerships, nine secondary vehicles and fourdirect deals.By the time the fund-of-funds is fully invested, Mr. Zug says he expects theportfolio to comprise between 12 and 15 investments in Europe, 10 to 12investments in Asia, and six to eight in Latin America, as well as otherinvestments in emerging markets such as South Africa.Target investment size for the fund ranges from $25 million to $30 million forinternational partnerships and between $2 million and $10 million for directinvestments.Mr. Zug says that the vehicle also would invest in undiscovered funds that havenot raised much capital in the United States.International groups with which Hancock has invested include French-based AlphaAssociates and CICLAD SA; U.K.-based Baring Capital Investors, CandoverInvestments PLC, Industri Kapital LTD, and Phildrew Ventures; Dowdy-Hanson inGermany; South Africa-based FirstCorp Capital Investors LTD and South AfricaCapital Growth; the Argentina Private Equity Fund and Italian Private EquityFund, Mr. Zug says."We directly invest in industries that we understand, and we'd like to have astrong local venture or buyout firm," he says.Local Presence EssentialHancock will only invest internationally with fund managers who fullyunderstand the nations and locales they are investing in."We will not invest in someone who comes into this region from another region,"Mr. Zug says. "We want someone who can have breakfast with the company bossonce a week."He said Hancock will consider investing alongside local private equity firmswith which it has not previously partnered. Also, secondary interests inpartnerships will continue as a large part of the overall portfolio.Mr. Zug says secondary investments represent between 20% and 25% of totalinvestments, and this trend would continue.Investors in Hancock's funds include Boeing Co., Deere & Co., Delta Air Lines,Denver Public School Employees' Pension & Benefit Assoc., Ford Foundation, IBMCorp., Louisiana State Employees' Retirement System, Massachusetts PensionsReserve Investment Management Board, NYNEX Asset Management Co., Orange CountyEmployees' Retirement System and William & Flora Hewitt Foundation.J.K.Back to Headline List CopyrightBUYOUTS via NewsNetDecember 09, 1996At Press Time Summit Partners Nears Mezzanine Fund CloseBoston-based Summit Partners is set to close by mid-December a second mezzaninefund that was launched Oct. 31.

About the show:  The Canadian International Automotive Show(CIAS) to be held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, April 14-16, 1996,is expected to attract over 30,000 automotive aftermarketprofessionals from all regions of Canada and the United States.All segments of the automotive aftermarket industry will berepresented, including warehouse distributors, buying groups,wholesalers, mass merchandisers, national accounts, sales agents,national distributors, government buyers, fleet owners, cardealers, owners of body/paint and specialty shops, as well asgarage/service station personnel.  The show will feature 900booths, showcasing the products of more than 300 suppliers ofparts, equipment, accessories, products and services availablefor sale to Canadian, as well as international aftermarketretailers and automotive service companies. The AutomotiveIndustries Association of Canada (AIA) is the organizer of  CIAS,a biennial show that alternates between Canada s two majormetropolises, Toronto and Montreal. CIAS  is Canada s largestautomotive aftermarket show.  The show will host a delegation of300 foreign buyers from more than 40 countries in 1996.  Inaddition to the USA Pavilion, CIAS will also present in Montrealthe  Future Store : the jobber store of the future featuringthree distinct areas: over-the-counter sales (retail),professional sales,  and, warehousing, shipping and receivingoperations -- each highlighting the future of its area.2.  About the market:  There are several favorable marketindicators that should convince U.S. firms to benefit from theUSA pavilion program and take part in Canada s largest automotiveaftermarket event.  Over the past four years, a fast-growingCanadian demand for automotive aftermarket products in thecategories of glass and mirrors, light trucks and trailer parts,instrumentation, garage equipment and supplies and aftermarketaccessories has been successfully satisfied by an increasingnumber of U.S. suppliers.  U.S. exporters have nearly doubledtheir Canadian business in these categories of products andequipment. There is room for many more U.S.-made automotiveaftermarket products in Canada because a sustained,  strongdemand is anticipated over the next three years.  The vehicle-ageand vehicle-type composition of the Canadian fleet is nowtransformed, thus creating a demand for an increasing variety oftechnologically advanced, reliable and quality automotiveproducts and equipment.  Over the past five years, the Canadianfleet of light trucks, including pick-up trucks, vans and sportutility vehicles, jumped  from 3.9 million to 4.6 million, whilepassenger cars slightly declined from 11.2 million to 11.0million.  The Canadian automotive aftermarket largely depends onimports which are valued at US$3.1 billion (point of entry), ofwhich nearly US$2.3 billion or 70 percent come from the UnitedStates.  The USA Pavilion program is an ideal way to enter theCanadian market, as well as an excellent way to increase yoursales to Canadian customers with whom you already do business.3.  About the pavilion:  The USA Pavilion presented at CIAS  96will offer a complete program for first-class access to theCanadian automotive aftermarket.  Highly successful at CIAS 94 inToronto, the USA Pavilion will now move to CIAS 96 in Montreal,again hosting U.S. firms ready to start on their way tosuccessfully penetrating the Canadian marketplace.  USA Pavilionparticipants will benefit from: professionally designed andfully-furnished  booth spaces located near the show entrance; apromotional program which includes advanced industry-widepublicity and on-site promotions; a direct mailing campaignpromoting participants  products and services -- targetedexclusively to buyers, agents, dealers, wholesalers/distributorsand government agencies; a detailed exhibitor briefing featuringexperts on local market conditions and competitive practices;personal on-site assistance provided by our fully bilingual CSstaff; and, a by-invitation-only cocktail reception to meet withkey Canadian Industry executives.4.

Summary: After four straight years of losses, Eastern Canada-based pulp and paper producers led Canada s forestry sector to abrilliant recovery in 1995.  Primarily newsprint producers,eastern Canadian pulp and paper producers have developed newproducts to diversify their production over the past few years.Spread in four of the five eastern provinces, the 116 mills inoperation  are generating combined profits that will exceedUS$1.5 billion in 1995, a return to profit levels onlyexperienced in the mid and late 80 s.   Eastern Canadian pulp andpaper producers are highly motivated to maintain their worldcompetitiveness through cost-efficiency and productivity, takinginto account the achievement of high levels of quality for theirproducts and compliance to environmental and internationalstandards.   U.S. firms who can help Canadian pulp and paperproducers achieve their goals will find excellent export businessopportunities in the Canadian market place. The CommercialService (CS) in Canada offers a direct and cost-efficientassistance service to U.S. firms ready to explore Canada's pulpand paper industry market.  (End summary) 2.  Prices and exports are up in 1995 and the forest industrywill have spent, by year-end, close to US$1 billion in newproducts development, environmental initiatives and  advancedtechnology in Canada.  The Canadian Pulp and Paper Associationestimates that Canadian forest products companies have sufferedlosses of over US$4 billion between 1991 and 1994.   Now, theforestry industry sector is back in the leading group of Canada sgoods-producing industries with a forecast of combined profits ofU$$2.3 billion for 1995.  Much of this outstanding  recovery islinked to the successes of eastern Canadian-based pulp and paperproducts producers located in the provinces of New Brunswick,Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec.  In the first twoquarters of 1995, eastern Canadian pulp and paper producers havereported profits nearing three quarters of a billion US dollars,and they expect to more than double these profits to US$1.7billion by year s end.3.  Eastern Canada s  pulp and paper industry is favored by asubstantial forest base, deep water ports and a well-establishedtransportation network.  Composed of some 116 pulp and papermills, with more than half of those located in Quebec, easternCanadian mills vary quite significantly in size and increasinglyin product specialty, ranging from 100 to 1,300 tpd in capacityand producing a variety of products from molded pulp egg trays tolightweight coated printing papers. This mix of mill capacity andproduct specialty is more noticeable in Quebec and Ontario thanin New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.   However, eastern Canada isprimarily a newsprint producing region. Quebec and Ontario are,respectively,  the first and second newsprint producing provincesin Canada with production of 4.1 and 1.8 million tons per year.Newfoundland s three mills are newsprint operations as well.4.  Newsprint is not eastern Canada pulp and paper industry sonly strength.  Exports of printing and writing papers, forexample, now account for more than 14 percent of the totalindustry s exports.  Over the years, an appreciablediversification in the making of value-added products is alsoworth mentioning for products like corrugating mediums, linerboard, chemic-thermomecanical pulp (CTMP) and bleached hardwoodand softwood kraft pulp, as well as lightweight coated papers.5.  Current pulp and paper price improvements have pushed theindustry back to almost full production capacity levels. Profitsare definitely back and while the paying off of long-term debtscomes first on the agenda, pollution control and quality controlupgrades,  personnel training and machine automation and speedupsappear equally important to remain competitive and preserve theindustry s world market share.  Since the majority of easternCanadian mills export to the United States and other countries,compliance with the International Standards Organization (ISO)standards through a certification process has become necessary tocontinue doing business.  These quality standards along withenvironmental standards have rapidly gained  recognition withinthe industry as being  instrumental to improving quality,acquiring environmental acceptance and, as a result, maintainingthe industry s world market share.6.  Canadian paper products have always enjoyed a reputation forhigh quality which will only be maintained by producingincreasingly higher value paper grades and maintaining strictadherence to internationally accepted standards, such as ISOstandards.  In addition, only large-scale investment incomputerized process control and other automation technologieswill help Canadian mills live up to their reputation.  RecentCanadian statistics reveal that paper companies using at leastone type of advanced technology in their operations, such asCAD/CAE systems, programmable controllers, manufacturinginformation systems, for example, accounted for 86 percent of theindustry s shipments in 1993.  Those using at least 10technologies already accounted for 23 percent of the shipments.Canadian pulp and paper makers have presently achieved asufficient level of technological advancement to be well-positioned in the international market place. To maintain thatadvantage they are committed to constant up-grades to meet thenew challenges of the global economy.  This presents U.S.manufacturers of goods and services for this industry with futureopportunities,  as it has with past ones in 1995.7.  U.S. firms who can help Canadian pulp and paper makersimprove their production cost efficiency, quality andenvironmental standards and their specialized employees  skillswill find excellent export business opportunities in the Canadianmarket place. The Commercial Service  in Canada offers a directand cost-efficient assistance service to U.S. firms ready toexplore Canada's pulp and paper industry market with its  newopportunities.

Summary:  A survey conducted by the Standards Council ofCanada (SCC) with more than 2000 Canadians provides, from aunique angle, consumer profile information expressed throughconsumers attitudes and expectations regarding standardsaffecting the environment, health and other services, as well asa number of consumer products.  An amazingly high 62 percent ofcompleted and returned survey questionnaires indicates thatCanadians express a high degree of interest for standards. Thesurvey concludes that Canadian consumers are most familiar withproducts' safety and performance standards but lack familiaritywith standards affecting products  quality, environmental impact,as well as with national and international standards in suchareas.  U.S. firms which market or intend to market consumerproducts and services in Canada will want to learn more from thissurvey by contacting SCC or any of the accredited standardsdevelopment organizations in Canada. (End summary)2. Environment: The SCC survey indicates there is a clear andsignificant priority attached to standards for drinking waterpurity, waste disposal methods and air quality in buildings. Inaddition to responding to the survey's environmentalstandardization questions, 40 percent of respondents volunteeredcomments on the subject. Many expressed concerns for insufficientor inadequate standards in relation to forestry, outside airquality, and motor vehicle emissions.3. Health: The top three health-related standard priorities forrespondents were water safety and purity, food quality andsafety, particularly standards for levels of bacteria in food.Most senior respondents gave high priority to presentation andcontent of information standards concerning prescription and non-prescription drugs. Other priorities identified in the survey'ssection entitled "over 65" were standards for personal healthcareequipment, personal monitoring or alarm systems for people livingalone, and standards regulating  print size on package labels.4. Services: The SCC survey's under age 60 respondents showed astrong interest in standards for education,  while day carestandards were a priority for more females than males in theunder 40 age category of respondents.  A priority regularly citedby all age groups combined was that of the necessity of standardsfor warranties and guaranties attached to products and services.5. Products: In the SCC survey, Canadian consumers were asked toindicate the level of importance they attach to standards for alist of 23 products. Heat, smoke, and fire detection systems andburglar alarms standards attracted the greatest frequency ofresponse. Following closely were concerns regarding properstandards for child-resistant containers, tamper proof closures,products for the physically handicapped, motorized vehicles andequipment, circuit breakers and water treatment devices.6. SCC concludes that the survey draws a portrait of a Canadianpopulation for which the level of knowledge about standards islimited, even in areas of traditional consumer interest. Even ifrespectively 70 and 57 percent of respondents claim  familiaritywith safety and performance standards, survey results indicatethat respondents are minimally familiar with quality,environmental management, national, and international standards.For example, 71 percent acknowledge their unfamiliarity withinternational standards.7. U.S. firms which intend to market their products and servicesin Canada will learn more by contacting SCC or any of theaccredited standards development organizations in Canada. U.S.firms may also decide to familiarize themselves with the Canadianmarket through the help of the Commercial Service (CS) of theU.S. Department of Commerce which operates offices across Canada.The Gold Key Service, for example, is one of CS's many serviceswhich offers a cost-effective and efficient way of initiatingbusiness contacts in Canada.

FRANCE TELECOM'S MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES HAVE LOSTMORE THAN FF5 BILLION (USD 1 BILLION).  THIS IS PARTICULARLYSURPRISING SINCE MOST PRIVATE MOBILE PHONE OPERATORS IN EUROPEHAVE BEEN PROFITABLE.2.  IN 1994, FRANCE TELECOM MOBILES RADIO TELEPHONE AND FRANCETELECOM MOBILES POINTEL LOST FF870 MILLION AND FF215 MILLION,RESPECTIVELY.  THIS IS A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT COMPARED TO 1993,WHERE FIGURES SHOWED A TOTAL LOSS OF FF1.36 BILLION.  THE RADIOTELEPHONE UNIT COMPRISES RADIOCOM 2000 AND ITINERIS, THEOPERATOR'S ANALOG AND DIGITAL CELLULAR NETWORKS; POINTEL'S ONLYBUSINESS IS THE BI-BOP TELEPOINT SYSTEM.  IN 1994, THE REVENUE INRADIO TELEPHONE AMOUNTED TO FF3.80 BILLION, WHILE THAT OF BI-BOPTO FF120 MILLION.3.  FRANCE TELECOM WAS CRITICIZED FOR NOT CREATING TWO SEPARATESUBSIDIARIES FOR ITS MOBILE ACTIVITIES.  THE COUR DES COMPTES,THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT BODY THAT MONITORS THE FINANCIALPERFORMANCE OF STATE-OWNED COMPANIES REPORTED THAT FRANCE TELECOMHAS NOT MET THE TWO CRITERIA ESTABLISHED FOR MOBILE OPERATORS BYFRENCH REGULATORS - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY, ANDFAIR COMPETITION BETWEEN COMPETITORS.  FURTHERMORE, THE REPORTSHOWED THAT PROVISIONS FOR BAD DEBTS ARE UNDERESTIMATED BECAUSETHE SAME RATIOS USED FOR FIXED NETWORK CUSTOMERS ARE USED FORMOBILE, A SECTOR WITH LESS CUSTOMER FIDELITY.4.  FOR THE TIME BEING, FRANCE TELECOM RADIO TELEPHONE UNIT HASNO ALTERNATIVE THAN TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE RADIOCOM 2000BUSINESS UNTIL IT EVENTUALLY DECREASES BY ATTRITION AND CLOSESDOWN.  WITH THE INCREASE IN COMPETITION AND A DESIRE TO SIGN UPSUBSCRIBERS 'AT ALL COSTS', ADVERTISING EXPENSES (WHICHREPRESENTED 11 PERCENT OF RADIO TELEPHONE'S REVENUE AND 150PERCENT OF POINTEL'S IN 1993) WILL CONTINUE TO GROW.  THEREFORE,FRANCE TELECOM'S FORECAST THAT THE MOBILE BUSINESS WILL BREAKEVEN IN 1996 OR 1997 MAY BE UNREALISTIC.5.  DESPITE THIS SITUATION, THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF FRANCETELECOM'S MOBILE OPERATIONS ASSERTS THAT THE RADIO TELEPHONE UNITWILL BREAK EVEN NEXT YEAR WHILE THE BI-BOP WILL NEVER BEPROFITABLE.

SUMMARY.  OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS, CARGO HANDLEDBY THE PORTS AT CALCUTTA AND HALDIA (BOTH RIVER PORTS TOTHE BAY OF BENGAL) HAS INCREASED BY ALMOST 35 PERCENT.THE NUMBER OF CONTAINER LINES CALLING AT CALCUTTA HASGONE UP FROM 20 IN 1988 TO 69 AT PRESENT AND THE NUMBEROF CONTAINERS HANDLED HAS INCREASED 120 PERCENT.  THECOMMISSIONING OF THREE NEW CONTAINER FREIGHT STATIONS ATCALCUTTA PORT HAS REDUCED CONGESTION AND CONTAINERHANDLING CHARGES.  LABOR RELATIONS THAT WERE EXTREMELYTURBULENT DURING THE 1980'S, RESULTING IN FREQUENTSTRIKES, NOW ARE COOPERATIVE.  THE AVERAGE PRE-BERTHINGDETENTION OF SHIPS AT CALCUTTA IS LESS THAN A DAY, ONEOF THE LOWEST AMONG INDIAN PORTS.  PORT FACILITIES AREBEING PRIVATIZED, AND PORT AUTHORITIES ARE SEEKINGPRIVATE INVESTMENT TO AUGMENT FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.WITH INCREASING INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY IN EASTERN INDIA,CALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTS ARE LIKELY TO HANDLE 30MILLION TONS OF CARGO BY THE YEAR 2000.  END SUMMARY2.  BACKGROUND.  CALCUTTA, INDIA'S OLDEST MAJOR PORT(AND ONE OF TWO RIVERINE ONES), IS CURRENTLY CELEBRATINGITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY.  OVER THE YEARS THE DRAUGHT OFTHE PORT HAS DECLINED DUE TO SILTATION OF THE HOOGLYRIVER (A BRANCH OF THE GANGES), AND LARGE SHIPS AREUNABLE TO REACH CALCUTTA.  HOWEVER, THE ADVENT OF"FEEDER" VESSELS HAS BEEN A BOON, AND BOTH CONTAINERIZEDAND OTHER CARGO HANDLED BY CALCUTTA HAS INCREASEDCONSTANTLY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  TO OVERCOME THEPROBLEMS OF LOW DRAUGHT AT CALCUTTA, IN 1977 A NEW PORTWAS COMMISSIONED AT HALDIA, 83 KM. DOWNSTREAM FROMCALCUTTA.  THE CALCUTTA PORT TRUST (CPT), A PARASTATALUNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, ADMINISTERS BOTH THECALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTS.3.  CALCUTTA PORT.  CARGO HANDLED BY CALCUTTA PORTINCREASED FROM 4.34 MILLION TONS IN IFY (APRIL 1 THRUMARCH 31) 1988-89 TO OVER 5.17 MILLION TONS IN IFY1993-94.  THE HANDLING OF CONTAINERIZED CARGO HASINCREASED EVEN MORE RAPIDLY.  AT PRESENT AN AVERAGE 70PERCENT OF CARGO IS CONTAINERIZED, COMPARED WITH THEALL-INDIA AVERAGE OF 35 PERCENT.  THE NUMBER OFCONTAINERS HANDLED BY CALCUTTA INCREASED BY OVER 120PERCENT, FROM 50,815 TWENTY-FOOT EQUIVALENT UNITS (TEUS)IN IFY 1988-89 TO 112,032 IN IFY 1994-95.  CONTAINERTRAFFIC INCREASED BY ALMOST 17 PERCENT, FROM 96,007 TEUSIN 1993-94 TO 112,032 TEUS IN IFY 1994-95.  DURINGAPRIL-SEPTEMBER 1995, CALCUTTA PORT HANDLED 60,053 TEUS,AND PORT OFFICIALS EXPECT THAT 130,000 TEUS WILL BEHANDLED IN 1995-96.4.  WHILE THE NUMBER OF SHIPS CALLING AT CALCUTTADECLINED FROM 840 IN IFY 1988-89 TO 780 IN IFY 1992-93,THE NUMBER OF CONTAINER LINES OPERATING AT CALCUTTA HASINCREASED FROM ABOUT 20 IN 1988-89 TO 69 AT PRESENT.THE AVERAGE PRE-BERTHING DETENTION OF SHIPS AT CALCUTTAIS LESS THAN A DAY, ONE OF THE LOWEST AMONG INDIAN PORTS.5.  IN SEPTEMBER, CALCUTTA PORT COMMISSIONED A NEW, RS.250 MILLION, COMPUTERIZED CONTAINER FREIGHT STATION(CFS), WHICH CAN HANDLE 75,000 TEUS ANNUALLY.  WITHTHIS, CONTAINER HANDLING FACILITIES HAVE EXPANDED BYOVER 20 PERCENT AND CONTAINER HANDLING COSTS HAVEDECLINED CONSIDERABLY.  OPERATION OF TWO ADDITIONALFREIGHT STATIONS (ONE PRIVATELY OWNED AND THE OTHEROWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA) HAS ALSO HELPED TOREDUCE CONGESTION AT THE PORT.  AN OFFICIAL OF THEAMERICAN PRESIDENT LINE TOLD US THAT OVER THE PASTCOUPLE OF YEARS, EFFICIENCY AT CALCUTTA PORT HASIMPROVED.  HE COMPLAINED, HOWEVER, ABOUT INADEQUATE ANDPOORLY MAINTAINED PORT EQUIPMENT THAT OFTEN RESULTS INDELAYS.6.  LABOR.  THE WORKFORCE AT CALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTSHAS DECLINED FROM 26,000 IN 1990 TO 21,000 AT PRESENT(16,000 AT CALCUTTA AND 5000 AT HALDIA).  IT ISESTIMATED THAT THIS LABOR FORCE STILL CONTAINS SOME11,000 UNNECESSARY WORKERS.  AS NATURAL ATTRITIONACCOUNTS FOR THE LOSS OF 1500 WORKERS ANNUALLY, THESURPLUS IS COULD BE ELIMINATED BY THE YEAR 2002.TRADITIONALLY, CALCUTTA PORT WAS BEDEVILED BY TURBULENTINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND LONG STRIKES.  FOR THE PASTSEVERAL YEARS INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS HAVE BEEN CORDIAL ANDPRODUCTIVITY HAS IMPROVED.  HOWEVER, SPORADIC AGITATIONSBY THE STAFFS OF CLEARING AGENTS, STEVEDORES,TRANSPORTERS AND CONTRACTORS CONTINUE TO HAMPER PORTOPERATIONS AT CALCUTTA.7.  HALDIA.  HALDIA'S FORTE IS THE HANDLING OF CRUDE,OIL AND LUBRICANTS (POL), PETROLEUM DISTILLATES, ANDBULK CARGO, INCLUDING FERTILIZERS AND COAL.  PRE-BERTHING DETENTION AT HALDIA IS ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THECOUNTRY.  CARGO HANDLED BY HALDIA INCREASED FROM 9.88MILLION TONS IN IFY 1988-89 TO 13.29 MILLION TONS(INCLUDING 7.69 MILLION TONS OF CRUDE AND POL) IN IFY1994-95.  ALTHOUGH CONTAINER HANDLING IS CHEAPER ATHALDIA THAN CALCUTTA, THE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS HANDLEDAT THE FORMER DURING THIS PERIOD DECREASED FROM 15,901TO 5,745.8.  NEW FACILITIES AT HALDIA.  A NEW BULK LIQUIDTERMINAL IS PLANNED AT HALDIA TO AUGMENT FACILITIES TOCOPE WITH THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN THE TRAFFIC OF CRUDE,POL AND NAPTHA.  (NAPTHA WILL BE THE BASIC INPUT OF ALARGE PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX BEING PLANNED NEARBY.)  WITHTHE CONSTRUCTION OF A PIPELINE LINKING THE EXISTINGREFINERIES AT HALDIA AND BARAUNI (IN THE STATE OFBIHAR), THE CRUDE HANDLED BY HALDIA (3.28 MILLION TONSIN IFY 1994-95) IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ALMOST ONEHUNDRED PERCENT IN IFY 1998-99.  TWO MULTIPURPOSE BERTHSARE BEING DEVELOPED AND A SECOND "ARM" AT THE DOCK HASBEEN EXCAVATED.  ON COMPLETION OF THE NEW FACILITIES,HALDIA'S CARGO HANDLING CAPACITY WILL INCREASE TO ANESTIMATED 35 MILLION TONS PER YEAR.10.  SHIP REPAIR YARD AT HALDIA.  A STUDY BY THE ASIANDEVELOPMENT BANK HAS RECOMMENDED THAT A SHIP REPAIR YARDWITH FACILITIES FOR UNDERWATER HULL REPAIR BE SET UP ATHALDIA.  (HALDIA, BEING A RIVERINE PORT, HAS THEADVANTAGE OF BEING RELATIVELY INSULATED FROM CYCLONES.)FOLLOWING THIS, THE CPT COMPLETED NEGOTIATIONS FOR APRIVATELY-OWNED SHIP REPAIR YARD AT HALDIA.  THE YARDWILL HAVE TWO DRY DOCKS WITH FACILITIES CAPABLE OFSERVICING SHIPS UP TO 80,000 DWT AND A LAY-BY WET BERTHWITH SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE.  SEMBAWANG SHIPYARD OFSINGAPORE WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.  THEPROJECT IS AWAITING A GREEN SIGNAL FROM THE CENTRALGOVERNMENT.11.  PRIVATIZATION.

In Japan, the Big Store Law (Daitenho) has changed the face ofretailing. The law has encouraged a reduction in the numbers ofhigh cost, privately owned, small retail stores.  In contrast,there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of low cost,publicly owned shopping center-type operations.  The process ofmodernizing Japan's retail sector, however, is only halffinished.  Expected liberalization of the Daitenho in 1996 and1997 will further accelerate the transition process.  End Summary2. Statistics recently compiled by the Japan Development Bankclearly indicate the inefficiencies of the Japanese distributionsystem relative to its U.S. counterpart.- From 1980 to 1993, the number of people engaged in wholesaleand retail trade in Japan increased only 1.43 million compared toan increase of 5.05 million in the U.S. during the same period.- Japan's wholesale/retail share of GDP was reduced from 14.3 to14.1 percent compared to an increase in the U.S. from 13.5percent to 16.6 percent, during the same period.- Japan's wholesale/retail ratio is 2.1/1, compared to 1.1/1 inthe U.S.- In the U.S., 60 percent of all retail stores were privatelyowned in 1972.  This percentage fell to 36 percent by 1988.  InJapan, 61 percent of total retail stores were privately owned in1994.3. According to 1994 MITI statistics, there are 1.59 millionretailers in Japan, of which small retailers with 1 to 4 workerscomprised 1.13 million or 71 percent of the total.  These smallstores have been disappearing at a rate of 47,000 stores per yearsince a partial relaxation of the Daitenho in 1990.4. At the same time, the number of large stores has beenincreasing rapidly.  In 1989, before the implementation of therelaxation of the Daitenho, the number of annual applications forthe establishment of large stores was 794.  In 1990, the numberof applications increased to 1,667.  In 1995, more than 1,900applications to open large stores have thus far been submitted.5. Since 1990, partial relaxation of the Daitenho has taken placethree times, as follows:1990 --   Maximum length of the application processing became 18          months.  (Implemented through an extended          interpretation of the law.)1992 --   Maximum length of application processing became 12          months.  Adoption of procedural transparency          (Implemented through partial amendment of the law.)1994 --   Basic liberalization of stores with floor space less          than 1,000 square meters.  Relaxation of store hours,          number of holidays in a year, etc. (Implemented          through an extended interpretation of the law.)6. In the not too distant future, we expect incremental reform ofthe Daitenho to continue.  Specifically, we expect that theapplication process will be simplified.  Moreover, the timerequired for approval will fall from the present 9 month period.In 1997, it is likely that the government will announce furtherliberalization of store operating parameters, including floorspace, business hours and number of vacation days.7. At the same time, one should remember that there are manyforces working against the relaxation of the Big Store Law.  Thefollowing associations have lined up in support of the presenthighly restrictive legislation:a)  Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industryb)  Federation of National Commerce and Industryc)  Central Organization for National Small/Medium Sized Businessd)  Federation of National Shopping District Promotion    Association, ande)  8 other small/medium size business organizations.Organizations that favor reform or abolition of the law are:a)  Foreign Governmentsb)  Large store corporationsc)  Japan Chain Store Associationd)  Federation of Economic Organization in Yamaguchi Prefecture.8. Industry sources say that the restrictions of the Daitenhohave led to rapid development of a large number of suburban,roadside stripmalls.  These stripmalls do not have any largestore tenants.  Rather, they contain a large number of smallretail outlets and therefore do not fall under the purview of theDaitenho.  At the same time, these stripmalls do not enjoy thesame economies of scale, or low prices, as large shopping centerswith one or more large scale tenants.9. As of now, while there are as many as 40,000 shopping centersin the U.S., there are only 2,225 shopping centers with largescale tenants in Japan.  An industry source estimates that thenumber of Japanese shopping centers will increase by 20,000 overthe next ten years.10. At the same time, there are 15,000 shop-lined streets inJapan.  Almost all of the outlets along the "shopping streets"are privately owned and managed as single store outlets.  Theyare high cost operations and are the most likely to fall victimto further liberalization of the Daitenho.  For example,according to a recent article in "Distribution Service News," 7of 33 three stores in Kamuma City's shop-lined street are closed.This case is considered to be typical of many Japanese towns andsmall cities.11. The success of "Toys R Us" has is inspired similar largescale, single category formats in other segments: electronics,appliances, tools, men's wear and sporting goods.  The trend isaccelerating as Japanese companies anticipate further relaxation,and ultimate abolition, of the Daitenho in the near future.12. The structural shift in the retail industry in Japan istaking place at a time when the "barriers to entry" for foreignretailers are much reduced.  Land prices have dropped on theaverage by 50 percent and rental is down by 40 percent.  This isdue to record levels of real estate vacancies (15 percent inmajor cities).  In addition, companies that wish to build theirown properties will find that construction costs have alsodeclined up to 40 percent in some cases.  Most importantly, thelow value of the dollar gives companies that source abroad acompetitive advantage over Japanese competitors.  Now is a goodtime for foreign retailers to re-consider entry into the Japanesemarket.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL BUSINESSMAN NEWS REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 1, 1996 WATER QUALITY PLAN1. SUMMARY: The results of a recent study, "Quality of Water inSpain: Summary Report", published by the Ministry of Health andConsumer Affairs, indicate that the quality of Spanish coastalwaters is good, whereas there are still problems with continentalwaters, especially in Spain's central regions. The controlnetwork established to measure the quality of water in Spain ismanaged by Hydrographic Confederacies, which feed data to theMinistry in Madrid through an automatic station network. Thisnetwork officially began working in March 1995 under the nameSAICA (Sistema Automatico de Informacion de Calidad de las Aguas,Water Quality Information Automatic Network). This reportprovides background information on the SAICA program and a listof the Hydrographic Confederacies and Spanish firms that supplyequipment or services to SAICA, which is considered one of themost sophisticated water quality information systems in theworld.2.  The network established to control and measure the quality ofwater in Spain is managed by the Hydrographic Confederacies,which are independent governmental bodies located throughout thecountry with responsibilities for monitoring and managing Spain'swater resources. These Confederacies have implemented a remotesystem for measuring the quality of water (automatic stationsnetwork) under the name SAICA (Sistema Automatico de Informacionde Calidad de las Aguas). These stations can transmit monitoreddata via satellite to the headquarters of each HydrographicConfederacy and to a central unit located in the Ministry ofPublic Works, Transportation and Environment in Madrid. The datatransmitted through this network gives information on turbidity,ph, carbon and metal content, oxygen content, phosphates andammonia. Each Confederacy has its own analytical laboratory, orhas special agreements with officially approved privatelaboratories.3. The SAICA system is considered one of the most sophisticatedsystems of its kind in the world, and official Spanish sourcesproudly say that it is the only system in the world establishedon a country-wide basis. It covers all of the main river basinsin Spain and uses state-of-the-art technology. Total investmentin the SAICA system was Pts 10,000 million (USD 80 million) whichincludes installation of 1,000 manual water quality controlstations and 200 automatic control stations. Investment waspartially funded through European Union Cohesion Funds (85% oftotal investment).For further information on the Spanish water quality controlsystem please see "IMI: Water Quality Measuring in Spain" datedAugust 1995 and prepared by FCS Barcelona.4. Interested U.S. suppliers of water quality control and datatransmitting equipment may wish to contact the HydrographicConfederacies directly (as they have responsibility for equipmentprocurement in their regions) or contact the private firms whichprovide equipment or are in charge of the SAICA network for eachmajor Spanish river basin.5.

It isthe fifth Internet provider in Indonesia to date.The provider is called CBNnet, established by P.T. CyberindoAditama in cooperation with YPTI, Foundation of TechnicalEducation in Indonesia, a foundation under the Department ofTourism, Post and Telecommunication.Mr. Dani Sumarsono, president of P.T. Cyberindo Aditama,informed U.S. Commercial Service Jakarta that Internet businessin Indonesia will grow steadily and competition will be based onservices, tariff rates, reliability and accessibility. Tarifflevels have been set by the government, so that each Internetprovider only has a narrow band within which to compete in price.CBNnet has a maximum modem speed of 28.8 Kbps for individualaccounts (IP dial up) and 33.6 Kbps for corporate accounts (LANdial up). At this stage, its target market is the professionalsin the Jakarta area. With improving infrastructures, CBNnet isoptimist it could get at least 2,000 individual accounts in thefirst year of operation. Mr. Sumarsono revealed that there hasalready been a big jump in the number of Internet users inJakarta. In June this year, there were 8,000 users, but bySeptember there were 15,000 users. He expects it will takeseveral more years for the industry to become fully mature.There are currently four other Internet providers : IndoInternet(P.T. IndoInternet), Idola (P.T.

Summary: Eastern Germany's large chemicals industry, whichaccounted for 20 percent of total industrial output for thenation before reunification, continues to confront the problemsof restructuring its large inefficient chemical concerns,adapting to new markets, finding buyers, and cleaning up massivepollution.2. Background:  in the former GDR (Eastern Germany), 230 chemicalcompanies, encompassing petrochemicals, plastics, rubber, andpotash mining, were grouped into 14 huge conglomerates.  By 1994over 200 of these companies had been privatized.  However, thesize of these privatized companies averaged under 300 employees.The remaining chemicals firms had the overwhelming share of thetotal employees in the industry.  The large companies alsosuffered from antiquated equipment and continue to operate in themidst of massive environmental damage. The most publicizedprivatization case covered the three chemical production sites ineastern Germany which Dow Chemical (Midland, Michigan) agreed tobuy in November.  This is the Buna Sow Leuna (BSL) conglomerate.3. Interim Market Dynamics:  the output trend for inorganic andorganic chemicals clearly reflects changes in the eastern Germanchemicals market.  The primary change is aimed at reducinglignite processing and building up a petrochemicals base.  Sincethe middle of 1990 over 150 antiquated production facilities inthe chemical industry have been shut down in eastern Germany.  InLeuna, plants for ammonia, methanol high-pressure, and phenolsynthesis were shut down, and in the Buna facility, carbide-acetylene production.  Until production of basic chemicals can berestarted on a petrochemical basis, organic chemicals for furtherprocessing are purchased from elsewhere.4. Environmental Consequences: environmental cleanup is a highpriority for the Germans, accounting for one-third of totalinvestments in the eastern German chemicals industry.  TheTreuhand (federal privatization agency) originally provided Bunawith DM 300 million for the construction of an oxychlorinatingplant for pvc production and for an air separation plant.  ForLeuna the Treuhand provided DM 250 million for a hydrogenproduction plant, a refinery water cleaning plant, adesulphurization plant, and a tanker filling station.  For manychemical companies, funds are being provided for disposing ofpolluted waste dumps.5. Dow Chemical: In November, 1995 the European Commissionreached a final decision to approve the privatization of the BunaSow Leuna (BSL) Olefin chemicals conglomerate in the easternGerman state of Saxony-Anhalt. To that end the EC Commission hasdecided to allow up to 5.5 billion dollars of investmentsubsidies to support the privatisation plan laid out by DowChemical. Dow will own 80 percent of the BSL conglomerate withthe remaining 20 percent owned by BVS (the successor agency tothe Treuhand).  So far, ten companies have signed letters ofintent to join Dow at BSL, including the American plasticsmolder, Ampacet Corp., Spanish-owned Grupo Coexpan, the BelgianRavago, Italy's ILPA, Manuli Group and Deribok.6. Modernisation: Dow has plans to upgrade a number of existingfacilities.  The existing chlorine plant will be upgraded fromthe current mercury-based process to a membrane process,eliminating the use of mercury in these plants.  The ethylenedichloride (EDC)  and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) plant at Bunawill be upgraded along with an increase of VCM capacity to330,000 tons per year.  The existing rubber production facilitieswill be retrofitted and upgraded.  The low-density polyethyleneplants at the Leuna site will be upgraded to increase plantsafety.  And a general upgrade of the process instrumentation andcontrol systems is planned.  The Boehlen steam cracker whichproduces the main building blocks for derivative plants at allthree sites will be upgraded and expanded to make the crackerglobally cost-competitive in technology and feedstockflexibility.  Total capacity by the end of 1997 will be 450,000tons per year.  The upgrade will include plant modifications suchas four new cracking furnaces, on-stream analyzers andcomputerized process control.7. New Equipment: new facilities are also planned.  A 210,000ton-per-year plant for the production of DOWLEX(r) linear low-density polyethylene at the Buna site will come on stream in late1997, in coordination with the expanded production of the steamcracker at Boehlen.  A 200,000 ton-per-year polypropylene plantwill be built at the Buna site and will come on stream during thesecond quarter of 1998.  A 130,000 ton-per-year aniline plantwill come on stream in late 1998.  A 90,000 ton-per-year acrylicacid and a 93,000 ton-per-year acrylic ester unit will be builtto obtain viable economics through scale and technology.  Severalfacilities for the compounding and recycling of polymers will beadded to the Buna site.8. Feedstock Pipeline: a new pipeline is also planned.  A 16-inchmulti-feedstock liquid pipeline from the deep-sea port of Rostockto the Boehlen site has already been started by the SaechsischeOlefinwerke GmbH.  Planning and construction of this pipelinewill include the construction of required facilities such asharbor facilities, terminals and pump stations.9. Chemicals Industry Supplier Mission:  FCS Berlin is planningfor the Spring of 1996 a trade mission to eastern Germany, whichwill include a stop at the Buna Sow Leuna facilities.  Those U.S.firms that can benefit from new contacts in the chemicalsindustry in eastern Germany are encouraged to participate.  Themission will be coordinated with German authorities to insurethat the best contacts are made for the U.S. participants.

IMPORTS OF DIVERSE RANGE AND QUALITY OFBICYCLES WHICH STARTED TO DRIVE THE MARKET, PROMPTED THELOCAL MANUFACTURERS TO FOLLOW SUIT.  SOME OF THEM SIGNEDLICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH LEADING BRANDS, WHILE OTHERSDIRECTED THEMSELVES TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY.  IN 1995,LOCAL PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO REACH 900,000 UNITS AND$175 MILLION.

TheCompany's  integrating  concept is People to  People  Technology,  whichembraces  multimedia, human interface systems and electronic devices  toenhance communications worldwide.Oki Electric is a responsible corporate citizen that contributes to  thewell-being of its host communities around the world.The  Company  was founded in January 1881 and  established  in  November1949.News:   August  1995  Message from the  President  and  Chief  ExecutiveOfficer, Mr. Jun Jinguji:"Oki  Electric  attained consolidated net sales of yen657.0  billion  infiscal  1994, ended March 31, 1995.  Up 0.8% from a year  earlier,  thisresult reflected increased demand for telecommunications  infrastructureand  for semiconductors used in personal computers (PCs).   However,  weimproved our bottom line dramatically, recording a net income of yen32.3billion,  or  yen52.70  per share, compared with a net  loss  of  yen1.8billion, or yen2.85 per share, the previous period.  In fiscal 1995,  weexpect once again to achieve net sales on the order of yen650.0  billiondespite the strong yen and moderate outlook for economic growth."We  have  rebounded  from  our  fiscal  1992  low  by  implementing   arestructuring plan from April 1993 that reorganized production,  sharplyreduced fixed costs and converted the operations for select  high-volumeproducts into separate entities.  Our printer and facsimile  operations,for  example,  were established as an independent subsidiary,  Oki  DataCorp.,  on October 1, 1994.  Our firm results for this year are  largelyattributable to the success of these restructuring measures.  To sustainmomentum and stabilize profitability, we are starting a second phase  ofthe plan in fiscal 1995, aimed at further refining operating efficiency,consolidating resources and focusing on select businesses.  We intend tomobilize  Oki Electric's progressive spirit and corporate  strengths  torealize the virtually unlimited opportunities of the emerging multimediaera."Multimedia  systems  offer  robust  growth  potential  and  utilize OkiElectric's  strengths,  making  them  a prime  focus  for  the  Company.Advancing  in  this direction, we became an equity  partner  in  GeneralMagic,  Inc., a leading communications alliance, in December  1994.   Weare  using  its platform technologies to develop  innovative  multimediacommunications terminal systems.  We also launched sales of asynchronoustransfer mode switching systems and related products.  By  participatingin  numerous  service  trials,  we are  striving  to  commercialize  newapplications that will help determine the future shape of the multimediasociety."In recent years, demand for large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs)  hasgrown with the expansion of the markets for PCs, peripherals and  mobilecommunications equipment.  To respond to this demand, we completed Phase1  construction  of  manufacturing facilities for  LSIs  at  Miyagi  OkiElectric Co., in fiscal 1994 and scheduled production to commence in thefirst quarter of 1996."The approaching 21st century is often described as the Age of Asia.  Inrecognition  of the region's potential, we plan to expand  our  regionalproduction  and  marketing presence.  We have started  this  process  byreinforcing our marketing and service network throughout Asia."Oki Electric has undergone a successful revitalization in the past  twofiscal  years.   Our  task over fiscal 1995  is  to  further  streamlineoperations, focus on key business segments and develop new  capabilitiesto create a secure foundation for growth well into the 21st Century."________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________PACIFIC AMERICAN INCOME SHARES, INC.Steven T.

That means trying to convince investors that its brand ofmanagement is what underperforming Forte needs. Unless the television-to-motorway services group comes up with something eye-catching, whatstarted out with a bang risks ending with a whimper.Forte surprised many this week by the robustness of its final offer,according to stockbrokers' analysts. There is now a growing band whichreckons Granada must both increase its price and improve the qualityand detail of its argument.It is not just the fact that Forte has found enough cash, thanks to theproposed sale of its roadside cafes to Whitbread for pounds 1.05bn, tolaunch a share buy-back worth pounds 800m (including the associated taxcredit). The pledge to distribute its stake in Savoy Hotels, worth 23pa share, also increases shareholder value. After years of staticdividends, this week's promise to raise the payout 20 per cent a yearuntil the end of the decade was unexpected.Forte claimed that to match the income provided under its latestdefence plan, Granada would have to raise its own dividend by 43 percent a year over the period. The bidder responded with its own estimateof how easily Forte could live up to its promises. 'To cover thedividend pledge Forte will have to double its profits over the nextthree years,' said Granada finance director Henry Staunton. 'Given itspast record and the volatile nature of the business this is risky.'Mr Staunton, questioning Forte's debt levels and highlighting the poorreturns it had made on its upmarket hotels, this week soundedincreasingly like a man preparing to tough it out, fighting onGranada's skills and solid past record. This may be because increasingthe bid could push the bidder's debts to levels it would beuncomfortable with. A cash bid of 380p would call for another pounds500m, with pro-forma gearing already more than 200 per cent. MrStaunton and his chief executive Gerry Robinson may nevertheless regardsuch debt levels as sustainable, with the cash-generating power ofGranada's ITV franchises (Granada and London Weekend) and interestpayments still covered roughly three times, as they would be at Forte.This week Forte and its advisers stole their adversaries' rhetoric.Whereas Granada's opening shot dwelt on the gulf in managementexpertise and strategic focus between the companies, it's now Fortewhich boasts that after its programme of disposals it will be the morefocused, growth-orientated company. Granada still has the option ofpledging to implement much of what Forte's management has agreed to do.If it couples this approach with a higher offer, the argument as towhich of the two managements deserves support would be back on.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996NEWS: MONEYBROKING - CITY CLUB LOSES ELITE STATUSThe New Year heralded a challenging new era for the hitherto exclusiveclub of gilt market moneybrokers. Companies affected include Cater Allen -owner of Sheppards, the largest moneybroking firm - Gerrard & National,King & Shaxson and Union.To help nourish the new market in gilt repos - agreements to sell andrepurchase gilts at a fixed price and on a fixed date - the Bank ofEngland has liberalised Stock Exchange moneybroking across the board,with effect from 2 January, when repo trading got off to the gentlestof starts. The Bank is keen for repos to thrive, as the ability toissue them at will would help it fine-tune interest rate movements. Inthe US, by comparison, the Federal Reserve intervenes daily in Treasurybond repo markets.Up to now, just eight firms have possessed a Stock Exchangemoneybroking license, allowing them to arrange for shares or gilts tobe borrowed or loaned on a short-term basis, principally by market-makers wanting to balance their books at the end of each day's trading.Now, any Stock Exchange member can act as a broker, and anyone can lendor borrow. Merrill Lynch analyst Martin Green believes that, over time,huge growth in the repo market should compensate the establishedmoneybrokers for a gradual loss of market share and erosion of profitmargins.Among the quoted companies which must cope with the loss of their'closed-shop' privileges, Cater Allen makes the most significantproportion of its earnings from this market. In the year to last April,43 per cent of the pounds 23.9m group profit before tax and exceptionalitems came from Sheppards. Merrill Lynch forecasts pounds 20.8m thisyear and a dividend of 30p, giving a PE ratio of 9 and a yield of 8.8per cent; last year's 29p total dividend was almost twice covered.Sheppards could be a business with appeal to an overseas buyer wantingto move early and quickly into London's repo and related markets. Nextmost exposed is Gerrard & National. It made 15 per cent of pre-exceptional profits last year from its moneybroking franchise.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996NEWS: LOOKING FOR CLUES ON THE TAKEOVER TRAILIndustry leaders may moan about short-termism in the City, but theplain fact is that investors love takeovers. And it's no wonder whenyou look at what a determined bidder can do for the price of shares inthe target company. Last year, as ever, some of the happiest investorswere those who held shares in companies on the receiving end oftakeover bids.Internet access provider Unipalm saw its shares rise more than four-fold before US counterpart UUNet gained control. And shareholders inmore widely held stocks, such as Eastern Group (bought by Hanson) andVSEL (GEC), saw bids lead to bumper profits.Anyone who gets in ahead of the takeover action in 1996 will seriouslyincrease their chances of a prosperous new year. Here, then, areInvestors Chronicle's five companies most likely to attract a bid inthe coming months.Kwik Save (500p) Dismal recent trading and a share price which haslagged the market by almost a quarter over the past year make this aprime takeover candidate. The group is being squeezed both by foodgiants such as Sainsbury and Tesco and by foreign-owned discounterslike Netto and Aldi. Lead shareholder Dairy Farm (part of Hong Kong'sJardine Matheson) is no longer bound by an agreement not to raise its30 per cent stake. Even if it has tired of its poorly performinginvestment, a suitor could pick up Kwik-Save at anything between 700pand 800p.Vosper Thornycroft (824p) The Southampton-based warship builder couldprovide a tasty morsel for high- flying British Aerospace. BAe wasthwarted in its attempt to buy VSEL, and could be looking for anothercatch to take it further into naval contracting. Vosper provides theonly challenge in this arena since VSEL and Yarrow are both part ofGEC. Although BAe is no longer desperate for cash, Vosper had a healthypounds 109m surplus at the last count. The shipbuilder also has ahealthy order book and is winning work away from shipbuilding too.British Gas (256p) The shares plumbed new lows in 1995 as the marketdigested the implications of its fixed-price take-or-pay contractliabilities and fears over the new pricing regime for TransCo, the gastransportation arm. Rumours of a predator surfaced late last year. Atpounds 11bn British Gas would be a mouthful for anyone. But TransCocould be worth pounds 18bn, there is a valuable exploration divisionand the company remains in a very strong position in the UK gas market.Management would also have a hard job to defend its recent performance.Crest Packaging (64p) It is increasingly difficult for smallerpackaging companies to compete. Without sufficient buying power andeconomies of scale they need to grow significantly or be swallowed up.Parkside and Ferry Pickering have already gone, and little Crest couldbe next. It makes flexible packaging and cartons for consumer marketsand discussed a merger with Parkside last year. It has found itdifficult to pass on input price increases, and trading conditions'remain tough'. Managing director Rodney Webb owns two-thirds of theshares, so a buyer would need his consent.Allied Domecq (537p) Vultures have reportedly been circling over Alliedfor some time. Major restructuring and a number of changes in directionhave not produced significantly better performance either for thebusiness or the shares. Unless that changes soon, a buyer which fanciesits chances of running Allied's portfolio of spirit brands, pubs andbrewing activities could be hard to resist. Sir Christopher Hogg takesover as chairman in April. He has to put some zip into Allied quicklyor it may be a short term of office.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996NEWS: AMSTRAD - RESIGNATION HITS SHARESAmstrad shares crashed almost 13 per cent in the quiet trading periodbetween Christmas and New Year as the consumer and business electronicsgroup belatedly revealed that its chief executive had quit. DavidRogers had served just 16 months of his three-year contract, which paidhim a salary of pounds 225,000.The departure fuelled fears that Amstrad founder and chairman AlanSugar was once more taking hands-on control. Analysts also believe MrSugar's thwarted plan of three years ago to take the company privatemay be revived.The City has never been convinced of Mr Sugar's commitment to servingthe interests of all Amstrad shareholders. 'No doubt he would behappier if he was running Amstrad and owned it himself,' an analystcommented. Mr Sugar's buy-back offer was worth the equivalent of 150p ashare. Now at 192p, the shares are worth 28 per cent more than Mr Sugaroffered - about the rate of growth achieved by the London market as awhole. Mr Sugar's attempt to take Amstrad private ran aground becauseshareholders felt their chairman was trying to get the company on thecheap.Mr Rogers was Amstrad's first chief executive. His decision to gofollows a crisis board meeting last month at which directors decided toscale down Ace, the its ailing consumer electronics business, in order'to reduce its cost base in line with its sales potential'. Ace bringsin about a fifth of Amstrad's turnover but has incurred losses for thepast three years. However since Mr Rogers joined Amstrad, Ace had beenbrought to within a whisker of breaking even. Whether it could dobetter than that is debatable given the intense competition in theaudio, video and satellite TV markets.Almost a year ago, Mr Rogers told Investors Chronicle he would quitAmstrad if he didn't get his way in the restructuring of the company -but made it clear that he couldn't foresee such a situation arising.'Alan Sugar is no different from any other entrepreneur,' said MrRogers. 'All need great business acumen to get where they have. Butwhen it comes to running a business on a day-to-day basis allentrepreneurs need help.'Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996NEWS: WATER COMPANIES - BLOW TO BID HOPESTakeover bids for water companies could be stopped in their tracks ifregulator Ian Byatt succeeds in preventing full mergers between buyersand their water subsidiaries. Mr Byatt is conducting a campaign toensure that future buyers of companies under his supervision retain aseparate stock market listing for the water business. The prospectcould put would-be predators off, analysts said this week.A separate listing would involve making at least 25 per cent of watershares available for trading. The water arm would have to maintain anindependent board, diluting the control of the acquiring company overmatters such as dividends paid.Corporate activity in the water industry has been relatively meagre incomparison to the frenzied electricity sector, with just NorthumbrianWater losing its independence (to French utility Lyonnaise des Eaux).While this combined group has informally agreed to retain a separatequotation for the UK water utility, North West Water and Welsh Water,which are taking over electricity companies, have so far resistedpressure to follow suit.Mr Byatt maintains that separate share price information is needed toprovide the regulator with an adequate basis for performancecomparisons. Some analysts find Ofwat's stance baffling, however. 'Totry and change the rules halfway through the game is ludicrous andraises questions about Ian Byatt's credibility,' said one of them.Companies which buy water distributors but resist separate listingscould face changes in their licence, said Ofwat. Failure to agree wouldmean a referral to the monopolies commission - a prospect which isoften enough to derail takeover bids.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996NEWS: WATER COMPANIES - BURST PIPES BRING MORE BUSINESSOfwat this week called on water companies to explain why the loss ofwater supplies to some weather-affected parts of the UK had lasted solong. So far, though, the cost to water companies of the spate of burstpipes looks likely to be slight. And the problem is even bringing extrabusiness to the hard-pressed building supplies sector. 'It's a niceshort-term boost but the overall impact is marginal,' said SteveWebster, finance director of plumbing parts distributor Wolseley. 'Therest of the market remains depressed.'Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996NEWS: SCHRODERS - MANAGER QUITSShares in the pounds 104m Schroder Japan Growth investment trust fellby almost 5 per cent this week as fund manager Ed Merner announced hisresignation from Schroders for 'personal reasons'. A Schrodersspokeswoman denied there would be much effect on its funds, but CharlesCade, an investment trust analyst at Merrill Lynch, warned: 'Ed Merneris a big name and that supported the rating of the trust.' Mr Merneralso managed Schroders' pounds 229m Japanese Smaller Companies unittrust.The Japan Growth trust has performed well since its launch in July1994. In the year to 1 November 1995 it was second-best of 12 funds inthe sector according to Micropal. The Smaller Companies unit trust hasbeen less successful, its performance in the five years to Novemberearning it 56th place among 73 funds.Schroders appointed Andrew Rose, an institutional fund manager, to runthe unit trust and Jonathan Bolton, who currently manages anotherJapanese unit trust, to run the Japan Growth Fund.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996NEWS: FINANCE BILL - WRECKING CREWLabour will attempt to derail the government's reforms of executiveshare options and taxation as it tries to capitalise on John Major'sdwindling majority and amend the Finance Bill.Labour believes the bill could be the key to its campaign to underminethe government, which has a majority of five after the defection ofDevon MP Emma Nicholson to the Liberal Democrats.Chancellor Kenneth Clarke announced in November's Budget speech thatprofits on share options worth up to pounds 20,000 and granted toemployees since 17 July 1995 would be subject to capital gains taxrather than income tax. The chancellor also said that share optionsgranted under a scheme approved by the taxman would escape income tax.A spokeswoman for Andrew Smith, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,said the government was watering down its support for recommendationsmade in the Greenbury Report.Labour will also use Finance Bill debates to try to delay theintroduction of the new system of self-assessment for tax.

Profits could recover strongly anyway from the level of 1994-95when Airtours had its first profits fall since getting its listing in1987.The key will be how well Airtours manages to protect its profitmargins. The nature of the package-tour business is that too often itis just too easy for operators to sacrifice margins in the pursuit ofextra volumes. When demand then fails to materialise - as was the casein the UK last year - profits fall out of bed as they are still facedwith the sticky overheads of chartered air seats and booked hotelrooms. The imperative of covering those overheads can turn into anunseemly scramble and wipe out profits. Indeed, ABN Amro Hoare Govett,stockbroker to Airtours, estimates that its profits per holidaymakerfrom UK tour operating alone - stripping out the contribution fromAirtours' in-house airline - dropped from pounds 13 in 1991 to pounds 7in 1994 and a loss last year.However, just as operational gearing can take away, so it can alsogive. On Hoare Govett's sensitivity analysis, pre-interest profits fromUK tour operating can swing from zero to pounds 37m depending inparticular on demand in the crucial holiday decision time in May andJune.With this in mind, operators have cut capacity for the coming summer;total market capacity is probably down by about 14 per cent.Additionally, prices in the Airtours catalogues are up 8-10 per cent.The first test will come this month, as January is the biggest bookingperiod of the year (though not the most important). A dull responsecould mean that Airtours and others will go for a combination offurther capacity cuts plus some discounting. Such a scenario would notbe disastrous, but would result in the sort of outcome forecast in thetable opposite. A more optimistic view of demand would imply pre-taxprofits of pounds 75m or more.Besides, Airtours has other things going for it: airlines and hotelsoperations which, so long as they confine themselves to serving thetour-operating side, keep extra profit in-house; a travel agency thatis to some extent contracyclical and an excellent Scandinavian touroperator, which in its first full year as part of the Airtours groupcontributed pounds 25m pre-tax against an pounds 80m acquisition cost.As to how to play the opportunity, Airtours has an inviting convertiblewhich yields 7.1 per cent and trades at a mere 4 per cent premium tothe ordinary. It has marginally less gearing (pounds 1 of convertiblebuys 96p of equity), but the income difference must mean it is the onefor income seekers. That said, either stock is worth buying.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996TIPS OF THE YEAR: CAPITAL SET TO GROWCapital Radio - Radio broadcasterBuyOrd price: 532p                     Market value: pounds 389mTouch: 528-35p                      12 month High: 532p Low: 325pProsp divd yield: 2.9%*             Forward PE ratio: 18*Net asset value: 39p                Net cash: pounds 23.9mYear        Turn-       Pre-tax     Stated         Net Dividendto          over        Profit      Earnings       per share30 Sept     pounds m    pounds m    per share (p)  (p)1992        32.3        11.0        10.9            5.31993        40.6        11.7        11.3            5.81994        51.7        22.1        22.8            7.31995        67.4        39.9        36.2           10.31996*       76.5        32.5        29.4           12.3% Change    +14         -19         -19            +19* Merrill Lynch estimatesMarket makers: 4        Normal market size: 2,000Last IC comment: 24 November 1995, page 66RADIO advertising revenues continue to grow rapidly. Even if the paceslows, radio will still grow faster than other advertising media. TheAdvertising Association recently downgraded its forecast for totaladvertising growth for 1996 from 11 to 8 per cent, but kept itsprediction for radio advertising at 17 per cent; that compares with anestimated 25 per cent rise in 1995. One of the beneficiaries will beCapital Radio. It is cash-rich and in a good position to grow. There isalso the added spice that relaxation of cross-media ownership rulescould make it a bid target.At the start of the 1990s radio's share of display advertising wasunder 3 per cent. It is now well on the way to achieving 6 per cent bythe end of the decade. Part of this growth has come from the launch ofnational radio stations, but much is due to existing stations sellingthe advantages of radio advertising. London has become particularlycompetitive in recent years with new stations starting up. WhileCapital has inevitably lost market share, it continues to dominate. Inthe third quarter of 1995 38 per cent of radio listeners tuned in toCapital Gold on AM or Capital FM each week. As the market leader,advertisers still make a beeline for it. Last year, underlying revenuesfor all the company's radio stations grew by 21 per cent. This waspartly due to better performances from its Midlands and Southernstations.Capital only has around 10 per cent of the available percentage pointsused to guage market share in the industry. It can hold up to 15 percent, so there is plenty of scope for expansion with cash in thecoffers to finance it.

Two profits warnings last year led to aslump in its shares and their subsequent demotion from the FT-SE 100index. It is time to reassess prospects. De La Rue's ability togenerate cash and its strong market positions are not doubted whileNational Lottery organiser Camelot is starting to make a contributionto profits.Acquiring paper maker Portals a year ago looked like management takingits eye off the ball. Yet Portals already contributes strongly toprofits and peripheral activities, such as making tea bags, have beensold.The banknote market is growing at 4 per cent per annum. Taking a longer-term perspective, the integration of banknote printing and paper-makingshould help De La Rue gain business through improved anti-counterfeiting technology. The current order book has improved althoughthis is at lower margins.Payment and transaction systems were supposed to take up the runningfrom banknotes, but they have had problems. Garny is having to copewith stiff competition in Germany and US bank mergers hit demand forcash machines. The trend towards increasing automation of banking isunchanged, though. Therefore demand for the company's cash-handlingequipment should continue to grow for the foreseeable future.Management needs to convince cynical investors that it won't slip upagain.

The pounds 527m purchaseof Boddington in October adds 454 outlets to the pub estate, bringingit to 2,300, of which 1,100 are managed in-house. Though this is only 4per cent of the UK total, the group's pubs are much higher volume thanaverage. Given the 20 per cent overcapacity in UK brewing, Greenalls'enhanced position as the largest chain among the independents (thosenot owned by brewers) means it is better placed than ever to buy beercheaply.Greenalls' main supplier is Carlsberg/Tetley, Boddington's isWhitbread. There are long-term supply agreements in place, till 1998with Carlsberg/Tetley, and till 2000 with Whitbread. There is, however,plenty of room to vary contract terms which cover only part of theretailer's needs. Assuming it can push Whitbread product through formerBoddington pubs, and do likewise with Carlsberg/Tetley brands inBoddington outlets, the group is in a strong position to buy cheaperliquid, especially as the brewers always face the temptation to sellextra volume at a very low price to get that last drop of profit.Greenalls' finance director, Alan Rothwell, points out that the groupdoes virtually no business with Scottish Courage, adding that theregional brewers are a loose cannon in capacity terms. The fact thatbrewers need to renew their contracts well ahead of expiry date gives aretailer, like Greenalls, scope to secure good buying terms for thepresent as well. Boddington was bought for 21.5 times its 1994earnings, which is why the forecast numbers in the table below are sotame. But the beer supply/demand picture suggest that growth willrapidly become apparent.Elsewhere, the hotels division continues to grow nicely. The off-licence and wholesaling businesses fit with pubs, the 500 off-licencesgiving the group buying power in spirits and wines, while the pubs givethe off-licences leverage in beer. Tavern, the wholesale operationbeing combined with Boddington's Liquid Assets, also benefits from thegroup's extra buying power. Though not as big as Matthew Clarke,wholesaling could be better positioned as far as price is concerned.The stock, No. 104 by stock market capitalisation, is tapping at thedoor of the FT-SE 100 club. If Greenalls gets in, index-tracking fundsshould give it a further lift. Meanwhile, Greenalls grows on manyfronts.

One of only two quoted structural steelmakers to survivethe last recession, Wescol is making the most of a strong market. Ithas improved efficiency and will benefit from the growing success ofits patented cellular steel beam.Demand for structural steelwork - used in football grounds and largebuildings such as factories and shopping centres - is expected to growalmost 5 per cent in 1996. The growth in sales now follows a near-catastrophic collapse in the market after a 1989 sales peak of 1.4mtonnes. About 250 fabricators vanished from the industry. Wescol is oneof seven key survivors. The rest include the other quoted structuralsteel company, Severfield-Reeve, the privately owned William Hare andsubsidiaries of Rugby and Amec.Structural steelwork has escaped the worst of the problems affectingthe rest of the construction industry and prospects look good for thenext 18 months. Wescol is also working hard to build exports, whichshould buffer the company from any collapse in UK demand. Exportsshould chip in 15 per cent of sales in 1995-96. A joint venture with aSingapore contractor gives Wescol a way into Asian-Pacific constructioncontracts, particularly in China, and Wescol is considering furtherjoint ventures of this type.In the UK the company has just quadrupled the space available in itsHalifax factory. However, Wescol will continue to sub-contract some ofits work. Sub-contracted work earns a lower margin, but it alsotransfers some of the risk from the repeated delays common inconstruction contracts.Westok, the group's cellular beam maker, is 'going like a train' thecompany says. Wescol invented the cellular beam - a steel beam withholes that offers increased strength without increased weight. For nowWestok remains a relatively small part of the business, 8 per cent ofturnover, but the cellular beam is growing in popularity with engineersand architects.Marbank, the last bit of the group, is a niche contractor specialisingin work worth about pounds 500,000. It is doing well, against thecontracting trend in the UK, but is not a key part of the group.Wescol had a gruelling time in the early 1990s. Its mistakes on baddebts and rampaging gearing mean it has taken longer to recover thanSeverfield-Reeve and the Yorkshire rival still tends to overshadowWescol's potential. But it has learnt its lesson and 1996 should be theyear Wescol proves its point.

Chaired by property guru John Ritblat,the company has in recent months paid Allied Domecq pounds 10.6m for109 pubs that are let to Burtonwood Brewery, bought a portfolio of nineproperties from the Royal Bank of Scotland for pounds 9.9m and morethan doubled the size of its property consultancy operation with thepounds 400,000 acquisition of rival Colliers Erdman Lewis (CEL).Conrad Ritblat is a hybrid in the property sector in that itsactivities include chartered surveying as well as property ownershipand rental. Not well understood, its shares fail to discount prospectsfor rising profits in conjunction with asset growth.Executive director Philip Lewis describes the CEL acquisition as a'real coup'. Conrad Ritblat has managed CEL since a receiver wasappointed in October. Since then, it has downsized operations byshedding staff and closing or rationalising regional offices. At abudgeted pounds 12m, CEL's fee income will be sharply down in 1995. Itpeaked at pounds 25m. But even at the reduced level, it will double theturnover of Conrad Ritblat's estate agency business.Having expanded this side of its operations, the company hopes tofunnel more business through it. It initiated both the Allied Domecqand Royal Bank of Scotland deals and they were structured so thatConrad Ritblat has been promised more of these companies' traditionalproperty consultancy work. As well as pounds 5.5m cash, Royal Bank ofScotland received 16m Conrad Ritblat shares in exchange for itsproperties. They were issued at 27.5p against a then market price of23p. It will own 11.8 per cent of the enlarged equity.Conrad Ritblat's existing properties in the City and West End are bothpretty much fully let. About 15,000 square feet of its premises at 9Marylebone Lane are let to M&C Saatchi, the Saatchi brothers' newadvertising agency. It also owns properties in Glasgow and Leeds.Ahead of February's interims, no forecasts were available for 1995-96.In any event, the full impact of recent deals won't be felt until 1996-97 when profits of between pounds 3m and pounds 4m are possible.

Marconi, its defence and aerospace electronics arm,is going into the production phase on a number of key projects. Costoverrun problems of the past seem to be resolved. Recovery prospectsfrom aerospace look good. Defence faces the challenge of slimmergovernment budgets. But a major joint venture followed by restructuringcould bring beneficial effects.

Since 1992 the company has transformeditself, helped by its US subsidiary, CEUSA, hitting a massive gas fieldin the Gulf of Mexico. CEUSA has since been sold for about pounds 32mand the money used to build a portfolio of cash-generating assets inthe UK and Netherlands. These will fund the development in Bangladesh,and other blue sky prospects in Thailand, Vietnam and China.Ignoring anything that may happen in Bangladesh, house broker SocieteGenerale Strauss Turnbull estimates that Cairn's net assets are worth95p per share anyway. Results of the first Bangladeshi well, offshoreon Block 16, are expected at the end of this month. The most optimisticbrokers' estimates suggest there is 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas inboth of Cairn's prospects. That could be worth up to pounds 160m orpounds 2 per share to Cairn. Therefore there is the potential thatrealisable net assets of almost pounds 3 will play a share price of115p. By any criteria of buying assets for less than their face value,that makes for an attractive prospect.Admittedly the risks are big, too. Cairn has first to find the gas andestablish that it's feasible to extract it economically; then it mustnegotiate a deal to build a power station to burn it and agree termswith the government. But if the drilling news is good, the share pricewill reflect the possibilities well in advance. The shares are a gamblebut also a buy.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996TIPS OF THE YEAR: FAR FROM FRAGILEPilkington - Glass makerBuyOrd price: 200p                     Market value: pounds 2bnTouch: 198-201p                     1995-96 High: 207p Low:136pGross divd yield: 2.8%*             PE ratio: 13*Net asset value: 117p               Net debt: 44%Year        Turn-       Pre-tax     Stated         Net Dividendto          over        Profit      Earnings       per share31 Mar      pounds bn   pounds m    per share (p)  (p)1992        2.61          96          3.3          5.71993        2.57          41         -2.5          3.81994        2.74          97          4.9          3.81995        2.68        -248        -38.8          4.01996*       -            230         15.1          4.5% Change    -           -           -              +12* Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull estimatesMarket makers: 14       Normal market size: 50,000Last IC comment: 3 November 1995, page 62PILKINGTON has been transformed from a sleepy family-run business proneto strategic blunders to a fast-growing global glass maker. It hasuntangled itself from its disastrous foray into contact lenses,stripped out pounds 200m of overheads and expanded into developingmarkets.In the short term, recovery in the mature European and US glass marketswill power profits. Volumes should rise by 3 per cent next year andprices have begun to harden. With its cost-cutting programme in fullswing, margins could increase from 8 per cent to 10 per cent over thenext two years.Acquisitions will also fuel growth. The proceeds of a recent pounds303m rights issue has been put to good use. Pilkington paid pounds 120mto buy the remaining 50 per cent of Italian car glass manufacturer SIV.The pounds 55m purchase of glass merchants Interpane also gives it afoothold in the Swiss and Scandinavian markets.Glass making remains a cyclical business and demand will peak by 1998.But Pilkington's rapid expansion abroad leaves it well placed to rideout any downturn. Developing countries currently account for a third ofprofits, but earnings should rocket over the next few years. SouthAmerica is the fastest-growing market in the world and Pilks is alreadythe leading glass maker in Brazil, Argentina and Chile.

Demand for non-computer electronics should increaseby at least 12 per cent in 1996. Although this is a slight slowdown onlast year, with UK inflation at under 3 per cent electrocomponentsremains one of industry's fastest-growing markets.On past performance, Abacus is odds-on to outstrip that growth. Overthe last few years the group has been steadily winning market share.Abacus aims to forge links with customers via regional sales officeswhich look after just a handful of accounts. Abacus is the only largedistributor that sources components from both franchised manufacturers - Abacus has 34, including household names Siemens, Toshiba andPanasonic - and overseas. This gives it an enviable spread of productsand the flexibility to offer dedicated stocks and just-in-timesupplies. In a market where customers are cutting back their number ofsuppliers, Abacus's focus on service is spot-on.November's pounds 36m acquisition of Polar looks a good fit. The twohave only one franchised supplier and just 10 per cent of their top 300customers in common. Polar brings another 26 franchised suppliers anddoubles the number of customers to over 4,000, establishing Abacus asthe UK's fifth-largest distributor. With scope to increaseproductivity, Abacus is looking to push Polar's 7 per cent marginscloser to its own 12 per cent in the UK. And Polar's technical strengthin component design adds a new element to Abacus's portfolio.With minimal borrowings, even after Polar, expansion in Europe is next.Last year's Scandinavian acquisition, Promax, is performing excellentlyand Abacus has just opened an office in the key German market.The share rating does not reflect Abacus-cum-Polar's strong UK marketposition nor the benefits of expansion abroad.

This was despite the fact that a number of historical trends,some running for most of this century, flagged a rise to 3700(accurately, as it turned out) over the next 12 months.Many of the same long-term trends are now warning of possibledisappointment to UK equity investors in 1996. Here are three worthwatching.The dividend yield of the FT-SE-A All-Share index currently standsbelow 4 per cent. From a historical perspective, this is quite ominous.Since the All-Share was initiated in 1962, the dividend yield has endedthe year below 4 per cent on just five occasions. On four of theseoccasions, share prices fell in the following year. The usual patternwas for the bottom to be reached in mid-year, followed by a mildrecovery.The year-end 1971 signal was a short-lived exception. Prices rose by 17per cent in the next few months, despite the historical experience. Butthe April peak turned out to be the start of the UK's worst-ever bearmarket. Although shares held on to some of these profits at yearend,the down-trend continued for two more years, ultimately dropping pricesby a mind-numbing 69 per cent.Another important signal is provided by the cyclical indicators,published each month by the Central Statistical Office to helpinterested organisations and individuals to monitor the state of the UKeconomy. Although the indices were not designed for this purpose, theymake an excellent tool for forecasting stock market ebbs and flows.Two cyclical indices worth monitoring are the Shorter Leading Index,which flags turning points in the economy six months ahead of time, andthe Coincident Index, designed to rise and fall in lock step withactual economic growth.Since 1959, when the series was first published, a late-in-the-cyclerise on the Shorter Leading Index above the preceding month's score anda reading above average on the Coincident Index has consistently beenassociated with bull market peaks.The signal sometimes flashes very early, as much as one year inadvance, so we can only use it as a rough timing guide even though itis a powerful bear market signal. At present the message from thecyclical indicators is quite clear. This stock market upturn will endno later than April 1996.The third signal - the most important of all - is the length of timethis rally has run. After a sharp price drop in the first half of 1994,prices bottomed out in June and have been rising ever since, sixquarters in a row.No-one knows when this upturn will end, but continuous rises for morethan four quarters are very rare. There have been just 12 in the UKthis century. No recent upward move has run longer than seven quartersin a row. Using history as a guide, the odds are very low that thecurrent upturn will continue for much longer.What will happen once the upturn ends? Here, too, history provides avaluable clue. After continuous quarterly upward moves run theircourse, shares usually decline, often for just three to six months,followed by a recovery that lifts prices back towards the startingpoint. When the smoke clears, generally nine to 12 months after theuptrend is first broken, prices are, at best, close to their startingpoint.Putting it all together, history suggests a disappointing 1996 with thepath to the year-end more like a roller-coaster ride than a strollalong a sleepy country lane. When the smoke clears 12 months from now,look for a FT-SE 100 at around the 3700 level.In the US, 1996 is a presidential election year. Politically, then, itis a time of great excitement and uncertainty. But the stock marketwill take no notice of this, following the same old patterns that haveapplied in the past.Since 1928, there have been 12 presidential election years that werepreceded with a share price increase of at least 10 per cent the yearbefore. 1995 is number 13 in the series. Wall Street rose each andevery time in the election year that followed. The average electionyear price increase was 16 per cent, suggesting a rise to near 6000 onthe Dow Jones by December 1996.The Tokyo stock market has been in free fall since 1990. Historyprovides two precedents for a stock market decline of such magnitudeand duration: the 86 per cent smash on Wall Street in 1929-32 and the69 per cent London fall in 1972-74. Both recoveries began with verysharp price increases, 38 per cent in each of two successive months inNew York, and a 51 per cent single month rise in London.Tokyo is not following the norm despite the fact that it is a much morevolatile stock market than London or New York. So far, the recoveryfrom its mid-year low has been comparatively mild (the Nikkei 225 is upby 37 per cent from the early July low). This raises the suspicion thatthe bottom may not yet been reached.For 1996, there are two possible scenarios for Tokyo. The market willeither continue to drift up as it has done in the second half of 1995,or drop sharply in a bloody finale to the bear market that has consumedmost of the 1990s.If it does drop sharply, the recovery will be equally breathtaking.Either way, I forecast that the Nikkei will rest near 22,000 at year-end 1996.David Schwartz is editor of the 1996 Schwartz Stock Market Handbook, aguide to the best/worst times to buy/sell shares.

After brieflyhitting the 20,000 level for the first time in 14 months, the Nikkei225 index finally finished at 19,868.Although this was less than 1 per cent higher than the previousDecember's close, it nonetheless represented a remarkable 37 per centgain on the year's low of 14,485 recorded in early July, when fears ofa re-run of the panic which prevailed in the summer of 1992 were attheir height.Key factors in the second half's optimism included a sustained fall inthe yen against the dollar, a continued decline in short- and long-terminterest rates, further recovery in corporate earnings, and yet greaterfiscal stimulation by the government (the recently published draftbudget for 1996-97 does, moreover, propose the sharpest rise in publicspending for five years).To add icing to the cake, worries about a banking crisis have recededbecause of the government's involvement in the rescue package forstricken housing loan companies.Despite increasing confidence that, this time, Japan's economicrecovery will prove to be for real, it is nonethless striking thatdomestic institutions continue to remain firmly on the stock marketsidelines. In 1995, as in 1994, locals were heavy sellers of equities.If the market's latest rally is not to fizzle out, domesticinstitutions will soon need to pick up the buying baton fromforeigners.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996MARKET STRATEGY: THE BURSTING OF THE ASIAN BUBBLEHaving lost pounds 800,000 on his holdings of Thai stocks, VivatSrisammacheep walked onto the floor of the Bangkok Stock Exchange inNovember and shot himself in the chin. His consternation, if not hisaiming, was understandable. Usually, when US stocks rise, Thai stocksrise by more. Not in 1995, however. That was the first year since 1980that the Thai market had fallen while the US had risen.As goes Thailand, so go south east Asian equities generally. Theirfalls last year mean that they are now back to the lows of 1992-93 whencompared with US stocks.So why did these markets become decoupled from the US? The principalreason lies in the fears of 'overheating' that struck the region. Rapideconomic growth has caused rising inflation (although in Malaysia andThailand this has been held down by stiffer price controls) and hugetrade deficits. Ng Bok Eng of Morgan Grenfell foresees the Malaysiandeficit rising to 9.3 per cent of GDP, and the Thai gap rising to 7.5per cent. These are huge numbers; when the UK had its last balance ofpayments crisis in 1989, the deficit was a mere 4.3 per cent of GDP. Tocurb this overheating, interest rates have risen.In itself, this need not have had disastrous effects upon the markets.After all, the trade deficits were largely the result of purchases ofcapital goods by Japanese companies which had set up in the area, sothe borrowing from overseas would be expected to pay for itself in duecourse. And anyway, Malaysian stocks rose in 1991, when interest ratesrose by more than they did this year, as did Indonesian stocks in 1990.Unfortunately, after the collapse of the Mexican peso last December,overseas investors became particularly jumpy about trade imbalances.Hence they sold the Indonesian, Thai and Malaysian markets even thoughtheir deficits were no worse this year than in 1990 or 1991.Once this selling had depressed the markets, other problems exacerbatedthe decline. In Thailand, private investors like the hapless MrSrisammacheep, who had bought with borrowed money, were forced to sellstock to meet margin payments. In Indonesia, investors feared thatlooming privatisations would depress prices - fears which were borneout by the unsuccessful sell-off of Tambang Timah. And in Malaysia thecirculation of forged share certificates and the drop in the price ofpalm oil hit stocks.With these markets now at two- or three-year lows relative to the US,isn't it time to buy? Maybe not. Most expect further rises in interestrates, and warn that the huge trade gaps may weaken the currencies.Equally worrying, if not more so, last year's decoupling from WallStreet may not be a permanent structural change. It could be the resultof temporary factors, such as the aftermath of the Mexican crisis andoverheating in the region. If so, then these markets would bevulnerable to any weakness on Wall Street. Traditionally, when it hassneezed, Asian markets have caught colds; in the two months after the1987 crash, when US stocks fell 20 per cent, the Thai and Malaysianmarkets halved.Nevertheless, some predict good returns later in 1996. Alan Butler-Henderson at Barings believes that overheating problems will fade nextyear as capital spending slows down (particularly in Malaysia) whilstgrowth outside the region picks up. Once this happens, he says,'markets in South East Asia should enjoy a much better year' and weshould 'be prepared for an impressive run' in Malaysian stocks in thesecond half of 1996. By the spring, the region's markets may appear alot more attractive than Mr Srisammacheep.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996MARKET STRATEGY: UK SECTORS - PLACE YOUR BETSPolarisation was the name of the sector game in 1995. At one extremewere the beneficiaries of the favoured themes of international growth,interest-rate sensitivity, and corporate activity. Pharmaceuticals andfinancials (life assurance, banks and to a lesser extent insurance)found themselves dominating the sector league table because they couldsatisfy not merely one, but two, of these thematic requirements.At the other extreme were the victims of the dread 'cyclicality'. Theworst-performing sector, gas distribution, was admittedly an exceptionto this rule and owed its dunce's cap to the specific problems ofBritish Gas. Elsewhere amongst the laggards, however, so-called'cyclicals' such as paper, packaging and printing, textiles, buildingmaterials and the catch-all diversified industrials proved unable toresist the mounting pressure of profit downgrades stemming from the low-growth, low-inflation environment.In the middle ground, with performances grouped around the All-Share's19 per cent rise over the 12 months, tended to be the more defensiveconsumer/services areas.According to Goldman Sachs, the expected weakness in the UK economy inthe first half of 1996 means that investors should continue to followthe sectoral lead already given - in a similar low-growth situation -by the US.On Wall Street, sector outperformance has been determined by whatGoldman describes as the holy trinity of technology, financial servicesand growth. On its reading of US equities, these should still determineoutperformance in the UK. Banks, insurances, growth stocks in media anddrugs, and the smaller tech stocks are consequently on their buyinglist, together with bid stocks.Cyclicals, especially those which are price 'takers' as opposed toprice determiners (chemicals, packaging, components) are forecast toremain out of favour.In contrast, BZW believes it is time to look for opportunities withinthe cyclicals, rather than dwell on past disappointments, because GDPand earnings growth should be recovering in 1996, especially during thesecond half as consumer spending becomes the major driving force.After juggling with the three elements of inventories and costs (whichdetermine the margin outlook), and geographic exposure (the likelysource of volume growth) BZW selects building materials, diversifiedindustrials, and electronics as its top three industrial picks. Forexposure to the domestic consumer theme, general retailers, leisure andwines/spirits are identified, at the expense of more defensive areas ofspending such as food retailing, food manufacturing or brewing.Although 'international growth', epitomised by media andpharmaceuticals stocks, should not be ignored, says BZW, they couldtake a temporary back seat in favour of cheaper growth alternatives.The hitherto high-performing banks sector is viewed with concern, onthe grounds that the banks are vulnerable to rising real interestrates.SECTOR WINNERS & LOSERS IN '95                            % ChangePharmaceuticals               +57Life assurance                +43Banks, retail                 +41Tobacco                       +33FT-SE-A All-Share             +19Transport                      -1Textiles, apparel              -6Paper, packaging & printing    -8Gas distribution              -19Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996MARKET STRATEGY: WALL STREET - ADDING VALUE?Most US-market watchers agree that in 1996 there will be low inflationand modest growth. But if the value of goods and services producedgrows only slowly, how can the value of the companies making them risequickly? There are several reasons, all of which have combined in the1990s to send equity prices rising far above money GDP. The share ofoutput going to profits has risen, thanks to strong productivity growthand low wage growth. Lower bond yields and greater economic stabilitymean these higher profits are discounted less heavily. And recently,merger activity has - it is hoped - raised the efficiency with whichgrowth is delivered.But it is doubtful whether these forces can persist. Stephen S Roach atMorgan Stanley warns that, with unemployment now low, 'the days ofasking labour to keep sacrificing appear to be largely over'. A 'workerbacklash' would either squeeze profits or raise inflation, and hencebond yields. Mr Roach expects the latter. 'Everything good is justabout priced into the market,' he says. 'As inflation fails to conformto consensus prognostications, the next big move in yields is backtowards 7 per cent.'But Edward Kerschner at PaineWebber says corporate restructuring is farfrom complete. A theme of 1996, he says, will be 'disaggregation', asperipheral businesses are sold off. 'Such deals,' he says, 'are often awin-win proposition for shareholders. Spun-off businesses tend tooutperform the market and many companies initiating disaggregation alsotend to be strong performers; recent examples include AT&T and ITT.'Unfortunately, if Mr Kerschner is right, the winners will be specificstocks, whilst if Mr Roach is right, the losers will be the entiremarket. Investors' best hope lies in the low inflation, low interestrate consensus proving correct - even if this destroys earnings growth.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996ANALYSTS' VIEWS: UK STRATEGY - THEMES FOR '96The accepted orthodoxies of the Christmas season can all too soonbecome the Aunt Sallies of the new year, according to BZW. This is aparticular risk at present, given how hard the stock market is buyingthe low-growth, low-interest-rate argument.With very much a 12-month view in mind, BZW chooses instead to stressthe following themes.First, the 'pause' interpretation of the economy seems most tenable.Growth is expected to recover sharply in the second half of the year,led by consumers. Growth of 2.5 per cent and 3.3 per cent is expectedin 1996 and 1997, respectively. On this reading, base rate rises latethis year are on the cards.Admittedly, there will be limited political appetite to raise rateswith a general election looming. However, BZW sees no benefit for thefinancial markets if politics is clearly seen to prevail overeconomics. Short-term interest rates may not rise, but in suchcircumstances long-term rates surely would.Moreover, the risks on the currency increase as the election getsnearer. BZW anticipates a sterling/dollar rate of dollars 1.44 in 1996,but a rally in the pound to DM2.30 when the US dollar strengthens.As far as gilts are concerned, stronger nominal GDP growth is rarelythe friend of the market. Ten-year yields are forecast to move back to8.25 per cent.BZW's view of growth signals that the current weight of profitdowngrades may not be long-lasting. However, equities could remaindriven more by interest rates than earnings, with cash-financedtakeover activity less of a positive factor. A dull 1996 isanticipated, with 3750 as the year-end FT-SE 100 forecast. Preferredsectors are building materials, electronics and general retailers.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996ANALYSTS' VIEWS: GLOBAL STRATEGY - MORE DIFFICULTFor 1996, Barton Biggs of Morgan Stanley thinks that the crucial assetallocation is to be underweight in US equities, pondering the sale ofUS bonds, and overweight in Asia.Although 1996 is likely to be a less happy year than 1995, asynchronised bear market is not anticipated. At this point cash isunattractive because the indicators of the liquidity cycle continue tobe very favourable, central banks are easing and interest rates arefalling.At the same time it is evident that economic growth in Europe, Japanand North America is at best sluggish. In Europe, the sluggishness isspreading from the D-Mark bloc to the weak-currency countries onEurope's periphery. In Japan, the latest Tankan report was onlysuperficially encouraging. In the rest of Asia, high real interestrates are slowing growth.Meanwhile, inflation in the developed world is very low, and the lossof pricing power is becoming a serious problem for many companies.However, Mr Biggs doesn't buy the story that the world is on the brinkof a deflationary episode that would be bullish for high-grade bondsbut bearish for equities.Sometime next year, probably in the second half, the big-locomotiveeconomies of the industrial world - the US, Japan, and Germany - willbegin to revive. This will be good news for politicians and workingpeople, but bad news for investors, who will begin worrying about apick-up in inflation and higher interest rates. The best guess is thatthe recovery won't be sufficiently synchronised, and that while it maycause a cyclical bear market in the US, there will only be a correctionin what will by then be bull markets in Japan, emerging Asia and theother emerging markets.The other risk is that the excess liquidity currently being createdcauses a bubble in financial markets that pops at the first indicationof Fed tightening, as happened in late 1993. The mania over technologystocks and the high degree of bond-buyer bullishness gives some basisfor this worry, as does the fact that valuations are filthy rich,particularly in the US. Nonetheless, the individual bubbles canprobably be pricked without precipitating a global bear market.As far as currencies are concerned, the dominant force will be yenweakness, as the Bank of Japan prints paper and Japan's trade surplusfalls rapidly. The dollar will have an upward bias, as will manycountries in emerging Asia.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996ANALYSTS' VIEWS: SPAIN - STILL TIME TO BUYDespite its recent outperformance relative to Europe (ex UK), Spainwill continue to outperform well into the first quarter of 1996,according to Merrill Lynch.The key factors are a continued rally in the bond market, fallinginterest rates and the prospect of political change. Spanish earningsmomentum has been remarkably stable yet the stock market is stilltrading at a 15 per cent discount to its historical average prospectivePE ratio of 13. As a result, the potential upside clearly outweighs anydownside risk.The Spanish-German bond yield differential has narrowed sharply overthe past three months, and should narrow further. Although part of theimprovement in Spanish bonds has come from external factors, such asthe continuing strength of US bonds and the recent cut in Germaninterest rates, the rest will come domestically from the improvinginflation outlook and a reduced political risk premium.Perhaps the biggest change in 1996 will be on the political front,where early general elections are expected to be called for the secondhalf of March. The most recent poll shows the Partido Popular (PP) hasbuilt up a 16-point lead over the Socialists. Although it will probablybe a minority government, the big issue is what policy changes the PPwould actually make and how far they would go in resolving Spain'sinflation, unemployment and budget-deficit problems. In reality it isstill too early to make an informed judgment.While Spain would obviously be affected by a collapse in the US bondmarkets and renewed concerns over European monetary union - or rather,the lack of budgetary discipline that convergence criteria currentlyprovide - short-term performance will be most sensitive to the currenttest case in France.Nevertheless Merrill believes the market will run up between now andthe election, followed by a period of profit-taking.After that, it depends on the market's belief in the political changeargument. One thing is certain: it won't be right to be neutral overthe longer term.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996TORY DEFECTORAs the UK thawed out from a frozen Christmas, MP Emma Nicholson, formerTory party vice-chairman, announced she was moving to the LiberalDemocrat party.

From the bustle of the day trader to thecomparative inactivity of the long-term buy- and-hold strategist. Thelast two reviews have examined sub-pounds 250 software packagessuitable for the investor who falls in the middle of this range. Bothprograms (Windows on Wall Street and Metastock for Windows) assume thatthe investor has access to daily data and a bias towards technicalanalysis. Pricetrack, by contrast, is a small DOS-based program moresuited to the less active investor. Although certainly not assophisticated or visually attractive as the other two programs, thesoftware includes some practical features and includes a data servicein the price.Although the program will run under a DOS extension from Windows,installation takes place from the DOS prompt. The manual does, however,recommend running the memory optimisation utility included with laterversions of DOS (Memmaker) before attempting to run Pricetrack. This isbecause the software uses a lot of expanded memory and will run like asnail if it is not available. In virtually every case, running Memmakerand following the instructions provided will ensure smooth operation.Pricetrack does offer mouse support, so you don't have to learn anirritating selection of multiple keyboard commands in order to operateit.The program is structured around a set of Lotus spreadsheets and hasthree main modules: the weekly share price system that allows databasemanipulation and graphing; a reports section that collates fundamentaldata on equities; and portfolio management. The largest module is theweekly share price system which has four main menu sections (general,sort, update and gain) and a separate set of charting commands. Thegeneral menu allows switching into other menus and covers basic defaultsettings. Users can select whether they want keyboard or mouse control.Pricetrack displays 'setpoint markers' on graphs that show year-ends.These are quite obtrusive and can be disabled if required.The gain menu uses the spreadsheet base of the program to bestadvantage and allows ranking of shares according to a number ofcriteria. The entire database (some 580 equities and indices) can besorted in order of gains made in the last one, four or 52 weeks,obviously handy when checking the consistency of an equity'sperformance. For those looking to balance a portfolio, it is alsopossible to rank the equities within their individual FT sectors overthe same periods as well. The individual sectors are listed first inthe spreadsheet followed by the shares in each sector in performanceranking for the period.As with most sorting functions on a computer, the speed of thisoperation will depend on your processor - on a 486DX66 it was virtuallyinstantaneous. The sort menu provides similar functions to the gainmenu but for different criteria. The entire database can be placed indescending order for market capitalisation or dividend yield over thelast one, four or 52 weeks. The database can also be set in sectororder following the usual financial times groupings.The update menu processes the data supplied by Pricetrack Ltd and addsit to the database. As the full database is large, users can extract aselection of equities for monitoring. This extract function is carriedout by marking shares in the main database with a number. Users can usecodes to classify equities. For example, shares already owned could bemarked with '2', those under consideration for purchase with '4' and soon. When extracted, shares in each category will then be groupedtogether.The reports database module supplies fundamental equity data (whereavailable) for both the current and previous year. Data includes lastdividend payments, net profit, earnings per share, total dividend,turnover and net asset value. There is a sort facility available, butit is only available for alphabetical listing or date of last companyreport. It would be helpful if this facility could be extended to someof the other data fields. As the database is large, a 'find' utility isincluded which will search for an equity based on the first few lettersof the name. This is something of a godsend.The portfolio valuation system allows multiple portfolio files to becreated that can be updated from the weekly system disk or a manuallyupdated extract file. For professional advisers handling a large numberof portfolios, a separate price file can be created from the weeklysystem that will dramatically speed up valuation or printing. A totalportfolio valuation is displayed at the top of the worksheet, whilenext to each equity is a figure for individual gain in both cash andpercentage terms since purchase. Entries can also be made for dealingcosts and cash on deposit.The charting facilities of Pricetrack are fairly basic, with a lowresolution graphic display, but still perfectly comprehensible.Investors with a technical bias are unlikely to get very excited. Thesoftware offers a certain amount of flexibility to the investor keen oncomparing a number of equities for relative performance. Equities canalso be plotted against the FT-SE-A All-Share index, FT-SE 100 or anyrelevant sector index.For those accustomed to the more intuitive atmosphere of Windows-basedsoftware, Pricetrack will take a while to get used to. Although thereare on-screen help files, a comprehensive manual would be an enormoushelp as some of the program's features take quite a bit of finding. Itwould also be good if basic functions such as Quit could be assignedthe same F key in all modules. The cost of Pricetrack ranges frompounds 40 per annum for 12 monthly updates to pounds 150 for 50 weeklyones. In all cases the data supplied is the Friday closing price.Technical analysts and more active experienced investors will probablywant to look elsewhere, but for the beginner or someone who only usesfundamental valuation techniques on a long-term basis, Pricetrack isideal.Pricetrack is available from: Pricetrack Ltd, Bicknell Farm, NearNempnett Thrubwell, Blagdon, Avon, BS18 6XG.

From dire straits in 1992 as worries over debt andstrategy mounted, the company is now firmly established as the topexplorer among the Seven Sisters - the giant European and US integratedoil companies. All of the brokers we consulted were impressed with BP'sprogress: the basic difference between the bulls and the bears is howmuch further the recovery process can go.At 537p, Morgan Stanley is a strong buyer. The strong exploration andproduction portfolio (in Colombia, west of Shetlands, Gulf of Mexicoand Vietnam), and possible earnings enhancement from a restructuring ofthe refining operations and continued cost reductions, mean BP isundervalued relative to its peers. Earnings should grow by 42 per centto 38.5p for 1995 with a jump in the dividend to 15p (10.5p). EPS of40.1p and 43.4p are forecast for 1996 and 1997. The chances of aspecial dividend are good as cash flow improves, and the broker expectsthe share price to go up to 580p.ABN-Amro Hoare Govett is another buyer. It reckons the shares are cheapcompared with the sector as a whole. Finds like the recently announcedAlgerian gas deposits also reinforce the company's position in othermarkets.Natwest Securities is also keen. It's more optimistic than most on oilprices and expects overcapacity in the refining market to sort itselfout. BP will lead the way in solving it with refinery closures in thenew year.Kleinwort Benson is more cautious. It says the outlook on oil pricesand the chemicals cycle is not in the company's favour. The shares area hold.Panmure Gordon expresses a similar view. The recovery story has nearlyworked its way through the system. If there is no additional news itwill be hard for the shares to outperform. Shell looks the better betas its cost-cutting programme is at a much earlier stage.Charles Stanley is the only outright seller. It expects chemicalsearnings to be significantly lower this year and dividend growth toslow after that.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996COMPANY RESULTS: HOWDENAir & gas handling, tunnelling gearGood valueOrd price: 68p                      Market value: pounds 198mTouch: 66-69p                       1995 High: 95p Low: 66pGross divd yield: 5.1%              PE ratio: 9Net asset value: 38p                Net debt: 47%Half-year   Turn-       Pre-tax     Stated         Net Dividendto          over        Profit      Earnings       per shareEnd Oct     pounds m    pounds m    per share (p)  (p)1994        194         10.6        2.5            0.891995        212         11.0        2.6            0.95% Change    +9          +4          +4             +7Market makers: 5        Normal market size: 10,000Last IC comment: 7 July 1995, page 52              xd: 17 AprHowden's spread of international businesses has been the key to itssuccess.

Continental European markets are better, and there's beensteady improvement in investment in the plastics industries, fuellingEurotherm's product sales.

It also signalled a cut in capacity for next year,which will mean the industry as a whole will shave the number ofpackages by 15 per cent. That still means that almost 9m holidays willbe on offer.The past 12 months perfectly examplify what happens when overcapacityand a hot summer combine to hit First Choice's largest operation,holidays in UK and Irish Republic. Despite turnover rising 4 per centto pounds 702m, profits dived from pounds 15m in 1994 to a loss ofpounds 12m.First Choice's pounds 44m October rights issue to fund acquisitions,which will help shift the balance away from summer to winter, will haverelatively little effect on the overall picture at the moment. Even itsmarket-leading Canadian tour operator, where profits more than doubledto nearly pounds 8m, provides little in the way of comfort.The problem is that the year revolves around a couple of months insummer. If the company gets it right it has no need to shift aninordinate number of holidays at cut price and margins look healthy. Ifnot, margins are slaughtered as it's forced to sell holidays atunacceptable rates. Merrill Lynch expects 1995-96 profits to rebound topounds 22m, giving a forward PE ratio of 14.

It seemsunlikely now that a third party will intervene.The price looks fair, but not generous. And there must be a tinge ofdisappointment amongst those who backed Hobson's audacious pounds 111macquisition of the Co-op's food distribution arm FE Barber in May 1994.That deal was engineered by Hobson's (then) 28-year-old boss AndrewRegan. FE Barber was worth five times more than Hobson at the time ofthe deal and great things were expected from Mr Regan. Supporters sayhe has done everything he promised. Three businesses have been sold,others closed and overheads slashed. Brokers expect Hobson to makeprofits of about pounds 17m in 1995 compared with Barber's pounds 10min 1993.But rumoured deals with Geest and Albert Fisher never materialised. Theshares also remained stuck beneath the 27p price of the pounds 73mrights issue that funded the Barber purchase.Talks with Hillsdown apparently have been under way for some time.

Basic assets per share in Ex-Landsaccording to the listing particulars is 26.8p.Ex-Lands new shares should settle around 21.2p if its shares mirrorvaluations of other property groups where the average discount to NAVis around 20 per cent.The new Clubhaus shares come virtually for free. Shareholders may wishto top up holdings in this new company. A placing price around 7.5p isexpected. But doing so would inevitably expose investors to greaterrisk. The placing should raise around pounds 5m. Even so Clubhaus willstill be nearly 90 per cent geared after taking account of Ex-Lands'loans.Clubhaus' golf clubs are mainly in Europe. Of its six clubs, three areoperational - Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart - but none were beforeJune 1994, so the trading record means little.Former golf champion Jack Nicklaus designed the Hamburg and Brusselscourses. Golf is still in its infancy, relatively speaking, in Germanyand France.Further expenditure of at least pounds 22.8m is planned, more than pro-forma net assets post demerger.

First Media Investment Trust will invest in bothlisted and unlisted companies involved in the 'content' side of theindustry. This includes multimedia, computer games, TV broadcasters andprogramme producers, music, radio and on-line services.The trust intends to keep away from direct investment in hardwaremakers, although its investments will, of course, use new hardware andtechnology. Around 40 per cent of the fund will be invested in the USwith the rest being placed in the UK and Europe.First Media plans to hold up to 30 per cent of its portfolio inunlisted shares. The initial intention was to hold half of the assetsin unlisted investments but potential investors were happier with thelower figure, at least for the time being. The trust will take stakesof up to 49 per cent in these businesses which are likely to be basedin the UK or Europe. This is where it can really make its money bygetting in early in the life of a business. Much of the uplift in thevalue of this kind of business can already have happened before theshares are floated.The key, of course, will be picking the right businesses and paying theright price for a holding. John Scaife, who will be responsible foridentifying investments, has more than a decade of experience of mediainvestments in corporate finance roles and through his own mediaconsultancy. His experience should reduce the chances of the fundmaking the wrong investment although the greater risk involved inunlisted investment, especially start-ups and young companies, meansthat not all investments will go as planned. First Media needs to makesure that the successes outweigh any failures.The aim is to raise up to pounds 100m via a placing at 100p per share -there will be one warrant for every 10 shares. The minimum subscriptionlevel is set at pounds 40m. The stock exchange has insisted that as theinvestment manager, Raphael Zorn Hemsley cannot also be the trust'ssponsor.

So why was its pounds 3m open offer over-subscribed?The answer is that shareholders had the right to subscribe for all theshares on offer. And Schuttersveld, the Dutch plastics group backingHartons' refinancing, did just that. But even after scaling back togive other investors a chance, Schuttersveld ended up with 96 per centof the new shares. Suter, the industrial conglomerate which owns 30 percent of Hartons' preference shares and blocked Hartons' earlier attemptat a refinancing, did not take up its rights. The result is that theDutch company, now with almost half the voting shares, has launched amandatory bid for Hartons at 8.5p for each ordinary share. It isoffering a measly 17.71p for each convertible preference share. That isbased on the existing conversion rights and makes no allowance for theunpaid preference dividends. The offer document, still to go out, willfill in the details. But even if ordinary shareholders grab their moneywith thanks, preference shareholders will be slower to accept the bid.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996SMALLER COMPANIES: ENNEMIX ON THE SLABEnnemix, the troubled Nottinghamshire aggregates group, is on theshopping list of building materials giant Redland.

Stripping out these costs, though, theunderlying performance of the businesses improved despite the summerheatwave. Operating profits were 4 per cent higher than in thecorresponding period last year. England football team sponsor GreenFlag continues to rise. Recognition of the Green Flag name is growingand the company intends to utilise this by launching new services underthis brand. NPC is a strong cash generator and this will enable it topay off the borrowings incurred to pay the special dividend. Followingthe breakdown of buyout talks last year, NPC plans to obtain a fulllisting in 1999. The shares are currently 465p valuing the company atpounds 547m.

It hopes to announce some major deals and talks arein progress with a number of big companies. At this stage, Just is coyabout releasing details.About half of Just's sales are currently generated from its successfulIn My Pocket range. It owns the rights to this range. Beginning withPuppy In My Pocket in 1994, the concept has been extended to coverKitty, Pony and more recently Teddy In My Pocket figures. Over 60million of these figures have been sold to British children, impressivemarket penetration. Last month, it signed a new three-year deal withtoy maker Vivid Imaginations. Royalties from the deal could be wortharound pounds 2m. The In My Pocket range is also being expandedinternationally with distribution in 35 new territories this year. AndJust is considering the potential of an animation series.In addition, Just acts on behalf of brand owners, licencing out rightsto third parties. Licences include BMG's The Wind in the WillowsCollection, Cadbury's parrot, Bertie Bassett and Jelly Babies. It alsohandles corporate brand merchandising for Cadbury's, Raleigh andMatchbox.The next leg to Just's expansion could be funded by a mixture of debtand equity. Alternatively it could consider joint ventures to ease itsshares of the financial burden. In 1995, it is likely to generate pre-tax profits of about pounds 300,000 on turnover of pounds 2m, whichputs the shares on a PE ratio of less than 7.Just is in the early stages of its development.

The medical school and the founding scientists, who own overhalf the company, stand to become biotechnology millionaires if thecompany's technologies, used to make it easier to treat conditionsranging from kidney failure to cancer, reach their intended market.The science boils down to a technique - called molecule alteringstructural chemistry or MASC - for attaching a polymer, polyethyleneglycol (PEG), to some types of drug, specifically proteins, peptidesand liposomes. The PEG disguises the drugs from the body, allowing themstay in the body longer. The result is happier patients because theyneed lower doses and fewer injections.The company argues that other types of PEGylation all have drawbacks.So far the technique has watered down the benefit from the drug itselfor has needed a potentially toxic coupling agent to tie up the drug.The gains from beating these problems and applying the result inoncology, haematology, gene therapy and the treatment of genetic andenzyme deficiencies make a compelling story.But it will take time to develop. The first market will be in replacingexisting drugs with its own PEGylation technologies. Polymasc will notdisclose what it is developing, but it has three development contractsunder way. It does say that it has already applied its technologies totwo drugs - erythropoietin (Epo) and GM-CSF, used in treating anaemiaand white blood cell deficiency respectively.Shares in Polymasc, placed at 100p, started trading at 127p just beforeChristmas. Polymasc is using pounds 750,000 of the pounds 4.47m raisedin the placing to buy assets from the medical school. In theory,Polymasc should have enough money to keep going until it hits breakevenin 1997, but the risk remains that losses will continue for longer thanexpected and the company will need to raise more money. One US company,Enzon, already works in a similar field and Polymasc must show that itstechnologies go one step further along. Even if all goes to plan, thefirst products should only reach the market in 2001. But for investorswho understand the enormous risks of the biotechnology game and thelong wait for results, Polymasc is good value.Back to Headline List CopyrightINVESTORS CHRONICLE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996SMALLER COMPANIES: J&S STRENGTHENSAbrasive machine tool designer and maker Jones & Shipman is building onthe recovery experienced in the second half of 1994-95.

J&Sgenerates more than three-fifths of sales overseas and reports stronglevels of business in North America, more than a quarter of groupsales, and France. But on a more cautious note, the company says therehas been a slowdown in the rate of growth in its order book in recentmonths. That's hardly surprising given its strong rise over the last 12months or so. And although November was a little disappointing,December was J&S's best month in around seven years.

The words weren't lost on anybody.Money managers don't sell in the face of soaring stock prices, and all werelooking for a reason to run for the exits. The Fed Chairman has just given themtheir excuse, sparking the fuse worldwide for investors to cash out and takeprofits.The choppy waters of the IPO market swam in a different undercurrent this pastweek. What got priced were several small-cap issues underwritten bylittle-known investment bank whose names are difficult to find in Wall Street'sdirectories. Not too surprising, given small underwriters' historically provenability to push small deals, the aftermarket performance was spectacular.Such underwriters as Coburn & Meredith and Werbel-Roth led the way as WallStreet's giants stepped to the sidelines. Nine IPOs were priced from Friday,November 29 to Thursday, December 5, and seven were winners. There were nolosers and the two IPOs that were unchanged (see Launching Pad - page 2) wereunderwritten by the well know and respected Oppenheimer & Co.The biggest moonshot of the week came from the syndicate desks of Werbel-Rothand co-manager Millennium Securities. On Tuesday, the underwriters offered700,000 shares of Translation Group (NASDAQ:THEO), a deal that had been on theIPO calendar for several weeks, at $6 a share and 1.3 million warrants at $0.20a warrant. The first day's trading was curious. The stock opened at $7 and thenexploded to the day's high and closing price of $14, up 133%. The warrantsfollowed a similar path in opening at $1, then zooming to $7.25 before closingat $6, up 2,900%. And the company? It is located in Pennsauken, N.J., and isengaged in the translation of documents and software.On December 5, Coburn & Meredith with its co-manager, Shamrock Partners, priced1.0 million shares and warrants of Websecure (NASDAQ:WEBS and WEBSW,respectively) at $8 a share and $0.20 a warrant. Both soared. The common stockopened at $14.50 share, traded between a range of $15.25 and $12.50, and closedat $14.75, up 84.4%. The warrants opened at $4, sold low at $3 and closed ontheir high of $5.88, up 2,837.5%. The development-stage company, based inSaugus, Mass., offers Internet access and support services for securecommercial transactions.In a not-too-shabby third place finish was the Advanced Aerodynamics &Structures (NASDAQ:AASIU) offering of DH Blair. On Thursday, 6.0 million unitsconsisting of one common share, one class A warrant and one class B warrantwere priced at $5 a unit. The securities were traded three ways: as units, ascommon stock and as warrants. The units opened at $7.75, sold to a high of$9.50 and closed at $8.50, up a nifty 70%. The company, located in Long Beach,Calif., is engaged in the design and manufacture of prop and jet aircraft.Normally, when a hot IPO market become dominated by the small fries, it is asign of a top. However, the new issue market is not frothy. Despite therecord-setting volume figures this year, the IPO market is far from sizzling.The Dow Jones Industrial Average have soared over 25% this year to a Novembertop of 6,547 while the new issue market (see ranking charts page 13) squeakedout a modest gain of 13.6% in the 12 months ending November 29.Now that the Fed has spoken and profit taking hit the market, a new andstronger securities market will emerge. It always has, and the Fed Chairmandoesn't want to go down in history as the father of another 1929-type stockmarket crash that led to the Depression of the 1930s. The stock market is hereto stay, and so are IPOs.John E.Fitzgibbon,Jr.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE IPO AFTERMARKET via NewsNetDecember 09, 1996Oakmont Flue Shut As Shapiro DeliversMary Shapiro, regulations president of the National Association of SecuritiesDealers, began handing early Christmas presents last week.Her first stop, Lake Success, N.Y., where she left bad brokerage firm StrattonOakmont a lump of coal and an expulsion from the securities industry.Over the past seven years, Stratton Oakmont has been repeatedly disciplined,fined, sued and reprimanded by securities regulators and customers.Charges to the company have included excessive mark-ups on stock offerings,illicit sales practices, fraud and business ethics abuses.An unaudited accounting of the total amount of fines owed by the firm couldexceed $25 million, sources familiar with the situation said.This latest action centers on allegations that the firm instituted essesivelylarge mark-ups in the securities of pink-sheeted Master Glazier's KarateInternational, and charged buyers over and above standard transaction costs todo trades.Besides closing the firm's doors, at least for the holidays, the expulsionspecifically bars Stratton's president Daniel Porush and Steven Saunders, itshead trader, from any securities dealings.Neither Porush or Saunders could be reached for comment at presstime.The expulsion also affects the trading of two initial public offerings that thefirm managed to underwrite this year and the proposed launch of one other.In January Stratton Oakmont, offered stock and warrants totaling $10.15 millionin proceeds for Paramount Financial (NASDAQ:PARA) at $3.50 per unit. At presstime the shares closed at $1 on a volume of 82. The warrants, tradingseparately, closed at 7/32 on volume of 105. Paramount is a consumer andbusiness financial services firm.In May, the firm offered stock and warrants totaling $6.5 million in proceedsfor n-Vision (NASDAQ:NVSN) at $5 per unit. At press time the stock closed at 15/16 and the warrants at 3/8.n-Vision makes and markets proprietary virtual reality applications for avariety of applications including medicine, simulation, and industrial designTrading, such as it is, in these stocks will continue through clearing agentJ.B. Oxford., which has had no charges leveled against itAnother proposed issue has been filed with SEC but has been in a state ofperpetual postponement, which now is more unlikely than ever to be lifted.In April, e-Net, an Internet service provider, filed for an IPO calculated togenerate $14 million in proceeds. Based in Gaithersburg, Md., e-Net executivesdid not return telephone calls.Inside sources at the NASD say that the move against Stratton Oakmont isShapiro's first significant crackdown on brokerage abuses since she took officeearlier this year. More are expected.Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Gracian.MackBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE IPO AFTERMARKET via NewsNetDecember 09, 199612-Month Rankings Have Bear TracksBear, Stearns (NYSE:BSC) is hoping the underwriting of First Virtual Holdings(Proposed NASDAQ:FVHI) this week performs as well as the 14 other deals thefirm has done over the 12 months ended November 30.According to statistics from Securities Data Co., Bear, Stearns is the numberone manager of positive performing initial public offerings during the rolling12-months began in December 1995.During the period, Bear, Stearns brought a total of 14 IPOs to market. As ofthe close on Nov. 29, they averaged a hefty 49.9% increase over their offerprices. This compares impressively to the mediocre 16.91% average increasenotched by all IPOs priced in the time frame.No doubt the success of several high profile issues, such as Planet Hollywood(NASDAQ:PHII), Guangshen Railway (NYSE:GSH), Sabratek (NASDAQ:SBTK) and SuizaFoods (NASDAQ:SWZA) helped lift Bear, Stearns from fifth place in the Octoberto October rankings ran last month to first place for the 12 months endedNovember 30.In New York, staffers at Planet Hollywood are still cordoning off the sidewalkfor tourists to gape at the  film industry's eatery/media memorabilia shop.Offered at $18 ($2 above the high end of the filing range), PHII has closed ashigh as $32.125 since its April IPO. The Class A shares posted a recent closeof $23.Guangshen, China's in-country railroad, offered more than 11 million AmericanDepository Shares at $19 in May. The ADSs  hit an all-time high of $21.50, andlanded a recent close near offer price of $19.75. Not great, but tight andconsistent.Sabratek, the electromedical equipment manufacturer, came to market in June at$10. The IPO price was $1 below the original $11 to $13 filing range, and yetinvestors snapped up the all 2.5 million shares and have booted the share priceas high as $16.75. A recent close lists the shares about $2 off that high butstill $4 above the offer price.Suiza, the Puerto Rican milk products and fruit drinks producer, was offered at$14 (smack dab in the middle of its filing range) posted a recent close of$18.625. That isn't far from its all-time high of $19.25.Price spreads among these issues may be tight compared to some other issuesoffered this year, but, as one BSC staffer said, "they're tight but they'reright for the market."Indeed, the IPO Managers Aftermarket chart shows on average, BSC has priced itsIPOs more than 3 1/2% below the stated filing range, only to have the sharessoar nearly 10% at the end of their first day of trading.Unlike number three ranked Hambrecht & Quist (NYSE:HMQ), BSC has stayed awayfrom any industry-based underwriting niche.Where Hambrecht has carved out a solid place among technology issues, BSC'sequity participations are an eclectic mix of transportation, food, and evenconsumer financial services such as United Payors & United Providers(NASDAQ:UPUP). Offered in July at $11, the shares have been as high as $15,although a recent close of $12 has wiped out those gains.The "one from column A and one from column B" approach is classic conservatismfor investors. It is also vintage Bear among deal makers on Wall Street.BSC's, mix of industry sectors has allowed it to take advantage of the stars ina range of niches.As the IPO Industry Aftermarket chart shows, credit institutions have turned ina surprising 73% increase over offer price.BSC managed the underwriting of RAC Financial Group  (NASDAQ:RACF) in Februaryat $17. While the shares have dipped as low as $8.75, they have also been ashigh as $30.75, with a recent close of $23.125.Again, issues in this sector have been priced an average 4 1/2% below thestated filing range, but closed the first day of trading up more than 14%.For individual investors, the scenario where an issue comes to market cheaperthat expected and then spirals higher than could have been hoped for is betterthan the converse.Consider specialty investors of application  software products over the last 12months.With their sexy Internet intros and promises to make life on the PC easier andmore exciting, these issues come to market priced at a premium.According to Securities Data, software applications that target home users havebeen priced on a steep average of 15% higher than the stated filing range.While there is heavy, almost too-good-to-be-true activity for about a monthafter offer, these stock have settled at or below offer price and show notangible sign of returning  to former short-lived glory.Volatility in this sector is not only a matter of broken promises. A quick andinformal pol of industry analysts reveals that a good story might get someventure capitalists interested, but for long-term investors the company has tohave a product that has the potential to become an industry standard."As computer usage becomes more commonplace among individuals," said oneanalyst. "Users are finding out that they do not have to have ever single newsoftware package that comes out, as soon as it comes out."The same quick rise and quicker fall is true for software applications thattarget business customers (see chart)."These issues don't represent the games or a lot of the educational mark," saidone industry analyst. "They do represent a lot of the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)wannabe's who ultimately can't compete with the established leaders inspreadsheet, word processing, etc. . Unfortunately, the market is a bitgullible about what a company or product promises it can do."

Nos. 33-7250,34-36643, IC-21625, December 28, 1995).  Comment also is sought onproposed amendments to require qualitative and quantitativedisclosure outside the financial statements about the market riskassociated with derivatives.The SEC conducted a review of about 500 registrants in 1994 and1995 to assess disclosure practices with respect to market risksensitive instruments.  The disclosures reviewed in 1995 were moreinformative than 1994, largely due to improved guidance by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board, the staff concluded.However, three significant disclosure issues remain.   The releaseaddresses those issues.The proposed amendments would require enhanced descriptions in thefootnotes to financial statements of accounting policies used forderivative financial instruments and derivative commodityinstruments.  The materiality of such disclosure would bedetermined by the fair values of the instruments at the end of eachreporting period and during each reporting period.The SEC proposed a new Item 305 under Regulation S-K to requiredisclosure outside the financial statements of qualitative andquantitative information about derivatives and other financialinstruments.  In complying with the proposed amendments requiringdisclosure of quantitative information about market risk,registrants could select from three alternatives.  One option is touse a tabular presentation of expected future cash flow amounts andrelated contract terms categorized by expected maturity dates.A second option is to use a sensitivity analysis expressing thepossible loss in earnings, fair values, or cash flows of marketrisk sensitive instruments from selected hypothetical changes inmarket rates and prices.  The final option is to use value at riskdisclosures expressing the potential loss in earnings, fair values,or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments from marketmovements over a selected period of time with a selected likelihoodof occurrence.The proposed qualitative information about market risk wouldinclude a narrative discussion of primary market risk exposures andhow they are managed.  Registrants are reminded to includeinformation about derivatives that directly or indirectly affectreported items to the extent such information is material andnecessary to prevent the disclosure about a reported item frombeing misleading.The SEC reported its intention that forward looking disclosuresunder new Item 305 and Item 9A of Form 20-F be subject to anappropriate safe harbor.  The staff is considering how to craft anappropriate safe harbor in light of the recently passed PrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act.  The Act amends the 1933 and 1934Acts to include a safe harbor for forward looking information.  TheSEC will issue a release in the near future to propose that dis-closures to be required by Items 305 and 9A be made subject to safeharbor provisions.The SEC noted that it recognizes the evolving nature of market risksensitive instruments and will continue to monitor disclosurerelated issues.  If the proposals are adopted, the SEC expects toreconsider the effectiveness of the rules and the need foradditional proposals in about five years.  The comment period forthe proposed amendments is 120 days.Back to Headline List CopyrightSEC TODAY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996Securities Act RegistrationsThe following registration statements have been filed with theSEC under the Securities Act of 1933.

26-31Overview:  Airs the unavoidable tension between the private placement issuerand the investors it hopes to attract.  Highlights alternatives in structuringprivate placements, which balance investors' risk/reward incentives and thecompany's managerial concerns.Choose financing vehicle.  The first issue a company must consider whenstructuring a private placement is whether to sell debt or equity.  Proceedsof an equity offering increase the company's net worth, thereby improving itsborrowing capacity and ov erall financial strength.  Although debt expands thecompany's capital base, it does not increase the net worth and it must berepaid.  Debt subordinated to the company's primary lending institution may beviewed as equity by the lender (i.e., to satisfy the lender'sdebt-to-equity-ratio requirements), but trade creditors may not share thatview.  While interest accruing on debt is booked as an expense, therebyincreasing liabilities and decreasing profit and net worth, accrued but unpaiddividends on equity securities do not reduce income and have no impact on networth until paid.Ascertain investors' goals.  To ensure liquidity for their investment,investors in a private placement need an exit strategy.  As compensation forthe increased risk and longer holding periods of a private placement,investors generally seek a high rate of return (an anticipated compoundedinternal rate of 30 to 45 percent) as well as the ability to maximize theirprobability of achieving a return of capital.  Therefore the investment isoften structured as preferred stock, convertible debt, or subordinated debtwith an equity feature.  To maintain control over their investment, privateplacement investors often negotiate seats on or control of the company's boardof directors, limits on executive compensation, antidilution provisions, andthe ability to control certain transactions outside of the ordinary course ofbusiness.Consider the alternatives.  Before purchasing preferred stock, investorsshould focus on the following negotiable features:  a liquidation preference;a dividend preference, preferably cumulative; a conversion right into commonstock; a forced redemption feature; voting rights equal to the number ofcommon shares into which the preferred stock can convert; demand or piggybackregistration rights; a right of first refusal allowing pro rata participationin any future offering; a "come-along" right to ensure the preferred investorreceives whatever the inside stockholders get for their shares; a "take-along"that forces the inside shareholders to go along if the investor wants to sellthe entire company; and negative covenants restricting actions that diminishthe preferred stock's value without the investor's consent.Compare rates of return.  The form of the security issued in a privateplacement can have a dramatic effect on the investor's return, should thecompany fall short of its stated performance goals or greatly exceed them.For example, an investor purchasing $100,000 of common stock that representsone-third of the company would receive $83,333 if the company were sold fiveyears later for $250,000 - a loss of $16,333.  On the other hand, an investorpurchasing 8 percent cumulative convertible preferred stock with a $100,000liquidation preference, convertible into one-third of the company's commonstock, would receive $140,000 ($40,000 of accumulated dividends and the$100,000 liquidation preference) if the company were sold five years later for$250,000 - a gain of $40,000.Editor's Note:  This issue of Business Law Today contains a collection ofinteresting articles on small business finance, including "Going Public," byMichael Ellis, Pgs.  37-41.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOWNE DIGEST-CORP/SEC ARTICLE ABSTRACTS via NewsNetJanuary 1996Going Public: Implications For The Question Of Minimizing Discrimination In The Residential Real Estate IndustryBy Richard BennettCapcar Enterprises, Ltd., BermudaReal Estate Law JournalVol. 24, No. 2, Pgs. 122-145Overview:  Describes several ways by which real estate developers can raiseequity.  Worries that the securities laws may not deter developers fromdiscriminating when making construction decisions.  Discouragingdiscrimination.  If funding comes from a federally insured or fundedinstitution, such as a bank, developers cannot use it for discriminatorypurposes and the lender retains an interest in and control over the use offunds.  Federal antidiscrimination laws do not, however, apply to funds raisedin the equity markets.  The shareholders, through the market, exercise controlby selling, which drives down the stock price.  Therefore, equity-fundeddevelopers may feel pressured to focus on the bottom line and build onlyhigher-cost housing.  Although the SEC scrutinizes the financial disclosuresof a public company, it does not prohibit these discriminatory buildingpractices.The MBS dilemma.  Real estate developers are increasingly accessing thesecurities markets - through MBSs and REITs - rather than seeking traditionalbank loans to provide their working capital.  Mortgage-backed securities areinstruments that bundle mortgages together and create a security backed by thecash flow from the mortgage payments.  A notable problem is the unevenness ofthe cash flow.  Similar to bonds with a call feature, the underlying mortgagesmay be (and often are) prepaid when interest rates fall, but investors cannotascertain the exact conditions that will prompt prepayment and cannot plan forits occurrence.  Investors might value the MBS investment higher if they haddetailed disclosures about the underlying mortgages, including informationabout the borrowers.  Unfortunately, the same information that would allowthem to calculate the probabilities of prepayment would also permitdiscrimination against certain borrowers and certain neighborhoods.With few strings attached.  Many developers use a real estate investment trustto issue stock.  To qualify as a REIT, the trust cannot be closely held andmust attract at least 100 investors.  The REIT must derive its income from andhold its assets only in defined areas, and it must pay a preset dividend.  Atypical REIT provides large amounts of cash to the developer, with few stringsattached.  The REIT's main advantage is that it is not subject to federalincome tax for the portion of its capital gains distributed to shareholders,thus avoiding the double taxation of the corporate form.  The developer thatfinances solely with debt runs a constant risk of financial difficulty; addingREIT equity decreases the risk and may increase the developer's value.Developers' decisionmaking.  Equity funding ideally would free a developer tomake decisions based purely on economics.  Theoretically the developer's idealportfolio contains a mixture of high, moderate, and low-income housing.Affordable housing stock provides a steady stream of rental income, which willlook good on quarterly disclosure statements, ensures working capital, andallows for the payment of regular dividends.  The fear is that developersmight not make decisions based purely on economic considerations, but rathermay shun low-income housing that does not increase profits for publicshareholders.  A statutory gap exists, one that allows developers todiscriminate when building residential housing.  The government should fillthis vacuum by extending the reach of the fair-housing laws to cover the gapor adding new features to the securities laws.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOWNE DIGEST-CORP/SEC ARTICLE ABSTRACTS via NewsNetJanuary 1996How To Draft Financial Representations And Indemnity Provisions In Acquisition AgreementsBy Leigh WaltonBass Berry & Sims, Nashville, TNALI-ABA Course Materials JournalVol. 20, No. 2, Pgs. 39-48Overview:  Outlines the representations of financial condition and theindemnification clauses commonly used in acquisition agreements, includingdraft model provisions prepared by an ABA committee.  Provides guidelines fornegotiating and drafting them.  Contrasts the arguments each side might use innegotiations.  Basic representations.  The seller's representations about itsfinancial condition are critical elements in an acquisition agreement.Representations are generally based on financial statements.  As early in theprocess as possible, a buyer should review the audit report to see if theseller's financial statements conform to GAAP.  Sellers are wise to representonly that the financials "fairly present" the company's financial condition"in accordance with GAAP" and not that they are "complete and correct."  Aseller's representation that interim financials conform to GAAP should includeproper qualifications, for example, that they are subject to "normal recurringyear-end adjustments."  In turn, the purchaser should require a furtherrepresentation that the effect of any qualifications will not "individually orin the aggregate, be materially adverse."Tailoring representations.  Sellers can resist or modify a buyer's requestsfor additional financial representations.  A common request is arepresentation that the target's records are complete, correct, and inconformance with valid business practice.  The seller may respond that GAAPfinancials alone are sufficient; however, if it does agree to give thatrepresentation, it should add a materiality qualification.  Frequently buyersrequest representations on specific line items in financial statements,perhaps to avoid the seller's qualifications (such as materiality).  Forexample, the buyer may seek assurance that the accounts receivable arecollectible.  The seller should object because doing so would constitutegiving a guarantee.  Other common line item representations involve inventoryand undisclosed liabilities.Carving out indemnification.  Multiple sellers might agree onjoint-and-several liability, with or without an allocation agreement.Alternatively, each seller's degree of liability could depend on itsproportionate share of the sale price, its role in the business (i.e., activeor passive), or the specific representation or covenant involved.  A sellershould indemnify beyond the representations' scope only on a known problem forwhich a clean representation seems impossible.  Careful drafting can resolvein advance any questions of whether tax benefits, insurance proceeds, andfound assets will offset losses.  Any clause setting an indemnificationdeductible should indicate whether reaching it entitles the purchaser to everydollar of loss or only every dollar over the deductible.  Parties should alsoclarify how the clause intersects with materiality limitations in specificrepresentations.  A buyer should not consent to the seller's typical requestfor an indemnification maximum equal to the purchase price unless it can carveout appropriate exceptions (e.g., taxes and intentional conduct, such asfraud).Ancillary aspects of indemnity.  Sellers should not agree to indemnify againstbreaches of representations and covenants from documents other than theacquisition agreement and its schedules.  A buyer concerned about the seller'screditworthiness could negotiate an escrow as a nonexclusive remedy, a letterof credit, or a right of set-off against postclosing payments it owes theseller.  An indemnification's time limit depends on the nature of the businessand the sufficiency of the financial statements provided, but the buyer shoulddemand at least enough time for one postclosing audit.  A seller should insistthat the indemnity is the exclusive means of asserting claims; in turn, thebuyer should demand that any exclusivity clause apply only to money damages.Because this clause would not bar recourse under Rule 10b-5 (or other fraudlaws), a seller could counter the scienter element of a possible 10b-5 claimby documenting the buyer's opportunity to perform due diligence.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOWNE DIGEST-CORP/SEC ARTICLE ABSTRACTS via NewsNetJanuary 1996An Argument For Invalidating Change Of Control CovenantsBy Thomas MarkoUniversity of Iowa College of LawJournal of Corporation LawVol. 20, No. 3, Pgs. 475-496Overview:  Analyzes change-of-control debt covenants, focusing on theirdefensive use as a tactic to entrench current management.  Argues that thesecovenants fail to satisfy the test for determining the validity of managementdefensive tactics and therefore are illegal.Protection or defense.  Courts traditionally refuse to recognize a fiduciaryrelationship between management and bondholders and are generally unwilling tofind a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing underbond contracts.  Accordingly, bondholders often require bond instruments toinclude a change-of-control covenant, which typically will give the bondholderthe right to put the bond back to the company or receive a higher interestrate, should a designated takeover-related event occur.  Thechange-of-con-trol covenant is usually triggered by a hostile attempt such asa tender offer or successful proxy contest.  Because the triggers apply onlyto transactions not approved by management and do not necessarily take intoaccount whether bond values will be adversely affected by the change ofcontrol, these covenants are used most often by incumbent management as adefensive entrenchment tool.Unocal test applies.  The Delaware Supreme Court in Unocal Corp.  v.  MesaPetroleum Co.  established a two-pronged inquiry for determining the validityof management defensive tactics:  1) the directors must have reasonablegrounds to believe that another entity's ownership would pose a danger tocorporate policy and effectiveness; and 2) the defensive measure is reasonablein relation to the purported threat.  Although it has never been judiciallyapplied to determine the validity of change-of-control covenants in bondinstruments, the Unocal test seems the appropriate standard to apply.Threatening corporate policy.  Delaware courts assessing management'sresponses to hostile tender offers have recognized three potential threats tocorporate policy and effectiveness:  (i) opportunity loss (the tender offermay deprive shareholders of the opportunity to select a better alternative);(ii) structural coercion (the risk that fear of disparate treatment ofshareholders not accepting the tender offer may affect shareholders'decisionmaking); and (iii) substantive coercion (the risk that shareholderswho disbelieve management's good-faith predictions about future value may beled to accept the tender offer).  A change-of-control bond covenant triggeredby a hostile tender offer survives the first prong of the Unocal test.However, only a proxy contest joined with a tender offer presents a legitimaterisk to shareholder interests.  Thus, a change-of-control bond covenanttriggered by a proxy contest alone would not survive the first Unocal prong.Matching remedy to threat.  Even if a change-of-control covenant could survivethe first prong, the second prong requires that the covenant must bereasonable in relation to the alleged threat.  By giving bondholders a put oran increased interest rate, a change-of-control covenant benefits only thebondholders and not the shareholders, who would be deprived of the opportunityto choose between competing offers.  In proxy contests, dissidents would findit much more difficult convincing shareholders to vote in their favor.  Thus,a change-of-control bond covenant triggered by either a hostile tender offeror a proxy contest fails the second prong of the Unocal test and should beinvalidated.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOWNE DIGEST-CORP/SEC ARTICLE ABSTRACTS via NewsNetJanuary 1996Dealing With State Securities RegulatorsBy Michael Missal, Stephen Topetzes, and Marc BryantKirkpatrick & Lockhart, Washington, DCReview of Securities & Commodities RegulationVol. 28, No. 20, Pgs. 203-213Overview:  Explores recent trends in state securities law enforcement.Explains the scope of state enforcement, focusing on actions againstsecurities professionals.  Contrasts state and federal powers andinvestigative strategies, and suggests response tactics for targets.State enforcement.  State securities regulators possess a wide panoply ofenforcement powers and remedies (including several not available to or used bythe SEC).  They often issue cease-and-desist orders in settling disputedantifraud cases or other alleged registration infractions.  Most states permitpublic (as well as discreet or secretive) investigation of securitiesviolations.  This public process can seriously injure a securities firm'sreputation, even absent any eventual finding of wrongdoing.  Because stateagencies have small staffs and frequent personnel turnover, they often resortto processes that are informal, not fully documented, and not procedurallysafeguarded (compared with SEC investigations).Collateral damage and coordinated enforcement.  State regulators often issuestop orders revoking the effectiveness of registration statements they findmisleading or otherwise in violation of the registration or prospectusrequirements.  Given the cooperation between regulators in multiple states andthe nearly universal presence of "bad boy" provisions in blue sky laws,sanctions in one state will generate sanctions in other states for amultistate offering or one involving a regional or national securities firm.Counsel for regulatory targets must therefore be sensitive to collateralconsequences when attempting to settle proceedings in the initial state andare wise to maintain a more national viewpoint and strategy.Strategize to prevent runaway liability.  When defending or settling stateenforcement actions, counsel should attempt as soon as possible to establishcordial, cooperative relations with the regulators, who often servesimultaneously as investigator, prosecutor, judge, and executioner.  Duringthe informal period, counsel should push to create ground rules for producingdocuments and exchanging information, while keeping other states' regulatorsat bay pending resolution of the initial action.  Losing in the "court ofpublic opinion" before succeeding with a legal defense can be a costly error.The issuer should develop a broad-scale plan for making whatever correctiveaction might be necessary in multiple states.  Because of the state agency'shigh public profile, the regulators often demand that settlements includerestitution and administrative costs, fines, strengthening of internalpolicies and procedures, further reporting, management changes, and othersupervisory requirements.Current issues in state enforcement.  Many state securities administratorshave adopted a more aggressive posture in cases that combine a securitiesfirm's failure to disclose significant risks - notably of derivativesinvestments - with allegations of its failure to make suitable recommendationsor to supervise.  State regulators demonstrate an increasing interest incooperative ventures with other states to attack regional or nationalsecurities firms on matters at the cutting edge of securities liability,without waiting for definitive SEC guidance.  In registration cases, thestates now often insist that issuers produce "stickered" prospectuses and addspecial legends to sales literature to highlight, beyond SEC requirements, anyenhanced investment risks that the regulators perceive in the investment.Editor's Note:  For another current article on state securities law, read"Recent Blue Sky Developments," by Pierre de Saint Phalle and Nora Jordan,Review of Securities & Commodities Regulation, Vol.  28, No.  15, Pgs.147-154.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOWNE DIGEST-CORP/SEC ARTICLE ABSTRACTS via NewsNetJanuary 1996Regulation Of Canadian Capital Markets In The 1990s: The United States In The Driver's SeatBy Prof. Cally JordanMcGill University Faculty of LawPacific Rim Law & Policy JournalVol. 4, No. 3, Pgs. 577-632Overview:  Summarizes the Canadian system of securities regulation andcontrasts it with the US system.  Explores the development of US/Canadianmultijurisdictional regulation, and evaluates its impact on the Canadiansystem.  Appends two detailed narratives summarizing Canada's regulatorysystems and enforcement provisions applicable to domestic and foreign issuers.Subtle differences underlie.  Canadian securities regulation, constitutionallyrelegated to provincial rather than federal control, resembles US federalregulation, but it adds subtle adaptations and differs slightly in itsemphasis.  The legislation, especially in Ontario (the de factostandard-setter), is drafted in a simpler, more modern style, while Canada'sregulatory structures have developed largely outside the formal statutoryprovisions, on a more consensual, nearly ad hoc basis.  The extrastatutoryregulatory system in Ontario fell to a legal challenge in 1993, resulting inthe 1994 adoption of legislation authorizing SEC-type rulemaking.  A notablecontrast in the countries' emphasis appears in Canada's treatment ofregistration exemptions:  unlike the subjective tests of investment intentthat SEC rules impose, Canada favors clear, bright-line rules.  For example,no prospectus is required under the Ontario private placement rules for asingle purchase of securities worth over Cdn $150,000.Multijurisdiction's disadvantages.  The 1991 implementation of the US/CanadianMultijurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS) significantly impacted Canadiansecurities regulation.  Under the MJDS, an issuer can rely on disclosuredocuments filed in its home country to satisfy the other country'srequirements.  Canadians find the system more complex than they had hoped,because the US did not ease its liability rules for the prospectus.  Thus, aCanadian prospectus used in the US under the MJDS still looks very much like aUS prospectus.  The chief Canadian beneficiaries of the system so far havebeen issuers of high-grade debt securities, whose primary disclosures consistof third-party ratings.  The MJDS's greatest impact to date is seen inCanada's harmonizing adoption of US practices such as shelf registration.Ontario's aggressive recognition policy.  The Ontario Securities Commissionhas forged new ground in applying MJDS principles on a unilateral basis.  Inits draft National Policy No.  53, the OSC has proposed permitting asubstantial foreign issuer of global offerings to use its domestic filingsfrom any country to comply with Ontario requirements.  The policy would havepermitted even exempt transactions such as Rule 144A offerings to use onlyoffering memoranda in Ontario, but under pressure the OSC has now retreatedfrom this policy extension.  The OSC also issued a ruling allowing limited useof US and UK private offering memoranda in Ontario private offerings.  Thisprivate placement ruling may pose a problem because of the common-lawmechanisms by which persons claim damages for misrepresentation, at leastuntil the Ontario legislature enacts a statutory remedy.Editor's Note:  The full text as well as a summary analysis of the currentsecurities laws and regulations for Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec areincluded in the International Securities Laws Handbook, a three-volumepublication available from Bowne.

Reviews recent cases on misleadinginformational memoranda in the UK and elsewhere.  Addresses the use andeffectiveness of exculpatory clauses in underwriting agreements andinformation memoranda.Liability of syndication managers.  The lead lender in a syndicated commercialloan usually undertakes the preparation of an informational memorandum tosolicit interest from other potential lenders.  This prospectus-like documentdraws its content largely from the borrower, but by preparing it, the leadmanager can become liable for common-law negligence or deceit and, underspecial statutory provisions in the UK, for any misrepresentations.  A personordinarily is liable only for negligent misrepresentations made to those incontractual proximity; for example, in the UK, auditors are not liable to thegeneral public for misstatements in a company's financial statements.  Leadmanagers, however, have the requisite proximity to the other members of theloan syndication.  Their special relationship permits recovery for negligentmisrepresentations in the information memorandum on which the other membersrelied.  Under the UK's Misrepresentations Act of 1967, a syndicate memberthat made a loan based on an erroneous memorandum merely needs to allege amisstatement; this shifts the burden of proof onto the lead manager, whichmust then show the absence of negligence.Harder cases:  deceit and fiduciary duty.  In contrast to proving common-lawnegligence and statutory liability for contractual misrepresentations,syndicate members would have a more difficult time proving a lead manager'sliability for fraudulent misrepresentation.  The plaintiff in a case of deceitmust show scienter or reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of themisstatement.  Despite occasional court dictum to the contrary, British andother Commonwealth courts have declined to find a fiduciary relationshipbetween a lead manager and the syndicate members.  Courts tend to viewcommercial banks in these transactions as sophisticated parties, acting atarm's length, well able to protect themselves without the benefit of thespecial relationships of trust imposed in the absence of particularcontractual clauses.Exclusionary clauses to limit liabilities.  Lead managers commonly seek toavoid negligence liability by disclaiming it in syndication agreements and inthe information memorandum itself.  Such clauses generally fail to protectagainst liability for fraud.  Their effectiveness against liability fornegligence depends on their status under the Unfair Contract Terms Act of 1977(the "UCTA").  The UCTA states that the disclaimer must be reasonable and theaffected party must receive advance notice of the liability disclaimer,thereby raising doubt over the effectiveness of disclaimers that exist only inthe memorandum.In a 1993 Australian Supreme Court case, NatWest Australia Bank Ltd.  v.Tricontinental Corp.  Ltd., the court found such a clause ineffective where asyndicate member had specifically inquired about certain borrower accounts andhad received specific assurances from the lead lender.  Other British casesthat refused to enforce liability disclaimers rest on the parties' unequalbargaining power, suggesting that ordinary syndication situations will not runafoul of the UCTA.  As an agent for the other lenders, the lead manager mayowe some duty of due care and skill when preparing the loan documentation, butrecent decisions have characterized the problem as "poor draftsmanship" andtoo remote to permit recovery.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOWNE DIGEST-CORP/SEC ARTICLE ABSTRACTS via NewsNetJanuary 1996London Market Starts UpBy Derham O'NeillClifford Chance, London, EnglandNational Law JournalDecember 4, 1995, Pgs. C1-C4Overview:  Describes the advent of a new, second-tier securities market in theUnited Kingdom.  Compares its listing and reporting criteria to those ofearlier "unlisted" markets and the NASDAQ.  Analyzes the new market'spotential impact on issuers and investors.Europe needs a NASDAQ.  Because other European efforts to emulate the successof the US's floorless exchange - NASDAQ - have not succeeded.  the LondonStock Exchange is replacing its Unlisted Securities Market with theAlternative Investment Market (AIM).  AIM is the first of several second-tiermarkets planned for Europe; one in Paris and a Europe-wide market known asEASDAQ are under development.  The objective of these markets is to create anenvironment for newer, small-cap companies that offers regulatory anddisclosure standards adequate to reassure investors but not so complex orexpensive that issuers will forgo the benefits of public listing.  TheExchange intends for AIM eventually to supplant not only the UnlistedSecurities Market but also the quasi-unregulated "Rule 4.2" market, althoughcurrently the latter continues in existence.Listing criteria favor new issues.  Since the AIM primarily wants to servenewly public companies, its listing requirements do not cover trading history,past public float, or minimum public share holdings.  This contrasts with themajor exchanges and even NASDAQ, whose "small-cap" listing requires $1 millionin publicly held shares.  To list on AIM, a company must have freely tradableshares, publish financial statements in compliance with US, UK, orInternational GAAP, and designate an exchange-approved "nominated advisor" anda "nominated broker."  A nominated advisor verifies compliance with the entryrequirements, advises the issuer on the listing and reporting rules, andconfirms the issuer's internal due diligence program, but need not certify theissuer's working capital.  A nominated broker (which must be an Exchangemember) is not a marketmaker but must use its best efforts to find tradematches if no marketmaker exists.Reporting and notification obligations.  AIM-listed companies must publishprospectuses complying with the European Union's Public Offering ProspectusDirective of 1989, but AIM does not review the prospectuses in advance ofpublication.  AIM companies must disclose certain acquisitions andrelated-party transactions, but at higher thresholds than regularly listedcompanies must observe and without obtaining prior shareholder approval.Because of the prevalence of newly public companies on AIM, directors andemployees must agree not to sell their shares for one year following admissionto listing.  The UK's new insider-trading regulations apply to AIM companies,which must adopt codes of conduct that prohibit insider trading at least forspecified key periods during the year and must report transgressions to thenew exchange.Prospects for success mixed.  The key investors in Europe remain institutions,which historically have resisted illiquid investments.  It may turn out thatAIM's lack of capitalization threshold, compared to the relatively smallthresholds on more established markets, will raise resistance in theseinvestors.  AIM shows promise as a "nursery" for newly public companies, whichmay later avail themselves of the LSE's upgrade privilege to list on the mainexchange after two years on AIM without having to issue new listingparticulars.  The development of additional second-tier markets in Europeindicates that many securities professionals believe Europe is ready for aNASDAQ-like opportunity for public trading of smaller and newer companies.Editor's Note:  Bowne's International Securities Laws Handbook includes thefull text of the European Union's securities-related directives, the currentUK Financial Services Act and insider trading laws, other UK securities laws,and a summary of UK securities regulations and listing rules.

Discusses the factors that courts consider when evaluatingthe doctrine.  Suggests ways that joint venturers can tackle the problem whenestablishing an enterprise.Testing the limits.  The corporate opportunity doctrine, an element of theduty of loyalty, protects an enterprise from self-dealing by its fiduciaries.The increasing use of joint venturing between well-established companies willtest the parameters of the doctrine.  Directors, officers, and significantshareholders (or the partners in a partnership) cannot divert businessopportunities to themselves that "belong" to the company.  This doctrine cancreate problems for venturers when their own businesses are closely related tothat of the joint venture.  For example, a telecommunications company and asoftware company might form a joint venture to develop products forinteractive television.  The telecom company might want to use the technologycreated by the joint venture in the telecom field generally, but the corporateopportunity doctrine seems to bar it from doing so.  A similar problem arisesif an officer of the telecom company who sits on the joint venture's boardlearns of an opportunity that could be exploited by either the company or thejoint venture; that person faces a conflict of fiduciary duties.The doctrine's parameters.  Several courts have articulated tests for thedoctrine.  Delaware calls its analysis the "line of business" test.Fiduciaries cannot pursue opportunities that fall within the corporation'sline of business and that the corporation financially could develop.Regardless of how they describe the doctrine, most courts consider six factorsin deciding whether a fiduciary may pursue an opportunity:  1) whether theopportunity falls within the company's present or planned line of business; 2)whether the company values the opportunity; 3) if corporate assets developedthe opportunity; 4) if the fiduciaries learned of the opportunity while actingin their corporate capacities; 5) whether the company possesses the financialwherewithal to exploit the opportunity; and 6) if the parties had anyagreement, express or tacit, on using such opportunities.  Cases applying thefactors tend to be fact-specific and provide only limited guidance for others.Courts have, however, followed one clear rule:  Fiduciaries may pursuesomething when they disclose the opportunity to the company and it expresslyallows the fiduciary to proceed, or if the corporation knew of the fiduciary'sactivities and did not take steps to halt them.Tackle the problem in advance.  Companies forming joint ventures shouldaddress opportunity conflicts at the outset.  Carefully define the businessthat the joint venture will address.  Consider including a precise descriptionof the venture's purpose in its corporate charter (this will render ultravires any activities outside the prescribed purpose and thus will settleconflicts by requiring a charter amendment before the venture can proceed).As a corollary, participants might enter into covenants not to compete withthe joint venture in its prescribed business.  Identify and allocate, inadvance, specific opportunities that might arise.  Determine in advance whatuse each participant can make of technology developed by the joint venture,perhaps through licensing and royalty arrangements.  Design a consentprocedure to be followed when opportunity problems arise.  Clarify howfiduciaries of both parent and venture will disclose opportunities, andexculpate them for disclosures made in accordance with the procedure.Partnerships and LLCs.  Partners owe a duty of loyalty to one another.  Courtsconsider factors similar to those considered for the corporate setting, butthey give particular weight to the partnership document itself.  Becausepartnerships are contractual in nature, partners have more latitude toestablish the boundaries of their duties to one another than the corporatesetting allows.  The opportunity doctrine also applies to limited liabilitycompanies.  Because this structure is relatively new, the parameters of thedoctrine's application to LLCs have not been defined and almost no case lawexists.  LLC venturers are well-advised to proceed under the assumption thatLLC members owe one another a duty of loyalty, similar to that in thecorporate and partnership settings.Editor's Note:  For a selection of books on joint ventures, see Bowne's newCatalog of Corporate and Securities Law Publications.

With firmsseeing the first real economic gains since the start of thedecade at least according to most of the key industrybenchmarks it stands to reason that administrators andmanaging partners were less apprehensive about approvinglarger pay hikes for support staff in 1996.     As LOMAR previously reported, salary increases for 1996were generally expected to stand in the range of 4%, withfirms of fewer than 500 employees likely to award 4.24%, andthose with 500 to 1,499 granting raises of about 4.04%. But asall law firm administrators and managing partners know, staffsalary increases don't always follow predictions.      Sharing the wealth. In 1995, for the most part,compensation increases for law firm support staff exceeded,and in many cases handsomely exceeded, cost-of-living hikes,according to the just-released 1995 Law Office Management &Administration Report (LOMAR)/Institute on Law Firm Management(ILFM) Compensation and Hourly Billing Survey. Across theboard, support staff, secretaries, and word processors faredbetter in the smaller firms than they did in the larger ones.In fact, secretaries and word processors fared least well inthe largest (75-plus attorney) firms (see partial Table 1below--complete version in printed newsletter only).     LOMAR's analysis of the data relating to a number of keylaw firm positions, including secretaries, word processors,and other support staff, reveals some interesting trends whichare described below:     Secretaries. In this category 1995 pay ranged from a lowof $19,000 to a high of $33,000, depending on firm size, yearsof experience, and reporting duties.     o Legal secretaries with less than three years'experience were hit the hardest in all size firms, with threesizes cutting their total compensation by as much as 17.4% andothers holding steady at 1994 pay levels.     o Those with more than three years of experience faredbetter, with three sizes of firms reporting increases (one byas much as 20%) and the other two holding steady.     o Across the board, secretaries who work for twoassociates earned less than those shared by a partner and anassociate, but the dual-associate secretaries reported ahigher percentage pay increase than did any other category ofsecretary.     o Secretaries who report to partners were paid the mostin large firms ($33,000), but were ompensated at nearly thesame level ($32,000) by firms with only two to eightattorneys.     Word processors. Pay for this position ranged from a lowof $22,000 at firms with two to eight attorneys to a high of$31,000 at firms with 75-plus lawyers. Firms that gave thisposition the largest hikes in 1995 were those with nine to 20lawyers (a 9.1% increase) and those with 41 to 74 attorneys(6.1%).     o Average salaries for word processors in the smallestsize firms, however, dropped substantially in 1995.     Other support staff. LOMAR's analysis of a few of themany positions reveals that accounting managers/controllers,for the most part, failed even to keep up with cost-of-livingincreases in 1995. The largest salary hike, given at firmswith 41 to 74 attorneys, was 6.3%. But other than that,increases hovered around 1% to 2%. In the case of firms withtwo to eight attorneys, the average salary droppedsubstantially.     o Pay hikes for switchboard operators/receptionistsranged from 0% to 25% (the latter, once again, in firms with41 to 74 attorneys). Pay levels for 1995 ranged from $18,000in firms with two to eight attorneys to $25,000 in firms with41 to 74 lawyers.     o Personnel director pay scales hovered in the$37,000-to-$40,000 area for smaller firms. However, those with41 or more attorneys earned $48,000 to $60,000. The LOMAR/ILFMsurvey did no year-to-year comparisons on this title, computerpositions, and several others because the sample size was notlarge enough (see Table 2 for positions with counts of lessthan 75--table available in print version only). Therefore, nopercentage differences are listed on Table 1.      Nonetheless, the size of the salary paid to those in thepersonnel administrator position does reveal that more lawfirms are recognizing the importance of this position for bothcontrolling costs and keeping the firm in compliance with thisincreasingly complex area of administration.     o As for automation personnel, in firms large enough tosupport a local area network (LAN) coordinator, pay rangedfrom $39,000 to $47,000.     In-house computer trainers were paid less thanreceptionists at the smaller firms, reflecting the fact thatmany of these posts now work part-time. Firms reported MISdirector pay scales from $30,000 to $65,000, with levelslargely tied to firm size.     Regional variations. The Pacific and South Atlanticregions generally paid their secretaries the most. Pacificfirms took top honors except for secretaries who are shared bytwo associates and those who serve a partner/associate/legalassistant team. In those instances, firms in the SouthAtlantic states paid the most.     Billing coordinators fared best in the Middle Atlanticstates, where firms paid$34,000. This contrasts sharply withthe Central and Plains states where they were more commonlypaid $22,000.

Few issues in today's law firm can spark as much raw emotion or portend real damage to the spirit of theorganization as partner compensation. While a few firms mayhave managed to devise systems that equitably reward allpartners, most are still struggling to strike that delicatebalance.     The Cyber Chapter members who took part in a recentAssociation of Legal Administrators' online forum viaCompuServe seemed all too aware of the many subtle pitfallsassociated with partner compensation. "Rewarding feegeneration alone tends to be divisive, works contrary tocollegiality, and doesn't properly reflect the contributionsthat are essential to the continuation and growth of thefirm," one participant asserted.     True, indeed. Just ask anyone who's followed the accountsleading up to the demise of Mudge Rose, which just months agovoted to dissolve after 126 years of existence. Surely mostobservers were surprised--to say the least--when The WallStreet Journal reported that the firm's demise wasprecipitated, in part, by an inability to reach consensus onwhether to retain "unproductive" partners and how best tocompensate "productive" members of the firm.      If Mudge Rose--which up until last year had earned enoughin gross revenues to regularly assume a spot on The AmericanLawyer's annual ranking of the nation's richest firms--couldn't hold it together, what does it mean to others copingwith similar issues relating to partner compensation?       "Giving and awarding credit for attorney origination isnot as easy as you would think," another administrator notedonline. "It is clear that when you bring in a client youshould get some credit for the origination, but how about theadditional tasks from that client that are created by the goodwork of another attorney?"      The same administrator continued: "Also, when you bringin a transactional client who has lots of small files, howlong does the originating attorney receive credit for theongoing shipment of small files, how do you factor credits....Does an attorney whose major role is origination [need] adifferent compensation plan? If you have advice, I'd love tosee it."      Exploring alternatives. Administrators and managingpartners are fully cognizant that no generic compensationsystem is perfect for every law firm. Partners will alwaysperceive inequities and partner compensation schemes are, forthe most part, driven by intangibles, like firm culture andpersonality. But, since some system is obviously necessary,examining the so-called model plans is a logical first step.      Outlined below is part of a compensation plan devised byJohn Iezzi, consultant and president of Richmond, Va.'s IezziManagement Group and a LOMAR contributor. While the samplingembodies the basics of Iezzi's plan, readers can receive afree copy of the complete Compensation Plan for Owners ofProfessional Service Firms and all applicable exhibits bycontacting the IOMA Fax Retrieval System at 212-244-0360 #250.Request Document #2 and it will be faxed to you immediately.Questions and comments on the specifics of the plan should bedirected to John Iezzi at P.O. Box 1711, Richmond, VA 23214-1711; 804-342-1206; Fax: 804-342-1209.     Iezzi's compensation plan is based on both objective andsubjective criteria. In addition to rewarding individualachievements based on attorney productivity and businessdevelopment, the plan also takes into account the activitiesand contributions that a partner makes to the good of the firmwhich may not be so easily quantifiable.     Since firm data can change regularly, it is suggestedthat once the plan is in effect, the information used in theformula should be based on a three-year moving average. Thus,until the three-year period can be determined, certainadjustments may have to be made to account for significantevents which occur during the year being reviewed. Adjustmentswill also need to be made for those owners who do not have athree-year history of activity on which to draw.      At the end of a 12-month period, (not necessarilycorresponding to the firm's accounting year), informationwould be generated on the total amount of working attorney andoriginating attorney credits assignable to each partner.      Iezzi's plan is based on three major criteria:     1. Working attorney credits. These are receipts (notbillable hours or billings) from work performed by theindividual partner. Working attorney points would be createdby determining the percentage that each partner's workingattorney credits bore to the working attorney credits of allthe other partners. Using an example of a firm with $2 millionin revenues, $933,500 came from the five partners. Partner Ahad $210,000 of the total, so received 22.5 compensationpoints.     2. Originating attorney credits. These are receipts(again not billable hours or billings) from work performed onall files that can be identified as having been originated bya particular partner. Figuring originating attorney points,again using the example of the $2 million firm: $1.9 millioncould be identified as having been originated by the currentgroup of five partners. In this case, Partner A was creditedfor $496,000 of the total, or 26.1 compensation points.     ln the above two situations, the points can be "weighted"based on the value that the firm perceives is attributable tothese factors. In this case, both the working credits and theoriginating credits have been given a factor of 1.0. There isno magic to this; they can be whatever the firm's partnersdecide. Thus, under this scenario, Partner A received 26.1originating attorney points.     3. Subjective criteria. This last group of factors isdeveloped to reward a partner's contributions to the firmoutside of the objective data. Elements to be consideredinclude firm management, associate training/mentoring,cooperativeness with staff and firm procedures, baractivities, community/civic activities, speaking andpublishing, financial management effectiveness (i.e., billingsmanagement), and technical skills.      Each partner submits a self-evaluation report which isreviewed by all the other partners or the compensationcommittee. The partners or the committee then grade theirother partners on these criteria, based on a 100-point total.     The criteria are individually weighted. The averages ofthe ratings are then used to determine the points attributableto this category. In the event the firm finds it difficult toallocate the 100 points to each partner for the subjectivecriteria, it could instead assign a value which could then beeasily translated into a percentage.     These values would then be weighted, totaled, and apercentage developed to establish the subjective element ofthe compensation plan, along with the working-attorney andoriginating-attorney components. The total points, afterapplication of the weighting factors, are then determined.     Special considerations. There are certain problems thatoccur with this type of system (all of which are alsodescribed in the full report). While none is insurmountable,each does need to be considered.      For instance, at some point, particularly for the larger,general practice firms, this type of plan may be inapplicable--specifically as it relates to the issue of originationcredits. Larger firms owe many of their new clients not to anyperson but to the firm as an institution which has built areputation that attracts clients. In addition, marketingprograms have changed to the point where teams rather thanindividuals are often responsible for obtaining new clients.      But no compensation plan is perfect nor can any respondto the totality of the compensation requirements in a firm.Iezzi's plan has been designed to recognize as many of theissues as possible, with the understanding that certainmodifications will need to be made before the finalpercentages can be developed.Back to Headline List CopyrightLAW OFFICE MANAGEMENT & ADMINISTRATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996Nine More Ways to Reduce Firm Costs in the New Year     Law firm administrators and managing partners areconstantly looking for new cost-control ideas, or at leastways to continue improving existing programs in the comingyear. Here are nine cost-control areas in which firms tellLOMAR they've had success:     1. Temporary staff. To get temps up and running asquickly as possible, one firm has developed a brief "TemporaryEmployee's Procedure Manual." It includes a simple officelayout, showing whose office is where; a brief style manualfor letters and other simple documents; details about how thefirm wants the phone answered; where supplies are located; thefirm's break policy; and several things that the firm does notwant the temp to do.     2. Health care costs. All firms have taken steps tocontrol these expenses in recent years. But it's interestingto note that a survey of human resource executives by Ernst &Young ranked the popularity of cost-cutting options asfollows: First, increasing employee contributions (26%);second, introducing a PPO (preferred provider organization)arrangement (17%); three options tied for third--adding aflexible benefits program, changing the insurancecarrier/administrator, and introducing POS (point-of-service)arrangements (9% each); sixth, adding an HMO (7%); andseventh, reducing benefits coverage (6%).     3. Faxes. Pitney Bowes suggests curbing high fax-relatedphone costs by buying a faster modem. About 70% of faxmachines are equipped with a 9.5 Kbp modem. A switch to a14.4-units (or faster, though reception times may interferewith the improvements) model would reduce the averagetransmission time of a five-page document by 64%. This couldcut phone costs by up to $1,450 per year per fax machine.     4. Firm brochures. Beware of too-low bids when lookingfor a typesetter and printer. Some typesetters will quote abreak-even price, and then charge for each correction, knowingfull well that they will profit enormously on the many changesthat law firms typically make. Printers may give you anextremely low quote, and then pull a "switcheroo" on the paperyou've selected, replacing it with a lower-quality stockthat's less expensive.      5. Cellular phones. Keith Fetridge of Aronson Fetridge &Weigle (Bethesda, Md.) suggests negotiating the cost of yourmonthly fee and the add-on services. Some providers willeliminate these fees for large users. It also pays to audityour monthly phone bills. Research concludes that up to 30%contain at least one error.     6. Online services. To control costs, limit the number ofstaff and attorneys who are given online access. And write anddistribute a policy that specifies that online services mustbe used only for purposes that benefit the firm or itsclients.      7. Staff management. Surprisingly, a quick staff meetingmay be less expensive than writing a memo. Studies show thatroutine memos are written once and then rewritten 4.2 times.And it typically takes 54 minutes to plan, compose, and editthe first draft alone.     8. Copiers. Saving money by purchasing less-expensivepaper can backfire by causing chronic paper jams. Most copiersare designed to handle 20-lb. bond paper that is uniform. Thecheaper the paper, the greater the variation (in stiffness,density, size, and so on) from sheet to sheet. Andinconsistencies lead to paper jams.     9. Lawyers' offices. Today's standard offices are smallerthan ever. According to architects, the optimum office forsenior partners is now 150 to 225 sq. ft. For partners, it's150 to 180 sq. ft. And for associates, it's just 100 to 150sq. ft.Back to Headline List CopyrightLAW OFFICE MANAGEMENT & ADMINISTRATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996What Can Law Firms Learn From Others About Marketing?     Chances are your firm's marketing staff is fully aware ofthe benefits of benchmarking and is already informally engagedin the process. Many are members of the National Law FirmMarketing Association or the Association of LegalAdministrators and have ample opportunity to share tactics atnational and local meetings.     Those firms that want to enhance their "casual"benchmarking efforts, however, must begin the ever-expandingquest to identify "best-in-class" organizations that haveachieved excellence in areas in which the firm too would liketo excel. And these don't have to be law firms. Otherprofessional service firms, corporations, even clients may behelpful in helping your firm's marketers and attorneys todevelop so-called external benchmarks.     Why are external benchmarks important? For starters,consider that without them, your firm's internally focusedmarketing team has access to few new ideas that can lead tocreative solutions. Without knowing what is outside, the focusof the team is limited and the results can be average at best.     Recognizing that external benchmarks can be useful to lawfirms trying to educate themselves about alternatives, arecent study, Benchmarking the Best Practices in ClientDevelopment, set out to compare the most effective initiativesused by law, accounting/management consulting, and otherprofessional services firms. The study's legal component--spearheaded by Julie Savarino, attorney and director ofDetroit's Business Development, Inc., was based onquestionnaires completed by 1,200 leading firms of all sizesin the U.S., Canada, England, and Australia. Follow-up phonecalls and focus groups were then conducted to identify some ofthe best practices used.     Key findings. The information is outlined below:     o Best practices. Participants reported that 10 types ofmarketing efforts yield positive results. They are:newsletters/bulletins; individual marketing plans; seminars;one-to-one communications; consulting services;industry/target/niche efforts; referrals; communityinvolvement; responding to proposals; and brochures. Most ofthe law firms queried, however, still rely on what Savarinoterms "first-generation" marketing efforts which include theuse of tools such as seminars, newsletters, and publicity.     Although accounting/management consulting and otherprofessional services firms gave industry/target/nichemarketing high marks, law firm respondents remainedunconvinced. According to the report, however, many law firmsplan to add industry-defined practice areas or groups to theirfirms' organizational structure (see Figures 1 and 2 on page3--bar charts available in printed version only).     o Marketing departments. Only half of the law firms thatresponded had dedicated marketing staff or an in-housemarketing department. By comparison, 70% ofaccounting/management consulting firms and more than 80% ofother professional services firms had in-house marketers.     And those law firms that do have marketers use them tosupport a larger number of professionals than doaccounting/management consulting and other professionalservices firms. Overall, the average marketing staff toprofessional ratio is 45 to 1; in law firms the average ratiois 65 to 1, the highest (see Figure 3 on page 3--printedversion only).     But half of all responding firms plan to increase thesize of their marketing departments in coming years, with mostadding coordinator/support staff-level professionals. Almostone-third of responding law firms plan to add sales/clientdevelopment professionals to their departments. About 45% ofresponding firms plan to maintain the size of their marketingdepartments.     Impediments to effective marketing. In law firms, thelack of commitment by attorneys was cited as an obstacle twiceas often as the corresponding professionals' level ofcommitment in accounting/management consulting and otherprofessional service firms. Asked what it would take toovercome marketing barriers, the respondents listed: greaterinvolvement of firm leadership; marketing training andeducation; monetary incentives; time management; use ofmarketing plans; creating marketing department efficiencies;and using marketing budgeting tools.

Back to Headline List CopyrightLAW OFFICE MANAGEMENT & ADMINISTRATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996Records and Files: The 'Status Quo' Can Be Expensive     Law firm administrators and managing partners putting thefinishing touches on their organizations' agendas for the NewYear will probably overlook one issue that's generally takenfor granted: records retention. But the hidden costsassociated with time wasted by staff searching for hard tofind files (not to mention the obvious legal implications andtheir potential costs) should prompt those firms that havebeen gathering client records and files for storage, movingrecords from partners' desks to the file cabinets, or keepingdocuments off-site indefinitely to make more frequent reviewsof their record-retention policies.     Where to begin? Statutes of limitations and state andgovernmental agency requirements vary from state to state, ofcourse, and firms must determine what requirements hold forthe states in which they practice--for client as well as firmrecords. In addition, the Association of Legal Administrators'minimum document retention guidelines provided in the sidebaron page 4 should prove useful as a starting point for firmsassessing their current policy.       Other considerations. While few firms employ full-timerecords-management personnel, most find it efficient to assignone person this additional responsibility, often withinpractice areas.      Although new records-management technology, e.g., opticaldisk imaging, may seem expensive, firms that have used itreport lower labor costs.      When it's time to move records off-site, firmadministrators can contact the Association of CommercialRecord Centers (ACRC), a nonprofit trade association for offsite information management companies.

As most willreadily attest, few in the law firm environment respectauthority simply because one demands it. On the contrary, manyof the "difficult" lawyers LOMAR knows respect those leaderswho consider their input before taking action.     Although there are no management courses entitled "LawFirm Listening 101," perhaps there should be. A recent studyby the American Management Association confirms that listeningis number one among the top 10 management activities. Andeight of the 10 activities involve attending to what otherssay. Providing a vision, giving direction, training others,conducting meetings, and communicating decisions, for example,all require a keen ear. Another management study found thatlistening takes up 53% of a typical executive's day, followedby reading (17%), speaking (26%), and writing (14%).     What issues have an adverse impact on communication inlaw firms? Managing partners and administrators queried byLOMAR indicate some common obstacles:     o "As a lawyer, my tendency is to do the same thing [inmanaging the firm] that I do when I'm trying a case, which isto reinforce a position," the managing partner of a midsizefirm confided. "We're all trained to do a kind of activelistening with witnesses which makes it difficult tocommunicate effectively at other times."     o A managing partner with a New York City-based firm, whoadmits that he is determined to build his listening skills,offered this observation: "When you're feeling stretched inall directions, taking the time to stop and listen can beextremely difficult. I do everything possible to put aside mypractice problems and talk, but still it's hard to do. I workat it, quite frankly, because that's my role as managingpartner."     Listening is an active art that involves two functions:Finding out what people know and finding out what they don'tknow. Although the latter is the more important skill, it isdifficult to cultivate. The key, say a majority of theadministrators and managing partners LOMAR interviewed, liesin listening between the lines--and above the cacophony ofother demands and practice-related stresses. (See the sidebarbelow for tips on enhancing others' perceptions of these firmleaders' power and authority.)     The consensus of those interviewed is that the strong,silent types who can lead their firms "through burningbuildings--and worse" tend to share the followingcharacteristics:     1. They find areas of common interest. This is not thesame as being a consensus-builder. As one lawyer in aSoutheast firm says, "Our managing partner asks a lot ofquestions, but he can process responses with incredible speed.He sifts through it all and assists us in identifying thechaff and the wheat."     2. They judge the content and overlook style. They don'ttune out the dull, laconic, or loquacious messengers or thedry, seemingly tedious topics of discussion. Instead, theyseek out whatever is of value to the group or the firm as awhole, no matter where it may originate.     "Our managing partner is quick to defend others who aresummarily shot down or ignored because of lack of presence,"one practitioner remarks. "He restates the good ideas fromtheir comments and enables us to focus on them in a way theoriginal speaker couldn't."     3. They hold their fire--even under attack. They don'targue or respond until they fully understand the objectionsthat have been made. And they never answer a question until itis fully asked. Confrontations are met with calm and reasonand followed up with rational points.      4. They look for and address breakdowns in communication."In my firm, probably like most, we had an unwritten policythat the administrator would handle staff problems and I wouldlook after the lawyers," the New York-based managing partnerexplains. "I know now that [the policy] actually worsened ourcommunications problem. You don't turn people away thatreadily. Now I ask, 'Why did you come to me instead of ouradministrator or your practice group leader, and what can I doto facilitate matters?'"      5. They don't fake attention. "We had one managingpartner who wanted to be 'powerful' but just came off as phonyand insincere with his overly solicitous manner," onepractitioner told LOMAR. "People know from your tone, bodylanguage, and so forth whether your interest is genuine."     6. They are open-minded and inquisitive. People tend toconstruct reality, so paying careful attention to theperceptions of others takes on added importance. The New Yorkpartner recounts the case, which he admits he could havehandled better, of a partner taken aback when a move to abranch office left him temporarily in an office without awindow.     "When you're dealing with lawyers, you know that ifyou're not careful an argument is always possible," he quips."I explained the mistake, but what I was saying was completelymisinterpreted, and I lost my temper." What could he have doneto defuse the problem? In the managing partner's mind, theissue was frivolous and he dismissed it summarily when activelistening, asking questions, and being more sensitive to thesituation  might have averted the confrontation.     In the end, if there's a benefit to being a "strong,silent type," it's that sooner or later, people start to payattention. Or, as many of the administrators and managingpartners that LOMAR interviewed concluded about their mostinfluential peers: When they speak, others listen.[-Five Communication Enhancers for Managing Partners andAdministrators-]     1. Identify your communications style. Some managingpartners and administrators communicate more effectivelythrough conversation and others through written communication.And some respond better to one form than the other. It alldepends on the individual. It's important to identify andunderstand how you are most effective.     2. Recognize varying styles. Everyone has a different wayof communicating. In addition to understanding your style,make an attempt to identify the recipients' without makingsnap judgments based on intangibles such as personality andappearance. Remember that law firms have a myriad ofpersonality types--from the silent ones and belligerenttyrants to the apple polishers and sensitive soldiers. Youcan't effectively communicate with each in the same manner.      3. Be consistent. Once you identify your style ofcommunicating, it will confuse your messages if you stray fromit. If you routinely go to others to discuss issues in person,don't start calling meetings in your office when minor mattersare involved. Use "unusual" communications techniques onlywhen all else fails.     4. Limit technological exchanges. With the proliferationof voice mail, e-mail, and telecommunications, many managingpartners and administrators have little incentive tocommunicate face-to-face. Try to strike a balance betweenpersonal contact and "impersonal" electronic conversationsthat may limit your ability to get information acrosseffectively. Routine communications--along the line of 'Ithought you might like to know'--might be made via phone or email, but crucial discussions should be conducted face-to-faceand in the listeners' environment.      5. Say it in person. It may be easier to give someone badnews or to criticize in writing, but such seriouscommunications must be issued in person. Follow up withwritten confirmation of what was said to avoidmisunderstandings. Written communication is most useful whenthe same message must be given to more than one person.(Source: Institute on Law Firm Management)Back to Headline List CopyrightLAW OFFICE MANAGEMENT & ADMINISTRATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996LOMAR Law Office Cost Index     Each month LOMAR updates its Law Office Cost Index formajor cities nationwide.

Pursue the matter. "Only once in my five  years with this firm have I received a review  [though] every year I prepare the form and send it  out. Last year the managing member walked into my  office, handed back the review, [and] said 'You want  a review, you're here aren't you? That's your  review,'" one administrator lamented. "I gave up.  After five years they finally got to me."         2. Apply gentle pressure. "At the same time as  everyone else's review and salary decisions, I would  provide partners with a document that detailed all  the things they said they wanted to accomplish over  the year and what was the result. The list was  primarily from the prior year's review and included  items that came up at partner meetings," explained  one administrator. "Also added to the list were  things that were by my own initiation.... I felt the  document worked for both the partners and myself  because they also had a list of things that I had  accomplished."         3. Put the process in motion_quickly. "I passed  out an evaluation form from the ALA and had all the  partners fill it out. It took me 90 days to get it  done," offered another law firm administrator who  had gone almost two years without an official  evaluation. "We did the basic accomplishments and  goals...they even interviewed staff to get their  opinion and gave me a great raise. The only thing  [the firm] didn't do was make the raise retroactive  back to my anniversary date like everyone else. What  I learned was to start 90 days in advance."         o Time to honor exceptional effort. The ABA's  Standing Committee on Lawyers' Public Service  Responsibilities is seeking nominations for its 1996  Pro Bono Publico Awards. Five awards will be  presented at the ABA's annual meeting in Orlando,  July 31-Aug. 4. For details on the nominating  process, contact Dorothy Jackson at 312-988-5766.  West Publishing (Eagan, Minn.) is also accepting  nominations for its Excellence in Private Law  Librarianship Award. Librarians who have  distinguished themselves in managing and providing  effective access to information are eligible for  consideration. For more information contact Todd  Daubenberger at 612-687-5638.         o Kudos to LOMAR's publisher. The Institute on  Management and Administration's (IOMA) Web site was  recently described by Inc. magazine as "by far the  best business-resource site we've ever seen," and  was cited by PC Week for its "comprehensive listing  of business information." For access, point to  http//www.ioma/com/ioma or e-mail Kathy Fitzgerald  at Kathie@ ingress.com for help.          o Remember client confidentiality when  outsourcing. Firms must make a reasonable effort to  ensure that the outside companies they retain know  when confidential material is involved, cautions a  recent opinion by the ABA's Standing Committee on  Ethics and Professional Responsibility. Formal  Opinion 95-398, issued in response to a request to  consider the implications of a firm's arrangement  with a maintenance company which had been given  access to client files on its local area network,  recommends setting up written agreements to prohibit  outside service providers from disclosing client  information they might see.          o Free help with new ERISA guidelines. The 1995  Guide to ERISA Reporting and Disclosure is being  offered by the Human Resource Advisory Group of  Coopers & Lybrand LLP to help those in search of the  latest information on ERISA's new reporting and  disclosure requirements. Copies are available free  of charge by contacting Coopers & Lybrand  Publications at 212-536-3257.         o Partners specializing in administrative law  command top dollar. And with their average annual  compensation of $237,714, these practitioners  outpaced their peers in other practice areas,  according to Altman Weil Pensa's 1995 Survey of Law  Firm Economics (Newtown Square, Pa.; 610-359-9900).         o New alternatives for NALFMA membership. In  response to recommendations that it review its  membership qualifications, benefits, and costs, the  National Law Firm Marketing Association (NALFMA;  Chicago, 312-245-1592) has added new "firm" and  "individual" membership categories. Firm membership  has its advantages. With this latest option, if a  marketer leaves a firm, his or her rights of NALFMA  membership are transferrable to the new  firm_assuming it continues to pay annual dues and  provides the association with written notice. In  addition, members of the same firm, regardless of  geographic location, may also join at a reduced  rate. Cost: $275 per year for the firm's member  representative and $150 for additional members. A  $50 initiation fee is assessed for each new member.           o LOMAR online.

Gonzalez of the SouthernDistrict of California on Sept. 22 dismissed the RICO-based classcomplaint lodged by nicotine patch users against the majorAmerican tobacco concerns, finding their nicotine addictionclaims to be, at bottom, for personal injury, and thereforeincompensable under the statute (Allman et al. v. Philip MorrisInc. et al., SD CA, No. 94-0504-IEG (CM).     The plaintiffs had argued that they were not seekingrecovery for injury to their person, such as for pain andsuffering, emotional distress or increased risk of cancer, butrather only for the money they were forced to spend to breaktheir addiction to cigarettes -- an addiction, they added, thatthe defendant tobacco companies caused.  They asserted that thesedamages constituted statutory injury to property.     "Although theoretically it is not always easy to distinguisha personal injury from an injury to property," Judge Gonzalezwrote, "for the purposes of bringing an action under RICO thecourts have been clear that even the economic consequences ofpersonal injuries are not compensable under RICO....     "[A]lthough plaintiffs characterize the injury as pecuniaryand thus an injury to their property," she continued, "the Courtis unable to ignore that the core injury alleged in the complaintis addiction to nicotine."  The judge noted that all courts facedwith the issue have recognized that expenses stemming frompersonal injury are not recoverable under RICO.  "Had Congressintended to create a federal treble damages remedy for casesinvolving such claims, it could have enacted a statute referringto injury generally, without any restrictive language," shewrote.     The judge found that the plaintiffs had cited to no casesthat allow recovery of medical expenses under RICO.  She alsorejected the claimants' argument that money is considered"property" under California law, and that expenditures fornicotine patches therefore constituted injury to property."[T]he Court will not adopt a state interpretation of 'property'that will contravene Congress' intent in enacting RICO," JudgeGonzalez stated.               The defendant tobacco companies' July 15 dismissal motionhad also asserted that the plaintiffs failed to allege that theywere injured by the use or investment of the money the companiessupposedly received from alleged racketeering conduct, asrequired under RICO Section 1962(a).  The plaintiffs had rejoinedin their Aug. 15 response that they adequately alleged injuryunder Section 1962(a) by asserting that the defendants'investment of the proceeds of their cigarettes sales, whichoccurred due to defendants' racketeering activity, caused injuryto the class.     The plaintiffs are represented by William S. Lerach, PatrickJ. Coughlin and Randi D. Weinberger of Milberg Weiss BershadHynes & Lerach in San Diego and by Melvyn I. Weiss and PatriciaHynes in the firm's New York office.     Counsel for the defendants include Maurice A. Leiter, AndrewC. Callari and Richard A.

Hospital Corp. of America. et al., 9th Cir., No. 92-17035).     Dr. Stuart Wyckoff, director of the adolescent psychiatriccare unit at Truckee Meadows Hospital, was among the parties suedby four former patients and their parents.  The plaintiffsalleged that Wyckoff and the hospital conspired to bill theirhealth care carriers for services that went unprovided, or wereinappropriate.     The U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada grantedsummary judgment to the defense, determining that the plaintiffslacked standing.  The lower court reasoned that the insurers, andnot the plaintiffs themselves, were injured by the fraudulentbilling.  The trial court further found that the plaintiffsfailed to show that they paid out any money of their own as aresult of the scheme.     In affirming, the Ninth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs'assertions of injury due to depletion of insurance benefits.  Oneparent asserted that he could have used some of the benefits forhimself; the panel rejoined that he had "not described a concretefinancial loss, but rather a speculative injury, contingent onactually seeking medical care for himself....  [S]peculativeinjuries to not serve to confer standing under RICO, unless theybecome concrete and actual."     Another parent claImed that he had to cover the entire billwhen his son was admitted to another facility because ofexhausted coverage.  "[P]roof of this payment would beinsufficient to confer RICO standing," the Ninth Circuit replied,"because it alone does not show that the payment was caused bythe alleged billing scheme..., as distinguished from some othercause."     While the record revealed direct payments made by two of thepatients to the hospital, the panel found that the record "doesnot reveal what these payments were for and there is noexplanation of how those charges were related to the allegedlyfraudulent overbilling scheme."     The Ninth Circuit also affirmed the lower court'sapplication of the same reasoning in granting summary judgment onthe Nevada state RICO allegations.     C.

TO HIGH CT.: CUSTOMER BILLING SCHEME DIDN'T INJURE COMPETITOR     The telecommunications company whose summary judgment on acompetitor's RICO claims was overturned by the Fourth Circuitlast March on Aug. 19 filed a petition for writ of certiorariwith the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the appellate panelimproperly found a causal link between the petitioner's allegedfraud on its customers and the injury claimed by the respondent(Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. et al. v. Mid AtlanticTelecom Inc., U.S. Sup. Ct., No. 94-319).     The petitioner Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. (neeLong Distance Services Inc.) and respondent Mid Atlantic TelecomInc. make wholesale purchases of time on the transmission linesof common carriers and resell them to their customers.  After a1986 systems error caused the loss of a weekend's worth of dataconcerning customer use, LDS President Richard J. Ricecommissioned the drafting of a computer program that wouldrandomly pad the length of its customers' billable calls.     Mid Atlantic sued LDS and Rice in the District of Marylandin 1992, arguing that LDS continued to utilize the program evenafter its losses had been recouped.  Mid Atlantic asserted thatthe program enabled LDS to offer artificially lower rates, andthereby entice away Mid Atlantic's customers, when in fact it wasoverbilling said customers.  The plaintiff alleged to have lostrevenues from engaging in a pricing war, as well as customers.     The trial court granted summary judgment to LDS, finding noproximate cause linking the alleged conduct could not haveproximately caused the claimed injuries per the U.S. SupremeCourt's 1992 ruling in Holmes v. SIPC.  In reversing andremanding for further discovery, the Fourth Circuit noted thatthe complaint alleged Mid Atlantic's elimination as a competitoras an end goal of the alleged scheme.  The appellate panel statedthat its findings were consistent with Holmes, noting that MidAtlantic was not seeking to vindicate the rights of its ex-customers, and that Mid Atlantic's claimed injuries were notderivative of its ex-customers.     In its certiorari petition, LDS asserted that the underlyingpredicate acts alleged "are the use of the mails and wires tocommit a fraud....  These allegations, plainly, are directedexclusively toward the users of long distance service, thecustomers.  There are no allegations that LDS intended to deceiveMid Atlantic or that Mid Atlantic was defrauded by the fraudulentbilling practice."     Regardless of whether it intended this alleged fraud on thecustomers to also harm the respondent competitively, argued thepetitioner, Mid Atlantic's injury was not directly caused by thefraud.  "Mid Atlantic's injury is a byproduct, whether intendedor not, of the injury to the customers," LDS argued.     "RICO, as construed by this court, requires a cognizableconnection between the offending acts and the claimed injury,"the petitioner contended.  The respondent alleged that one of thepurposes of the scheme was to steal Mid Atlantic's customers; thepetitioner rejoined that "unfair competition of that nature,however unacceptable it is deemed under state law, is notprohibited by the federal mail fraud statute."               The petitioner asserted that "RICO does not, and wasnever intended to, prohibit anticompetitive conduct, even in its morevirulent forms, without more.  RICO was aimed at a differentevil."     Edgar N. James and Martha Walfoort of Guerrieri, Edmond &James, Washington, DC, submitted the certiorari petition onbehalf of Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. and Richard J.Rice.

First of America Bank Champion N.A., ND IL, No. 93 C3653).     The three plaintiffs had each purchased an auto financed viaa motor vehicle retail installment sales contract.  Each salescontract was immediately assigned to Champion.  The salescontracts' terms required the borrowers to keep the vehiclesinsured against loss or damage, and authorized Champion to obtainloss/damage insurance if the borrower failed to do so.  The costof any such "forced-placed" insurance would be charged to theborrowers' loan balance.     In their cases, the plaintiffs urged, Champion, withoutauthorization, procured insurance that would also cover anydefault on their loan obligations.  All three of the plaintiffshere refused to pay the extra premiums that were added to theirbalances due and all had their cars repossessed by the lender.Their claimed injuries included loss of their vehicles, injury totheir credit and the creation of fictitious indebtedness.     Champion never provided the borrowers with copies of theforced-placed policies, and nothing in the "certificate ofinsurance" transmitted to each plaintiff suggested that theinsurance also covered default.  The policies also coveredimposition of mechanic's liens on the collateral, and against theborrower absconding with or secreting the collateral.     The plaintiffs' complaint was grounded in RICO, the Truth inLending Act and numerous state counts.  Champion made multiplearguments in its bid to dismiss the RICO claim, including lack ofRICO "injury," lack of proximate causation, running of thestatute of limitations, failure to adequately plead fraud,failure to allege pattern, and immunity under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.     Judge Castillo disposed of the McCarran-Ferguson argumentfirst, concluding that the defendant's unauthorized procurementof coverage (and passing such costs along) was not part of the"business of insurance."  The judge found that this practice doesnot involve the transferring or spreading of Champion's risk, noris it an integral part of the policy relationship between carrierand policyholder.  Nor were the challenged practices limited toentities in the insurance industry, the court noted.     In addressing Champion's RICO standing arguments, the courtnoted that the lender "does not dispute that repossession ofplaintiffs' vehicles and payment of money for unauthorizedpremiums constitute compensable injuries under RICO."  The judgerejected Champion's contentions that the plaintiffs suffered noinjury because they did not pay the additional premiums.     He further rejected the lender's assertion that the carrepossessions were not proximately caused by its conduct.  Oneplaintiff had not paid any insurance premiums, much less theadded charges, Champion argued; another was in default for anamount beyond the premiums.  Judge Castillo found that thepresent record "does not permit a parcelling of charges [into]authorized and unauthorized components," and that the otherplaintiff could possibly "establish facts proving that Championwould not have repossessed his vehicle if not for the fact thathis outstanding balance was so great."     The judge rejected the lenders' contentions that theborrowers in fact benefited from the additional coverage, or thatthe coverage would not have been forced-placed but for theplaintiffs' failure to obtain their own insurance.  Theborrowers, the judge noted, did not complain about thedefendant's procurement of authorized insurance.     In turning to the time-bar argument, the court noted theplaintiffs' contentions that their claims accrued in February1993, when they obtained documents showing that Champion hadprocured the unauthorized insurance.  Champion asserted that theclaims began to run in 1988-1989, when the borrowers receivedtheir "certificates of insurance."     Judge Castillo refused to find that the certificates put theplaintiffs on notice.  "The statement that the certificate is acondensed version of the policy and that there are additionalterms and conditions does not suggest to the ordinary consumerthat there is coverage beyond that described in the certificate,"he wrote.     He also found that the plaintiffs' authorization in thecontracts did not void their ability to allege fraud.  Afterreviewing the documents, the judge refused to hold as a matter oflaw that they "authorized Champion to purchase insurance inaddition to that for damage or loss to the vehicles."     The court also found the pleadings to sufficiently allegepattern.  The allegations, noted the judge, satisfied therelatedness inquiry by claiming a course of conduct running atleast five years; the possibility of thousands of victims;similar injuries (repossession, overpayments); and multiplefraudulent uses of the mails.     Continuity was also demonstrated, found the judge, by theallegations that these were the lender's "normal ongoingpractices" and that such practices had occurred for severalyears.     The judge refused to dismiss the TILA claims as time-barredunder the statute's one-year limitations period, finding theplaintiffs to have sufficiently averred fraudulent concealment.The court also rejected the substantive TILA challenge.  JudgeCastillo found that if the default coverage was unauthorized,then the charges for the coverage would not constitute a chargefor actual unanticipated default, but a finance charge subject tothe statute.     The judge ordered the submission of a motion for classcertification by Sept. 1 and a defense response by Sept. 29.Back to Headline List CopyrightCIVIL RICO LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 199411TH CIR. ADOPTS PERSON/ENTERPRISE DISTINCTION IN REVISED OPINION     The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 19 modifiedits April 1994 ruling that permitted members of the UnitedSteelworkers of America to bring RICO claims against their unionand USX Corp. over a swap of labor concessions for perks to unionnegotiators.     While the modification did not invalidate the claims of theplaintiffs here, the 11th Circuit has ostensibly voided its 1982ruling in U.S. v. Hartley, which had rejected the commonly-heldrequirement that a defendant entity cannot be both a RICO"person" and "enterprise" under 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(c) (Cox etal. v. Administrator United States Steel & Carnegie et al., 11thCir., Nos. 91-7215, 92-6218).     The litigation, which was brought in the Northern Districtof Alabama by 38 former union employees of USX's Fairfield mill,stemmed from a 1983 collective bargaining agreement between USXand the union.  Leading the negotiations for the Steelworkerswere District 36 director Thermon Phillips and district sub-director E.B. Rich, both former USX employees.  As alleged,Phillips and Rich sought to have USX grant them (and other ex-USXemployee/union reps) retroactive leaves of absence, in order tobecome eligible for USX pensions.  The negotiators purportedlymade any labor concessions contingent on their receivingpensions.     The CBA that was struck contained considerable concessions,including the elimination of 500 jobs, the abolition of localworking conditions rules, and the dismissal of all pendinggrievances and complaints.  USX subsequently amended corporatepolicy to grant indefinite retroactive leaves of absence foremployees who had left to work for the union.     While Phillips, Rich and four other union reps (the"Fairfield Six") began receiving pension payments, no otherpotential beneficiaries under the policy change did.  Afterrumors of the Fairfield Six's arrangement surfaced, potentialbeneficiaries made demand on USX's pension fund.  USX, Rich andPhillips were ultimately convicted under 29 U.S.C. Section 186for their bargaining activities.     The Northern District of Alabama had granted summaryjudgment to the defense on the plaintiffs' RICO and LaborManagement Relations Act claims.  The trial court determined thatthe employees did not demonstrate any causal link between thenegotiations that led to the pension grandfathering and theirclaimed injuries.     The 11th Circuit reversed last April 5.  The paneldetermined the plaintiffs' RICO claims valid after exhaustivereview, finding that the employees had properly alleged patternand that a jury issue could be made that Rich and Phillips'pursuit of their self-interests resulted in some dollar amount ofconcessions in the CBA.  The appellate court also found that theplaintiffs could pursue arguments under theories of respondeatsuperior and aiding/abetting to establish the union's RICOliability for the negotiators' acts.  The defense soughtrehearing and rehearing en banc from the 11th Circuit.     While the panel rejected the defense petitions in all otherrespects, it altered the text of Section II.B.1.b.  In itsearlier ruling, the court had rejected USX's argument that itcould not be both a 1962(c) "person" and "enterprise" by simplyciting back to Hartley.  The revised portions of the opinionremoved all citations to Hartley.     The revised opinion found that the plaintiffs' claims did infact make a person/enterprise distinction.  "[T]he plaintiffshave alleged only that USX conducted the affairs of the FairfieldWorks, the Union, District 36 and the Fund through a pattern ofracketeering activity -- not that USX conducted its own affairsthrough a pattern of such activity."     The panel also determined that the pension fund was anenterprise distinct from USX.  "The pension fund has a separatecorporate existence; it is a nonprofit membership corporation.Its existence is not dependent upon USX....  Although both USXand its employees have a role in the pension fund, the role ofeach is distinct from the respective role each has in thecorporation itself."     The amendments also eliminated all reference to Hartley fromthe context of its vicarious liability overview atSection II.B.3.a.Back to Headline List CopyrightCIVIL RICO LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 19947TH CIR.: POWER TOOL DISPARAGEMENT CLAIMS FAIL TO PLEAD FRAUD     The Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 13affirmed the dismissal of the RICO-based trade disparagementclaims brought by a Taiwanese power tool maker and its Americandistributor against Makita Corp. and its subsidiaries, agreeingthat the averments of fraud fail to meet the particularityrequirements of FRCP 9(b) (Jepson Inc. et al. v. Makita Corp. etal., 7th Cir., No. 93-1606).     The action is rooted in an April 1988 complaint to theInternational Trade Commission by the defendants (collectively,"Makita") alleging that the distributor Jepson Inc. and some 30other parties had engaged in unfair trade practices with respectto the importation and marketing of Taiwan-made power tools.That August, the ITC began an investigation into possiblebreaches of the Tariff Act of 1930.     While the investigation ensued, Makita allegedly contactedJepson customers, apprising them of the ITC activity anddisparaging Jepson's products as low-quality, infringing goodsthat would be ordered removed from their shelves.  Makita alsoarranged the placement of stories in the trade press concerningthe investigation and predicting that Makita would prevail in thematter.  One story identified Jepson and the co-plaintiffmanufacturer Ko Shin Electric and Machinery Co. Ltd. as two ofthe companies that Makita was seeking to block.  In July 1989,the ITC found in favor of all but one of the companies named toMakita's complaint.     Jepson and Ko Shin filed a RICO complaint with the NorthernDistrict of Illinois in 1990, asserting that Makita's acts werepart of a conspiracy dating back to 1986 calculated to driveTaiwanese power tool manufacturers from the market.  Theplaintiffs alleged substantial sales losses over 1986-1990, alongwith erosion of market position, customer base, and potential forgrowth.  The plaintiffs sought a base recovery of $10 millionplus treble damages.     The trial court dismissed the action with prejudice onvarious grounds; the Seventh Circuit's affirmance focused on thelower court's FRCP 9(b) analysis.  With respect to the phonecalls and mailings to Jepson customers and the trade press, theNorthern District found the plaintiffs' allegations to "fail toprovide any indications of who made the communications or whenthey took place."               The lower court also determined that the plaintiffs'allegations were not within the scope of the wire and mail fraudstatutes.  As construed by the Seventh Circuit, the NorthernDistrict "thought that the gist of the alleged scheme -- todisparage Jepson's products and frighten away its customers --did not fall under the rubric of fraud."  While the statutes areconcerned with property rights, the plaintiffs "had notidentified  damage to a cognizable property interest."     The Seventh Circuit's analysis opened by finding"considerable persuasive force" to this latter argument.  Thepanel declined to address the issue at length, however, becauseit agreed with the lower court's 9(b) findings as grounds foraffirmance.  The panel found the allegations concerning thecommunications to Jepson's customers to be "the most glaringlydeficient....     "Although the amended complaint identifies the generalnature of the purported misrepresentations made to thesecustomers," the panel continued, "no detail beyond that issupplied."  The court found that there was no issue present as towhether the facts were in the sole possession of the defense."[E]ven if they learned of the contacts through other sources,"wrote the panel, "they have as much access as the defendants tothe customers who can flesh out the circumstances of the mailingsand wire communications involved."     While finding the allegations concerning the communicationswith the trade press "not flawed to the same degree," theappellate panel still found the complaint void of detailconcerning the content of any such communication.  From the faceof the articles that appeared in the trades, the Seventh Circuitwrote, "we detect only one or two statements that might becharacterized as misrepresentations."     The panel rejected the plaintiffs' allegations concerningthe article that implicated them in the ITC investigation.  "Wedo not see what is false or misleading about such a statement,"wrote the court.  "Jepson and Ko Shin were, so far as we candetermine, targets of Makita's complaint, and the complaint didseek an order of the kind described."     The court found the statements made by Makita's counsel tothe trades "fall within the range of opinions predictions thatparties and their attorneys routinely make while legalproceedings are underway."  The references made in the trades to"rip-offs" and "poor-quality copies" of Makita products did notrise to fraud, stated the panel; Makita did obtain a convictionagainst one manufacturer, indicating there were in fact inferiorcopies of their products in circulation.     "Labels like 'poor quality,' 'cheap,' and 'lookalike' may beoffensive to the companies whose products are being described,"the panel concluded, "but they are also inherently subjectiveexpressions that are ill-suited as the basis for mail and wirefraud claims."Back to Headline List CopyrightCIVIL RICO LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 19944TH CIR.: PTL SHARES ARE 'SECURITIES,' DEFENSE RICO WIN AFFIRMED     The Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 23overturned the directed verdict granted to Jim Bakker on thefederal securities fraud claims levied against him by a class ofsubscribers to "lifetime partnerships" in PTL, determining thatthe partnership interests constitute "securities" under federallaw.  The balance of the North Carolina federal court and jury'sfindings, including Bakker's liability for common law fraud andthe defense verdict on federal and state RICO claims, were upheld(Teague et al. v. Bakker et al., 4th Cir., Nos. 91-2101, 91-2120,91-2121, 91-2122).     The "partnerships" solicited by the former televangelist'sorganization between 1984-1987 promised benefits that includedannual lodging at PTL's Heritage Village theme park.  Bakker soldroughly 153,000 partnerships that included lodging benefits,raising at least $158 million.  The partnerships were oversold;most of the proposed additional facilities at the park wentunconstructed, and the partnership investments went to PTL'soperating expenses and the support of Bakker's lifestyle.  Mostmembers never received the promised lodging benefits.  Bakker wascriminally convicted for this conduct.     A class suit was lodged in late 1987 in the Western Districtof North Carolina, naming Bakker; PTL accountants Deloitte,Haskin & Sells; and various individual PTL principals.  Thecomplaint was grounded in federal and state securities law,federal and state RICO, the South Carolina Timeshare Act("SCTSA"), common law fraud and common law negligence.     The trial judge granted a directed verdict on the securitiesfraud claims, determining the partnership interests not to bestatutory "securities."  The jury determined Bakker to be liableon the common-law fraud count and found for the defense in allother respects.     In overturning the directed verdict on the securitiesclaims, the Fourth Circuit found that the case turned on thethird inquiry established by SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (U.S. Sup. Ct.1946) as to whether the partnerships are statutory "investmentcontracts, e.g. whether the investment was made "with anexpectation of profits 'solely' from the efforts of others."     The lower court found that the investors were attractedsolely to acquire lodging, and not for a financial return on theinvestment.  The appellate panel noted that PTL's promotionalmaterials "represented that the value of the privileges lifetimepartners would receive far exceeded the $1,000 LTP purchaseprice."  The court found that the defense representations "can beread to suggest that LTP purchasers would receive an economicbenefit in the form of discounted lodging privileges at PTLfacilities."     The defense pointed to the testimony of class members whostated that they purchased with personal use as their primarymotivation; the panel found such evidence "cannot be dispositivein the face of evidence that the promoter of the scheme inquestion marketed the scheme by emphasizing the potential forprofit."     The appellees contended that the partnerships are nottransferrable, and that the partners could therefore neverrealize capital appreciation.  The Fourth Circuit found there tobe record evidence that the partnerships could be transferred onan annual basis.     The panel affirmed the dismissal of the claims againstDeloitte, Haskin for aiding and abetting Bakker's alleged federalsecurities violations, finding this theory invalidated by theSupreme Court's 1994 opinion in Central Bank of Denver v. FirstInterstate Bank of Denver.  The panel found Central Bankpersuasive, if not dispositive, in affirming the rejection of theplaintiffs' comparable state counts.     The panel also agreed that the partnerships were not"vacation time sharing plans" for the purposes of the statetimeshare act.  The Fourth Circuit found no abuse of discretionby the court below in denying new trial on either the claimsagainst the accountants on the aiding and abetting of Bakker'scommon-law fraud, or on the plaintiffs' federal and state RICOclaims.     The plaintiffs had asserted on appeal that the jury wasimproperly allowed to decide if Bakker had committed the allegedRICO predicates.  They argued that Bakker's criminal convictionscollaterally estopped any such debate issue as to whether he hadcommitted the RICO predicates; the panel found that this argumenthad never been proffered below, and was inappropriate here.     The partners also argued that the RICO jury instructionswere flawed in three respects.  They asserted that theinstructions erroneously referred to RICO predicates as "crimes";the panel found this to be harmless error, as the trial court atno time imposed a "beyond reasonable doubt" proof burden.     The court had instructed the jury that the North CarolinaRICO statute requires proof beyond reasonable doubt.  Theplaintiffs found this proper with respect to Bakker's primaryviolation, but erroneous with respect to Deloitte, Haskin'saiding and abetting of the primary violation.  The panel foundharmless error here as well, because Bakker was exonerated on theprimary violation.               The plaintiffs lastly challenged the instructionconcerning 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(b).  They contended that theinstruction wrongly required the jury to find that Bakker acquired anequity ownership in the enterprise.  The court found that, in itsentirety, the instruction ultimately required a finding that Bakkerhad "actual day-to-day involvement in the management and operation ofPTL."     The panel rejected Bakker's appeal on the fraud count, aswell as the attempts of Deloitte, Haskin and Bakker aide David A.Taggart to recoup their costs from the plaintiffs.Back to Headline List CopyrightCIVIL RICO LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 1994ND CA DISMISSES SECURITIES FRAUD ACTION AGAINST OMNITRITION     Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong of the U.S. District Court forthe Northern District of California on July 25 dismissed asecurities action against Omnitrition International Inc. and itstop officials, finding that the company is not an illegal pyramidsales scheme as alleged by the plaintiffs  (In re OmnitritionInternational Inc. Securities Litigation, ND CA, MDL No. 965,No. C-92-4133-SBA).     Judge Armstrong granted a motion for summary judgment filedon May 11 by defendants Omnitrition, Jim Fobair, Roger Daley andCharles Ragus, holding that the structure of Omnitrition's systemdoes not lend itself to the definition of an illegal pyramidscheme.     "As a threshold matter," the judge said, "the participantsin the company, [Independent Marketing Agents], do not pay moneyto obtain sales and/or recruiting rights....  [T]here is nocharge for joining the company.  Once the application isapproved, the participant obtains the right to buy Omnitritionproducts at a 20% discount, and the right to sell Omnitritionproducts."     Plaintiffs in this action, individuals who obtaineddistributorships with Omnitrition between 1989 and 1992, filed acomplaint against the defendants alleging violations of federalsecurities laws, RICO and state fraud laws in the creation,promotion and marketing of Omnitrition and its distributorships.Omnitrition allegedly markets a line of health food products.However, plaintiffs claim that Omnitrition did not engage in orencourage retail sale of these products.  Rather, plaintiffsstate that Omnitrition actively recruited distributors of theproducts, who would in turn be encouraged to recruit moredistributors.     However, Judge Armstrong said the recruitment of others intoa program does not constitute a pyramid scheme, at least notuntil the recruits make any retail sales.     "More significantly," the judge said, "an IMA does notobtain the right to earn rewards for recruiting otherparticipants into the scheme that are unrelated to product sales.A participant in Omnitrition does not receive any payment orreward for merely recruiting others into the program.  These newrecruits must make retail sales.  If the recruiter has achieved asufficient sales volume to qualify for overrides and/or bonuses,and the new recruits make retail sales, the recruiter receives apayment from Omnitrition based upon a percentage of the retailsales of his downline.     "Thus," the judge said, "Omnitrition provides rewards forrecruiting participants that are directly related to productsales.  In fact, the reward is conditional on product sales, andthe amount of the award is based upon the amount of product salesthat occur."     Judge Armstrong also ruled that the defendants' allegedmisleading statements and omissions are not actionable under thefederal securities laws.  The judge cited the Ninth Circuit'sruling in In re Apple Computer Sec. Litig., 886 F.2d 1109, 1113(9th Cir. 1989).  In Apple, the appeals court said that aprojection or statement of belief contains at least threeimplicit factual assertions:  (1) that the statement is genuinelybelieved, (2) that there is a reasonable basis for that beliefand (3) that the speaker is not aware of any undisclosed factstending to seriously undermine the accuracy of the statement.  Aprojection or statement of belief may be actionable to the extentthat one of these implied factual assertions is inaccurate.     "Plaintiffs have challenged every statement [of thedefendants] on the ground that Omnitrition is a pyramid schemethat was destined to collapse, and that each defendant knew thisto be true," Judge Armstrong said.  "However,...Omnitrition doesnot meet the legal definition of an illegal pyramid sales scheme.Accordingly, plaintiffs' claims that Omnitrition is inherentlydestined to collapse are unsupportable.     "Moreover," the judge said, "defendants have each submitteddeclarations in which they maintain that they genuinely believedand continue to believe that every statement they made is true.Defendants have therefore met the first prong of the Apple test."     The judge also noted that each defendant testified that hehad a reasonable basis for believing the statements to be true."Plaintiffs have not forwarded any evidence or argumentsuggesting that defendants' bases for believing their statementsto be true were unreasonable, thus, defendants have met thesecond prong of the Apple test," she said.     "Finally," the judge said, "plaintiffs have not forwardedany evidence suggesting that any defendant was aware ofundisclosed facts tending to seriously undermine the accuracy ofeach statement.  Thus, the third prong of the Apple test is met."               In addition, Judge Armstrong found that theplaintiffs have not sufficiently proven their allegations that thedefendants engaged in RICO predicate acts.  "Plaintiffs maintain thatsince they have proven Omnitrition is a pyramid scheme, they need notprove specific intent," the judge said.  "However,...plaintiffs havefailed to demonstrate or otherwise establish a triable issue of factconcerning whether Omnitrition is a pyramid scheme.  As there isotherwise no evidence of specific intent on the part of thedefendants to defraud anyone, plaintiffs' RICO claims are fatallydeficient."Back to Headline List CopyrightCIVIL RICO LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 1994SD NY: BRIBERY ALLEGATIONS DON'T REQUIRE FRCP 9(b) REVIEW     U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan of the Southern Districtof New York on Aug. 17 refused to dismiss the RICO action broughtby CNBC Inc. against a commercial printer that it claimscorrupted an ex-employee into arranging inflated compensation forthe defendants' services.  The judge rejected the defense'scontentions that the alleged predicate acts of commercial briberymust be pleaded with FRCP 9(b) particularity (CNBC Inc. v.Alvarado et al., SD NY, No. 93 Civ. 2261 (JFK)).     The cable programmer alleged that in a period spanning 1989-1993, Avalon Group Associates Ltd. and its president, RobertAlvarado Jr., conspired with then-CNBC employee Joyce Gibney toembezzle from the plaintiff.  Over 1991-1993, Gibney receivedsome $111,000 in bribes and kickbacks to direct some $3 millionof CNBC business to the defendants, the plaintiff alleged; Gibneywas also supposedly named to Alvarado's will.     Gibney also purportedly gave the defendants insideinformation on CNBC's bidding process; the plaintiff alleged thatthis resulted the submission of falsely inflated invoices thatoverbilled for over $500,000.  The plaintiff seeks this amount,plus $100,000 for the loss of Gibney's loyal services and forcompensatory damages, plus an additional $2 million in punitives.The complaint listed 18 faxed communications as predicate acts ofwire fraud and also claimed the bribery of Gibney as a predicate.     In rejecting the defense's dismissal motion, the courtrejected Avalon's argument that the bribery allegations mustcomport with FRCP 9(b).  The defendants argued that the stricterstandard should apply, because the damage from the allegedbribery stemmed solely from the fraudulent invoices."[P]laintiff," the judge rejoined, "alleges that it was damagednot only by the invoices, but also by the loss of a loyalemployee."     The judge found the bribery allegations sufficiently pleadedunder the standard of FRCP 8(a).  The allegations of the fraudpredicates were determined to be sufficient under FRCP 9(b).While acknowledging that CNBC failed to specify the content ofeither the invoices or the faxes, the court noted that thedefendants and Gibney are the only persons with actual knowledgeas to their content.  Noting that the plaintiff will need furtherdiscovery, and had established motive and opportunity for fraud,the judge refused to dismiss.     Nathaniel H.

Leinenwebber of the NorthernDistrict of Illinois on Aug. 17 declined to dismiss the RICOfraud class claims lodged under 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(c) and (d)by a member of a consumer "power buying" club against the club'sorganizers and operators.  The plaintiff's allegations underSection 1962(a) were dismissed for failure to demonstrateinvestment injury (Crawford v. Payne et al., ND IL, No. 93 C7303).     Charlie Crawford lodged the instant suit against theoperators of the Combined Purchasing Association Inc. BuyersClub, which induced memberships by representing that it couldobtain merchandise at substantially below-retail prices.Memberships were solicited via at-home demonstrations and follow-up calls; the required membership fee was upwards of $1000.Crawford alleged that the defendants sought to reap these fees,while concurrently defeating the efforts of the members to obtainmerchandise at discount prices.     The plaintiff alleged three separate clusters of defendants:the individual "designers" who set up the overall enterprise; theindividual "operators" who implemented the scheme on a day-to-daybasis; and corporate defendants that acted in direct concert withthe designers.     In reviewing the defense's dismissal motion, the judge firstaddressed the assertion that Crawford's predicate fraudallegations failed to plead a scheme to defraud.  The court foundthat the tiers of operation alleged by the plaintiff, if proven,would "constitute an 'elaborate attempt at concealment.'"   Thejudge also found the defendants' sales pitches as alleged by theplaintiffs constituted "specific misrepresentations or half-truths." He also determined that the allegations demonstratedscienter and a sufficient link between the alleged fraud and theuse of the mails and wires.     In rejecting Crawford's 1962(a) count, Judge Leinenwebberfound him to be "in effect...claiming that defendants reinvestedracketeering proceeds into the entities it created to operate theBuyers Club."  The court cited to the Seventh Circuit's Aprilruling in Vicom v. Harbridge Merchant Services (see Civil RICOLR, April 1994, P. 9,484) for the principle that merereinvestment of proceeds, without proximate causation of injury,is insufficient to create 1962(a) standing.     The judge denied the defense's attempt to dismiss the1962(c) count, however.  He found the fraud allegations to bepleaded with sufficient FRCP 9(b) particularity, noting thatCrawford included a copy of the Buying Club sales pitchmaterials, and notified each defendant as to his role in thealleged fraud.  The court also determined the plaintiff to havesufficiently identified an enterprise comprised of the threeclusters of defendants.     Judge Leinenwebber further ruled that Crawford hadsufficiently alleged pattern.  The relationship prong wassatisfied, he found, as each prospective plaintiff was defraudedby the same misrepresentations.  The judge also noted that theBuyers' Club's activities are allegedly ongoing, and ruled thatopen-ended continuity was therefore established.     The judge found the conspiracy allegations under 1962(d)sufficiently pleaded.  He denied the defendants' bid to strikeany claims accruing prior to Dec. 3, 1989 (four years before thefiling of Crawford's suit), as time-barred.Back to Headline List CopyrightCIVIL RICO LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 19942ND CIR. PROPERLY FOUND NO DAMAGES, MILKENS ARGUE TO HIGH COURT     Michael and Lowell Milken on Aug. 17 responded to thecertiorari petition lodged by investors in the restructuring ofIvan Boesky & Co. whose federal securities and RICO claims weredenied by the Second Circuit, arguing that the appellate panelwas correct in finding the petitioners "had no damages in lightof their 100% recoupment (plus a profit)" (Commercial UnionAssurance Co. et al. v. Milken et al., U.S. Sup. Ct., No. 94-153).     In 1986, the plaintiff investors bought $10.5 million worthof partnership interests in Ivan F. Boesky & Co., L.P.  Theplaintiffs opted into the March 1987 lawsuit against Boesky anddebt underwriter Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; that suit wasamended in 1989 to name the Milkens, who had worked with Boeskyon the reorganization as principals of DBL, as defendants.     After the respondents were brought into suit, the investorsbegan to cash distributions from Boesky & Co.'s liquidationtrustee.  By April 1992, the petitioners had receiveddistributions totaling $12.047 million, or over 114% of theiroriginal investment.  The petitioners opted out of the March 1992global settlement that the Milkens arranged with Boeskyinvestors, and brought an amended complaint against therespondents.               The Milkens obtained summary judgment from the SouthernDistrict of New York in May 1993.  The trial court's finding offailure to plead compensable damages was affirmed last March bythe Second Circuit, which wrote that "damages as compensationunder RICO Section 1964(c) for injury to property must, under thefamiliar rule of law, place appellants in the same position theywould have been but for the illegal conduct.  Here, appellantshave already been placed in that position."     The investors asked for certiorari on July 15, arguing thatthe Second Circuit in effect resuscitated the "racketeeringinjury" requirement rejected by the high court in Sedima v. ImrexCo.  The petitioners asserted that under such reasoning, a RICOclaim for mail, wire or securities fraud "will not ripen untilall or part of its underlying investment is proved worthless andits damages are finally determined to be uncollectible."     In their response brief, the Milkens argued that theappellate panel's ruling "is fully consistent with the precedentsof this Court and other circuits, and raises no question ofconstitutional magnitude or national importance."     The respondents asserted that Sedima was "simply irrelevant"in the instant context.  "[T]he Sedima majority emphasized that aRICO plaintiff 'can only recover to the extent that he has beeninjured in his business or property by the conduct constitutingthe violation [emphasis added]," they argued.  "[P]etitionerssuffered no injury in their business or property, whether causedby the Milkens' alleged predicate acts or otherwise."     The Milkens further deemed the investors' uncertainty ofaccrual argument "a red herring.  The decision below did not evenreach the issue of when petitioners' purported RICO claimaccrued, much less the standard stated by petitioners."  Therespondents also rejected the petitioners' reliance on antitrustprecedent that holds a plaintiff damaged even when capital isrecovered.  Those cases, the Milkens argue, involve plaintiffsthat passed their overcharges along to their clients;"Petitioners here did not recover their alleged losses by'passing them on' to someone else."     The Milkens further argued that the investors' bid forattorneys' fees was never before the courts below, and improperlyraised on appeal.  The respondents asserted that the petitionerswere otherwise unentitled to fees, as they did not suffer a RICOinjury.     Mark A. Belnick, David L. Kornblau and Steven Pacht of Paul,Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, New York, submitted theresponse on behalf of Michael Milken.  Michael O. Finkelstein ofLord, Day & Lord, Barrett Smith, New York, submitted the responseon behalf of Lowell Milken.     George D.

Keenan of the Southern Districtof New York on Aug. 17 dismissed the RICO counts raised by twohealth insurance purchasers against Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shieldof New York for allegedly submitting fraudulent applications forrate increases to the state insurance department ("NYSID") over1990-1993, determining the alleged claims to be barred by thefiled rate doctrine (Fersco et al. v. Empire Blue Cross/BlueShield of New York et al., SD NY, No. 93 Civ. 4226 (JFK)).     In the years at issue, Judge Keenan noted, the defendantsobtained rate increases of no less than 13.7% and as much as25.5%.  The plaintiffs asserted that Empire obtained theseincreases through "an intentional scheme of deception andmisrepresentation."  Empire, they alleged, exaggerated itscommunity-rated losses, understated its experience-rated lossesand exaggerated the impact of competition from large commercialcarriers in its filings with state regulators.     In granting the defense's bid for summary judgment, JudgeKeenan looked to the Second Circuit's May ruling in Wegoland Ltd.v. NYNEX Corp. (see Civil RICO LR, May 1994, P. 9,578) in findingthe claims barred.  "There is no dispute that Empire is aregulated utility whose rates must be approved by a governingregulatory agency, the NYSID," he noted.     The plaintiffs' fraud allegations were "of little import,"the judge found, as Wegoland v. NYNEX expressly rejected a fraudexception to the filed rate doctrine.  The plaintiffs assertedthat they did not ask the court to engage in the rate-makingprocess, but only to ascertain whether the increases should havebeen granted at all.  The court rejoined that it could notdetermine "either the pervasiveness of the fraud or thereasonableness of the rates existing prior to the increasewithout a thorough understanding of the factors involved inascertaining a reasonable rate."     The judge rejected the plaintiffs' citation to County ofSuffolk v. LILCO (2nd Cir. 1990), noting that the Wegoland panelexpressly rejected the earlier ruling as a bar to the filed ratedoctrine in RICO suits against utilities.  He concluded that theplaintiffs "must pursue their claims through 'the propergovernment officials,' who may challenge these rates 'inappropriate circumstances.'"     Daniel W. Krasner, Fred T.

Investors Associates, Inc., et al., 11thCir., No. 93-5049).               The panel said that the defendants did not qualify asthird party beneficiaries because an intent to benefit them was notapparent from the construction of the arbitration agreement "in lightof all surrounding circumstances."     According to court documents, co-defendant MitchellGoldberg, as agent for co-defendant Investors Associates, Inc.(IAI), solicited plaintiff Don Taylor to buy and sell stock fromIAI.  On Jan. 6, 1992, Taylor purchased stock through IAI and,the next day, signed a client's agreement with Prudential-BacheSecurities, which was to serve as clearing broker in the tradingarrangement.     Taylor subsequently filed suit against IAI and Goldberg,alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934; Rule 10(b)(5); Section 12(2) of the Securities Actof 1933; RICO; Texas Blue Sky Law; Texas Business and CommerceCode; and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Act.  Thedefendants moved to stay proceedings and compel arbitration ordismiss the action.     The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texasconcluded that the defendants could not compel arbitration, andthe appeals court panel affirmed in a per curiam opinion, whichadopted the trial court's decision.     In his opinion below, U.S. District Judge William Justicefirst noted that the arbitration clause did not mention IAI orGoldberg by name or function, nor did those parties sign thedocument.  Judge Justice rejected the defendants' contention thatthey were included as parties to the pact through the use of"you" (referring to Prudential) in the client's agreement,because IAI allegedly supplied Taylor with the agreement.     Second, Judge Justice said that the intent of the parties tothe arbitration agreement was manifest -- to arbitrate claims byor against the clearing house concerning its handling of Taylor'saccount.  In addition, a letter from Prudential, explaining thatit was not Taylor's broker, but his broker's clearing firm, makesit clear that the defendants were independent from Prudential,said the judge.     Third, the defendants cannot rely on agency principles tosupport their argument that they are entitled to enforce thearbitration agreement, said the court.  Unlike the factsituations in the cases cited by the defendants, here, thedisputed transaction did not involve the liquidation of stockwhereby the clearing house's services were employed, which mightmake the clearing house a party to the suit, Judge Justice noted.No claims in the suit pertain to Prudential's or Taylor'saccounts there, he said, and, hence, there was no contingentright for the introducing broker to invoke the arbitrationagreement.               Finally, with respect to the defendants' third-partybeneficiary argument, the defendants are not mentioned in thearbitration agreement and no consent to arbitration with Goldbergor IAI may be implied based solely on the relationship betweenthe introducing broker and the clearing house, said the court.Back to Headline List WT03-B07-25IA087-000634-B046-166http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/la27.html 205.156.212.5 19970122033031 text/html 79796HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 03:28:04 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:57 GMTContent-length: 79609Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/la27.html Sample Issue Copyright CORPORATE OFFICERS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNet January 3, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES DE HIGH CT.

SAYS APPRAISALRIGHTLY BARRED IN WRITTENCONSENT TIME WARNER MERGER     If the "market out" exception would otherwise apply, thefact that a merger is accomplished through the use of writtenconsents instead of a shareholder meeting is irrelevant, so anobjecting shareholder had no appraisal rights when he dissentedfrom the much litigated merger of Warner Communications, Inc.into Time Warner Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court decided Dec. 18in an issue of first impression.  Klotz v. Warner Communications,Inc. et al., No. 222-95, (DE Sup. Ct.); see Corporate Officers &Directors LR, June 7, 1995.     The high court panel disagreed with the dissentingshareholder's argument that equated merger by written approvalwith short-form mergers under Section 253 of the Delaware GeneralCorporate Law.     After the Delaware Supreme Court upheld the dismissal ofParamount Communications, Inc.'s challenge to the Time-Warnerdeal, the merger was accomplished in a two-step process:  first,Time purchased 100 million shares of Warner common stock to giveTime Warner, Inc. " as Time was then renamed " a 59.3% control ofWarner's outstanding shares.  Warner and Time Warner thenapproved a merger agreement by written consent without a meetingof the stockholders, who were informed that they were notentitled to appraisal rights under the "market out" exception toSection 262(b)(1) of the DGCL.     Plaintiff Howard Klotz filed suit claiming that thatinstruction is misleading since mergers approved by writtenconsent cannot fall within the market out exception.  Accordingto Klotz's reading of the statute, stockholders are entitled tovote at the shareholders' meeting to act upon the agreement, orelse they get appraisal rights.  He said the procedure forperfecting appraisal rights assumes that mergers approved bywritten consent always trigger appraisal rights.     The court agreed with defendant Warner's contention that theentire lawsuit relies on a strained reading of Section 262 thatcannot be reconciled with the plain meaning for the statutorylanguage.  "Section 262(b)(1) denies appraisal rights for sharesof 'stock, which, at the record date fixed to determine thestockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at themeeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger orconsolidation, were traded in a public market,'" the court wrote."An action taken by written consent has a record date, which cansubstitute for the stockholders meeting for purposes of Section262(b)(1)."     Section 262(b) unambiguously describes two circumstancesunder which the market out exception does not apply, the courtsaid.  "First, Section 262 restores appraisal rights denied bySection 262(b)(1) when stockholders receive consideration thatdoes not meet the requirements enumerated in Section Section262(b)(2)(a)-(d).  Second, Section 262(b)(3) assures appraisalrights to shares not owned by the parent corporation in allmergers pursuant to 8 Del.C. Section 253."     On appeal to the state Supreme Court, a panel led by JusticeJoseph Walsh agreed with the lower court's reasoning.  JusticeWalsh noted that the structure of the applicable subsection ofSection 262 places the market out exceptions in separateparagraphs.  "Had the drafters intended to provide an additionalexception, they likely would have also included it in a separateparagraph," but "...the exception proposed by Klotz is in thesame sentence which defines the market out."     The panel was not persuaded by Klotz's argument equatingshort-form mergers under Section 253 of the DGCL with mergers bywritten approval.  "The General Assembly provided in anadditional paragraph that shareholders of a company that wasmerged pursuant to Section 253 are entitled to appraisal," but"despite other similarities between the short-form mergerprocedure and merger approval by written consent, the lack ofsuch a paragraph granting appraisal in the latter circumstance isa crucial difference," Justice Walsh wrote.     Finally, no policy objectives would be served by adoptingKlotz's interpretation, the panel held.     The plaintiff is represented by Pamela Tikellis ofChimicles, Jacobsen & Tikellis in Wilmington, and by DanielKrasner and Edward Dietrich of Wolf, Haldenstein, Adler, Freeman& Herz in New York City.

In the Matter of RussellM. Jedinak and In the Matter of Rebecca Manley Jedinak, Nos. SF-95-023 and SF-95-024 (OTS).     Russell and Rebecca Jedinak, the former officials of failedGuardian Savings and Loan in Huntington Beach, CA, agreed to therestitution in consent orders with OTS and a concurrentlyexecuted settlement agreement with the Resolution Trust Corp.(RTC).  The couple paid the $8.5 million restitution to the RTCas receiver for Guardian.     OTS accused the two of multiple offenses including breach ofduty, conflict of interest, unsafe and unsound conduct thatcaused substantial loss to the thrift, and violation of bankinglaws and regulations.  In consenting to the orders, the Jedinaksneither admitted nor denied the OTS charges.     Guardian, with assets of $682 million, was placed inconservatorship in June 1991 and subsequently into receivershipsix months later.  The Jedinaks were removed from their positionswith the institution under the terms of a 1991 cease and desistconsent order.     The OTS accused the Jedinaks of violating their fiduciaryduty by having the thrift provide them with credit at no interestor at artificially low interest rates.  The OTS said the breachof duty allegations extended to a number of personal trips theJedinaks billed the thrift for as well as the cost of maintainingtheir personal property.     In addition, the OTS said the Jedinaks did not adequatelyunderwrite the origination and modification of several large realestate loans, causing a substantial loss to Guardian.  TheJedinaks also personally benefited from several loans, the OTSsaid.     The OTS further claimed that the Jedinaks did not haveGuardian provide a reserve for certain loan losses and failed toperform due diligence on certain asset acquisitions andcommercial loans.  The OTS also claimed that the Jedinaks hadGuardian pay an unauthorized dividend that was unsafe and unsoundand then had the thrift misreport its financial condition in itsbooks and records.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE OFFICERS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996ONLY TRUSTEE CAN ASSERTALTER EGO CLAIMS AGAINSTPRINCIPALS, SAYS NC COURT               A creditor cannot pursue alter ego claims against a debtor'salleged controllers unless the bankruptcy trustee has abandonedthe claims, a federal judge in North Carolina held Nov. 30,dismissing derivative charges of unfair and deceptive tradepractices against third parties who allegedly controlled abankrupt corporation to avoid personal liability.Trans-Continental Meats Inc. v. Shaw Food Services Inc. et al.,No. 5:94-CV-875-BO (ED NC).     The right to sue the defendants under an alter ego theoryvests exclusively in the trustee, not in a creditor, where statelaw provides that such a claim belongs to a debtor corporation,the judge said.     North/South Meatpackers Inc. bought products fromTrans-Continental Meats but failed to pay for them.  Aninvoluntary Chapter 7 petition was filed against North/South inthe U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of NorthCarolina.  Trans-Continental then filed a U.S. District Courtcomplaint against four individuals and three companies thatallegedly controlled North/South.  The defendants moved todismiss for lack of standing.     Judge Terrence W. Boyle granted the defense motion and saidTrans-Continental cannot reassert its claims unless they areabandoned by North/South's trustee.     The right to sue the defendants under an alter ego theoryvests exclusively in the trustee, not in a creditor, where statelaw provides that such a claim belongs to a debtor corporation,Judge Boyle said.  In this case, the trustee has decided topursue the claims through an adversary proceeding in bankruptcycourt, he noted.     In addition, he said, an identity-type alter ego actionarises from general injury to the creditors of a corporation thatlacks a separate and distinct corporate identity and operates asa mere shell.  Nor was there an allegation that the defendantsused North/South as an instrument to defraud Trans-Continental inparticular, he said, even if North/South was undercapitalized andcontrolled by the defendants to avoid liability.     As a result, he said, Trans-Continental's claims are deemedassets of the debtor's estate and subject to an automatic stay.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE OFFICERS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996TN CT. WILL NOT REHEARDECISION ON AMENDMENT TOSUIT AGAINST EX-DIRECTORS     In a Dec. 1 ruling, the Tennessee Court of Appeals rejectedthe plea of the ex-directors of a defunct insurance group toreconsider its decision that the Tennessee InsuranceCommissioner's breach of duty charges against them should nothave been dismissed without leave to amend the complaint.  UnitedPhysicians Insurance Risk Retention Group v. Belisomo et al.,No. 01-A-01-9595-CH-00189 (TN Ct. App.).     The ex-directors unsuccessfully argued that the appellatepanel permitted the addition of a bad faith allegation to a causeof action whose summary dismissal it has affirmed and addedissues and defendants after substantial discovery had beencompleted.     The action was brought by the office of the TennesseeCommissioner of Commerce and Insurance as liquidator/receiver forUnited Physicians Insurance Risk Retention Group to recoverdamages allegedly suffered by the company as a result ofmisconduct by the defendant directors.  The original complaintfiled in June 1993 charged that each of the defendant-appellees "John Fuhrman, Allan Gibofsky, Richard Goodman, Claude Moorman,Stewart Reuter, Daniel Shirey, Donald O'Sullivan, Richard Tyler,Michael Victor and Cyril Wecht " breached a fiduciary duty byabdicating their authority to the executive committee.     The trial court granted the appellee directors summaryjudgment after finding that plaintiff's second amended complaintdid not allege a breach of duty against them.     The appellate panel said the allegation that appelleesdelegated powers to an executive committee that may havecommitted acts of disloyalty does not assert disloyalty on thepart of appellees; therefore, the complaint was properlydismissed.     However, as to the denial of the motion to file an amendedcomplaint with specific charges of how the directors profitedfrom their actions allegedly to the detriment of the company, theappellate court said it "takes judicial knowledge that an outsidereceiver of a corporation is at a distinct disadvantage inefforts to discover the causes of insolvency including the searchof voluminous records and extensive discovery."  The orderdenying leave to file an amended complaint was vacated.     The ex-directors sought rehearing of the panel's decision toallow the filing of an amended complaint on grounds that thepanel's opinion (1) incorrectly states the material factsestablished by the evidence; (2) is in conflict with priordecisions and other principles of law; (3) overlooks ormisapprehends a material fact or proposition of law; and(4) relies upon matters of fact and law upon which the partieshave not been heard and that are open to reasonable dispute.     The proposed amended complaint that the panel allowed to befiled contains additional allegations that were not the subjectof the court's opinion, including a charge of bad faith stemmingfrom the breach of duty charge, which the panel previously ruledwas properly disposed of on summary judgment, the ex-boardmembers contend.  The opinion could permit plaintiff to presentnew allegations against new defendants and would necessitate thereopening of discovery, appellees aver.     The appellees also took issue with the panel'scharacterization of the Insurance Commissioner as being at adisadvantage in discovering the causes of the defunctcorporation's insolvency.     "Indeed, the various pleadings in the record reflect thatappellant has had not only the resources of the TennesseeDepartment of Commerce and Insurance, but also the legal servicesof two outside law firms from the outset," the ex-directorsmaintained.  "Here, whether or not 'an outside receiver of acorporation is at a distinct disadvantage in efforts to discoverthe causes of insolvency'...are not, as required for judicialnotice, facts so universally known, of such universal notoriety,and so generally understood that they are within the commonknowledge of every person."     The panel's ruling on rehearing made minor changes in theOct. 13 opinion but declined to reconsider the decision.

WHO WASN'T COUNSELNOT PROTECTED BY PRIVILEGE     Corporate documents that were prepared by an attorney whowas not acting as the company's counsel in anticipation oflitigation are not protected by the attorney-client or workproduct privileges, said Vice Chancellor Myron Steele in aDec. 15 ruling in Delaware Chancery Court.  Lee v. Engle,No. 13323 (DE Ch. Ct.); Frank v. Engle, No. 13284 (DE Ch. Ct.)     The memorandum opinion granted the discovery requests of theshareholder derivative plaintiffs and rejected the defendantdirectors' attempted use of the Illinois accountant-clientprivilege, but it found no reason to compel the production ofdraft versions of documents that were later filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission.     Richard Frank and Robert Lee brought separate actionsagainst certain officers and directors of several corporationsrelated to what is now Sunstates Corp., alleging waste ofcorporate assets and breach of duty.  (Frank's action alsocharged failure to pay dividends and violations of disclosureduty with regard to a proxy statement.)  The court consolidatedthe suits for discovery dispute purposes.     In deciding plaintiffs' motion to compel production ofdocuments withheld on the basis of privilege, the vice chancellorsaid the chancery court has followed the reasoning of Garner v.Wolfinbarger, 430 F.2d 1093 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401U.S. 974 (1971), which implies a three-part test to decidewhether the attorney-client privilege should be invoked:  (1) thenature and colorableness of the claim, (2) the necessity of andalternate access to the information, and (3) the extent to whichthe information is identified.     In this case, although much of the disputed information wasgenerated by Sunstates' secretary and vice president " who is anattorney " he was not the in-house counsel and was not acting aslegal counsel to Sunstates.  "Therefore, he cannot avail himselfof the protection associated with the attorney-client or the workproduct privilege," the court held.  However, the court addedthat even assuming that the officer acted as the company counsel,"[p]laintiffs have shown good cause necessitating production ofcertain withheld documents.  First, plaintiffs are minorityshareholders of Sunstates seeking information related totransactions they challenge as breaches of fiduciaryresponsibility."     Second, the court said, "[t]he withheld documents may leadto the discovery of information relevant to the transactionsplaintiffs contest as breaches of fiduciary duty.  Furthermore,these documents may be the best evidence of the facts theycontain which otherwise would be unavailable from any otherpractical source," the court wrote.  "Third, the record does notleave me with the impression plaintiffs' request for documentproduction constitutes a blind 'fishing expedition.'"     As to defendants' attempt to use the Illinois accountant-client privilege to protect some of the documents, the courtnoted that "Delaware does not recognize the accountant-clientprivilege; nor do the Federal Courts....  Nevertheless,defendants argue this court should apply Illinois law...becauseIllinois is the state with the most significant relationship tothe communications in issue.  I disagree."     Sunstates knowingly incorporated in Delaware, which"...constitutes a knowing and voluntary request for the widelyrecognized benefits and advantages flowing from the applicationof Delaware general corporate law...," the court pointed out."Besides, Illinois' only connection with Sunstates is thatIllinois accountants originally generated or received thedocuments defendants want to protect," it added.     However, the court found no reason to compel draft versionsof disclosure documents that the company intended for publicdisclosure.

A shareholder plaintiff was excused from making pre-suitdemand on the board of York Research Corp. by a Delaware statecourt judge who on Dec. 4 found that a majority of the boardlacked independence due to a dominant director/shareholder'sability to exert "considerable influence" over a swing votedirector.  Friedman v. Beningson et al., No. 12232 (DE Ch. Ct.).     In his memorandum opinion, Chancellor William T. Allenrejected a motion to dismiss breach of duty and insider tradingcharges from Delaware Chancery Court, finding that in order toallege lack of independence, it was not necessary to show thatthe swing vote director's continued employment and remunerationhinged solely on the whim of the controlling director.     At issue in the derivative suit by Irving Friedman was thedecision of York Research Corp. " a Delaware company thatdevelops, constructs and operates co-generation power plants " toissue interest-free loans to several of its directors andofficers so that they could buy large blocks of stock in thecompany.  According to the complaint, the directors and officersthen made false statements regarding revenue growth and futurebusiness prospects to inflate York's stock price and sold theirshares before announcing that revenues would be significantlybelow projections.     Friedman alleged that the defendant officers and directorsnot only misused corporate office but cost the company a $500,000settlement used to obtain the dismissal of shareholder securitiessuits in federal court in New York City.     After the suit was amended, defendants in July 1993 moved todismiss it for failure to make demand on the board beforeinitiating the action.  Friedman contended that he was excusedfrom making pre-suit demand because the majority of the threeboard members lacked both independence and disinterest.  He saiddefendant York director/president Robert Beningson was themastermind of the interest-free loan and insider trading schemeand that he exerted a controlling interest over board member JohnEllis through his control of his remuneration.     The court said it need only address the first prong of thetwo-prong test used in Aronson v. Lewis, DE Sup. 473 A.2d 805,814 (1984), i.e., whether plaintiff has alleged particularizedfacts creating a reasonable doubt whether those directors could,under the circumstances, exercise a judgment on the suit anddemand that would qualify for the deference of the businessjudgment rule.     "This inquiry may include the subject whether some or alldirectors are 'beholden' to or under the control, domination orstrong influence of a party with a material financial interest inthe transaction under attack, which interest is adverse to thatof the corporation," the court wrote.  "Such circumstances alonemay sometimes raise a reasonable doubt that directors in such asituation could exercise judgment on behalf of the corporationconcerning the transaction involving such dominant or influentialparty."     The court noted that the state Supreme Court held in Ralesv. Blasband, DE Sup. 634 A.2d 927, 936 (1993), that "although thedirector/officer's continued employment and remuneration did nothinge solely on his relations with the defendant directors, theofficial authority of the defendant directors 'placed them in aposition to exert considerable influence over the directorofficer.'"  Ellis's continued receipt of consulting fees,"...when considered in the context of the other facts alleged,represents a substantial interest subject to possible corporateretribution had he exercised judgment in a way displeasing to thefinancially interested shareholder/CEO," the court concluded.     The court also noted that Beningson's ties to York'sprincipal client empower him in relation to the other directors,"...since they must remain cognizant of and sensitive to hisability to affect York's business prospects."  The chancelloralso noted (1) the size of the loans " the loan to Beningson wasgreater than the company's net revenue that year; and (2) York'ssettlement of the federal class actions without any directorcontribution, despite the profits earned by Beningson.

REINSTATES SUITDESPITE FAILURE TO PRODUCEOFFICER FOR DISCOVERY     The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 reinstateda breach of contract complaint although the plaintiff repeatedlyfailed to produce an officer for depositions.  Roots Contractingand Trading Co. v. Creighton Ltd. et al., No. 94-5752 (6th Cir.).     The panel said if the suit is again dismissed, the trialcourt must provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or otherreasons to support the inference that Roots engaged in a courseof conduct to evade deposition and it must explain why lessersanctions were rejected.     Roots Contracting and Trading, a Qatari limited liabilitycompany, contracted for a joint venture with Creighton Ltd., aCayman Islands corporation headquartered in Nashville, to build agovernment-sponsored hospital in Qatar.  The Qatari governmentterminated the construction contract due to Creighton's workdeficiencies and delays.     Roots sued Creighton and other defendants in the MiddleDistrict of Tennessee for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,dissolution of the joint venture, breach of contract and anaccounting.     During the Persian Gulf War, two codefendants noticed theNashville deposition of Abdullah Hamad Al-Attiyah, who chairedRoots' board of directors and served as managing agent.  At thetime, Al-Attiyah was chief of the cabinet of the Qatari InteriorMinistry.     Roots opposed the deposition, contending Al-Attiyah wasmerely a passive minority shareholder who performed no managerialduties, received no salary and knew nothing about the company'sbusiness operations; Roots also said its general manager, who wasdeposed, had the same knowledge as Al-Attiyah about the hospitalproject.  However, the defendants offered evidence Al-Attiyah wasa policy maker and an operational factor in Roots.     Al-Attiyah failed repeatedly to appear.  Roots argued thatthe Qatari interior minister had refused to allow him to leavethe country; meanwhile, he rose to become minister of energy andindustry and president of OPEC.  Ultimately, Chief Judge John T.Nixon granted a defense motion to dismiss the complaint as adiscovery sanction.     The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded in a per curiamopinion.  Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizedismissal as a sanction for the refusal of an officer, directoror managing agent to provide discovery, this particular dismissalwas an abuse of discretion, the panel held.  Judge Nixon failedto articulate sufficient findings of fact to justify thesanction, it said.     If Judge Nixon again dismisses the complaint on remand, hemust provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or otherreasons for Roots' failure to produce Al-Attiyah to support theinference that Roots engaged in a course of conduct to evadedeposition.  Those findings also should explain why lessersanctions were rejected, it said.  In addition, it said thereshould be findings as to how the defendants would be prejudicedif they cannot depose Al-Attiyah in Nashville.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE OFFICERS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996HYPERION TRUST INVESTORSURGE SECOND CIRCUITTO REINSTATE THEIR SUIT     The plaintiffs in the Hyperion Securities Litigation arguedto the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Oct. 23 that thedistrict court erred in dismissing their suit over investmentlosses involving the Hyperion Trusts.  In re Hyperion SecuritiesLitigation, No. 93 Civ. 7179 (SD NY); see Corporate Officers &Directors Liability LR, Oct. 4, 1995.     T111plaintiffs, Marilyn Olkey and others, labeled as"without foundation" the district court's holding that, as amatter of law, the interest rate bias and risks to capital posedby the Trusts' investment strategy were adequately disclosed.The plaintiffs said the court focused "upon fragmented andisolated statements to reach that conclusion" and "completelydiscounted as mere 'expectations' defendants' repeatedrepresentations that they would design 'balanced' portfolios."The court ignored the crucial fact that the defendants never madesuch an effort, even though the prospectuses stated clearly thateach Trust "has designed the initial composition of the Trustportfolio and will manage the portfolio on an ongoing basis in anattempt to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates onthe net asset value of the portfolio."     This and similar representations of a balanced portfoliowere made through each prospectus, the plaintiffs said, but thedistrict court completely ignored the fact that investorsbargained for one thing but received something quite different.The plaintiff said the court ignored its duty under McMahan & Co.v. Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., 900 F.2d 576 (2nd Cir. 1990,cert. denied, 1991)[see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Oct.4, 1995, 18,274) to read the prospectus as a whole.  The courtalso disregarded its obligation to construe the complaint in themanner most favorable to the plaintiffs, they said.     The plaintiffs contended:  "In fact, the court drew allinferences, however strained, in defendants' favor.  The courtwound up with a conclusion that lacked any real worldsensibility:  investors knowingly invested in a low yield, highrisk investment."     The plaintiffs further argued that the various authoritiesrelied on by the district court provide no support for itsdecision.  "The 'bespeaks caution' doctrine mentioned by thecourt is only a new label for describing what a reasonableinvestor should have understood based upon the representationsmade," the plaintiffs said.  Moreover, they said, the decisionscited by the district court involve fact patterns far removedfrom this one.  Here, the plaintiffs said, conservative risk-adverse investors were told repeatedly that there would be anattempt to balance the portfolio to attempt to neutralize theimpact on capital of movements in interest rates.  In fact, theysaid, no such effort was made, and as a result, the defendants"destroyed much of the capital that had been placed with them."     The plaintiffs claim to have lost more than $325 million asa result of putting their money in securities offered by threeclosed-end investment companies known as the Hyperion Trusts.The Trusts' assets consisted of zero coupon securities,collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage-backedsecurities.  The defendants include the three Trusts; HyperionCapital Management (HCM), which served as investment advisor andadministrator for the Trusts; individuals who were officers anddirectors of the Trusts and of Hyperion Capital; and nineunderwriters that participated in the Hyperion offerings.     The district court ruled on July 12 that the plaintiffs haveno case because the offering materials disclosed both the Trusts'investment strategy and the attendant risk.  The second amendedcomplaint was dismissed without leave to replead.     The three defendant Trusts and four individual defendants "Rodman L. Drake, Garth Marston, Harry E. Petersen Jr. and Leo M.Walsh Jr. (collectively the Trust Defendants) " told the court ina Nov. 30 appellee brief that the plaintiffs have "no facts atall" that would warrant their "conclusory allegation" that theTrust managers, instead of constructing and managing eachportfolio so as to minimize the impact of changes in interestrates on the net asset value, intended to construct portfoliosthat would do well when interest rates rose and do disastrouslywhen interest rates fell.  The lack of a factual basis to supportthis contention, the Trust Defendants said, renders theplaintiffs' pleading deficient under First Nationwide Bank v.Gelt Funding Corp., 27 F.3d 763 (2nd Cir. 1994, cert. denied,1995).  In addition, the Trust Defendants said, the assertion is"inherently implausible."     The Trust Defendants said the plaintiffs' assertion is basedon the opinion of experts who looked at the list of securities inthe initial Trust portfolios.  "What methodology these expertsused to arrive at this conclusion, and what assumptions may havebeen, are matters that plaintiffs have steadfastly refused todisclose," the Trust Defendants said.     The Trust Defendants argued:  "The fact is that the taskplaintiffs claim their experts have performed " divining theTrust managers' long-term investment objectives from a scan ofthe first day's list of securities " is not capable of beingdone.  The initial securities list could change the next day orminute.  Indeed, the prospectuses themselves made painstakinglyclear that the managers would restructure the portfolios as oftenas necessary to react to changing economic conditions."     As for the plaintiffs' reliance on a Hyperion 1999 semi-annual report statement that the initial portfolio was designed"with a bias toward a rising interest rate environment," "thefact is," the Trust Defendants said, "that the Hyperion 1999prospectus (as well as the [Hyperion] 1997 and 2002 prospectuses)stated the same proposition."     The Trust Defendants said the plaintiffs' contention thatthe Trust prospectuses failed adequately to warn investors ofpossible capital losses "is simply divorced from the reality ofthese prospectuses, which issued such warnings again and again."     Hyperion Capital Management and five individual defendants "Lewis S. Ranieri, Kenneth C. Weiss, David R. Odenath Jr.,Patricia Sloan and Alan M. Mandel (collectively the HCMDefendants) " argued to the court in an appellee brief also filedNov. 30 that since the outset of this putative class action, theplaintiffs have drafted innumerable complaints, all in search ofa viable securities law claim.  The plaintiffs' quest, the HCMDefendants said, has been stymied by one major obstacle: theplaintiffs cannot identify a material misrepresentation by thedefendants because the prospectus for each trust disclosed everyrisk that the plaintiffs have asserted as the basis for theirclaims.     "Moreover," the HCM Defendants said, "the prospectusesdescribed those risks with clarity in the very circumstances thatcame to pass: a substantial decrease in interest rates thattriggered a large volume of mortgage prepayments."     The Underwriter Defendants argued in a brief, also filedNov. 30, that the district court properly held that theprospectuses fully disclosed all the relevant risks of investingin the Hyperion funds.     The Underwriters stated:  "Plaintiffs also complain of theselection and management of the Hyperion Funds' investmentportfolios subsequent to their initial public offerings.  As amatter of law the Underwriter Defendants bear no responsibilityfor the manner in which the Funds' post-offering portfolios weredesigned and managed after the initial public offerings; whatevercontinuing responsibilities there were belonged to the Funds,their managements and advisors after they obtained the proceedsfrom the initial public offerings."

Kidsco Inc. et al. v. The Learning Co. et al.,No. 95-733, (D DE).     In July, The Learning Co. (TLC), a Delaware corporation thatproduces and distributes educational personal computer softwareproducts, agreed to merge with Broderbund Software, Inc., aDelaware corporation that develops and distributes personalcomputer software for home, school and small businesses.  Threemonths later, SoftKey International, Inc. (SII), a producer ofchildren's educational software, launched a tender offer for TLCthrough its subsidiary Kidsco Inc., and a proxy campaign toreplace the TLC board with nominees who would dismantle thecompany's takeover defenses.     The TLC board, which had signed no-shop and good-bye feeagreements with Broderbund, declined to examine the SII offer butsecured a more favorable stock-swap exchange ratio fromBroderbund.  It told the shareholders that the synergy inherentin a merger with Broderbund offered greater long-term value.When SII began soliciting the backing of the minimum 10% of TLCshareholders in order to demand a special meeting at which itwould attempt to depose the board, the TLC board amended thecompany bylaws to the effect that SII's special meeting could notbe held until after the meeting at which the shareholders were tovote on the Broderbund offer.     Suits filed in Delaware Chancery Court by both SII and byshareholders Ernest Hack and Irving Kas, which were consolidated,charged that the directors breached their duty by failing toconsider the superior SII bid and asked the court to invalidatethe bylaw change.     In the federal suit, Kidsco and SII charged that TLCofficers and directors violated federal securities laws by "falseand misleading statements denigrating SoftKey's business,management and prospects in violation of Sections 14(a) and 14(e)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."     In numerous "roadshow" presentations to investors, TLCofficials have supplied false and incomplete information on thefinancial status of SII and on the prospects for a combinedSII/TLC entity, the suit claims.

Securities & Exchange Commission v. Lenfest andLenfest, No. 95-7597 (ED PA).

Nevertheless, he revealed theinformation to his wife, Marguerite, who was also an officer ofLiberty, and she instructed her son Chase to buy stock in eitherTCI or Liberty.     Two days after Chase bought large blocks of TCI stock forhis mother and himself, Bell Atlantic announced the merger plan,and TCI stock skyrocketed, the SEC claims.  On paper, theLenfests earned a profit of $120,750 on 35,000 shares.

In re MutualSavings Bank Securities Litigation, No. 95-CV-71590-DT (JudgeJohn Feikens) (ED MI, Southern Div.).     The defendants " Mutual Savings Bank and co-defendants "said the parties have worked on drafting a proposed protectiveorder but have run into two areas of disagreement.     The first area, the defendants said, involves their requestthat in addition to informing a nonparty (including an expertwitness) of the existence and nature of the protective order, anysuch person to whom confidential documents are shown should berequired to sign a written undertaking to abide by the order.The defendants said this will eliminate any later disputeregarding whether a person was or was not informed of theprovisions of the order, and the act of signing anacknowledgement should serve to reinforce the obligations imposedby the order.     The defendants said there is no reason for the plaintiffs'opposition to the signed acknowledgement because the orderproposed by the defendants would not require the plaintiffs tosubmit all the signed acknowledgements to defendants, i.e., theplaintiffs would not be required to disclose the identity ofpersons, such as potential expert witnesses, to whom theyprovided any confidential material unless an issue aroseregarding misuse of the information.  The defendants said:  "Therequirement of the signed acknowledgement is a reasonableprophylactic measure which imposes no material burden.  It shouldbe embodied in the protective order."     The defendants said the second area of disagreement relatesto the protection that will be given information included inconfidential documents when that information is recounted in orattached to a document filed with the court.  The defendants saidthey recognize that there is a distinction between theprotections afforded to the fruits of discovery and to materialsfiled with the court.  "Yet if plaintiffs can unilaterally fileconfidential material in the public court file," the defendantssaid, "any protection to which the information may be entitledwould be mooted."  The defendants said they request that theplaintiffs provide reasonable advance notice of an intention tofile such material, thereby giving the defendants the chance toseek relief from the court.  "If the requirement of advancenotice is burdensome," the defendants said, "an alternative wouldbe to permit the material to be filed under seal subject to theproducing party filing, within a specified short date, a motionto retain the material under seal."     In a Dec. 4 brief opposing the motion, the plaintiffs saidthe requirements proposed by the defendants would impose"unnecessary and undue burdens" on the plaintiffs in a situationwhere the defendants have not even attempted to meet theirinitial burden of establishing that such documents should betreated as confidential.     The defendants, the plaintiffs said, seek a provision thatwould require all class members and non-parties (includingconsultants and expert witnesses) to execute signedacknowledgments that they have received the proposed protectiveorder, prior to reviewing any documents that the defendants mayhave unilaterally designated as "confidential."     "Contrary to Defendants' assertion that this requirement isa reasonably prophylactic measure which imposes no materialburden on Plaintiffs," the court was told, "this provisioneffectively 'chills' Plaintiffs' ability to pursue and obtainrelevant discovery by (i) potentially subjecting every personshown a 'confidential' document to the jurisdiction of this courtthrough, vis-a-vis, their signed acknowledgement, and(ii) imposing an additional burden on Plaintiffs to obtain,maintain and produce, if required, all such acknowledgements."     Similarly, the plaintiffs contended, they object to theproposed provision that would require a party intending to file adocument unilaterally designed by defendants as "confidential" togive four business days notice to the opposing party of intent tofile, and file such document under seal.  The plaintiffs saidcase authority shows that a protective order that so restrictspublic disclosure, prior to a court finding that the informationsought warrants protection, is a prior restraint on the FirstAmendment right of expression.     (Copies of the plaintiffs' opposition brief and thedefendants' motion for a protective order are available fromAndrew Document Access Service.)     On Oct. 20, the parties stipulated that Count IV of thecomplaint, alleging negligent misrepresentation, should bedismissed without prejudice.     The litigation was initiated by three shareholders in MutualSavings Bank, who allege that the bank and its co-defendantsconcealed the risky nature of Mutual's investments, particularlythe interest rate-sensitive nature of investments in mortgage-backed derivatives.  The plaintiffs claim the defendants alsomisrepresented the success of the bank's new loan origination andloan service business and that the defendants artificiallyinflated the market price of the stock during the purported classperiod " Nov. 30, 1993, through Nov. 14, 1994.

Although company officials wrote a letter Jan. 30,1995, notifying shareholders that the company was experiencing"some software issues with regard to ease of use" of a mainproduct, it was not distributed until a later date, Pozzicharged.     In support of their original motion to dismiss, defendantsargued that the "bespeaks caution" doctrine adopted by the ThirdCircuit U.S. Court of Appeals compels dismissal because theuncertainties of software development were adequately disclosedby the company.  However, in his Dec. 1 opinion, the judge notedthat "even though Quad made certain cautionary statements aboutsoftware limitations and bugs (which it soft-pedalled bydescribing them as not unusual), it was simultaneously hiding theeffect of those problems on the company's business."     Defendants moved to reargue the decision, but plaintiffscountered that the complaint in J/H Real Estate Inc. v. Abramsonet al. (see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Dec. 20, 1995,P. 18,687), in which a class has been certified and allegationsof negligent misrepresentation have survived motions to dismiss,lacks the specificity contained in the charges against Quad, itspresident, one of the company's founders and its chief financialofficer.     Pozzi's allegations contain more detail than the complaintsustained in Abramson, plaintiffs assert. The need forindividualized proof of reliance should not direct trial courtstoward denying class certification, plaintiffs argued, addingseveral citations.  Defendants' efforts to induce the court to gooutside the pleading to analyze plaintiff's reliance isinappropriate in the context of a motion to dismiss and factuallyinaccurate, plaintiffs stated.     On Jan. 31, 1995, plaintiffs stated, defendants conducted ananalysts' conference and misinformed them regarding anysignificant functional problems with the company's software.  Atleast one stockbroker reiterated its recommendation to buy Quadstock based on that conference call, plaintiffs argued.  Pozzi'stestimony demonstrates that she relied on defendants' statementsmade to the broker, plaintiffs argued.     Defendants are represented by R. Nicholas Gimbel of thePhiladelphia firm of Klett Lieber Rooney & Schorling.     Plaintiffs are represented by Dennis J. Johnson ofHavertown, PA, and by Barbara Podell of the Philadelphia firm ofSavett Frutkin Podell & Ryan.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE OFFICERS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996RI BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMAGAINST GENERAL PARTNERSFAILS; DISCLOSURE ADEQUATE     Finding that defendant general partners made all thenecessary disclosures to the limited partners, a state courtjudge in Providence, RI, has rejected conversion and breach offiduciary duty claims by several limited partners against twogeneral partners who negotiated a sale of the partnership's onlyasset.  Epstein et al. v. Dimeo et al., No. 94-2368 (RI Super.Ct., Providence Cty.).     In 1978, the plaintiffs bought a limited partnership unit ina partnership that built, maintained and managed a housingdevelopment.  In 1991, the general partners notified the limitedpartners of a purchase offer.  Under the offer, the partnershipwould receive payment partly in cash and partly in a 15-yearunsecured nonrecourse note; in addition, the general partnerswould separately sell their management rights.     It took two years, repeated solicitations to the limitedpartners and modification of the offer before the generalpartners obtained the consent of the required two-thirds of the15 partnership units.     The plaintiffs filed a Superior Court complaint allegingbreach of the partnership agreement, violation of the RhodeIsland Limited Partnership Act, breach of fiduciary duty,conversion and unjust enrichment.     A defense motion for summary judgment was granted.  First,the court found no provision in the agreement or statute thatprohibited the general partners from accumulating the requiredconsents through repeated solicitations.     Next, it found no breach of fiduciary duty because thegeneral partners fully disclosed all material facts regarding thetransaction.  The letters sent to the limited partners clearlyindicated how the proceeds of the sale were to be allocated.     Third, the court rejected the plaintiffs' argument thatunanimous consent of the partnership units was required beforethe nonrecourse note could be distributed.  Acceptance of thenonrecourse note did not increase the limited partners' personalliability, so unanimous approval was not necessary, the courtsaid.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE OFFICERS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996MO COURT: PARTNERS CAN BESUED FOR INTERFERING WITHBUSINESS EXPECTATIONS     Two partners who made false financial-related statementsabout their other partners and their corporation to banks can besued for intentional interference with the corporation's businessexpectations, the Missouri Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 5.  21West Inc. et al. v. Meadowgreen Trails Inc. et al., No. 65978(MO Ct. App.).     In a unanimous decision, the panel said the defendants usedimproper tactics to safeguard their own economic interests.     The complex litigation involved Joe and Carol Layton, theirex-partners John and Ann Gorse and several interlockingcorporations involved in land development and home construction.Relations between the Laytons and the Gorses deteriorated,including a dispute over who would be officers of MeadowgreenTrails Inc., a development company of which each couple owned50%; the Gorses prevailed.     The Laytons and their corporation, 21 West, filed a petitionin equity to liquidate Meadowgreen and filed a notice of lispendens as to property owned by the company.  There also wereclaims against the Gorses individually.     The Laytons wrote to all financial institutions and banks inthe St. Louis phone book, objecting to any loans made toMeadowgreen or to the Gorses on behalf of Meadowgreen.  At leasttwo banks had prior dealings with the company, and one bank citedthe Laytons' letter in denying a $475,000 loan to Meadowgreen.     The Laytons and 21 West filed a petition in St. Louis CountyCircuit Court alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach ofcontract, unjust enrichment, misappropriation of corporate funds,intentional interference with business expectancies, liquidationand other causes of action.  Meadowgreen and the Gorsescounterclaimed, alleging tortious interference and other causesof action.     After a bench trial, Judge Herbert Lasky awarded the Laytons$1.582 million for their share of Meadowgreen.  At the same time,he offset that award in full for what he assessed the Laytons asowing Meadowgreen and the Gorses for intentional interference,breach of fiduciary duty and trespass.  He also ordered theLaytons to convey their interest in Meadowgreen to thecorporation.  Cross-appeals were filed.     The Court of Appeals, Eastern District, modified slightly inan opinion by Judge Gary Gaertner.     The panel upheld the offset, saying the trial judge coulddisregard the corporate entity where justice requires.  TheLaytons controlled and were sole shareholders, directors andofficers of one of the corporations that committed misconduct, itsaid.  In addition, it cited an exception to the generalrequirement for mutuality of parties in setoffs where there is noprejudice and where a setoff discharges a judgment against anonmutual party.     Next, it upheld the Laytons' liability for tortiousinterference, finding sufficient evidence that their letters tothe banks contained factual misrepresentations about Meadowgreenand that the Laytons used improper means to protect theirinterest in Meadowgreen.  There also was enough evidence ofMeadowgreen's valid business expectancy, which the Laytons knewabout, and of damages, it held.     The trial judge's decision was modified to make parts of theaward in favor of Meadowgreen rather than in favor of the Gorsesindividually.     On other issues, the court upheld the Laytons' liability forbreach of contract in connection with the sale of lots,prejudgment interest and unjust enrichment.  The Laytons'challenge to the award of contempt damages was dismissed becausethere was no attempt to execute on that order.     Counsel were Michael F. Roche and Thomas Cummings of St.Louis for the Laytons and John L. Gianoulakis and Lori J. Baskinsof St. Louis for Meadowgreen.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE OFFICERS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996NC JUDGE SAYS STATE COURTSHOULD DECIDE DIRECTORLIABILITY FOR DEFAMATION     A federal judge in North Carolina on Nov. 29 ruled that astate court should hear a defamation and emotional distress suitagainst Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) Inc., Rev. PatRobertson, the executive director of Christian Coalition andcorporate directors of CBN.  Peterson et al. v. Robertson et al.,No. 6:95CV00450 (MD NC).     The judge rejected a defense argument that one officer hadbeen fraudulently joined in an effort to avoid completediversity.     Mark Peterson was hired as a supervisor in a CBN subsidiarythat sold discount coupon books, long-distance phone service,vacation rentals and other consumer services.  He was promoted inNovember 1991 by Robertson to president of the subsidiary,American Benefits Plus, but was fired in December 1992 when thedirectors became concerned about finances and customercomplaints.     Critical comments about Peterson were made in an August 1993press release from Robertson, in a September 1994 "Prime TimeLive" interview with Ralph Reed, executive director ofRobertson's Christian Coalition, and in a September 1994 letterfrom CBN to "Prime Time Live"; the comments referred toPeterson's business operations and alleged theft of donor listsand documents for personal profit.     A complaint was filed in state court against CBN, Reed, thedirectors and Robertson, alleging defamation, emotional distressand loss of consortium.  The defense removed the case to theMiddle District of North Carolina, asserting that director PaulA. Holcombe Jr. was a North Carolina resident who had beenfraudulently joined as a defendant to defeat diversity.     Judge James A. Beaty Jr. granted Peterson's motion to remandto state court, finding a lack of complete diversity.  Holcombewas not fraudulently joined, and it is possible for Peterson toprevail against him on the merits in state court, the judge held.Holcombe belonged to the board from September 1993 to March 1995and can be held liable for corporate acts or breach of hisstatutory duty during that period.     The complaint adequately pled facts in support of Peterson'sdefamation claim against Holcombe based on statements by Reed andthe letter from Robertson and CBN to "Prime Time Live," allegedlyauthorized and ratified during Holcombe's tenure on the board,Judge Beaty said.     As for defense arguments that Holcombe is immune from suitunder Virginia law as a director of a tax-exempt corporation, thejudge found a material factual issue as to whether Holcombe wascompensated for his services and whether CBN is tax-exempt.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE OFFICERS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996BANK OWNER WAS NOT'UNJUSTLY ENRICHED,'SUP. CT. RESPONDENT SAYS     Robert D. Rapaport, a majority shareholder in Great LifeSavings Association, should not be liable under 12 U.S.C. Section1818(b)(6)(A) for failing to honor the bank's net worth agreementbecause the government produced no evidence that he was "unjustlyenriched" in the process, Rapaport argued in a Dec. 11 briefopposing a U.S. Supreme Court certiorari petition filed lastmonth by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).  U.S. Dept. ofthe Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision v. Rapaport, No. 95-738 (U.S.) see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Nov. 16, 1994.     Rapaport had personally guaranteed Great Life's net worth bysigning a net worth maintenance agreement with OTS.  However, herefused to pay the agreed-upon monies when the bank's fundsdropped below minimum federal levels.     "[Section] 1818(b)(6)(A) requires evidence of unjustenrichment " a personal benefit, something more than a failure tomake a monetary payment under contracts " as a prerequisite tothe recovery of money in an administrative proceeding," Rapaportargued.     In 1984, Great Life was seeking federal depositorsinsurance.  The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which was latersucceeded by OTS, approved Great Life's application for insurancewith one caveat " Rapaport, who owned 70% of the bank's stock,was required to guarantee the bank's net worth.     The bank's net worth, however, dipped below minimum federallevels and in 1989 the OTS notified Rapaport that he wasobligated to shore up the bank's weak financial condition.Rapaport failed to make the requested payments and the followingyear OTS filed an administrative proceeding to collect the money.     In 1993, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found Rapaportliable for violating the agreement.  The OTS acting directoraffirmed the ALJ's decision, finding that Rapaport's failure tohonor the agreement had unjustly enriched him under Section1818(b)(6)(A).  The acting director said that Rapaport had beenunjustly enriched by retaining the money he had promised to pay.     The District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, inreversing the OTS decision, said that a definition of "unjustenrichment" was limited to personal benefit under common lawtorts.  Under this reading, the D.C. Circuit found thatRapaport's failure to pay did not evidence that he had gainedpersonally.  The OTS filed for certiorari.     "OTS cannot show unjust enrichment in this case, becauseRespondent reaped no personal benefit," Rapaport's oppositionbrief argues.  "If OTS has a remedy against Respondent, thatremedy lies in an Article III court, not in an administrativeforum.  To hold otherwise would be to give OTS an unfetteredpower to engage in administrative enforcement, and that is apower Congress never intended it to have."     Rapaport is represented by Frank J.

Alderman v. Securitiesand Exchange Commission, No. 95-70609 (9th Cir.).     "The use of NASD's power to sanction in this context exceedsthe power delegated to it by the Malone Act since it seeks toimpose sanctions over a person not engaged in the investmentbanking or securities business for his alleged failure to act inhis corporate capacity with a non-member private corporation,"according to the brief.     Daniel Joseph Alderman, an officer and director of Portland-based Peregrine Holdings Limited, focused his argument onallegations that the NASD had trammelled on state corporationslaw by imposing federal regulatory proceedings over a state-chartered, non-NASD member private business.     "The governance of internal corporate affairs [is] reservedunder the Constitution to state law," Alderman argued."Corporations such as Peregrine are creatures of state law andthe relationship created thereby are entrusted entirely to statelaw....  As a result, state laws govern the internal affairs ofprivate corporations and federal law shall not intrude into thoseinternal affairs."     According to the brief, this case stems from a check for$3,193.23 that was mistakenly deposited into a Peregrinecorporate account instead of into the account of a Peregrine-owned securities dealer, American Interstate Financial Corp.(AIFC).  Peregrine discovered the mistake and issued a check forthe full amount to the AIFC customer.     The NASD claimed that Alderman deliberately withheld paymentfor two whole months.  Alderman said the NASD allegation wasunsupported.     The deposit snafu eventually resulted in the filing of adisciplinary action against Alderman by the District BusinessConduct Committee (DBCC) of the NASD.  In addition to being anofficer and director, Alderman was Peregrine's executive vicepresident.  He was also a director of AIFC.  The DBCC foundAlderman to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of theNASD's Rules of Fair Practice.    Article III states:  "A member, in the conduct of hisbusiness, shall observe high standards of commercial honor andjust and equitable principles of trade."               According to the brief, the DBCC censured Alderman and finedhim $3,000.  Alderman sought review of the decision by the NASD'sNational Business Conduct Committee (NBCC), which affirmed theDBCC.     The $3,000 case found its way further up the appeals ladderwhen Alderman asked the Securities and Exchange Commission toreview the NBCC's finding.  The SEC affirmed.  Alderman appealedto the Ninth Circuit.      The brief, citing O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct.2048, 2053, 129 L.Ed.2d 76 (1994), argued that state law " notthe NASD " governs Alderman's actions as a Peregrine officer.Specifically, Alderman pointed out that ORS Chapter 60.371allowed Peregrine to delegate day-to-day operations of thecompany.  In this instance, responsibility for Peregrine's bankaccounts fell to a vice president for finance and not toAlderman, the brief argued.      "The standards to which directors are held are establishedby state law," Alderman argued.  "A director must be diligent andprudent in managing the corporation's affairs.  It is clearlyrecognized that the Board's responsibility is limited tooverseeing the operation."     Alderman is represented by Allan A. Fulsher of Portland, OR.The SEC is represented by Randall W.

(NASD)announced Nov. 7 that it has assessed fines totaling $258,000against Worthen Investments, Inc. of Little Rock and several ofits officers and registered representatives in connection withthe sale on bank premises of mutual funds containing risky,derivative instruments.  Worthen Investments, Inc. and RelatedCases, Complaint No. C05950057 (NASD Dist. 5, New Orleans).     Investors who bought the funds have filed suit againstWorthen and its new holding company, Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.The investors allege the mutual funds were falsely touted assafe, government-guaranteed investments.  Many of the mutual fundsales allegedly took place inside branches of Arkansas' Worthenbanks, which were acquired by Boatmen's earlier this year alongwith Worthen Investments.     NASD is the self-regulatory organization for The NASDAQStock Market and the over-the-counter securities markets.     NASD said that Worthen and all of the individualrespondents, without admitting or denying the allegations againstthem, consented to the NASD disciplinary action taken by theAssociation's New Orleans District Business Conduct Committee.     The respondents, NASD said, consented to findings that theymade, or caused to have been made, misleading statements to theircustomers about the characteristics and safety features of themutual fund investments at issue.  NASD said that in addition toconducting many of the mutual fund sales on bank premises,Worthen "failed and neglected to perform adequate due diligencein connection with the promotion and sale of certain mutual fundproducts."  NASD said that Worthen also failed to keep copies ofall customer correspondence and failed to establish and maintainan adequate supervisory system.     Worthen itself was censured and fined $200,000.  Inaddition, NASD said, Worthen agreed to a number of additionalsanctions, including a promise to conduct a complete audit of allinternal policies and an agreement to form an investmentcommittee to meet regularly to review the methods used by Worthenpersonnel to market all securities.  The committee is toespecially consider the suitability of sales literature topromote the sale of the securities, NASD said.  The results ofthe independent audit and investment committee reviews aresubject to NASD inspection.     Among the individuals sanctioned were Patrick D. Miller,Worthen's former president, and Frank M. McGibbony, Worthen'sexecutive vice president and former compliance officer.     NASD said Miller agreed to a $10,000 fine, a five-yearsuspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify in allcapacities.  NASD said Miller consented to findings that he boreresponsibility for misleading and inaccurate statements to publiccustomers.  Through written solicitations approved by Miller,NASD said, at least seven registered Worthen representatives sentmisleading sales correspondence to public customers thatmisstated the characteristics and safety features of mutual fundinvestments.  Miller also failed to supervise employees who usesuch correspondence, NASD said.     NASD said McGibbony agreed to a $5,000 fine, a 30-daysuspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify as aprincipal.  According to NASD, McGibbony consented to findingsthat he approved certain items of misleading sales correspondencethat misstated the safety features of the mutual funds.  Inaddition, NASD said, McGibbony failed to ensure that copies ofcustomer correspondence were properly maintained in the firm'sfiles and failed to establish an adequate supervisory system.     Higher fines were levied against the seven representativeswho were sanctioned.  Jamai W. Weber was fined the highestamount, $70,300, suspended in all capacities for three months,and required to requalify in all capacities.  Altogether, theseven representatives were fined $130,900.     Five individuals employed by Worthen Bank & Trust Co., whichwas the Worthen parent company, also were censured and fined.     NASD said that Boatmen's cooperated fully with theinvestigation "and promptly instituted new policies andprocedures at Worthen to assure compliance and to prevent futureviolations."

"TheSecurities Litigation Reform Act," H.R. 1058.  (See CorporateOfficers & Directors LR, Dec. 20, 1995).     H.R. 1058, The Securities Litigation Reform Act, makesnumerous changes that proponents say will cut down on frivolouslawsuits.  For example, safe harbors for forward-lookingstatements are strengthened, while damage awards for plaintiffinvestors are tightened.     Opponents of the Act, including trial lawyers, regulatorsand consumer groups, say the legislation gives companies too much"wiggle" room while, at the same time, increases risks for smallinvestors.  Under the Act, for example, companies are less liablefor their forward-looking statements and are under no duty tomake continuing projections.  These kinds of changes, however,have generally been applauded by high-technology companies.     The high-tech industry has complained that it is especiallyhard hit by frivolous lawsuits because of the unavoidablevolatility of their stock prices.     An entire section of the Act is reserved for "prevention ofabusive practices that forwent litigation."  The section includesthe elimination of bonus payments to named plaintiffs in classactions, restrictions on professional plaintiffs, disclosure ofsettlement terms to class members, and a prohibition against thepayment of referral fees by attorneys to brokers, dealers orassociated persons.     The Act also contains a break for accountants, who are oftennamed as co-defendants, by providing steps to follow fordisclosing wrongdoing and by limiting their liability in fraudcases.  The Act states, "No independent public accountant shallbe liable in a private action for any finding, conclusion, orstatement expressed in a report made pursuant to paragraph (3)[Notice To Commission; Response to Failure to Notify] or (4)[Report After Resignation]."Back to Headline List WT03-B07-26IA087-000634-B046-202http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/la24.html 205.156.212.5 19970122033100 text/html 55277HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 03:29:01 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:57 GMTContent-length: 55090Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/la24.html Sample Issue Copyright EAST EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES UZBEKISTAN WELCOMES FOREIGN INVESTORS (1877 words) COMING TO GRIPS WITH SLOVAKIA'S LANGUAGE LAWS (2001 words) NEWS MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE (12 words) ARMENIA SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH INDIA (12 words) LUKASHENKO APPROVES BELARUS PRIVATISATION PROGRAMME (8 words) DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT (15 words) ZHELEV SEEKS MEDIA RULING (23 words) PRIVATISATION PROGRAMME LAUNCHED (38 words) BANK STABILISATION APPROVED (10 words) LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESS STREAMLINED (68 words) GEORGIA AND EU SIGN AGREEMENT ON PARTNERSHIP (14 words) NEW INSURANCE ACT COMES INTO FORCE (10 words) REGISTER OF DEBTORS TO BE SET UP BY BANKS (18 words) POLAND'S FIRST SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE (11 words) DRAFT PRIVATISATION LAW DUE (23 words) PRESIDENT ILIESCU SIGNS RESTITUTION LAW (9 words) BANK PRIVATISATION DEBATE (14 words) TURKMENISTAN SIGNS DOUBLE TAX TREATY WITH IRAN (6 words) BULGARIA: NEW EXPORT RESTRICTIONS SET TO BE INTRODUCED (207 words) CZECH REPUBLIC: CHANGE IN REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPANIES (66 words) KAZAKHSTAN: EXCESS WAGE TAX REINSTATED BY GOVERNMENT (47 words) KAZAKHSTAN: MINIMUM WAGE REPLACED BY NEW INDEX (48 words) KAZAKHSTAN: THE REINTRODUCTION OF THE ROAD USE TAX (58 words) KAZAKHSTAN: CHANGES TO EMPLOYER SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTIONS (80 words) MOLDOVA: DEVELOPMENT OF SECURITIES MARKET AND STOCK EXCHANGE (2024 words) RUSSIA: REGISTRATION IN ST PETERSBURG (582 words) PRAGUE HIRING (40 words) CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996UZBEKISTAN WELCOMES FOREIGN INVESTORSUzbekistan has put in place a legal framework conducive to encouragingforeign investment. Elena Kirillova of McKenna & Co, London summarisesthe key aspects of Uzbek legislation which a potential investor willneed to consider.Uzbekistan is at the crossroads of Central Asia and a landlockedcountry completely surrounded by countries which are also landlocked.Despite its geographical position, since independence in 1991 itsrelative political and economic stability, coupled with thegovernment's encouragement of foreign investment has resulted in asteady increase in interest from foreign investors.The legal framework is a key factor in encouraging investment in anemerging market. In Uzbekistan, legislation has been changing to adaptto the post-Soviet market reforms.The Law On Foreign InvestmentsArticle 11 of the Law On Foreign Investment dated 5 May 1994 providesfor a legislative guarantee that where laws are passed adverselyaffecting foreign investment, "the laws in force on the day of initialinvestment shall be applicable to foreign investments for 10 years".This provision does not apply to "defence, national security, socialdisorder and environmental protection".This is an ambiguous provision, which can be interpreted as meaningthat such protection can be granted for a period less than 10 years. Inpractice, the government authorities in Uzbekistan are interpretingthis provision as applying for a 10 year period.A foreign investor's rights are "protected by law". Article 7 of theLaw provides that such protection is to be on "no less favourable termsthan those accorded to local entities". However, foreign investmentsmay be subject to expropriation in the case of "national calamities,accidents and epidemics".Compensation "adequate for the damages suffered" will be paid, althoughthe method for calculating this is not determined by existinglegislation.Financial regulations and taxArticle 13 of the Law contains guarantees allowing investors to"transfer abroad profits ... earned from legally authorised activities,without any restrictions".However, profits earned locally will not automatically be convertibleinto hard currency. Due to government policy and a shortage of hardcurrency, converting any significant amounts of local currency isextremely difficult. Investors' profits can be "reinvested ... or usedin any other manner at the proprietor's discretion".Accounts may be opened in any currency although the use of foreigncurrency is restricted. Cash payments are not allowed and there is a15% tax on gains from foreign currency sales.Goods and equipment imported for production purposes or the personalneeds of foreign employees are exempt from customs duties.Companies which are more than 30% foreign owned and which specialise inthe agricultural, construction and consumer industries are entitled toa two year holiday from income tax.Companies included in the Priority Investment Programme are entitled toa five year income tax holiday. Inclusion in the Priority InvestmentProgramme is a matter of discretion exercised by the Cabinet ofMinisters.According to the Enterprise Tax Law of 22 December 1995, the basic rateof profits tax for companies with less than 30% foreign capital is 37%and 25% for companies with more than 30% foreign capital.Exporters receive further benefits in the President's Edict of 18 June1994 "On measures to stimulate the activity of enterprises towardsbroadening of export potential". Under this Edict, income tax ispayable at half the standard rate where exports comprise 30% of acompany's total output.Additionally, certain benefits are available against tax levied on hardcurrency revenues earned from exports, where exports have increased.Further, export tariffs are reduced by 50% where goods are exported forhard currency.The Law On ConcessionsThe Law On Foreign Investments provides for concessions to be grantedto foreign investors wishing to exploit natural resources. The Law OnConcessions was passed on 30 August 1995 and provides a generalframework for concessions.Under this Law, concessions are awarded to a company upon winning atender organised by the state management bodies of the relevantindustry sector. Also, the Cabinet of Ministers may allow a concessionagreement to be negotiated without a tender. Concession agreements areusually valid for 15 years, with the possibility of extensions by theCabinet of Ministers.There are some contradictions within the Law On Concessions. Forexample, authorisation to enter into a concession is grantedsimultaneously by authorised state management bodies and localmanagement bodies. The Law does not state which has responsibility inparticular circumstances.Article 8 provides that the Cabinet of Ministers can determine priorityareas of concessionary activity, although no such determination has yetbeen made. The registration procedure for concessions has not beendetermined, although the Law states that concessions come into effectfrom the moment of registration. The taxation regime is also not yetdeveloped regarding concessions.It is also not clear if a foreign investor who is party to a concessionagreement is required to form a legal entity in Uzbekistan. Moreover,some activities permissible under a concession agreement will requireadditional licensing.Legal structuresOne of the issues facing foreign investors is the choice of appropriatelegal structure in Uzbekistan.- Representative officesInvestors who do not propose to undertake income producing activitiescan set up an accredited representative office. This is effectively anextension of the parent company and, as such, has no separate legalpersonality.The kind of activities which a representative office would normallyundertake include the negotiation of co-operation or licensingagreements on behalf of the parent company, undertaking marketing andpromotional work and by holding an export licence or obtaining visas orcustoms exemptions for the parent company and its employees.Representative offices are not entitled to trade. However,representative offices can become liable for payment of income taxwhere the parent company receives income as a result of its activitiesin Uzbekistan.The parent company will be responsible for the debts and obligations ofits representative office.- Legal EntitiesTwo types of corporate structure are commonly used by investors: thejoint stock company and the limited liability company. There are somenotable differences between these structures.In the case of a joint stock company, the charter fund (share capital)is divided into shares. Each shareholder is allocated a certainpercentage of these which have a nominal value ascribed to them in thecompany's founding documents.A joint stock company can be either open (where shares are freelytransferable) or closed (where shares are distributed among founders,and any change in the identity or number of founders will require theexecution of a new founders agreement and the re-registration of thecompany).The Presidential Decree of 21 January 1994 provided that the Cabinet ofMinisters develop a Programme for the Intensification of theDenationalisation and Privatisation Processes which included enactingregulations for closed joint stock companies to be transferred to openjoint stock companies. This Edict reflects the presidential policy ofencouraging wide public ownership of shares.In contrast, limited liability companies do not issue shares. Instead,each member, or "participant", takes an "interest" in the charter fund.An interest is akin to a share, with similar rights and obligationsattached. Subject to the terms of legislation and to the foundingdocuments, "interests" may be sold to other participants, to outsidethird parties or they may be redeemed by the company.The framework of management is also different between the two forms ofcompany. The minimum requirement for a limited liability company is ageneral meeting of participants (to be held at least twice per year)and a directorate or general director. This latter body acts as theexecutive organ of the company with full power to carry out thedecisions of the general meeting and to oversee the day-to-day runningof the business.A joint stock company is required to have both a general meeting anddirectorate or general director as well as a supervisory board. Thespecific powers allocated to each of the three organs of the companyand their inter-relationships are to some extent set out in therelevant company legislation.However, there is still a degree of uncertainty as to how the threebodies work in practice and the division of their spheres ofresponsibility. For example, the roles of the directorate, whichhandles the daily business of the company and is responsible forimplementing executive policies, and the supervisory board, whichoversees the activities of the directorate, seem to overlap andproblems can arise in practice if the founding documents of the companyare not sufficiently specific.RegistrationBoth entities must be registered with the Ministry of Justice. Inaddition, joint stock companies must register all issues of shares withthe Ministry of Finance and the National Depository, which makes theaccreditation process for such companies more complex.The initial charter fund for both types of company must be paid in fullwithin one year of state registration. Each participant in a limitedliability company must pay up 30% of its cash contribution prior toregistration. This requirement does not apply to joint stock companies.All documents required for the registration of an enterprise inUzbekistan should be submitted initially to the Ministry of Justice andshould include a feasibility study of the proposed venture.If the proposed entity will involve state property, a resolution of theState Committee for Property and the Support of Entrepreneurship willbe necessary.However, the accreditation of companies with assets in excess of US$20million, and all enterprises with 100% foreign investment must also benotified to the Cabinet of Ministers.The Ministry of Justice cannot register the company without the priorapproval of the Cabinet of Ministers. In practice, all companies withforeign investment will require such approval.Where the investment contemplated is of significant size or ofstrategic importance to the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Cabinet ofMinisters may issue a decree approving the investment.The decree procedure may allow an investor to seek additionalexemptions or guarantees, not available in existing legislation.Additionally, companies must register with the Ministry for ForeignEconomic Relations when engaged in "overseas economic activity".Practical considerationsThe choice of corporate structure and the availability of additionalexemptions and guarantees will depend on the perceived importance ofthe potential foreign investment to the Republic of Uzbekistan. Whilethe government encourages foreign investment, negotiations can take along time, in what is still a developing legislative environment.A company wishing to invest in Uzbekistan will need to come to gripswith a great body of legislative and regulatory provisions. Eachsignificant new investment is still something of a precedent for theRepublic of Uzbekistan and there will be aspects which are not properlyregulated in the existing framework, and matters where the legislationwill be silent.It is thus likely that the enactment of project-specific decrees willremain a necessary part of structuring foreign investment in Uzbekistanin the immediate future.Companies need to be prepared to take an innovative and pragmaticapproach to succeed in this potentially rewarding market.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996COMING TO GRIPS WITH SLOVAKIA'S LANGUAGE LAWSA law regulating the use of the Slovak language is now in force inSlovakia. Strict implementation of its provisions could lead toincreased costs for some businesses. By John Loughey of Squire Sanders& Dempsey, Phoenix.The Act on the State Language of the Slovak Republic (the LanguageLaw), Act No. 270/1995, passed by the National Council of the SlovakRepublic on 15 November 1995 and signed into law by President MichelKovac on 25 November 1995, has generated considerable controversy inits short life, primarily relating to concerns about the effect of thenew law on Slovakia's Hungarian speaking ethnic minority.Much less attention has been paid to the effect of the new Language Lawin international business and commerce. Although, for the majority ofbusinesses, the Language Law is unlikely to have a significant impact,it may require major adjustments for businesses in certain industriesin Slovakia.The Language Law, effective since 1 January 1996, provides that Slovakis the official language in the Slovak Republic and takes priority overother languages used in the Slovak Republic. It provides that officialuse of the Slovak language must be in conformity with the codified formof the language to be promulgated by the Slovak Ministry of Culture.The main intent of the Language Law is to require the use of Slovak asthe official language in all government functions.Although the Language Law specifically states that it is not intendedto regulate the use of languages of national minorities and ethnicgroups, and indeed Premier Vladimir Meciar and his government havepledged to promulgate regulations dealing with the use of minoritylanguages, the Language Law's provisions requiring the use of Slovak ineducation and government proceedings and making Slovak language abilitya pre-condition for government employment have generated the mostcontroversy among ethnic minorities.These provisions are unlikely to be of concern to most foreigninvestors. Other provisions of the Language Law, however, may have adirect effect on certain businesses in Slovakia.Mass media, broadcasting and publishingThe Language Law will have a significant impact on those businessesoperating in the broadcasting and publishing fields.It provides that Slovak is the official language to be used in allradio and television broadcasting in Slovakia. Foreign language radioand television broadcasting with subtitles in Slovak or "otherwisesatisfying the requirement of basic comprehensibility from thestandpoint of the official language" are permitted, as are broadcastsof music in the official language, foreign language transmissions bySlovak Radio intended for foreign countries, and television and radiobroadcasting for the purposes of teaching a foreign language or forsimilar purposes. (Presumably, the BBC and similar broadcasters whobroadcast foreign language programming from within Slovakia will bepermitted to continue such broadcasts on the rationale that they areintended to teach foreign languages.) Radio and television broadcastingoperators, announcers, moderators and editors must use Slovak in theirbroadcasts.The Language Law does not provide any guidelines as to how a broadcastwould "otherwise satisfy the requirement of basic comprehensibility".However, the "basic comprehensibility" exceptions in the Language Lawwere added by last minute amendments as a result of lobbying by Czechlanguage interests.It appears, therefore, that the intention of the exceptions is topermit Czech language broadcasts. The Slovak language is similar toCzech and many broadcasters in Slovakia use Czech subtitles or dubbingon other foreign language programming. This practice will apparently bepermitted under the Language Law.If strictly enforced, however, the Language Law may still have adrastic effect on television broadcasting and cable companies operatingfrom within Slovakia. A strict interpretation of the Language Law wouldprohibit local cable operators from retransmitting on their cablesystems such popular foreign language satellite programming as theEnglish language CNN or the German language RTL Plus without Slovak orCzech dubbing or subtitling.In addition, Slovak broadcasters would be unable to broadcastprogramming from such international services without dubbing orsubtitling. Given the cost and practical difficulties of dubbing orsubtitling, Slovak broadcasters and cable operators, if faced withstrict enforcement, are likely to discontinue such programming, therebyreducing the range of choices available to Slovak viewers. (The SlovakNational Council is currently considering a bill that would applysimilar restrictions to video taped films distributed in Slovakia.Provided Czech dubbing or subtitling is permitted for these films, thepractical effect of the proposed law is likely to be minimal, becausemost major video taped films distributed in Slovakia are eithersubtitled or dubbed in Czech or Slovak).Further, programming for children up to the age of 12 must be dubbed inSlovak. Subtitles are not permitted nor is Czech dubbing. As a result,the range of children's programming available in Slovakia may bereduced.As with the broadcast industries, the print and publishing industrywill be affected by the Language Law, which provides that periodicaland non-periodical publications must be published in Slovak. The "basiccomprehensibility" exception does not apply to such publications.Consequently, publishing companies may face the additional expense ofproducing Slovak translations of publications when, in the past, theyhave sold only the Czech translation in Slovakia.Lectures, seminars and cultural eventsOrganisations that sponsor lectures, seminars or other educational,training or cultural events will also be affected by the Language Law.Such events must be held in Slovak or, if in another language, in amanner in which the "basic comprehensibility from the standpoint of theofficial language is satisfied".Again, the Language Law provides no guidance as to what meets therequirement of "basic comprehensibility". Presumably, however,translations of foreign language presentations into Slovak shouldsatisfy this requirement in addition to presentations in Czech.An exception is provided for touring foreign artists, cultural eventsof national minorities and ethnic groups, and musical works in theiroriginal language, provided such programs are first introduced inSlovak. (Paradoxically, the Language Law would permit Slovak rock bandsto perform the music of an American rap group in English, but would bana Slovak based theatre group from performing Shakespeare in English).Participants at lectures have the right to express themselves andpresent speeches in Slovak. Printed materials for cultural events andother special occasions, including programs for cinemas, theatres andconcerts must be issued in Slovak. They may, however, containtranslations in other languages.If the Language Law is strictly enforced, those organisations thatsponsor seminars and lectures in Slovakia may face additional expensesin these operations. These organisations may be required to provideSlovak translators for any programs held in Slovakia, even if allparticipants in the program are fluent in the foreign language in whichthe program is conducted.Contracts and similar documentsThe Language Law will require several types of contracts and otherdocuments to be in Slovak that the parties might not otherwise executein Slovak.All employment contracts and other agreements related to labourrelations must be in Slovak. This requirement would apply even inemployment contracts between a foreign-owned Slovak company and itsSlovak resident foreign employee if those contracts are entered into inSlovakia.All financial and technical documentation must be in Slovak. Althoughthe requirement prior to the Language Law was that financial statementsused for official purposes such as tax returns were to be prepared inSlovak, other financial statements, such as those prepared according tointernational accounting standards and used for international purposes,were often prepared only in English and another foreign language.The official language of court proceedings will, of course, be Slovak,and non-Slovak speaking foreigners will continue to have a right to useinterpreters.Of major significance to international business, however, is the newrequirement that, in any proceeding before public authorities(including courts) relating to a contract, only the Slovak version ofthe contract will be recognised.It is common practice in international transactions for the contractsto be prepared either in both a foreign language and in Slovak, withthe foreign language version controlling, or only in the foreignlanguage.The Language Law mandates that the court must recognise only the Slovaklanguage version of the contract, despite any clear expression that theintent of the parties is to the contrary.This provision of the Language Law may lead to an increased use ofarbitration in international transactions in an effort to avoid theapplication of this particular provision of the Language Law.Product packaging and documentationThe Language Law requires that all information and documentation forconsumer goods, foods and medicines, including the listing of thecontents, instructions for their use, and warranty conditions, be inSlovak. Presumably, this documentation may also be in other languages.This particular provision would not be a major change from existingpractice for most (but not all) importers. Most importers provideSlovak language documentation in order to reach the widest possiblemarket in Slovakia. This provision of the Language Law would, however,prohibit the use of Czech documentation in place of Slovak languagedocumentation, as has sometimes been the practice for companies inorder to save the cost of translating materials into Slovak.Computer softwareThe provisions of the Language Law relating to product documentationmay have a major impact on producers and distributors of computersoftware, although the Language Law has no provisions expresslyapplicable to computer software. According to Milan Ferko, the Directorof the Section of State Languages and Scripts of the Slovak Ministry ofCulture, (the ministry with responsibility for supervising compliancewith the Language Law), producers and distributors of computer softwaremust provide Slovak versions of computer programs. In addition, thecomputer programs must permit the use of the Slovak alphabet. Thisrequirement may limit Slovakia's access to new programs when theexpense of developing a Slovak language version is deemed to be toohigh by the software producer.AdvertisingSigns, advertisements and notices in stores, sporting arenas, cafes,streets, airports, train stations and means of public transport must bein Slovak. Other languages may be included, provided such otherlanguages follow the Slovak text and are not larger than the Slovaktext. The current practice of some advertisers of using slogans in aforeign language only will no longer be permitted. This will requireadvertising campaigns especially developed for the Slovak market.Further, the Slovak language must be used even if the advertising isdirected solely to foreigners, as is commonly seen in advertising atairports.Penalties for violationsAlthough the Language Law came into effect on 1 January 1996, theprovisions of the Language Law relating to penalties for its violationwill not come into effect until 1 January 1997. After 1 January 1997,the Ministry of Culture will have the authority to impose fines up toSKK 250,000 (US$8,500) for most violations. For violations of theprovisions imposed upon broadcasters relating to children's programmingand local television and radio broadcasting, fines can be imposed up toSKK 500,000.Increasing the costs of businessDespite the controversy concerning the effect of the Law on minoritiesin Slovakia, the Language Law will not have a significant impact onmost businesses.In some instances, however, the new Language Law, if strictly enforced,may increase the cost of doing business in Slovakia because ofrequirements for translation into Slovak of documentation, broadcastprogramming, lectures and presentations, advertising and, possibly,computer software programs. Given the relatively small market of Slovakspeakers, some businesses may feel that the additional cost thusimposed is unjustified and decide to forego the Slovak market as aresult. Other businesses might pass the increased cost on to Slovakconsumers. As with the effect of the law on minorities, the real impactof the Language Law will depend on how it is implemented and enforced.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996MINIMUM WAGE INCREASEThe monthly minimum wage has been increased from 540 to 720 drams.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996ARMENIA SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH INDIAA friendship and co-operation agreement has been signed between Armeniaand India.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996LUKASHENKO APPROVES BELARUS PRIVATISATION PROGRAMMEPresident Lukashenko has approved the country's privatisationprogramme.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENTThe double taxation agreement between Russia and Bulgaria has beenpublished in the Official Gazette.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996ZHELEV SEEKS MEDIA RULINGPresident Zhelev has seeking a ruling from the Constitutional Court onthree provisions of the Bulgarian Constitution on the freedom of themedia.Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996PRIVATISATION PROGRAMME LAUNCHEDThe mass privatisation programme was launched on 8 January.Registration of privatisation vouchers started on that date.

That number is expected to grow as privatised andother qualifying companies seek listings.A legislative framework has also emerged, although a number ofsignificant changes are in the pipeline. Preparation began with the May1993 Law on Circulation of Securities and Stock Exchanges (as amended,the Securities Law) which creates a basic framework of securitiesmarket regulation. Recently ratified amendments to this law, along withcorresponding amendments (still awaiting passage) to the Law On JointStock Companies (the JSC Law), reflect anticipated use by companies ofstock market mechanisms. A more comprehensive securities law is underconsideration, although its passage has been delayed by debate over theestablishment and operation of over-the-counter markets.Scope of Securities LawSecurities are defined as instruments representing equity rights andcertain debt obligations, which usually provide the holder withperiodic or defined dividend or interest payments and are transferable.Securities may exist in materialised or dematerialised (book-entry)form, and may be issued in registered or bearer form. The exchange ofsecurities includes their purchase and sale and other activitiesdefined by law where a change of ownership is or may be effected (whichwould embrace such instruments as options or futures contracts).Securities registries must be maintained to reflect the issuance,exchange and pledge of securities.Competent securities issuers are joint stock companies, banks and statebodies, although others may be designated by law. Subject to certainregulatory requirements, foreign institutions and individuals mayparticipate in the market on a par with Moldovan entities.Only specified domestic securities may be issued or circulate in theMoldovan market under the Securities Law. These include shares andbonds issued by joint stock companies, bonds issued by other types ofenterprises and such other securities designated by the SCSM.Foreign-issued securities may also be allowed onto the Moldovan market,although this is subject to a number of regulatory requirementsincluding authorisation from the National Bank of Moldova.Other forms of securities include:- government bonds;- treasury or treasury-like bonds;- bank certificates;- promissory notes and bills of exchange;- other documentary evidences of commercial obligation; and- special MPP enterprise-specific securities.The following are not debt security instruments:- simple debt receipts;- testamentary dispositions;- lottery tickets; and- insurance policies.The issuance of state securities is regulated by the Ministry ofFinance and the NBM, and their exchange by the Securities Law. Somebank-related securities, such as bills of exchange, may be under NBMjurisdiction.Chief among the Securities Law amendments is the creation of securitiesregistry systems. A registry must contain details of owners or nominalholders of securities. Amendments to the JSC Law set out obligations ofjoint stock companies in relation to the establishment and maintenanceof registries. Issuers may maintain their own registries or use theservices of an independent SCSM-licensed registrar. Nominal securitiesholders, who must also be SCSM-registered, may also perform registryfunctions. Securities transfers are valid only when all registrationrequirements under the law have been completed.Securities issuanceSecurities issues must be registered with the SCSM and given a publicfile number. Thirty days prior to registration of the issue, thefollowing documents must be submitted to the SCSM:- the registration application describing security type, quantity andface value;- an extract from Ministry of Justice Enterprises Registry certifyingthe issuer's existence;- certified copies of the issuer's constituent documents;- security specimens; and- the issue prospectus.The prospectus must be approved by the SCSM prior to distribution topotential investors. The SCSM will review the prospectus, which must becurrent to within three months of publication, and may requireadditions or deletions to it.A copy of the prospectus must be made available to each interestedinvestor. Any amendments made during the securities offering periodmust approved by the SCSM and provided to investors holding prospectuscopies. During the initial offering period (which is not defined),securities must be sold at face value. The SCSM may suspend or declareinvalid an issue in the event of a breach of legislation, falseinformation in the prospectus or a material change in the condition ofthe issuer or issue terms and conditions. This decision is subject tojudicial review. The Securities Law sets out detailed reportingrequirements, which include keeping details of all corporate activitiesand filing annual reports with the SCSM.Securities exchangeSecurities exchange activities may only be undertaken by personslicensed by the SCSM. Banks and companies whose sole corporate activityis securities dealing may apply for a trading licence from the SCSM.They must be able to demonstrate professional competence in theactivities they wish to pursue and may not be more than 10% owned orcontrolled by another SCSM licence holder.A bank may engage in dealing for its own account only and may not dealin securities of issuers which are bank customers or clients.Recent amendments to the Securities Law and JSC Law concern large-scalesecurities issues, the operation of independent registries, over-the-counter trading and disclosure requirements.A large-scale securities issue is one where the number of registeredsecurities holders exceeds 300 (individual shareholders of nomineescounting against the limit).Open joint stock companies involved in such issues must register theissue with the MSE. Issuers of such securities are obliged to contractresponsibility for issuance and exchange registration activities to anSCSM-licensed independent registrar. Such a registrar is defined byamendments to the JSC Law as a legal person whose sole corporateactivity is engaging in issuance and registry activities. Anindependent registrar is precluded from transacting in clientsecurities or sub-contracting any of its clients' responsibilities.OTC exchange activity in large scale securities issues by joint stockcompanies must be performed by the SCSM licensed persons who mustreport to the regulator the manner and volume of trades executed.Disclosure requirements, which are still to be determined by thegovernment, will bind persons engaged in securities issuance anddealing.The stock exchangeThe MSE is established as a closed joint stock company and is thereforesubject to the JSC Law in relation to internal corporate governance.Stock exchange activities are subject to SCSM supervision.Founders of the Moldova Stock Exchange, whose number shall not exceedten, must be SCSM-licensed market participants.The founders must establish a general guaranty fund to which exchangemembers must contribute. Assets of the fund may not be used to coverthe general debt obligations of an exchange member (except asprescribed by exchange regulations) where membership is terminatedbecause of liquidation, bankruptcy or otherwise. The MSE has a priorityclaim over the former member's guaranty share to satisfy obligationsassociated with exchange activity.MSE members must be SCSM-licensed market participants. They mustsatisfy MSE regulations regarding financial and operational capacityand agree to abide by the MSE charter and rules.Members are not obliged to hold shares in the MSE. Membership may besold or voluntarily relinquished. The MSE may cancel a member'slicence, suspend its activities or revoke membership for failure toabide by MSE regulations. Appeal lies with the SCSM.MSE income is used to defray exchange operational expenses. Conflict ofinterest provisions prohibit the holding of management or otherofficial positions in the MSE by persons holding shares in a MSEmember.No MSE employee may also be employed by a securities issuer, includinggovernment treasury bond issuers.The MSE shall cease to exist by a vote of the general assembly ofshareholders, where membership falls below ten persons and within thepreceding six months no new members have been admitted, or upon SCSMrevocation of the MSE's licence.Investor protectionInvestors are protected against losses suffered as a result of falseinformation provided to them in the initial share offering -presumably, only by reference to the issuer's published prospectus.Where a licensed market participant knowingly certifies as true falseinformation on the issuer, the participant and the issuer shall beliable to the investor. Investor remedies include compensation or,where the investor files the claim within a month of the affectedsecurities purchase, revocation of the securities sales contract. Asregards initial share issues, the issuer and other market participantsinvolved in the transaction must maintain purchase monies received bythem in escrow until such time as they are satisfied that no violationof the investor protection provisions is likely to occur. A personpurchasing 5% or more of a company's voting stock or increasing anexisting holding through voting share purchases by 5% or more, mustreport such activity within five days of its occurrence to the SCSM.Joint stock companies purchasing their own stock on the open marketmust inform the SCSM within 15 days of the completed transaction.As regards open market share buy-backs by joint stock companies, theproposed amendments to the JSC Law requires the company charter tospecifically authorise such buy-backs as well as approval of the actionby the board of directors. The board may only approve the buy-backwhere the company is unlikely to become insolvent or where the buy-backwould not provoke insolvency. Repurchased shares must be retired totreasury. A company may not purchase shares in a primary issue. Theforegoing directives are not specifically provided for, but may bededuced from current JSC Law read with the Securities Law and generalcivil law principles of corporate governance.Insider trading is prohibited to certain listed categories of personsassociated with an issuer, subject to an exception clause whichseriously undermines the prohibition's effect.Persons having access to "official information" (an undefined term) ofan issuer, who are forbidden from engaging in insider trading activity,are categorised as follows:- "issuers authorities", a grouping which includes member of acompany's supervisory council or board of directors and administrativepersonnel;- officials engaged in auditing functions in connection with issuers orthe MSE;- SCSM authorities or officials; and- authorities and officials of the MSE and professional SCSM-licensedmarket participants."Authorities" and "members" are not defined. Such persons and membersof their families may purchase securities of associated issuersprovided that they sell or transfer them within six months of purchase.Banks issuing securities may not provide credit to investors in thosesecurities. It is prohibited to disseminate false information about anissuer with a view to profiting from a resultant share price swing.Investors suffering losses may bring a claim against the individual orcompany disseminating the information by reference to as yet undraftedlegislation. Any pledge of securities must be recorded in the issuer'sshare registry.Securities watchdogThe SCSM is the main regulator with its mandate expanded underSecurities Law amendments giving it wider regulatory and investigatorypowers.Recently added powers include:- approving new MSE rules;- investigative authority over activities by market participants with aview to uncovering or pursuing suspected irregularities or illicitbehaviour, coupled with documentary and written deposition subpoenapowers; and- certain proactive remedial powers.Appeal from SCSM orders lies with the general and arbitral courts byreference to the order's terms.Transitional provisionsThe government is directed to submit draft amendments to the JSC Law toParliament for approval and to bring regulations under the JSC Law andSecurities Law into compliance with the amended Laws.As mentioned, amendments to the JSC Law are still under discussion.Regulations are being updated to reflect recent changes to theSecurities Law and discussions on a second wholly redrafted securitieslaw are well advanced.(By Gael Graham, attorney-at-law, Boston)Back to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996RUSSIA: REGISTRATION IN ST PETERSBURGRussian companies with foreign investment located in St Petersburg(including their branches and representative offices), as well asbranch offices of foreign companies, are now registered in the samemanner as most other local Russian commercial entities by the StPetersburg Registration Chamber.Under prior legislation, companies with foreign investment and branchesand representative offices of foreign companies were registered at aseparate registration chamber at the Committee of Foreign Relations ofthe Mayor's Office (the CFR). Now only representative offices offoreign legal entities need be CFR registered.The new registration process has formally been in effect since thepublication on 25 July 1995 of the Order of the Mayor of St. PetersburgExecutive Organs in Relation to State Registration of JuridicalEntities as well as Physical Persons Engaged in Individual CommercialActivities Not Having Formed a Juridical Entity in the Form of anIndividual Enterprise (Order 692-p), which attaches the new Regulationof the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber. However, its provisionswere not implemented immediately and its interpretation by theRegistration Chamber and CFR became clear only recently.Order 692-p establishes that the St. Petersburg Registration Chamberhas responsibility for registering and maintaining a unified registryof all new and reorganised juridical entities in St. Petersburg(including those with foreign investment) as well as branches and theirrepresentative offices, including the branch offices (but notrepresentative offices) of foreign entities. Specifically included inthe competence of the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber is the rightto register all of the aforementioned entities as well as to confirmeither the amendments to the foundation documents or the liquidationbalance in case of the dissolution of any entities previouslyregistered by the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber or the CFR.As to the timing of the registration process, previously, the CFRreviewed the application documentation over a 21-day period inaccordance with the provisions of the Law on Foreign Investment in theRSFSR of 4 July 1991 and the Regulations on the Order of Registrationof Enterprises with Foreign Investment on the Territory of St.Petersburg as attached to Order of the Mayor of St. Petersburg no. 219-p of 14 March 1994 On the Registration of Enterprises with ForeignInvestment which Order 692-p partially repeals.Subsequently, the legality of this waiting period was brought intoquestion by Decree No. 1482 of the President of 8 July 1994 On theOrder of State Registration of the Subjects of Entrepreneurial Activity(Decree 1482) which requires that the registration organ complete theregistration process no later than three days after submission of therequired documentation.The wording of Order 692-p appears to ignore Decree 1482, by implicitlygranting to the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber the right to reviewapplication documentation over a 21-day waiting period as well.Experience since the publication of Order 692-p has been that in somecases, where all documents have been in order, registrations have beencompleted within several days following their submission. Thedocumentation required to register a Russian company with foreigninvestment (including its branch and representative offices) or abranch office of a foreign company remains unchanged, except for theapplication letter, which must now be addressed to the St. PetersburgRegistration Chamber.

Stephens v. Kay ManagementCo. Inc. et al., No. 95cv470-A (ED VA).     The judge rejected the plaintiff's argument that thesupervisor qualified as an "employer" under the ADA because ofthe supervisor's role as an agent of the employer who exercisedsignificant control over hiring, firing or conditions ofemployment.  He said that the "agent" wording of the statutemerely incorporated the principles of respondeat superior, notexposure to personal liability in discrimination cases.     Plaintiff Marian Stephens worked in management positions forKay Management Co., a real estate management firm, from 1983until 1993.  A 1992 stroke affected her ability to walk and climbstairs but did not prevent her from those activities, which werepart of her job as a resident manager of an apartment complex inFairfax, VA.     According to the U.S. District Court for the EasternDistrict of Virginia complaint, the property manager, Stephens'supervisor, made comments about Stephens' "handicap" and refusedto allow Stephens to accompany her and a male employee on walkingtours of the property.  Stephens was terminated despite theabsence of prior performance complaints and without the warningor counseling required by Kay Management's employment policies.A person 20 years younger than Stephens was then hired to replaceher.     The complaint named the company and property manager, SusanPool, as defendants.     Judge Robert E. Payne granted the property manager's motionfor summary judgment by dismissing the complaint against her.     There is no individual liability on a supervisor foremployment-related decisions of a plainly delegable nature, hesaid, unless the supervisor also independently meets the ADAdefinition of "employer."  He cited case law in which courtsreached a similar conclusion under the Age Discrimination inEmployment Act and Title VII.     In addition, Congress could have directly imposed new andexpansive liability for individuals in the statutory definitionof "employer," he said, rejecting the argument that Congress didso by implication through ADA provisions regarding recoverablecompensatory and punitive damages.     At the same time, he said, absolving the property manager ofpersonal liability does not encourage discrimination because ofthe employer's respondeat superior liability.     Candace S. McCall of Fairfax appeared for Stephens.  DavidM.

SAYS FAILURETO HIRE MAY HAVE VIOLATEDRIGHTS OF GAY WOMAN     The withdrawal of an offer of employment by a Georgia stateagency to an openly homosexual candidate may have violated herintimate association rights and her right of expressiveassociation, a divided 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruledon Dec. 20, vacating a lower court grant of summary judgment tothe defendant in the case.  Shahar v. Bowers, No. 93-9345(11th Cir.).     The majority concluded that the district court should applystrict scrutiny to a review of whether the decision to withdrawthe job offer when the candidate announced her intention toengage in a religious marriage ceremony with her partner was"narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest."     Joy Shahar was offered and accepted a job with theDepartment of Law of the State of Georgia.  Before she beganwork, she announced her intention to engage in a marriageceremony with her female companion.  The attorney general ofGeorgia learned of her plans and terminated the offer ofemployment by letter in July 1991.  He stated that he could notapprove of "this purported marriage," as doing so would"jeopardize the proper function of this office."     Shahar filed suit in October 1991 against the AG under42 U.S.C. Section 1983, alleging violation of her right ofintimate association, of her freedom of religion, and of equalprotection and substantive due process.  She claimed thatengaging in a religious ceremony recognized by theReconstructionist branch of Judaism, to which she adheres,conferred upon her and her partner a religious-based status whichwas separate from civil marriage in Georgia, which does notrecognize same-gender marriages.  The U.S. District Court for theNorthern District of Georgia entered summary judgment for the AG.     The appeals court panel, in a majority opinion delivered bySenior Judge John Godbold, concluded that the district court haderred in applying a balancing test to determine whether Shahar'sright to intimate association had been violated.  However, thecourt affirmed summary judgment for the AG on Shahar's freeexpression and equal protection claims.     Judge Godbold first emphasized that Shahar's intimateassociation claim was based in a long-standing commitment toreligious principles; that she and her partner were active intheir synagogue; and that the couple had been counseled by arabbi prior to their marriage.  He stated that, while themarriage between Shahar and her partner did not involve marriagein a civil, legal sense, it was "inextricably entwined withShahar's exercise of her religious beliefs."  Therefore, thatintimate relationship was constitutionally protected, anddeserved strict scrutiny, not a balancing test review, he said.     Next, the court remanded Shahar's expressive associationclaim, on a finding that the district court erred in notaddressing the issue because of its overlap with her freeexercise claim, and the court's conclusion that the expressiveassociation claim required no greater constitutional protectionthan her intimate association claim.  Judge Godbold noted thatthe right of expressive association " the right to associate forthe purpose of engaging in those activities protected by theFirst Amendment, including religious expression " may be limitedby regulations which serve a compelling state interest.     Senior Judge Lewis Morgan concurred in part, taking issuewith Judge Godbold's opinion that Shahar's association and equalprotection claims require strict scrutiny.  He stated that Shaharhad not presented an equal protection claim based on afundamental right of religious freedom.  In addition, theevidence does not support an equal protection claim because thejob offer was not revoked because of Shahar's sexual orientationbut because the AG believed that she invoked the legal and civilsignificance of being married to another female, which isinconsistent with Georgia law.     Judge Phyllis Kravitch concurred in part and dissented inpart.  She stated that, although she disagreed with themajority's holding that strict scrutiny ought to be applied inthis case, applying a balancing test led her to conclude that theemotional and religious bond between Shahar and her partner isentitled to constitutional protection.  Although the "uniquestatus" of the AG's office made this a close case for JudgeKravitch, Shahar's "constitutional interest in pursuing herintimate association outweighed any threat to the efficientoperation of the Georgia Department of Law," she stated.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMPLOYMENT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996VA COURT SAYS SUPERVISORMAY BE PERSONALLY LIABLEFOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT     A supervisor may be held personally liable for sexualharassment in a Title VII case, a federal judge in Roanoke, VA,has decided.  Frye v. Virginia Transformer Corp. et al.,No. 95-0399-R (WD VA).     The court concluded that a supervisor can be held liable forsexual harassment where (1) the supervisor has a significantdegree of control over the employee and (2) the sexual harassmentis conducted by the supervisor for his own benefit and not forthat of his employer.     Defendant Jeff Clark was one of Sarah Frye's supervisors atVirginia Transformer Corp.  He allegedly sexually touched Fryeand made suggestive sexual comments; he also reportedly sexuallyharassed other female and male employees.  Frye did not complainpersonally to the company about Clark until company investigatorsapproached her after hearing rumors of the incidents.  She toldthem she did not want Clark fired and would handle the situationherself; she declined to provide a written statement andresigned.     The company continued its own investigation, reprimandingClark and requiring sexual harassment training for allsupervisors.  The decision to reprimand, rather than terminate,was based on the fact that Clark denied the allegation; therewere no prior complaints against Clark; and Frye had asked thatClark not be fired.  Frye was notified of the reprimand, butrefused several invitations to return to work at VirginiaTransformer.  Her request for post-traumatic stress workers'compensation was denied, and the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission issued a no-cause determination.     Frye filed suit in U.S. District Court for the WesternDistrict of Virginia, alleging sexual harassment by Clark andVirginia Transformer, assault and battery by Clark, and negligentretention by Virginia Transformer.     Chief Judge Jackson L. Kisor refused to dismiss theTitle VII claim against Clark but dismissed the negligentretention cause of action against the company.     First, Judge Kisor ruled an individual supervisor may beliable under Title VII for sexual harassment conducted for thesupervisor's own benefit, not for the benefit of the employer.In concluding that there are situations where a supervisor shouldbe held individually liable under Title VII, he differentiatedbetween an age discrimination suit where the discrimination is"relatively benign" and a Title VII suit involving "moreegregious sexual harassment."  He also noted that Title VII's"rationale of solicitude" for small businesses should beinapplicable is cases such as this.  Therefore, Frye should begiven the opportunity to prove that Clark exercised the requisitedegree of supervisory control to warrant Title VII liability, hesaid.     Next, he let stand the Title VII claim against VirginiaTransformer, despite the company's arguments that (1) it wasunaware of Clark's misconduct; and (2) Clark harassed both maleand female employees, so his conduct was not "based on sex."However, he dismissed the negligent retention claim, holdingthat, although state law recognizes the tort of negligent hiring,it does not recognize the tort of negligent retention:  "employerliability in this analysis centers only on the decision to hire;it goes no further once the employee is actually retained."     Terry Neill Grimes of King, Fulghum, Snead, Nixon & Grimesin Roanoke represented Frye.  Defense counsel were ClintonStephen Morse and Todd A. Leeson of Woods, Rogers & Hazlegrove inRoanoke and Agnis Chandra Chakravorty of the Center forEmployment Law in Roanoke.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMPLOYMENT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 199610TH CIRCUIT AFFIRMSSUMMARY JUDGMENT FORK-MART IN HARASSMENT CASE     An employee who claimed that K-Mart should be held liablefor her sexual harassment by a co-worker cannot avoid summaryjudgment in favor of her employer because she failed to show thatthe company knew about, but did nothing to remedy, the allegedhostile workplace, the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals hasheld.  Ulrich v. K-Mart Corp., No. 94-3267 (10th Cir.).     The panel affirmed the decision and reasoning of the U.S.District Court for the District of Kansas, noting that, althoughthe alleged harasser had the title of "manager," there was noevidence that he used any supervisory authority to facilitate hissexual harassment of the employee.     Terry Ulrich worked in the layaway department at K-Mart.She worked regularly on inventory checks with Larry Denney, whoheld the title of "loss prevention manager."  In August 1991,Ulrich reported to K-Mart's personnel manager a number ofincidents of sexual harassment by Denney, who allegedly grabbedher breasts and other areas of her anatomy, and kissed heragainst her will.     K-Mart responded to the report by instructing Denney inwriting to stay away from Ulrich during investigation of theincidents, all of which took place within one week during July1991.  Denney was later fired.               Ulrich filed one charge with the state human rightscommission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, andlater filed a second charge claiming that K-Mart retaliatedagainst her for the first charge.  Ulrich said that herassignment after her return from a leave of absence was a"demotion."  K-Mart countered that the temporary assignment aboutwhich Ulrich complained was not a demotion, as Ulrich continuedto receive the same rate of pay and benefits as she had prior toher leave of absence.     The complaint alleged sexual harassment and constructivedischarge/retaliation under Title VII and the Kansas Acts AgainstDiscrimination, assault and battery, negligent retention,invasion of privacy, breach of duty to provide a harassment-freeworkplace, and failure to properly hire and train.     U.S. District Judge Monti Belot entered summary judgment infavor of K-Mart.  He found that, although Denney's conductconstituted hostile environment sexual harassment, K-Mart couldnot be held liable.     First, K-Mart was not liable for the harassment because(1) the "grabbing, hugging and fondling" were not within Denney'sjob description; (2) the employee handbook expressly stated thatsexual harassment was prohibited; and (3) the handbook definitionof sexual harassment covered Denney's conduct.     Second, the court rejected Ulrich's contention that K-Marthad actual or constructive notice of Denney's harassment of otheremployees because he had been involved in three adulterousaffairs with female co-workers.  Judge Belot said that, even ifK-Mart had known about the affairs, the evidence clearlyindicated that the relationships were consensual.  The sexualadvances must be unwelcome to trigger a duty on the employer toact to prevent them, he stated.  In addition, the company actedpromptly to remedy the situation with Ulrich, observed the judge.     Third, the company cannot be held liable for the harassmentbecause Denney did not purport to be acting as K-Mart's agent atthe time of the misconduct.  While Denney held the title of"manager" with respect to the store's surveillance and security,he did not hire or fire anyone, did not discipline anyone and didnot control other employees' schedules or their wages.  Moreimportantly, Ulrich does not claim that Denney used anysupervisory authority to press his sexual harassment of Ulrich,said the court.     Turning to Ulrich's constructive discharge/retaliationclaims, Judge Belot said that Ulrich had failed to show that thetemporary assignment she was given after her return from a leaveof absence made her working conditions so intolerable that shewas forced to quit.  The court said it was the fact that Ulrich'spay and benefits remained the same and not her subjective view ofthe "atmosphere or dignity" of her employment which determinedwhether Ulrich had been constructively discharged.  "A reasonableperson in Ulrich's position would not view having to perform theduties of door greeter and checker for limited periods of time asintolerable," said the judge.     Finally, Ulrich's negligent retention and failure toproperly hire and train were rejected by the district court.  K-Mart's personnel director testified that, until Ulrich herselfreported Denney's misconduct in August 1991, the company had noknowledge of the problem, said Judge Belot.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMPLOYMENT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996CALIFORNIA JUDGE CLEARSLOS ANGELES COUNCILMAN OFSEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES     A California state court judge has rejected the claims of aformer secretary that her boss, a Los Angeles city councilman,two of his employees and the city itself were responsible forhostile environment and quid pro quo sexual harassment.  Beyda v.City of Los Angeles et al., No. BC083850 (CA Super. Ct., LosAngeles Cty.).     In his Nov. 27 ruling, the judge stated that thecouncilman's condominium, where some of the alleged harassmenttook place, did not constitute a "workplace":  there wasinsufficient evidence that the visits by the secretary were work-related, or that the defendant had exerted "some kind of power"over the plaintiff to get her to come to the apartment.     According to Marlee Beyda's August 1993 complaint, she washired as Councilman Nate Holden's secretary in April 1991.Shortly thereafter, she was allegedly subjected to sexualharassment in the form of unwanted touching of her; forcedtouching of Holden; forcible removal of her clothing; requestsfor unwelcome sexual interaction as a condition of continuedemployment; and sexually explicit conversations in her presence.The harassment took place not only in the "sexually charged"atmosphere of the office, but also in Holden's condominium, whereHolden tried to convince Beyda that she "owed" him sexualactivity after all he had done for her, she claimed.     Beyda claimed that two of Holden's employees either joinedin the verbal harassment or cooperated in Holden's misconduct inan attempt to get her " the only white female and/or Jewishemployee in Holden's office " to quit.  Beyda also said thatAfrican-American males were given preference with respect to workhours, assignments, trips out of the city and application ofoffice policies.  The harassment and the preferential treatmentof men constituted unlawful discrimination on the basis ofgender, race, ethnicity and religion, and forced her to quit herjob, she claimed.  She requested $1 million in damages on herclaims of discrimination, wrongful termination, breach ofcontract, negligent supervision, assault, battery and invasion ofprivacy.     In her trial brief, Beyda argued not only that she was thetarget of sexual harassment, but also that she was subjected toharassment by having to witness the harassment of other femaleco-workers.  Hostile environment can be found when a "supervisorobtains sexual favors from subordinates other than thecomplainant," she contended.  She urged the court to hold thedefendants liable for knowledge of Holden's harassment eventhough she did not report each and every incident of misconduct.     In their post-trial brief, the three individual defendantsargued that Beyda failed to meet her burden of showing that theharassing conduct "altered her working conditions and created anabusive working environment."  Beyda's working environment didnot extend to Holden's private residence, as she herself admittedthat she was not asked to work at the apartment and did not workthere, they argued.  In addition, Beyda could not support hercontention that she was, as were deputies, on call 24 hours perday, and, therefore, that she was "working" at Holden's apartmentwhenever she went there after normal office hours.     Second, there was no evidence that Holden had the authority,or misused that authority, to coerce Beyda to come to his home,said the defendants.  However, even if the apartment wereconsidered an extension of the work environment, there was noevidence that any sexual harassment occurred there.  For example,Beyda never complained to anyone in authority about Holden'streatment of her; she visited the apartment even after sheresigned; and her demeanor and performance at work did notdisplay any of the depression or other emotional distress ofwhich she complained, said the defendants.     Third, Beyda did not establish the elements of a qui pro quoharassment claim, argued the defendants.  Her attendance of work-related events was not curtailed in any way, and she did notdemonstrate that Holden conditioned her "putting out" or havingsex of any kind on raises, promotions, pay, demotion, terminationor any other adverse job consequence.     Beyda was represented by Dan Stormer of Hadsel & Stormer inPasadena and by J.L. O'Donnell of O'Donnell & Mandrell in LosAngeles.  Counsel for the individual defendants were Louis Millerand Michael O'Connor of Christensen, White, Miller, Fink, Jacobs,Glaser & Shapiro in Los Angeles.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMPLOYMENT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996LEGAL SECRETARY CLAIMSFORMER LAW FIRM LIABLEFOR HARASSMENT, DEFAMATION     A legal secretary has filed suit in California state courtagainst her former employer, alleging that she was sexuallyharassed by one of the firm's partners, and that the rest of thefirm conspired to cover up the misconduct and force her out ofher job when she complained.  Van Sloten v. Chase, Rotchford,Drukker & Bogust et al., No. BC139859 (CA Super. Ct., Los AngelesCty.).     The complaint also contains claims for sexual battery,defamation, negligence, breach of oral contract and wrongfultermination.     Plaintiff Martha Van Sloten began working for the firm ofChase, Rotchford, Drukker & Bogust in 1977 and, in 1978, wasassigned to work for firm partner Howard Slavin as his personalsecretary.  She says that Slavin made "offensive and off-colorsexual remarks" to her, including several requests for sexualintercourse and descriptions of his sexual fantasies; touched herin a sexual manner; and finally raped her in December 1992 andDecember 1993.     The rest of the firm knew about the incidents of sexualharassment by Slavin, but took no action to remedy the situation,claims Van Sloten.  This failure to stop the harassment amountedto an "authorization and ratification" of Slavin's misconduct bythe officers and directors, says the complaint.  In addition, thefirm and Slavin conspired to increase the harassment in anattempt to damage her health and force her to quit, says VanSloten.  Allowing Slavin to occupy "positions of trust andauthority at a time when they knew or should have known about hisimproper conduct" amounted to negligence on the part of the firm,she says.     The basis of the defamation claim are false statementsallegedly made by the firm concerning Van Sloten's "inadequate"job performance, again in an attempt to force her out of her job.The defendants also breached their oral contract with Van Slotenby failing to ensure that she worked in an environment free ofsexual harassment, says the complaint.  According to thecomplaint, Van Sloten was terminated in violation of publicpolicy because her 16-year career with Chase Rotchford gave her"the present ability to testify to facts which implicateddefendants Chase Rotchford and Slavin in acts which violated theprovisions of the state bar act...."     Van Sloten has requested the award of double her lostearnings as well as unspecified general damages for mentaldistress, punitive and exemplary damages, an injunction againstthe firm, an order that mandates sensitivity training andpublicly posted statements at the firm to inform employees thatsexual harassment violates state and federal law.     The complaint was filed by David Smith Bates of BeverlyHills.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMPLOYMENT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 19968TH CIRCUIT THROWS OUT$500,000 PUNITIVE AWARD INCREDIT CARD SNOOPING SUIT     The Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 19 reverseda punitive damage award of $500,000 to a former Amoco Oil Co.employee who claimed that he was fired because of his age, andthat Amoco invaded his privacy by inspecting his credit cardrecords for days when he had called in sick.  Pulla v. Amoco OilCo., Nos. 94-4001 and 95-1047 (8th Cir.).     The court concluded that, given the "limited offensiveness"of Amoco's actions and the "unlikelihood of any serious potentialharm" from its conduct, the 250,000-to-1 ratio of punitivedamages to actual damages was "excessive, unreasonable andviolative of due process."     The dispute began when Thaddeus Pulla, a 15-year Amocoemployee, was told that performance in the company's credit carddepartment was unsatisfactory.  He was demoted in July 1989, andreplaced by a 45-year-old female.  Pulla, who was 48, filed suitunder the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), supportinghis claim with several ageist comments by his supervisor.     Pulla later amended his complaint to allege that Amoco hadretaliated against him for the ADEA filing and had also violatedstate tort law by invading his privacy.  The basis of theinvasion of privacy claim was the company's inspection of hiscredit card records after one of Pulla's co-workers decided thatshe was tired of covering Pulla's shift when he called in sick.Pulla had missed two months of work in 1991.  The co-workerdiscovered that Pulla had used his credit card at a number ofrestaurants and bars on the days when he had called in sick, andreported these findings to their mutual supervisor.     The co-worker was admonished but not disciplined forreviewing the credit card records, and Amoco subsequentlyretrieved the information and made it a part of Pulla's personnelrecords.  Finally, the supervisor referred to Pulla's absenceproblem in his next evaluation, and singled him out for theunique requirement of having to obtain a physician's note beforesubmitting any claims for sick leave.     The jury found in favor of Amoco on the age discriminationclaims, but found in favor of Pulla on the invasion of privacyclaim.  The award was $1 for actual damages for past pain andsuffering and $1 actual damages for future pain and suffering.However, the jury concluded that the company had acted "willfullyand wantonly" in violating Pulla's right to privacy and awardedhim $500,000 in punitive damages.     The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowarebuffed Amoco's motion for j.n.o.v., a new trial and remittitur.     The appeals court panel, in an opinion by the HonorableByron White, Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, sittingby designation, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.     First, Justice White found no error in the district court'sconclusion that there was sufficient evidence to support thejury's finding on the invasion of privacy claim.  Therefore, hesaid, there was no abuse of discretion in denying in its entiretyAmoco's motion for a new trial.     Next, there was no error in the district court's conclusionthat Pulla failed to present sufficient evidence to support hisbreach of contract claim, i.e., that Amoco's employment policiesconstituted an exception to Iowa's employment-at-will doctrine.The evidence included:  (1) a progressive discipline policy whichmanagers "should follow"; (2) a merit employment policy thatmanagers "should follow"; (3) statements by Amoco that it will"follow the law and maintain equal opportunity in employment";and (4) statements that the workplace should be "friendly andcooperative."  These were not sufficiently definite or mandatoryto constitute a binding contract, said the appeals court panel.     Finally, Justice White addressed the issue of theconstitutionality of the punitive damages award, stating that theU.S. Supreme Court has twice stated that the appropriateframework to employ is a "general concern for reasonableness."This concern "requires that the award be 'rational in light ofits purpose to punish what has occurred and to deter itsrepetition,'" he stated.     Based on this framework, the $500,000 punitive damages awardwas unreasonable and violated Amoco's substantive due processrights, said the panel.  The district court erred bymisperceiving the nature of the potential harm, said JusticeWhite.  Because Pulla did not present any evidence that thecompany put any other individual's privacy at risk, the potentialharm from the search of his credit card records can be analyzedonly in terms of the very limited way it affected him.  Theappeals court contrasted Pulla's situation with one where amanufacturer puts several thousand potentially dangerous products" such as breast implants " into the marketplace.     In addition, Amoco's conduct was not as offensive asperceived by the district court because there was no indicationthat the supervisor's conduct in retrieving Pulla's credit cardrecords reflected a company policy or practice.  There was noevidence that this was anything more than an "isolated and rare"incident, said Justice White.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMPLOYMENT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996DE COURT ENTERSPARTIAL DISMISSAL OFCLAIMS AGAINST DUPONT     U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson has ruled that a group ofDuPont employees may proceed with some of their AgeDiscrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Americans WithDisabilities Act (ADA), and Employee Retirement and IncomeSecurity Act (ERISA) claims against their former employer, E.I.DuPont de Nemours & Co.  Adkins et al. v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours& Co. et al., No. 95-315-SLR (D DE); see Employment LR, July 11,1995.     Ruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss the ERISA andpendent state law claims, Judge Robinson allowed the ERISAwrongful discharge claims to remain, but dismissed those ERISAclaims which relied on allegations of fraud with respect to theseverance plan.  The state law claims were also dismissed.     Court documents contained the following backgroundinformation:  A group of 180 DuPont employees filed a 12-countpurported class action suit against the company, alleging thatDuPont tried to force out older employees by instituting a cross-training program and by reducing the workforce by almost half toavoid paying full pension benefits.     The complaint states that shortly after the companyinstituted a High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) program, theworkers were threatened with termination if they did not complywith its requirement that each employee learn how to perform eachjob at the plant.  The employees also claim that older employeeswere intimidated into leaving their jobs and accepting areduction in pension benefits.     The employees also allege that the company refused toaccommodate the vision or physical impairments which those olderemployees had, and instead intentionally placed them in jobswhich they were not able to perform.  The company violated theADA, says the workers, by creating only four ADA "slots," lightduty positions which were filled on the basis of seniority ratherthan need.     At the time that the HPWS program began, an enhancedseverance benefits program was also announced.  In contrast tothe DuPont early retirement plan, which provided for 100% ofpension benefits even though an employee may not have attainedthe age or years of service generally needed for full retirementbenefits, the severance plan paid less than 100% of the pensionbenefits, said the workers.  By coercing the older employees toenter the severance program, DuPont was able to substantiallyreduce its pension benefits obligations, says the complaint.     In addition to alleging violations of the ADEA, ADA andERISA, the complaint alleged negligent misrepresentation, breachof fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, fraud and promissoryestoppel.     Judge Robinson first ruled on the employees' ERISA claims,holding that those portions of the claims charging DuPont withhaving made false statements and misrepresentations regarding theseverance plan "relate to" an ERISA plan, and, therefore, arepreempted under 29 U.S.C. Section 1144(a).   However, while thejudge dismissed so much of those claims which allege fraud andconstructive fraud, she refused to dismiss the remainder of theERISA claims.     Next, the court addressed the employees' contention thatDuPont breached its fiduciary duty with respect to its handlingof the severance and pension plans.  Judge Robinson dismissedthis claim because the plaintiffs were seeking only monetaryrelief for an alleged breach of duty under ERISA.     Third, the court allowed the claims of fraud andconstructive fraud to remain, provided that the employees amendthem to meet the requirements of FRCP 9(b).  The defendantsargued, and Judge Robinson agreed, that those claims were notpleaded with sufficient particularity, and failed to show the"nature and scope" of efforts to obtain the information needed toplead with particularity.  The employees contended that detailswere not available because "defendants are in a much betterposition to know the details of the fraudulent conduct" and theywere not about to provide such information.     Finally, Judge Robinson rejected the defendants' statute oflimitations argument with respect dismissal of the ERISA wrongfultermination claims.  She said that, although the one-yearVirginia limitations period applies to this claim, thelimitations period could be equitably tolled based on theallegations of fraud in the complaint.

SEES NO ERRORIN DENIAL OF DOCTOR'SDISCRIMINATION CLAIM     A unanimous panel of the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appealshas found no basis to overturn a federal jury's verdict that aMichigan cardiologist was not discriminated against on the basisof his age or Mexican heritage.  Muzquiz v. W.A. Foote MemorialHospital, Nos. 94-1088, 94-1089 and 94-1420 (6th Cir.).     The panel held that the dismissal of the doctor's antitrust,breach of contract and other claims was based on a lack ofevidence or compelled by legal precedent.     Moses Muzquiz is a medical doctor of Hispanic descent whopracticed cardiology in Texas and Mexico for many years prior toestablishing a practice in Michigan in 1985.  He became a memberof the provisional staff of W.A. Foote Memorial Hospital in 1989.When Foote established a cardiac catheterization laboratory in1991, Muzquiz applied for invasive cardiology privileges.Muzquiz was the oldest member of Foote's staff to apply.     The review of his credentials ran into some difficulty asMuzquiz had performed cardiac catheterizations only in Mexico.As a result, Foote's Credentials Committee had to rely ontranslated patient charts obtained from a Mexican hospital.  Therequested films of catheterizations and the original charts werenot available.  The Credentials Committee recommended thatMuzquiz be granted provisional cardiac catheterization privilegesbased on favorable evaluations of his first 10 cardiacprocedures.     However, Foote's Medical Executive Committee rejected thatrecommendation, opining that Muzquiz's time away fromcatheterization procedures required that his first 25 proceduresbe proctored.  Foote's Board of Trustees adopted the MedicalExecutive Committee's recommendation on Jan. 22, 1992.     Muzquiz subsequently objected to the 25-procedurerequirement, as well as to Foote's selection of proctors for hisprocedures.  Muzquiz viewed the physicians selected by Foote asdirect competitors.  On March 17, 1992, Muzquiz formally rejectedthe conditions placed on his provisional catheterizationprivileges.  On March 25, 1992, Foote's Board of Trusteeswithdrew the provisional grant of privileges to Muzquiz.     Muzquiz filed suit in U.S. District Court for the EasternDistrict of Michigan on Sept. 21, 1992, alleging violations ofTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Elliot-LarsenCivil Rights Act.  Muzquiz's suit also advanced antitrust andbreach of contract claims that were dismissed by the districtcourt.  After two days of deliberation, a jury found that Muzquizhad not been discriminated against on the basis of his age ornational origin, although it said that "[w]e would hope thatFoote Hospital and Muzquiz would go forward speedily to honor hisresidence requirement of ten cases."     Foote's post-judgment motion for attorneys' fees under theHealth Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) was denied by thedistrict court on March 24, 1994.     Muzquiz appealed the district court's judgment.  Foote fileda cross-appeal, as well as an appeal of the district court'sdenial of attorneys' fees.               The Sixth Circuit panel unanimously affirmed both theverdict against Muzquiz and the denial of attorneys' fees.     The panel said that the district court did not err inrefusing to allow Muzquiz to question witnesses in an attempt toprove that Foote's credentialling process, while faciallyneutral, had a disparate impact on protected groups underTitle VII.  The panel said that, at most, that line ofquestioning would show bias against Muzquiz's medical training inMexico, but not bias against people of Mexican heritage.  Thepanel also refused to assign error to the district court'srefusal to allow other testimony on the discrimination claim.The panel said that this testimony either did not indicate a biasbased on Muzquiz's heritage or was "simply not probative ofdiscriminatory animus."     Muzquiz's assertion that the district court erred indismissing his antitrust and breach of contract claims was alsorejected by the panel.  The panel followed the teaching in NurseMidwifery Assn. v. Hibbert, 918 F.2d 605 (6th Cir. 1990), that"the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine prevents a finding ofconspiracy between a hospital and its medical staff...."  Absenta conspiracy, there was no violation of Section 1 of the ShermanAct, said the panel.  As to the breach of contract claim, thepanel agreed with the district court that judicial review ofstaffing decisions by private hospitals is precluded by Sarin v.Samaritan Health Center, 440 N.W.2d 80 (MI App. 1989).     The panel also rejected Muzquiz's argument that the districtcourt placed undue limitations on pretrial discovery, noting thatthe district court's "dismissal of [Muzquiz's] claims was basedon legal determinations that could not have been altered by anyfurther discovery."  In any event, the panel noted that Muzquizhad never filed a motion to compel discovery.     Finally, the panel said, "we conclude that Dr. Muzquiz'sclaims were not without foundation so as to entitle [Foote] to anaward of attorney fees and costs under HCQIA."  The panel opinedthat "Dr. Muzquiz had a legitimate factual basis for allegingthat the extreme delay in his application processing was theresult of a bias...."  Furthermore, the panel said that "[t]hefact that several of his claims either lacked sufficient evidenceto go forward, or were determined to be precluded by legalprecedent in this circuit or under Michigan law, does not meanthat those claims were completely without foundation."Back to Headline List CopyrightEMPLOYMENT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 19969TH CIRCUIT FINDSEMPLOYER EAVESDROPPINGUNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE     An employer who conducts private surveillance on employeesand eavesdrops on the conversations of those it suspects areinvolved in union-related activities has violated the LaborManagement Relations Act's (LMRA) prohibition against unfairlabor practices, said the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals onDec. 1.  National Labor Relations Board v. Unbelievable, Inc.,No. 93-70236 (9th Cir.).     The panel ordered enforcement of the NLRB order on a findingthat the employer had wrongfully ejected union representativesbased on what was overheard and also violated the LMRA when itunilaterally established new disciplinary rules with respect tosuspected drug users and refused to make pension contributions.     Employer Unbelievable, Inc. does business as Frontier Hoteland Casino in Las Vegas.  In February 1990, collective bargainingbetween Frontier and the several unions which represent theculinary workers, bartenders and restaurant employees who workfor Frontier broke down.  After the collective bargainingagreement (CBA) expired, Frontier began to eavesdrop on employeeconversations and to eject union representatives for "harassing"other employees.  The administrative law judge found that, whileejection of union representatives is proper under somecircumstances, the several incidents cited by the union were"unremarkable" and not a proper basis for ejection.     As to the promulgation of new disciplinary rules, Frontierargued that five of the new rules did not involve changes whichwere "material, substantial or significant."  The ALJ and theappeals court panel disagreed, citing in particular a new rulewhich required employees suspected of being under the influenceof drugs or alcohol to undergo a medical examination or beterminated immediately.  The old rules said nothing about anexamination, noted the panel, and this change could hardly beconsidered "insubstantial."     As to the pension contributions, the panel noted that,during the negotiations over a new agreement, the provisions forpension fund contributions were never at issue.  The courtrejected Frontier's contention that under the LMRA there must bea written agreement with the employer before contributions to anemployee trust fund can be made. An employer has a duty torefrain from unilaterally changing the terms of employmentwithout first bargaining, said the court.     Here, Frontier was legally obligated to continue itscontributions to the pension fund after the expiration of theCBA, and was in violation of the law when it did not give theunion prior notice or opportunity to bargain, said the panel.Frontier also failed to present any evidence that changes in thepension plan were reasonably comprehended in its proposals beforenegotiations reached an impasse.  There had been no waiver by theunion of its right to bargain over the proposed pension planchange, it added.     The panel imposed sanctions against Frontier in the form ofattorneys' fees and double costs, as the company's appeal was"frivolous," concluded the court.     The NLRB was represented by NLRB attorney Frederick Havardin Washington, DC.  Counsel for the union was Barry Jellison andMichael Anderson of Cowell & Bowe in San Francisco.

Kurtz v. City of North Miami, No. 95-545(U.S.); see Employment LR, Nov. 28, 1995.     The argument was made in a brief in response to a petitionfrom Arlene Kurtz for a writ of certiorari to a Florida SupremeCourt ruling that a regulation requiring a job applicant not tohave used tobacco for at least one year before applying for workwith the City of North Miami is not an intrusion of privacyrights.     The Florida Supreme Court held that Kurtz had no reasonableexpectation of privacy when she applied for a position with thecity and that the city, saying that it enacted the requirement toreduce costs and bolster productivity, had established acompelling interest.     The city said that the only issue before the Florida SupremeCourt was a state law certified question of whether the Floridaconstitution barred the city's employment policy.  Because theonly issue presented to the Florida Supreme Court was the statelaw issue decided and certified by the state district court, theSupreme Court should deny Kurtz's petition for certiorari, thecity said.     Further, the city said, the state Supreme Court did not"decide," as Kurtz asserted, a question of federal constitutionallaw, and no question of due process.  Therefore, the issue is notone that warrants Supreme Court review.     Also, Kurtz's portrayal of the factual and proceduralpredicates of the case were "profoundly inaccurate," the citysaid, adding that it proved through undisputed evidence that thepolicy was legitimate and rational, "while Kurtz proved nothingat all."     The city's response was submitted by Thomas M. Pflaum ofMicanopy, FL, and by Pedro P. Echarte Jr. of Miami.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMPLOYMENT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996CA CT. GRANTS JUDGMENTFOR DEFENSE IN OFFICEEMF EXPOSURE CASE     Holding that the plaintiffs would be unable to submit causalevidence associating electromagnetic field exposure to thedevelopment of cancer in humans, a California Superior Courtjudge on Dec. 8 granted defendant Southern California Edison's(SCE) motion for summary judgment in a suit by office workers whosay they developed cancer due to the location of an SCEtransformer beneath their office.  Johsz et al. v. Koll Co. etal., No. 726765 (CA Super. Ct., Orange Cty.); see Employment LR,Sept. 27, 1994.     Orange County Superior Court Judge H. Warren Siegel said heagreed with SCE's assertion that plaintiffs' proffered testimonywould not meet the Kelly-Frye admissibility test.  Suchtestimony, which was to have been given at trial beginning onJan. 8, he said, failed to conclusively say EMF causedplaintiffs' cancers.  The testimony expected from plaintiffsexperts Samuel Milham, M.D., M.P.H., and David Michael Ozonoff,M.D., suggested only that "there is a causal association; thatbased on statistics it 'may' be a cause," the judge ruled.     The judge added, "Statistics may lend credence to an opinionthat EMF caused plaintiff's cancers, but there is no expertopinion that it did in these cases and Ozonoff and Milham are theonly causation experts proposed by the plaintiffs on the EMFissue."     Co-defendants Koll Co. and Grubb & Ellis joined in theutility's summary judgment motion.     Plaintiffs Michael and Jill Johsz, James and ChristianneNichols, and Mary Ann Stewart voluntarily dismissed withprejudice their causes of action for battery and fraudulentconcealment and their request for punitive damages after SCEmoved for summary judgment on Nov. 7.  Plaintiff attorney AnneeDella Donna, who plans to file a motion for a new trial by earlyJanuary, says the ruling does not affect companion cases Younkinv. Southern California Edison, in which a March settlementconference is slated, or Muir v. Southern California Edison,which is scheduled for trial on May 20, 1996.     The plaintiffs discounted SCE's summary judgment motionclaim that the Kelly-Frye test is inapplicable, arguing that itapplies only to admissibility of "new scientific methods, devicesor techniques" in criminal cases.  They instead said that theirconclusions and opinions should be judged, and are shownreliable, under the 35-year-old "Hill Criteria," developed inEngland.  The Hill Criteria, they argued, include strength,consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient,plausibility, coherence, experiment and analogy.     "Plaintiffs argue that the Kelly-Frye rule is not applicableto the scientific principle of whether EMF causes cancer, butrather is limited to novel scientific techniques, methods ortests," SCE responded.  "In support of this argument, plaintiffscite several California decisions which have held that the Kelly-Frye rule is not applicable to medical opinion testimony based onan examination of a particular physical or psychological injury."     The utility continues, "[H]owever, the cases cited byplaintiffs on this point are inapposite in that the issue withrespect to Edison's motion for summary judgment is not theadmissibility of medical opinion testimony that EMF causedplaintiffs' specific cancers, but rather the admissibility ofscientific evidence on the threshold issue of whether EMF causescancer generally.  This distinction is highlighted by the factthat the expert declarations submitted to plaintiffs inopposition to Edison's motion for summary judgment do notindicate that either of the declarants have ever examined any ofthe plaintiffs in this action, but rather base their opinionssolely upon scientific literature and epidemiologic studiesregarding the health effects of EMF."     Opposing SCE's motion, the plaintiffs challenged thequalifications of defense experts Philip Cole, M.D., Chairman ofthe University of Alabama School of Public Health's Department ofEpidemiology, and Jack D. Sahl, M.S., M.P.H., Ph.D, an SCEresearch scientist since 1983.  Both men, the plaintiffs argued,"are so tied to the utility companies that their testimony is notcredible."     The plaintiffs added, "These 'utility experts' are tooclosely identified with the utility view to access fairly andimpartially the nature and extent of any opposing scientificviews....  Before 1992, neither Sahl or Cole conducted anyepidemiological research themselves.  Sahl published a study onbehalf of his employer, SCE, and expectedly reached a negativeresult.  Cole's only epidemiological study was conducted in thepast year, even though both have held themselves out to thepublic as epidemiologists for years."     SCE replied, "In contrast to the declaration of Dr. Cole[that there is no causal relationship between human cancerdevelopment and EMF exposure], the declarations submitted byplaintiffs are devoid of any reference to general acceptancewithin the scientific community of the principle that EMF causescancer.  Rather than addressing the consensus of the scientificcommunity, Dr. Milham simply states that there are a number ofbiological mechanisms by which EMF 'may' cause cancer, that EMF'may' effect and compromise the immune system, and that, in hisopinion, EMF exposure promotes a number of cancers."

Namislo v. Akzo ChemicalCo., No. CV-92-1127 (AL Sup. Ct.).     Mary Namislo was employed in a chlorine manufacturing plantwas that was owned in succession by Stauffer Chemical Co.,Chesebrough-Ponds and Akzo Chemical Co.  In 1992, she and herhusband, Ricky, sued Akzo on behalf of themselves and theirdaughter, Amber, alleging that both she and Amber had sufferedmercury poisoning and that Ricky had suffered loss of consortium.The suit named Akzo, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. andseveral of Mary Namislo's co-workers.     The complaint alleged that Akzo and the co-workers hadnegligently and wantonly caused the mercury poisoning and hadnegligently failed to warn that mercury created a dangerouscondition at the plant.  The suit also alleged fraud, outrage andwillful conduct.     When the trial court dismissed all of the claims againstAkzo and the co-workers, the Namislos appealed to the SupremeCourt, which reversed and remanded on the grounds that theWorkers' Compensation Act does not exclude Akzo's liability tononemployees such as Amber.  The court ruled further that the actdoes not bar Amber's claims against the co-workers on fraud,outrage and willfulness nor does it bar the Namislos' claimsagainst the co-workers for Amber's medical expenses and the lossof her services.     On remand, the trial court again granted summary judgmentdismissing claims against Stauffer and Chesebrough-Ponds fornegligence and wantonness, against the co-workers for willfulconduct and outrage, and against all the defendants forintentional fraud and intentional suppression of material facts.               On this second appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the trialcourt's judgment on all claims.  Namislo contended that the trialcourt erred in dismissing the willful conduct claims because ithad incorrectly held that those claims were barred by theWorkers' Compensation Act's exclusivity provisions.      Under the provisions of Section 25-5-11(b), theoccupational disease provision, an action against third partiesor co-employees is not a claim for workmen's compensation but isa tort action for damages that is removed from the exclusiveremedy provisions of the act, the appellate court ruled.  Thatsection specifies that "if personal injury or death of anemployee results from the willful conduct, ...of any...employeeof the same employer...the employee shall have a cause of actionagainst the person...."     The issue here was whether Namislo had offered substantialevidence of willful conduct, and the Supreme Court found that shedid not.  She contended that the willful conduct was the removalof safety devices from machines that otherwise would haveprotected her from exposure to mercury.     She alleged that her co-workers failed to maintain exhaustfans and a scrubber in the "cell house," a structure in the plantwhere the chlorine gas is produced, which she was required toclean.  She also claimed that her co-employees provided the wrongfilters for a respirator that she used while performing thecleaning.     The Supreme Court ruled that the scrubber and exhaust fanswere not safety devices within the meaning of the Workers'Compensation Act because they are part of the system to producechlorine gas, not to provide safety to workers.  In addition, thecourt said, while co-employees may be held liable for the removalor omission of a manufacturer's safety device from a machine "such as the respirator Namislo used " nothing was removed oromitted from the respirator and, therefore, it does not fallwithin the purview of the act.     The appellate court also affirmed the trial court's judgmentwith regard to the remaining claims, finding no evidence "thatthe defendants' actions in handling [Namislo's] claim were 'sooutrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyondall possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrociousand utterly intolerable in a civilized society.'"  It quotedAmerican Road Service Co. v. Inmon, 394, So.2d [361] at 365 (AL1980), and Nabors v. St. Paul Insurance Co., 489 So.2d 573 (AL1986).     Namislo was represented by Christopher E.

Manning of the Northern District ofIllinois recently dismissed a repetitive stress injury suitagainst International Business Machines Corp. on the basis thatthe plaintiff, a former IBM employee, was statutorily barred frompursuing a product liability action against her former employer.McCall v. IBM Corp., No. 95-581 (ND IL).     In dismissing the suit, Judge Manning found controlling thedecision in Toth v. Westinghouse Elevator Co., 114 Ill.App.3d905, 449 N.E.2d 1005 (1983).  "That case holds that an employerin Illinois who is also the manufacturer of a product used in thecourse of employment is not liable in damages to his own employeein a products liability suit," said Judge Manning.     Judge Manning also cited the Illinois Workers' CompensationAct.  That statute says, at 820 ILCS 305/5(a):     No common law or statutory right to recover damages from the     employer...for injury or death sustained by any employee     while engaged in the line of his duty as such employee,     other than the compensation herein provided, is available to     any employee....     Judge Manning rejected the plaintiff's assertion that hercase fell within the "dual capacity" exception to the exclusiveremedy provision laid out in Sharp v. Gallagher Tractor Co., 85Ill.2d 322, 227 N.E.2d 786 (1983), and others.  "That doctrinedoes not apply unless the manufacturer is a separate legal entityfrom the employer, said the judge.  "There is no evidence thatIBM, as manufacturer, has a separate legal identity from that asplaintiff's employer," she added.     Emma McCall brought an action against IBM on Dec. 30, 1994,in Cook County Circuit Court, alleging that she sufferedrepetitive stress injuries from using an IBM keyboard while inIBM's employ from 1989 until early 1993.  The matter was removedto federal district court on Jan. 30, 1995.     IBM moved to dismiss McCall's complaint, citing theexclusive remedy provision of the Illinois Workers' CompensationAct.  IBM asserted that under the Act, McCall could not bring aproduct liability suit against her employer.     In defending her action from dismissal, McCall cited, inaddition to IBM's role as her employer, IBM's "entirely separateand distinct second role as a designer, manufacturer and sellerof computer keyboards."     "The duties, responsibilities, and obligations of IBMimposed by the tenets of product liability law generateobligations upon IBM wholly unrelated and distinct from its roleas an employer," added McCall.Back to Headline List WT03-B07-28IA087-000634-B046-266http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/la04.html 205.156.212.5 19970122033141 text/html 44182HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 03:29:44 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:01 GMTContent-length: 43995Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/la04.html Sample Issue Copyright INDUSTRIAL HEALTH & HAZARDS UPDATE via NewsNet January 1990 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES * GENERAL INTEREST REPORTS * ELECTRONIC SUPERVISION: A NEW TECHNOLOGY RESULTING IN NEW JOB TENSIONS (81 words) MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS (147 words) SAFETY IN THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY (153 words) HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRANSPORTATION (91 words) FEDERAL TRAINING FOR FIRST RESPONDERS TO HIGHWAY AND RAILROAD HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INCIDENTS (105 words) EXPEDIENT EMERGENCY SANITATION MEASURES (76 words) SAFETY WITH INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS (123 words) CUMULATIVE TRAUMA DISORDER MANUAL (210 words) NIOSH CERTIFIED EQUIPMENT LIST (66 words) COMFORT AND HUMAN FACTORS IN OFFICE AND RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS (76 words) SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE USED AS A TRACER GAS (128 words) GUIDANCE MANUAL FOR FILTRATION/DISINFECTION OF PUBLIC SURFACE WATER SUPPLIES (47 words) GROUND-FAULT PROTECTION AND ANALYSIS (107 words) ** POWER-FREQUENCY ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS ** BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS (157 words) THE ELECTRICAL ENVIRONMENT PRODUCED BY OVERHEAD POWER LINES (64 words) EFFECTS OF TRANSMISSION LINE FIELDS ON CATTLE (99 words) ** WASTES, EMISSIONS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL ** RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) ORIENTATION MANUAL (93 words) ANALYSIS OF U.S. MUNICIPAL WASTE COMBUSTION OPERATING PRACTICES (81 words) COMBINED SO2/NOx FLUE GAS CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES (93 words) ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE AND THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT (209 words) ** SUPERFUND ** SUPERFUND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY EVALUATION (88 words) ASSESSMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUPERFUND APPLICATIONS (107 words) ** LIGHTNING ** LIGHTNING AS AN AIRCRAFT HAZARD (89 words) THE FLORIDA LIGHTNING AND RADAR EXPERIMENT (68 words) ** FIRE SAFETY ** DETONABILITY OF HYDROCARBON FUELS IN AIR (61 words) SHIPBOARD FIRES (66 words) FIRE EXTINGUISHING AGENTS (76 words) FIRE ALARMS AND FIRE DETECTORS (120 words) ** RISK ASSESSMENTS ** RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES (50 words) WHAT YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT WHEN DOING A RISK ASSESSMENT (44 words) ASSESSING POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF INCINERATING HAZARDOUS WASTES AT SEA (51 words) GUIDANCE FOR CARCINOGEN RISK ASSESSMENT (79 words) UNCERTAINTIES IN QUANTITATIVE CANCER RISK ASSESSMENT (89 words) ANALYTICAL METHODS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT RISK-BASED CRITERIA FOR CHEMICALS IN MUNICIPAL SLUDGE (46 words) HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT OF CHEMICAL MIXTURES (72 words) POTENTIAL RISKS FROM EXPOSURE TO ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN INDOOR AIR (67 words) ** RADIATION ** DOSE REDUCTION AND RADIATION PROTECTION IN MEDICAL RADIOLOGY (94 words) DEFUELING THE THREE MILE ISLAND REACTOR (75 words) ** ASBESTOS ** ASBESTOS AND SILICATE POLLUTION IN THE WORKPLACE (103 words) ASBESTOS REMOVAL (91 words) EVALUATION OF ASBESTOS LEVELS IN TWO SCHOOLS BEFORE AND AFTER ASBESTOS REMOVAL (61 words) ** OIL LEAKAGE, STORAGE, DISPOSAL ** OIL REFINERY GENERATION/DISPOSAL OF WASTES (88 words) INLAND OIL SPILLS (98 words) SUMMARY OF THE NEW UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK SYSTEM REGULATIONS (84 words) FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REGULATIONS FOR UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS (77 words) USING EXTERNAL LEAK DETECTORS TO PREVENT PETROLEUM CONTAMINATION FROM UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS (79 words) CopyrightINDUSTRIAL HEALTH & HAZARDS UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1990ELECTRONIC SUPERVISION: A NEW TECHNOLOGY RESULTINGIN NEW JOB TENSIONSThe capabilities of new computer and communicationtechnologies for monitoring employees' activities inthe workplace are presented.
