Now, here's the news:Back to Headline List CopyrightPAC-RIM DEFENSE MARKETING via NewsNetJuly 23, 1990JAPANESE DEFENSE MINISTER SEEKS LIMITATIONS IN NEW BUDGET     In spite of prime ministerial support for moderate defensegrowth, Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) Director General YozoIshikawa said this week that the agency will likely limit defensespending in the next five-year defense plan (FYDP) following theSoviet agreement to allow a unified Germany under NATO.     Ishikawa said that easing tensions in Europe, coupled withthis new Soviet agreement, will eventually reach the "Asianregion."  He added that in order to win public understanding ondefense expenditures, "it is natural that we try as much aspossible to restrain the scale of the defense budget."     The statement comes after Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu andJDA Director General for Policy Akira Hiyoshi last week voicedmore active support for a strong military posture, despitedecreased tensions between the United States and the SovietUnion.     Citing differences between the European and Asian politicalsituation, Hiyoshi emphasized that the region is still militarily"unstable and fluid."  He pointed to the Soviet Union's strategicmodernization and upgrading of their naval forces with moreadvanced weapons, the People's Republic of China's large groundforces, and the continued war in Cambodia, as justifications formaintaining a 6 percent annual growth in the next five-year plan(1991-95).Budget Details of the New Five-Year Plan     Last month, JDA estimated the nation's next five-year planwould total approximately $160 billion and will call for flatgrowth in procurement--with more money going to maintenance ofadvanced systems--as a direct response to the reduced threatfrom, and warming relations with, the Soviet Union andneighboring countries.     Japan's current five-year program (1986-90) totals about$126 billion, under which the defense budget has seen a rough 5.6percent annual increase.  Some in the government, however, arelooking to reduce that annual growth to below 5 percent, withoutexceeding the 1 percent of Gross National Product (GNP) ceiling.     Japan's Parliamentary Security Council, after a meeting withJDA officials last month on the new five-year defense program,says that after a several more meetings, it will propose its newbudget to Japanese legislators early this fall.     A final FYDP program will be defined and voted on byDecember, in time for the government to resolve its entire fiscal1991 budget plan.Major Procurement Programs     Major systems the JDA is looking to procure after 1991include the Boeing E-3A AWACS aircraft, LTV's Multiple LaunchRocket System (MLRS), and four air tankers.  Opinions are dividedbetween the JDA Air Staff Office (ASO) and other departments ofthe Defense Agency as to what type of air tankers to buy and howthey should be procured.     Japanese sources say that it will be very tough to overcomeobjections from opposition party leaders who charge that airtankers would pose a threat to other Pacific Rim nations thatwould perceive an extended Japanese attack capability.     The ASO, however, maintains it is possible to win approvalsince the air tanker would be used for extending endurance offighters on patrol only in Japanese air space, which would notpose a threat to neighboring countries.     Additional continued procurement programs include:     AH-64A Apache--Outlook for introduction of McDonnellDouglas' attack helicopter during the next defense program isbleak as procurement cuts in the purchase of new equipment willaffect future buys, a Japanese source says.  The government addsthat Fuji Heavy Industries will be hit hardest because productionof the AH-IS anti-tank helicopter will end in four years, leavingthe firm without any guarantees of future contracts.     New aircraft trainer--Development of a follow-on toMitsubishi Heavy Industries' (MHI) current T-2 supersonic jettrainer is designed mainly to foster indigenous aircraftdevelopment capability, rather than meet a requirement to trainpilots, the government says.  But JDA officials say they arereluctant to develop a new trainer after the experience of theFSX, in which the U.S. Congress delayed the program for over ayear because it did not approve of the technology transfersinvolved.     Under a contract to Japan's Technical Research andDevelopment Institute, MHI has also converted one T-2 into atestbed that utilizes horizontal and vertical canards to increasethe flight envelope, a program similar in principle to theU.S./German X-31 Enhanced Fighter Maneuverability (EFM) aircraft.     New light helicopter-A new light helicopter to replace theKawasaki/McDonnell Douglas OH-6 may be developed in the latterhalf of 1990s, JDA officials say.  The original helicopter wasdeveloped by Hughes (now McDonnell Douglas) Helicopters in thelate 1970s and is produced under license by Kawasaki HeavyIndustries.     Hawk and Patriot missiles--A new medium-range surface-to-airmissile to replace Raytheon's radar-guided Hawk may be developedin the 1990s.  The U.S. Army began fielding the improved version,the PIP III Hawk, last year.  The PIP III provides a low-altitude, simultaneous engagement capability and enhancedelectronic counter-measures.  Procurement of Raytheon's Patriotsurface-to-air missile will end during the middle of the newfive-year program.Back to Headline List CopyrightPAC-RIM DEFENSE MARKETING via NewsNetJuly 23, 1990MITSUBISHI SEEKS $333 MILLION MORE FOR FSX     Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the Japanese prime contractorin the development of the FSX fighter, has asked the JapaneseDefense Agency (JDA) for an additional $333 million and anotheryear's time to complete development of the fighter.     Mitsubishi says that more funding is necessary as thedevelopment estimate submitted by the U.S. prime contractor,General Dynamics, is higher than the original estimate of about$1 billion.  Company officials add that having to develop theaviation control software on its own has pushed up program costs.FSX development was originally slated to be completed within fiveyears, and achieve operational deployment by the late 1990s.General Dynamics would not comment on the cost changes.     MHI currently has a small staff of engineers at GeneralDynamics' Fort Worth, Texas, plant working on design anddevelopment of the FSX, while General Dynamics, in turn, has asmall contingent of engineers working in MHI's domestic aircraftfacilities.  Although the FSX is based on GD's F-16C, a GeneralDynamics official tells us that an actual F-16 is not being usedas a baseboard for FSX development, only certain F-16technologies are.  The FSX is a complete and independentdevelopment program.Back to Headline List CopyrightPAC-RIM DEFENSE MARKETING via NewsNetJuly 23, 1990ENGINE FOR JAPANESE TILT-ROTOR TO BE SELECTED SOON     The selection of an engine for the TW-68, a Japanese tilt-wing aircraft, will be made within the next 90 days, J. DavidKocurek, president of Ishida Aerospace Group (IAG), tells PAC-RIMDEFENSE MARKETING correspondent Ernest Blazar.     Currently, IAG is looking at both Rolls-Royce Turbomeca andPratt & Whitney powerplants for the airplane.  He said, "Theaircraft is sizing out nicely" and he is pleased with theaircraft's technological progress.     Flight testing of the TW-68 is scheduled for 1994 withcertification expected to be complete by 1997.     The range and speed of the planned aircraft are estimated at300-350 knots and 700 static miles, respectively.     Dual Mode Air Vehicles and the Ishida Corporation of Japanare jointly developing the aircraft which is capable of liftingoff like a helicopter and flying like an airplane.     Though some see the TW-68 as a Japanese version of the V-22Osprey, jointly developed by Bell Helicopters and BoeingHelicopters, the new aircraft is designed for commercial purposesrather than the military requirements that drove the Osprey'sdesign and development.     Ground-breaking ceremonies were last month for the IshidaAerospace Research Technical Center at Fort Worth's AllianceAirport.  Construction will unfold in two phases.  The firstphase is a 20,000-square-foot building housing design and officefacilities.  After its completion at the end of next year, phasetwo construction will begin, bringing the total area to 60,000square feet.  Phase two will witness the construction of theassembly buildings.V-22/TW-68 Seen as Complimentary Aircraft in Novel Market     Kocurek said he does not particularly view the V-22 Ospreytilt-rotor aircraft as a competitor.  He explained the V-22"complements" the Ishida tilt-wing.  The most important item toremember at this time, he said, is the necessity of building up acommercial vertical lift constituency in the fixed wing,rotorcraft operator community.  That constituent backing, he wenton, is how the proper infrastructure for vertical lift willeventually be developed.     However, the aircraft are different, he told our sisterpublication DEFENSE DAILY.  As most helicopters haul passengersrather than spend the majority of their time hovering, a tilt-wing aircraft is better suited to carrying passengers, he said."The V-22 is entirely a military aircraft.  The only thing takenfrom it is experience," he added.  Additionally, the V-22 is inthe 40,000-pound range, whereas the TW-68 is around 14,000pounds.     The FAA has been picking up some momentum in both theoperations and certification sides of the shop, Kocurek said.     IAG is predicting a monthly production rate of threeaircraft.  Furthermore, it estimates that during the productionrun between 1997 and 2005 approximately 300 aircraft will beproduced, 100 of which will be taken by the North Americanmarket.     The Pacific Rim will take the remainder of the production,and the Middle East is seen as contributing to the customer base.As soon as the production line is stabilized, Kocurek said a co-production venture will begin on one of the Japanese islands.     In regards to some of the rumors circulating in the industryabout T-Ishida siphoning off Bell Helicopter engineers, Kocureksaid it was not true.  He has not had to solicit any of hisengineers.  As for Bell, "I hope it is a friendly rivalry."     Kocurek held out the idea that a model tilt-wing port willbe established to demonstrate the value of the technology.Perhaps a Dallas-to-Houston route will be set up.  Some of thedifficulty in establishing novel vertical lift transport in theUnited States is the stumbling block of establishing aninfrastructure.  A package deal of aircraft and vertiport may bein the works, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightPAC-RIM DEFENSE MARKETING via NewsNetJuly 23, 1990AUSTRALIAN DEFENSE OFFICIALS CHARGED WITH PROCUREMENT FRAUD     Australian government police last week said they haveuncovered a scam in which tens of millions of dollars of thenation's military procurement budget was annually misappropriatedby military officials as the result of an effort by industryexecutives to secure contract awards.     Commander Jim Allen of the Australian Federal Police (AFP),who declined to specify the areas in which defense spending fraudtook place, said a year-long investigation by AFP officersuncovered six instances of Fraud in which military procurementofficials and industry executives colluded to intervene in thecontract tendering process.     Allen added that there was also evidence of a "revolvingdoor," where former defense department officers were offeredemployment by companies bidding for contracts, noting that thesix cases identified appeared to be only the tip of the iceberg.     Australian Defense Minister Robert Ray confirmed theexistence of fraud in the defense department, but rejected thepolice assertion that it involved millions of dollars.  "Althoughthe total value of the contracts being investigated amount to[several] million dollars, there is no valid financial data tosupport the claims that the dollar loss to defense through fraud[amounts to] millions of dollars a year," he said.     Ray said two cases of fraud are currently active courtcases, while five other cases are still under investigation.  Twocases, meanwhile, have been closed, one because of a lack ofevidence and another following the conviction of a defensecontractor.     Allen, who worked for several years as the AFP's seniorliaison officer in Washington, D.C., said corruption and waste indefense procurement costs the United States $45 billion annually,the equivalent of 11 new aircraft carriers.  He said evidencesuggests similar corruption has developing in Australia's defensecircles.  Australia's annual defense budget totals about $6billion.Back to Headline List CopyrightPAC-RIM DEFENSE MARKETING via NewsNetJuly 23, 1990SOVIETS WILL NOT UNDERCUT U.S. LAUNCH PRICES AT CAPE YORK     The Soviet Union does not intend to capture the world marketwith low-price launches at Australia's Cape York facility,according to representatives of the Soviet civil space agencyGlavcosmos and a U.S. firm that markets Russian space products.     "The Soviets have no intention of dominating the market(through predatory pricing), they only want a share of it,"Chester Taylor, an official with SpaceCommerce Corp. (SCC) of Houston told our sister publicationSOVIET AEROSPACE & TECHNOLOGY.  "The Soviets have said manytimes, and I repeat it now, that they will sell launches at worldmarket prices," he added.  SCC markets Soviet boosters and otherspace technology to U.S. customers.     A senior Soviet space official confirmed Taylor's remarks,although critics and some members of the fledgling U.S.commercial launch industry expressed doubt as to the veracity ofthe Soviet price claims.  Unlike U.S. firms, the Soviet couldoffer low launch prices due to the subsidies and artificialpricing system that has dominated its economy.     The Bush Administration announced at the Houston EconomicSummit that the White House would allow launch of Americancommercial payloads into orbit by Soviet-built boosters.     Frank Gaffney, former assistant secretary of defense, said,"While the Bush Administration avers that the Soviets will beobliged to charge fair and reasonable prices for their launchservices, this is, at best, wishful thinking; at worst, it is acanard."     Gaffney added that Moscow will, like Beijing, disregardcommitments made to the United States to market its boosters atfair prices.  Under a January 1989 pact with the United States,China agreed to limit itself to a total of nine commerciallaunches over a five-year period.  In return, the United Stateswould allow American payloads to be exported to China andlaunched on its Long March rocket.  Last February, Western firmscomplained that China's contract to launch Arabsat for $25million, roughly half the going price, constituted a breach ofthe agreement with the United States.     In addition, the Soviet has a large stable of boosters and astrong desire for hard currency.  The Soviet has conducted justone commercial satellite launch--the low price charged to theIndian government for the March 1988 mission was a specialintroductory offer, according to Soviet officials.     The price Glavcosmos would charge to orbit a commercialsatellite has taken on increasing relevance since remarks maderecently by Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, andSecretary of State James Baker that indicate the White House willapprove a proposal by USBI Co., a subsidiary of UnitedTechnologies Corp., to manage an Australian space facility.     The space port, known as Cape York, would feature launchesof commercial payloads, including American-made satellites, usingthe Soviet SL-16 Zenit rocket.     The three-stage Zenit, which can boost 5,860 kg togeostationary transfer orbit, is well known as the strap-onrocket for the Soviet heavy-lift Energia launcher, which carriesthe Soviet Buran space shuttle.     In addition to price, some critics of Cape York fear U.S.satellite technology will be acquired by the Soviet despiteUSBI's claims to the contrary.  Gaffney is concerned that a"short cut" to Cape York will be to allow U.S. payloads to belaunched in the Soviet Union.  "Let there be no mistake about it:This is a formula for the wholesale compromise of sensitive,military relevant technologies," Gaffney said.First Launch Seen in 1995     "This [the U.S. decision] is a major step...[since] 60percent of commercial launches are of U.S.-made satellites,"Stephen Williams, Cape York managing director, said last week.He predicted the first Zenit rockets could be launched by 1995.     The spaceport would be the world's first and will cost anestimated $384 million to build.  The Cape York authority isplanning five launches annually and hopes to take 20 percent ofthe global commercial satellite market.  The site in northeastAustralia is seen as a prime candidate due to its proximity tothe equator--only the Ariane complex at Kourou is closer.     Other industry officials said a commercial launch policyreport prepared by the National Space Council had been approvedby officials at State, Defense, Commerce and NASA.     It now awaits the president's approval, which is supposed tobe imminent, officials said.  The report will include provisionsconcerning launching of U.S. satellites on Soviet boosters.  Aswe went to press, the policy had not been formally released.Back to Headline List CopyrightPAC-RIM DEFENSE MARKETING via NewsNetJuly 23, 1990NEC TO CONSTRUCT TECHNOLOGY CENTER IN EUROPE     NEC Corp. of Japan plans to open a European TechnologyCenter (ETC) in Dusseldorf, West Germany, in October as part ofan ongoing effort to expand its European semiconductor business.The center, the first of its kind, is primarily intended todevelop and design Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)chips, NEC said.

Officials from Mitsubishi Research Institute, MitsubishiHeavy Industries (MHI), Nissan Motor Co., and Ishikawajima-HarimaHeavy Industries (IHI), which purchased the Contam softwaresystem without proper U.S. licenses, contend they were unawarethat they lacked the relevant import permits from the U.S.government.  They further noted that there are no procedures forverifying whether or not a U.S. company has received allnecessary licenses.     The software was sold by Plume Technology, a small defensesoftware contractor located in Los Angeles.  Four weeks ago,Plume executive Ronald Hoffman was arrested for illegallyexporting the Contam software to Japan.  According to a U.S.government affidavit filed in Los Angeles federal court, thesoftware continues to be developed to analyze missile plumes andexhaust trails to provide missile defense data for develop SDI.     A spokesman for Mitsubishi said the Japanese companiesbought the software "because it was interesting, but that's allwe can say."     The U.S. government is still investigating the softwaresale.  The Pentagon's SDI Organization (SDIO) declined to commenton the case, noting that it is still pending.  The U.S.Department of Justice also declined to comment.

An announcement over the US military television, Far East Network, saidtravel to Manila by some 9,000 airmen at the headquarters of the 13th AirForce is prohibited except for official missions.   The announcement said exceptions could be granted on a "case-by-casebasis" by commanders at Clark, 50 miles north of Manila.   Clark's travel ban followed a similar directive Tuesday from the commanderof US naval forces in the Philippines at Subic Bay Naval Station "due toincreased threats to US military members."   Some 6,000 servicemen are stationed at Subic, the sprawling repair andlogistics center for the US Seventh Fleet, 60 miles northwest of thePhilippine capital.   Eight Americans have been killed in the country in the past two years inslayings the government blames on communist guerrillas.

Pentagon acquisition chief Paul Kaminski formally approved theconcept in a Dec. 21 memo that calls for the demonstration of atactical UAV system within 18 months, as well as a pre-planned productimprovement (P3I) to build upon air vehicle capabilities.      Kaminski's approval came on the heels of an agreement brokered bythe Joint Requirements Oversight Council in mid-December between theArmy and Navy over divergent system requirements.The originalsuggestion to scrap the traditional acquisition process in lieu of anaccelerated plan came last July after a year-long delay in releasing arequest for proposals (RFP).     Formerly known as the Maneuver variant, the Tactical UAV (TUAV)ACTD will include the procurement of six complete systems, two MobileMaintenance Facilities (MMFs), and eight attrition air vehicles andModular Mission Payloads (MMPs), according to Kaminski's memo.     Moreover, the TUAV "should have a maximum projected cost of$350,000 for the 33rd air vehicle and sensor," Kaminski stipulates."The TUAV selected for award should also have a maximum projected costof $300,000 for the 100th air vehicle and sensor."      The system is envisioned to have a range of 200 kilometers, beable to fly for three to four hours, and be launched from land or sea.     Officials in the Navy-led UAV Joint Program Office are anxious torelease a draft RFP for the TUAV ACTD as early as next week. A finalRFP is expected by the end of the month. Proposals are due aroundMarch 11 and a final contract award should be made on "reasonablyquick order," JPO spokesman Ray Colemon said earlier this month.     But the final RFP, and subsequent contract award, may not come sosoon, despite the level of importance the Army and Navy have ascribedto the tactical UAV mission, military and industry officials contend.      For example, Kaminski has directed several things be completedfirst to ensure a successful ACTD is pursued. The TUAV program managerhas been directed to develop an ACTD management plan which willinclude TUAV life cycle costs, logistics support, manpower, training,and transition to production. The program manager has yet to beselected, Colemon said.     The question of how best to transition from an ACTD to fullproduction--if such a decision is made--has plagued ACTDs in the pastand in this case has been a concern of Kaminski's.      Pentagon officials are grappling with the production issue withanother UAV program that was developed and built as an ACTD, the TierII Predator. The Predator ACTD, which ends in June, has been hailed asa success for its quick development and its deployment last year insupport of NATO forces in Bosnia.     An Integrated Product Team, which will evaluate the TUAV'smilitary utility, supportability, and producibility, is also beingestablished under Kaminski's orders.     And lastly, the director of the Defense Airborne ReconnaissanceOffice has been tasked to "develop a ground reception, processing, andcontrol system architecture and a schedule for achievinginteroperability with other UAVs, collection systems, and command,control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, andreconnaissance systems," Kaminski's memo states.  One industryofficial also foresees industry competitors having difficulty meetingthe requirements of the forthcoming RFP quickly. He points out thatthe ACTD requirements are significantly different than the originalManeuver UAV program. In particular, the range now called for isalmost four times greater than in the original program, which called for between 30 and 50kilometers."[Industry] can't add weight or fuel [to go that distance] without re-engineering the whole thing," the industry official said.      According to military and industry UAV officials, the potentialcompetitors for the TUAV ACTD contract include Westinghouse, Textron,Alliant Techsystems, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon , a Boeing-GeneralAtomics team, and interested Canadian and German firms.      Kaminski is expected to decide soon on the fate of another UAVprogram, the Hunter short-range UAV. The Joint Staff recommendedterminating the TRW -developed system late last year after numerousair vehicle crashes and programmatic blunders.      According to officials familiar with the discussions, some of theseven Hunter systems resulting from the existing production contract,including 56 air vehicles, will divvied up among operational Armyunits--and perhaps even the Marine Corps--over the next few months.But no additional vehicles will be built.     Some of the vehicles are likely to be put in storage, as theJoint Staff recommended, an Army official said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTACTICAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996STUDY SEES 50 PERCENT GROWTH IN U.S. EW MARKET BY 2001     The U.S. electronic warfare (EW) market projects U.S. sales willgrow from $1 billion last year to $1.45 billion by 2001, according toa new study by the market research firm Frost & Sullivan.     The study says the market will decline slightly to $946 millionin 1997  but rebound later in the decade when programs completingdevelopment move into production.     F&S says in U.S. Electronic Warfare Market that rotary-wingaircraft equipment will rise from 13 percent of total EW marketrevenues in 1995 to 20 percent in 2001 while the market forfighter/attack aircraft equipment will dip from 72 to 61 percent inthe same period.

"We have about 50 percent of the aircraft which is now 'actual'parts with known weights," says Stuart Dodge, Director of the JointProgram Office (JPO) in Washington, D.C. "They all conformed to ourpredictions. It shows we have the weight projections nailed down."     Dodge recently told JPO employees in a Christmas letter that theweight savings have exceeded--by more than a factor of two--the targetweights set by the Bell Boeing manufacturing team themselves.     "It's directly related to the advanced production processes inuse. Put simply, they minimize errors and guarantee first timeresults," Dodge said in a follow-up interview with sister publicationHelicopter News.     Dodge--who credits pioneering work done with the Boeing 777airliner with the production process success--says the first EMD(Engineering, Manufacturing and Development) Osprey fuselage wasrecently mated to its wing structure "with the tap of a rubbermallet."     This operation--which brought the Boeing Helicopters Div.,fuselage together with wings manufactured by Bell Helicopter Textronin Arlington, Texas,--represented an important milestone for theproject.     "It qualified us to begin giving out advanced long-lead contractsto vendors for the first Osprey production equipment items," he said.     Go-ahead for the first, or low rate initial production (LRIP),parts will follow the first flight of this aircraft set for Decemberof this year. It will be the seventh V-22, but the first built toproduction-level specifications.     "Everything hangs on meeting that [first flight] commitment,"Dodge said.     The stakes are high. With this flight complete, the governmentwill formally begin the process of buying 523 V-22s it has contractedfor (425 for the Marine Corps, 48 for the Navy and 50 for the SpecialOperations Command.)      Costs of the program show a similar story to the one on weight,he said, with the first EMD aircraft now exhibiting a "recurringflyaway" cost estimate of $32.5-million per aircraft. Dodge said thisis on track to meeting its the target price goal of $29.4-million (inFY '94 dollars.) A cost reduction program under assessment has thepotential of reducing this to $28.1 million.Back to Headline List CopyrightTACTICAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996ARPA EMBARKS ON ELECTRIC COMBAT VEHICLE DEMONSTRATION     The Advanced Research Projects Agency is soliciting proposals forelectric power systems for future use in land combat vehicles,according to an announcement in Commerce Business Daily.

[SOL BAA96-09, POC John Gully, 703/696-8401]   Back to Headline List CopyrightTACTICAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996PENTAGON RESTORES MOST OF ARMY's MONEY FOR RADIO PROGRAM      The Pentagon's civilian leadership last week heeded the Army'scries over the past few months and agreed to restore nearly all of theservice's funding request for the Single Channel Ground and AirborneRadio System (SINCGARS) in the next two fiscal years, according to DoDofficials and budget documents.     The service is now set to accelerate fielding of an improvedversion of the primary tactical radio system and believes it canretain two prime contractors and continue to keep costs down. GeneralDynamics and ITT  compete annually for SINCGARS production and areboth working on the SINCGARS System Improvement Program (SIP).     In early December, Deputy Defense Secretary John White restoredthe $92.8 million in FY '97 money DoD Comptroller John Hamrerecommended be cut last November. However, until last week, the Armywas set to lose all of its $298 million request for FY '98.     In program budget decision (PBD) 731 on Dec. 28, White restored$267.9 million in FY '98, $30 million less than the Army was lookingfor. The decision came after continued Army assertions that the FY '98cut would put the program and force readiness in jeopardy.     Although the Army won't be able to buy as many radios in FY '98as originally intended, service officials are confident the program isout of the woods.     "We see that as a pretty fair cut," an Army budget official saidof the $30 million FY '98 decrement. "We made our case and got most ofwhat we asked for."      Budget requests are made for two fiscal years at once, butCongress appropriates funding for only one year at a time. This yearthe Pentagon is at a disadvantage going into its final budgetdeliberations because without a federal budget for FY '96 it lacks afunding baseline for FY '97 to work against. Without a federal budgetsoon, the FY '97 request will likely be delayed beyond the statutorydeadline for being submitted to Congress.      The comptroller's original recommendation to cut FY '97 and FY'98 SINCGARS money was based on the belief that the Army planned touse the resources to outfit the National Guard with the primarycommand and control system used by infantry, armor, artillery andaviation units. But, the argument went, the National Guard has nowarfighting mission, does not require SINCGARS, and should make dowith its older VRC-12 series radios.      But the Army, in an appeal to Hamre's recommendations inNovember, said it plans to field the SINCGARS SIP radio to first-to-fight units and that the National Guard will benefit only by receivingthose SINCGARS already fielded and set to be replaced by the SIPradios. The appeal by Neil Ginnetti, principal deputy assistantsecretary of the Army, prompted White to approve the FY '97 request inDecember. But the Army's continued fight led to White's decision lastweek to approve FY '98 funding as well.     Last fall the Army decided to accelerate the SINCGARS program inan effort to field the required 225,000 radios as quickly as possibleand save nearly $500 million over the future years defense plan bybuying out the program in three years instead of eight. The Army plansto apply those cost savings to other areas. The accelerated plancalled for $283 million in FY '97, $298 million in FY '98, and $15million in FY '99 and FY '00, according to internal Army documents.Back to Headline List CopyrightTACTICAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996ARMY TO BRIEF INDUSTRY ON SCOUT SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM     The Army plans to host an industry briefing this month on theservice's plans for the Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System(LRAS3), the Communications Electronics Command, C4I ElectronicWarfare Acquisition Center, says in the Jan. 3 Commerce BusinessDaily.

BDM Federal is a subsidiary of BDM International, Inc..Back to Headline List CopyrightTACTICAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996JOINT STARS TO CONTINUE OPERATIONAL TESTING IN BOSNIA     Operational testing of the Joint Surveillance Target and AttackRadar System (Joint STARS) will continue while the aircraft system isdeployed operationally over Bosnia as part of Operation JointEndeavor, an Air Force official said in late December.     Joint STARS, a system that consists of a modified Boeing E-8aircraft and ground-based terminals, was sent to Iraq during thePersian Gulf War. That deployment delayed the system's operationaltesting. Air Force officials were concerned that a second deploymentwould further delay the independent operational testing.         "[The Office of the Secretary of Defense] and the Air Force spenttime with the [Director of Operational Test and Evaluation], alongwith Air Combat Command, to put together a deployment and multi-development test and evaluation [schedule] that would be transparentand non-interfering" with the ongoing Bosnian mission, Air Force Col.Robert DeBusk, commander of the 4500th Joint STARS squadron[provisional], said in a telephone interview. On Dec. 4, DOT&E signedoff on a plan to concurrently test Joint STARS during Operation JointEndeavor. DeBusk spoke to Defense Daily from Rheim Air Base, Germany,regarding the fledgling U.S. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.     "We need to do that to ensure full rate production in 1996,"DeBusk said. He added that first and foremost, Joint STARS is toprovide surveillance for U.S. troops in the peacekeeping mission. Butwhen possible, the platform and its associated ground stations will betested.      The Joint STARS system will begin operations over and in Bosniain January, DeBusk said.     Northrop Grumman, the Joint STARS aircraft system primecontractor, is to deliver two Joint STARS systems to the Air Force inFY '96. The Air Force has a requirement for 20 of the systems. Theservice plans to buy the aircraft at a rate of two or three a year forthe next 10 years at a cost of about $5 billion to $7 billion.     Joint STARS is a long-range, air-to-ground surveillance andbattle management system that can locate and track vehicle and armormovements. The program, run jointly by the Army and the Air Force, iscomprised of an airborne platform, a radar sensor with subsystems anda ground station that receives, in real time, the radar data processedin the aircraft. Motorola builds the Ground Station Modules (GSM).     Two E-8 Joint STARS aircraft left on Dec. 14 for Bosnia fromNorthrop Grumman testing grounds in Melbourne, Fla. Along with the twoE-8s, at least 10 GSMs from Fort Bragg, N.C., and Fort Hood, Texas,are being deployed to help monitor vehicle movements during thetransition between the United Nations' protection force in Bosnia andthe implementation of NATO forces there.     In preparing for the January missions, DeBusk is running trainingsorties of Joint STARS to check out the crews and to "determine theground truth." The Joint STARS, based out of Rheim, will be monitoring"vehicle-type" movements, he added.      Joint STARS has not flown in an operation since Desert Storm. Oneobvious difference between that mission and the upcoming one is thatBosnia is a different terrain, full of mountains and trees, somewhatlimiting Joint STARS' ability to survey and track movements.      Overall, Joint STARS was considered a great success in DesertStorm and DeBusk plans on using the lessons learned in that operationin Bosnia.      "I have reviewed lessons learned and have set down with Lt. Gen.George Muellner [principal deputy assistant secretary of the Air Forcefor acquisition] to get his perspective on the lessons learned," hesaid. "We are going to try to avoid any mistakes [made during DesertStorm.]" Muellner commanded the Joint STARS squadron in Desert Storm.     DeBusk added that the Joint STARS mission for Bosnia is differentthan that in Desert Storm in that this time, it is completely a jointoperation.      "The 4500th is a unique organization because it is a totallyjoint Air Force, Army group. The vice commander is Army Col. RandyYoung. Our organization is Army and Air Force top to bottom. It is asuccess story from the joint perspective."Back to Headline List CopyrightTACTICAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996EMERGING COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS BEING CONSIDERED FOR BOSNIA       The results of a recent exercise that tested the ability ofemerging communications systems to work together in support of jointmilitary operations are affecting Pentagon discussions on how to bestequip U.S. and NATO forces in Bosnia, with several systems on thetable for probable deployment to the European theater in the comingmonths, according to Pentagon officials.     A "lessons learned" report on the Joint Warrior InteroperabilityDemonstration (JWID), recently approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,recommends these systems be fielded at the earliest possible date,following the determination by exercise evaluators that they greatlyenhance the capabilities of U.S. forces across a broad spectrum ofmilitary operations.      The high-level Military Communications and Electronics Boardwill be briefed on these recommendations and Pentagon officialsbelieve many, if not all, will then be put into motion.      "A lot of the [communications] technologies to be used in Bosniaresulted from the JWID proof of concept," Ronald Elliot, Marine Corpsassistant chief of staff for command, control, communications,computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems integration, told DefenseDaily.      Elliot was tapped last year by the Joint Staff to supervise theexercise, which is held every year and rotates the service sponsor.     "Those kinds of things being used in the commercial sector andcivil agencies that can be applied to military operations emerged[from JWID]," Elliot said. "All of those are being planned to beapplied" to current operations, most notably Bosnia.     According to officials at the Defense Information Systems Agency,the lead agency in formulating the insights gained from the exercise,the lessons learned report will be widely distributed beginning thesecond week of January.      Although the JWID report doesn't specifically mention Bosnia andrecommend the systems in question should be utilized there, "if youread between the lines you can certainly pull that out of this," aDISA official said. "It does certainly say these capabilities shouldbe made available immediately."     The communications systems being considered for use in NATO'sOperation Joint Endeavor as a result of JWID '95 serve a broad rangeof purposes, according to officials familiar with the findings.     Communications on Operational Modeling, Planning, and SimulationStrategy (COMPSS), a training tool largely aimed at improving theexecution of air mission plans and fostering a smoother, moreeffective air tasking order process, is being "bannered around forgoing [to Bosnia]," the DISA official said. "It did very well inJWID." COMPSS is an effort originally led by the Advanced ResearchProjects Agency and is now under the auspices of the Defense Modeling and Simulation Organization.     Another capability successfully demonstrated and being consideredfor a Bosnian deployment is the Collaborative Contingency Targeting(CCT) system, officials said. An evolution of an older program knownas Rapid Application of Air Power, CCT was developed to "solve thetargeting problems" encountered by pilots during the Persian Gulf Warsuch as dated information on the location and purpose of Iraqi bombingtargets. That "did very well" during JWID as well.     The exercise also convinced officials that large screen displaysand electronic "white boarding" capabilities would enhance operationalplanning and execution in any hot spot. White boarding is nothing morethan electronic "chalkboards" that can be used in briefings throughoutan operation such as Joint Endeavor.         Many of the capabilities such as COMPSS and CCT have been pursuedby the Pentagon as advanced technology demonstrations, aimed atintroducing next-generation systems to the warfighters in a timelyfashion. C4I officials are now urging these capabilities be leveragedin Bosnia.      Some of the communications capabilities proven during JWID, andnow being considered for Bosnia are nearing the completion of theirdevelopment anyway, officials contend. These include the GlobalCommand and Control System (GCCS), a contractor-supported DISAintegration effort to tie together the services' disparate command andcontrol systems into a global network. GCCS is currently being testedand is set to replace the outdated World-Wide Command and ControlSystem early next year.     The Global Broadcast System (GBS), or at least much of what itwill offer, is also a candidate for use by U.S. troops in Bosnia,according to officials. A Navy program, GBS is scheduled to leveragecommercial satellites to offer the military direct voice, data, andvideo broadcast capability virtually everywhere on the planetbeginning in FY '96.     "The key is even though [GBS] has specific requirements as a new[program], that capability can now be fielded in Bosnia," a Pentagonofficial said. "The constellations and equipment are there."     Likewise, asynchronous transfer mode communications--alreadyfielded to U.S. forces in the continental U.S. and Hawaii--are readyfor deployment, according to officials. This technology providessecure telecommunications service via satellite.     The Pentagon official noted that although contractors aredeveloping these emerging systems, C4I officials are recommending onlythe capabilities be introduced to the force quickly. In other words,"even though a specific system has been demonstrated, [the capability]could be introduced another way."       As Pentagon leaders decide which communications capabilitiesshould go to Bosnia and how best to introduce them, the warfightingcommunity in Europe is playing a crucial role as it determines what itneeds. Requests from the warfighters are being funneled through AirForce Brig. Gen.

The final report calls for preservingthe formula for students with severe disabilities.It also expands on earlier recommendations that teacherpreparation programs address special education in basiccourses.Former New York City schools Chancellor Ramon Cortinesrequested the study as part of an effort to trim special edcosts.Nearly a quarter of the city's public school budget goestoward educating 140,000 special education students.The report suggests that its proposals could yield savingsby cutting transportation costs and reducing the need forevaluations."The cost of evaluating, transporting, tracking, re-evaluating, mainstreaming and de-certifying students who maynot be disabled is siphoning resources from a resource-starved public education system," said Norm Fruchter, headof the university team and co-director of the NYU Institutefor Education and Social Policy.Rudolph Crew, who has replaced Cortines as the city's schoolchief, said the report, "Focus on Learning," will be sent toa variety of groups for review.For more information, contact Norman Fruchter, Institute forEducation and Social Policy, New York University, 285 MercerSt., 10th Floor, New York, N.Y.

solve hands-on problems, theyhave trouble explaining their answers, according to thelargest study ever of mathematics and science achievement.Many students could show that light exercise boosts theheart rate, for instance, but few were able to explain whyor how they reached that conclusion, say researchersprocessing results from the Third International Mathematicsand Science Study (TIMSS)."Writing something out clarifies your thinking," saidMaryellen Harmon, the study's international coordinator ofperformance assessment, who previewed some preliminaryfindings for Education Daily.Over the past two years, TIMSS has posed traditionalmultiple-choice questions and presented a series ofperformance assessment tasks to elementary and secondarystudents in 45 nations.While the eagerly awaited TIMSS results won't be releaseduntil September, field trials of 22 performance tasksconducted in 19 countries in the summer of 1994 shed lighton weaknesses in students' math and science writing aroundthe world, Harmon added."Students need to learn to communicate, in English orNorwegian or whatever language they speak, about anythingand everything that is important to them," she said, urgingeducators to demand that students write every day in everysubject.National Assessment of Educational Progress findings on U.S.students released last year -- showing mild gains in scienceand math, but hardly a ripple in reading and writing --point up the relevance of Harmon's observations for Americanchildren (ED, Aug. 18, 1994).The Write Stuff?"Students like to problem-solve, and they have a notion ofhow to go about it, and they go about it well," Harmon said,lauding nine- and 13-year-olds' showing on problems, such asconducting laboratory experiments or arranging blocks tosolve math puzzles."Children of this age don't like to write," however, shelamented.Based on her 40 years of experience teaching U.S. studentsin a range of subjects, Harmon said she wasn't surprised tofind students largely unable to put their thoughts on paper.When a nation leans heavily on high-stakes, multiple-choicetests, it offers students little incentive to refine theircommunications skills, she said in an interview.Means To An EndWhile only 27 of the 45 nations participating in TIMSS --including the United States -- are using the performanceassessment part of the test, that number represents a stepforward for that type of evaluation, Harmon said.Only six countries used such techniques in the previous mathand science survey about a decade ago by the Netherlands-based International Association for the Evaluation ofEducational Research (ED, March 29, 1994).The multiple-choice and short-answer items that make up mostof TIMSS reveal little more than whether students canthoughtfully choose or guess correct answers, butperformance tasks enable assessors and educators to"diagnose" problems in student performance, said EugeneGonzalez, TIMSS director of operations and data analysis."We can see the process that the student follows to get theanswer to a question, rather than just the product," hesaid.The performance aspect of TIMSS makes the test not only atool for comparing countries, but an engine for schoolimprovement, providing curriculum designers and teachersinsights about trouble spots, Gonzalez added.It also helped the study cater to the varied curricularemphases different nations brought to math and science, saidIna Mullis, deputy director of TIMSS's internationalheadquarters at Boston College.The hands-on format proved agreeable to educators fromDenmark, who claim their students never have taken amultiple-choice test, and to those from Austria, where manystudents spend more time on job training sites than inschools, Mullis said.Inequities UnclearTIMSS turned up mixed findings on gender differences,contrary to the conventional wisdom among U.S. researchersthat boys regularly outperform girls in science and math.But socioeconomic and racial or ethnic disparities aredifficult to gauge in an international study, sincecountries have varied ideas about what constitutes a poorstandard of living or a minority.   --

studentsin special education, and improperly label other students aslearning disabled, an independent review panel says.Those charges -- frequently leveled against specialeducation programs around the country -- are part of a newreport calling for major changes to the city's general andspecial education systems.The researchers found that black studentsin New York Cityare placed in self-contained classes almost twice as oftenas whites.For every white student, there are 1.93 black students inthe total population.  But for every white, 3.74 blacks areplaced in self-contained classes.And in schools where fewer than 20 percent of students areblack, the black referral rate to self-contained classes isfour times the rate for whites, they say.Citing a 1985 study of New York City school children, theysaid just 16 percent of 133 children labeled as learningdisabled met the criterion for that disability as stipulatedin state regulations.In a follow-up study in 1992, researchers found that 15percent of 175 students met the clinical definition oflearning disabled.The report was compiled last year by five New YorkUniversity education specialists for former New York CityChancellor Ramon Cortines.For more information, contact Norman Fruchter, Institute forEducation and Social Policy, New York University, 285 MercerSt., 10th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10003-6607, (212)998-5880. -- Xavier BriandBack to Headline List CopyrightEDUCATION DAILY via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996RESOURCESPhi Delta Kappa has released its 1995 Fastback Series ofbooklets on various issues from outcome-based education tocontrolling aggressive students.

A "multifaceted approach" to educating and involvingschool staff, board members, parents and members of thecommunity at large was critical to the success of theWestside Community Schools in Omaha, Neb., saidSuperintendent Ken Bird.   Writing in Edutopia, the newsletter of the George LucasEducational Foundation, Bird said a recent survey ofresidents in his district showed 96 percent "support ourinvestment in technology." He attributes that support to theefforts made to involve the entire community in thetransition to modern technology in the schools.   Bird said he talks regularly to people about howtechnology can play a positive role in educationaltransformation. "The goal of this daily discourse is to helpall the stakeholders become aware of our vision - thattechnology provides tools to increase our capacity togather, organize, analyze, and impart information and thatit helps increase learners' abilities in all academic areasas well as areas such as critical thinking, problem solving,communication and social skills," he said.   A successful transition requires extensive involvementand full support of a district's teaching staff, Bird said."So teachers were invited to become actively involved indesigning and planning the learning environments in whichthey conducted their work." It also was realized that theinfusion of technology "would create a critical need forongoing staff development, with an emphasis on 'ongoing' -not one-time training opportunities."   Another vital component of the strategy "has beenbuilding a sense of need and urgency with the board ofeducation," he said. "We accomplished this by makingtechnology an integral part of the board's operation and bygiving members the support they need to facilitate theirlearning."   The board's meeting room is equipped with state-of-the-art presentation equipment and meetings frequently includepresentations by students and teachers who use "theopportunity to demonstrate to the board - and to the public- how fundamental technology has become to learning."   Each board member's home was connected with thedistrictwide computer network, Bird said. "Their workstations provide instant access to the district'sinformation bulletin board, calendars and e-mail, as well asaccess to all of the resources available on the Internet.This active involvement with technology has been asignificant factor in gaining and maintaining boardsupport."   Providing opportunities for community members to use newtechnologies and experience their value "was a key elementin our transformation," the Omaha superintendent said.   "Our district has a long tradition of active communityparticipation and we are committed to weaving the fabric ofthe community and the schools. I was especially concernedabout trying to prevent the emergence of a 'haves' and'have-nots' situation, in which students from families withtechnological resources in their homes could gain aconsiderable advantage over those whose families could notafford such resources." While the district could not put acomputer in every home, "we have been able to do some thingswhich have provided greater access to computers foreveryone," he said.Low-Income Access   Bird cited an initiative at Amber Ridge Family EducationCenter in an apartment complex of many low-income families."The center provides a wide variety of services to thefamilies of students who live there, including access tocomputers. The students use computers for homeworkassignments and other learning experiences. Adults, too, canuse the computers and training is provided for those whodon't have computer skills."   Also, the newly renovated Westside Middle School has beenopened to the public in the evenings and on Saturdays."Parents, students and 'empty nesters' take advantage of theschool's computers, with students often guiding theirparents and grandparents on their first trip down the'information highway.'"   Bird noted new technologies "have helped us move towardbetter teaching and learning, more challenging roles forteachers, and greater levels of community involvement. Yetnone of this would be possible without using the oldest toolavailable to a superintendent: careful cultivation ofrelationships with the school board, the staff and thecommunity.

The school districts, working with three colleges,experimented with videoconferencing during the 1994-95school year, allowing rural, remote schools to expand highschool curriculums, offer college classes to high schoolstudents, assist with staff development for local teachersand offer career training and college classes to localresidents.   While capable of offering a strong educational program,the district was not able previously to offer the number anddiversity of courses available in suburban areas.   The consortium recently applied for a five- year grant toexpand the videoconferencing network to 40 sites throughoutPennsylvania, New York and New Jersey.   Besides linking the involved schools with other schools,the network has the potential to connect them to otherresources, such as museums, historic sites, art galleriesand performance centers.   Typical of the districts involved in the program is theTowanda Areas School District.Learning Language   In 1994, a teacher went to Towanda High School to teachJapanese 101 to students from three different schooldistricts. In exchange for teaching the Japanese class, theteacher made it possible for students at Towanda to receivedistance learning from other schools.   Without videoconferencing, there would have been noJapanese instruction because the number of students in oneschool would not justify paying a teacher's salary for thatcourse.   However, videoconferencing enabled the foreign-languagecurriculum in six school districts to expand from French andSpanish to include German I-III, Japanese, Russian andLatin.   Besides being a cost-effective way to enhance curriculum,videoconferencing is helping students in the schools makefriends many miles away, according to a consortiumspokeswoman.   The consortium also allowed high school students to takecollege introductory classes in literature, anthropology,psychology and fine arts available from CollegeMisericordia. The classes also were available to localresidents during day and evening hours.   Teachers have taken advantage of some college creditcourses previously not available in their area and, inaddition to those classes, there are many opportunities forteacher seminars.

Unlike most telecommunications networks, which aredesigned for point-to-point connections, multimediaapplications such as distance learning and videoconferencing usually are multipoint.   Recently, the research center announced, it previewed anew product that supports the deployment of multipointmultimedia services using existing network infrastructures.   The not-yet-announced product, a powerful multimediamultipoint server with multistandard and multibandwidthcapability, represents two years of design and developmentwork at the Montreal-based center.   When completed, the new "video interactive product" isexpected to allow a broad range of multimedia services to bedeployed on a network, the center said.   At the preview, musicians situated in remote locations inToronto, Montreal and Laval, Que., played instruments inunison, successfully recreating the sound of a liveorchestra.   As the musicians played, their images were joined on alarge projection screen set up at the preview for theproduct.   According to Shaker Sabri, vice president of theMultimedia Research Center, the server's multimediafunctionality and multipoint connectivity will allow forcreation of "a broad range of services such as videoconferencing, distance learning and telemedicine."

Apple also had important news for the K-12market: in a videocassette mailed to thousands of educators,Apple Chairman John Sculley made official what has been widelyrumored--it will introduce an inexpensive, color Macintosh,during the 1990-91 school year, which will also be able to runApple II software (via an Apple IIe emulation board).Education market discounts for existing Mac products have beenincreased "significantly" over the current discount structure,effective immediately. (While Apple does not publish its discountschedule, a spokesperson suggested that, for example, some K-12buyers will be able to get the Mac Plus for under $700). Applealso announced the System 7.0 operating system for the Mac, whichit has released in a Beta test version to selected softwaredevelopers.The new IBM machine, called the PS/2 Model 25 286 is the first ofthe educational series to be able to run Windows and PresentationManager, the object-oriented multitasking operating environmentswhich are the hallmark of the PS/2 line's models 30 and higher.With it, IBM hopes to extend its reach beyond student instructionto powerful but user-friendly and affordable work stations forschool staff. Like all MS DOS PCs, the Model 25 286 will beeasily connected to high speed local area networks, able to linkteacher's units to school office or district resources.The new Mac will correct some glaring weaknesses in Apple's K-12line which have given IBM the opportunity to mount a far moreserious challenge to Apple's K-12 dominance than most industryobservers had believed possible only a few years ago. During theperiod from the 1985-86 school year to the 1988-89 school year,IBM's share of new machines going into the K-12 market has risenfrom 5% to 30% while Apple's has fallen from 70% to 54%. IBMChairman John Akers recently suggested that IBM may move ahead ofApple in K-12 market share as soon as the end of the currentschool year.Apple built its position in the K-12 market on the Apple IIplatform, a technology increasingly seen by educators and othersas a dead end. Apple's own focus on Macintosh technology for thebusiness market over the past several years, has left its AppleII line exposed in networking capabilities, on-board mass storageand processing speed -- all areas of strength for IBM. Althoughthe Mac is competitive in these regards, they've been tooexpensive for the K-12 market and, at the low end, have lackedthe color monitor considered essential for effective educationalsoftware.Because of these weaknesses, integrated learning system (ILS) andadministrative software developers have largely shunned the AppleII platform in favor of MS DOS, giving IBM a significant edge inincreased K-12 penetration. Now, assuming Apple delivers on itspromise, it has a chance to again become a serious competitor inthese critical market segments. Software publishers seeking moreinformation about Apple's support program for education marketproducts should contact Don Fields, Apple manager for educationsolutions, at 408/974-8595 (Cupertino, CA).HELLER REPORT News AnalysisIf the three most important factors in the success of a retailestablishment are "location, location and location," are theequivalent factors for winning the school market "installed base,installed base and installed base?" If so, Apple may feel it cantake some comfort in its new strategy despite IBM's PR to thecontrary. While IBM is creeping up on Apple in terms of newmachines going into the market, it still faces at least a 2-to-1disadvantage relative to Apple in terms of total installed base(all Apple products vs. all brands of MS DOS PCs).Until recently, Apple's predominant market share and theconsequent attention of most educational software developers,gave Apple a solid lock on the K-12 market. The new Mac, bypreserving schools' investment in Apple II software and bysupporting networking technology and computing power competitivewith MS DOS, will help Apple to position itself as the best ofboth worlds.It won't be that simple. While Apple is playing catch-up innetworking and ILS, IBM has been significantly altering the rulesof the game -- radically expanding the expectations of K-12decision makers -- in ways that still leave Apple at adisadvantage. From IBM's perspective, the educational PC is nolonger just a free-standing educational appliance; now it is onepiece of a seamless web of interconnected data processing powerextending from the classroom to the school office and on todistrict, regional and state headquarters, as well as into thehomes of students, teachers and administrators.IBM doesn't see "educational software" as what it used to beeither. The traditional instructional drill and practice,tutorials, simulations and productivity tools are only a piece ofit -- now there must also be a comprehensive suite ofadministrative and management systems ranging from instructionalmanagement, student attendance and grade reporting to foodservice management, bus scheduling and salary administration.In other words, IBM is changing the unit of competition from thedesktop PC, and its attendant floppy- or hard disk-basedsoftware, to networks of computers spanning the range from PCthrough mainframe, and to software systems ranging frominstructional floppies to mainframe packages able to manageinformation from all the schools in a state. In this type of aface off, IBM is coming at Apple from a position of considerableand unequally matched strength.If this were just IBM's world view, Apple could treat it asspeculation. But IBM has come to these conclusions "the old-fashioned way," by listening to teachers, administrators,superintendents and state agency executives who are throwing uptheir hands over piecemeal solutions to school computing needs.After years of grass-roots support for computers in schools bystudents and parents, it is as if the superintendents andprincipals are saying "I give up; you win! Okay, we'll havecomputers in our schools. But (1) the educational software'sgoing to be comprehensive and curricularly relevant, (2) thesystems are going to support teachers in accomplishing theirdaily classroom objectives, and (3) the technology will encompasseverything from the classroom to the office and on to stateheadquarters."Is the game worth the candle? No matter how one looks at thedata, the upside potential for PC hardware and software in theK-12 market is still enormous. Current penetration is less thanfive percent in terms of PCs for students and far less in termsof PCs for teachers and administrators. Add in the market forminicomputer- and mainframe-based management systems, and itsclear that the stakes in K-12 are extremely high.IBM has committed at least $30 million in grants for K-12 marketdevelopment, and, according to industry sources, has almost 1,200people in K-12 marketing support (i.e., not counting sales reps).Apple's new strategy should put it back in the game, but what ittakes to play will never be the same.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELLER REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetMay 1990VANDERBILT'S PEABODY COLLEGE DEVELOPS "JASPER" VIDEODISCS/SeeksSchool Market DistributorA group of educators from Vanderbilt University's Peabody Collegeof Education (Nashville, TN) is developing interactive videoproducts to teach multi-step problem solving to 5th and 6th gradestudents. The first two videodiscs of the Jasper Project (namedafter the protagonist of the storyline, Jasper Woodbury) arebeing testing in schools in Nashville and a few other areasaround the country. About 50 discs have been sent out for testingto date, said Dr. Bob Sherwood, associate director of Peabody'sLearning Technology Center. The program is being simultaneouslyproduced on videotape as well as disc, so that it can be used bya wider number of schools, according to project director Dr. JohnBrandsford.The goal is to produce at least six Jasper discs. The third andfourth discs are in production; Dr. Brandsford said theUniversity is hoping to get Federal funds to help it completediscs five and six. The vice-chancellor's office is currentlytalking to several distributors of educational software in hopesof striking an agreement to market Jasper to schools. Dr.Sherwood said that the University is hoping the Jasper discs willgo at "a reasonable price", which he put at under $300. Dr.Bransford noted that Vanderbilt would put any profit it makesfrom the project directly back into research.The Jasper discs are appropriate for teaching "math-impaired" andat-risk students, as well as adult remedial education, Dr.Brandsford said. Students watching the program for the first timesee a linear, 17-minute version, and then go back for clues tosolve Jasper's problems using mathematics. With videodisctechnology, there is the advantage of random access; in thevideotaped versions, students watch the entire tape again andraise their hands when they feel the tape should be stopped todiscuss a clue, Dr. Bransford said.Each Jasper episode is costing close to $100,000 to produce, Dr.Sherwood said, noting that programs demand high quality videobecause children are accustomed to TV's high production values.In addition to the videotape versions, the Learning TechnologyCenter is developing training tapes and workbooks for teachers.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELLER REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetMay 1990SURVEY: $1.3 MILLION COMPUTING BUDGET YEARLY AVERAGE FOR HIGHERED SCHOOLSWith many areas of the economy sagging, technology providers maytake comfort to know that the market for computers--andparticularly microcomputers--in the nation's colleges anduniversities is robust. According to a recent study by GlobeResearch Corp. on behalf of The Chronicle of Higher Education,institutes of higher education budget a yearly average of $1.3million each for computing purposes, a figure that includes feesfor hardware, software, support staff and courseware. The budgetsranged from an average low of $482,000 per year for two-yearcolleges, up to $3.37 million annually for large institutions.The study, Computers in Higher Education: The 1990s, CurrentUsage, Responsibilities and Purchasing Trends, is based on datafrom 2,426 responses out of a mailing of 4,000 questionnaires,representing a return rate of 60.9%.Nearly every college and university already owns microcomputers(the survey placed the number at 96.5%), with an average of 101microcomputers per institution. Small institutions averaged thelowest number of units, at 58 each, while large institutionsaveraged 308 microcomputers. The survey found that colleges anduniversities averaged 3.6 computer centers each, and that themajority of microcomputers were located in the computer centers,administrative offices, individual departments and libraries.About 16.7% of campus computers were located in dormitories. Thesurvey found that between 18% and 24% of the respondinginstitutions recommended brands or types of hardware to students;however, only 1.1% of respondents required students to purchasecomputers. Nearly half (48.6%) made some sort of microcomputerhardware recommendation to students, faculty and/oradministrative staff.According to the study's findings, IBM retains a wide margin overits nearest competitor, Apple, in the competition for marketshare. The brands or models most recommended by respondents wereof the IBM PC family, including the IBM PC, PC/XT, PC/AT, PC/RTand OS/2 (a combined total of 70.2%), followed by the AppleMacintosh (31.3%). IBM-compatible clones were assessed at 27.6%of the market, ahead of Zenith (24.7%), Apple II (20.3), AT&T(9.7%), Hewlett-Packard (6.4%) and DEC (5.7%). Other familiarnames, including Leading Edge, Epson, Compaq and Tandy, were allplaced at under 5% of the market.Globe's results confirmed the heavy use of computer networks inhigher ed. Seven out of ten schools reported that their microswere networked to other computers. Of schools using networks, 78%had their micros connected to a mainframe; 54.1% were usingmicro-to-micro networks.Software Centrally Pooled on CampusOne significant finding of the report revealed that a very largenumber of institutions--averaged to 43% in the survey--had acentral pool of microcomputer software. Nearly all had wordprocessing and spreadsheet software available from the pool(98.1% and 93.4%, respectively), and most had database managementsoftware as well as programs in graphics and statistics. Of thoseinstitutions, WordPerfect was the dominant word processingproduct (66.9%), while Lotus 1-2-3 remained the top spreadsheetpackage (81.9% of schools). dBase topped the list of databasemanagement software (81.2% of schools) and SPSS was the topstatistical product (45.2%).Almost half of all institutions --48.1%--said they "would be moreinterested in software if site licensing were offered," thereport states. The potential number of microcomputers that wouldcome under site licensing averaged out to 195.5 units perinstitution. That figure rose to 233.4 micros at four-yearcolleges and universities and leaped to 437.1 units for largeinstitutions. The potential number of individual users in sitelicensing came to an average of 850 individuals, while the numberof potential concurrent users averaged to 295. The majority ofschools also said they preferred a one-time payment for sitelicensing rights, as opposed to an annual fee.Purchasing trends for peripherals were also looked at in thestudy. Among higher ed officials using microcomputers as part oftheir jobs, 39.9% said they planned to add a laser printer totheir system within the next two years. Modems were on theshopping list for 25.1% of the officials, while 31.7% said theyplanned to add a scanner.The Role of Purchasing CommitteesA 1989 survey published by Globe Research Corp. focusing onhigher ed purchasing patterns found that, in the majority ofschools, purchasing committees were involved in the purchases ofcomputer products, software and telecommunications systems. Theresponses were taken from people who had served on institutionalpurchasing committees in the 12 months prior to the survey. Thestudy, The Purchasing Process in Higher Education, determinedthat purchasing committees were involved in the decision to buycomputer equipment, products and systems in over 80% ofinstitutions surveyed (83.2%).Purchasing committees were involved in the acquisition ofaudio/video equipment and products in 55.9% of all institutions,while such committees were active in the buying oftelecommunications equipment in 33.2% of all schools. Ofinstitutions surveyed, 32.2% of senior administrative officialswere involved in purchasing telephone equipment, and 30% of thosesenior officials were involved in the purchase of long-distanceservices.Copies of both higher ed surveys can be obtained from TheChronicle of Higher Education, Inc., 1255 23rd St. NW,Washington, D.C. 20037.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELLER REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetMay 1990US DOE'S TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OFFICE IN FORMATIVE STAGEThe US Dept. of Ed's Office of Training Technology Transfer(OTTT), established two years ago under a Federal Trade Act, hasyet to hire personnel and create an agenda to carry out itsmission -- but recent activity suggests both may happen soon. Ifso, publishers may find some product opportunities involvinggovernment-funded training materials. The goal of the OTTT,according to DOE's Dr. Lucille Reifman, is to "facilitatetransfer of education and training technology, with educationaland Federal support, to technology and training institutes."Although startup of the OTTT was approved in 1988, funding hasyet to be sent to the unit.Dr. Reifman feels that Federal money will be arriving soon;Congressional legislation had proposed $3 million for the firstyear of operation, with subsequent years funded "as needed," Dr.Reifman said. The $3 million was supposed to come out of a largertechnology training initiative that has yet to gain officialapproval, she added. During the Spring of 1990, Dr. Reifman andother officials will be meeting to explore issues central to theunit, and to formulate how policy will be conducted.Once the Office takes shape, the plan is to establish a networkof OTTT training technology centers in every government officethat uses such technology. Then the OTTT would seek to take aninventory of training technology programs used by the U.S.government, analyze them, and disseminate information. Of course,a portion of this work will have to be contracted out; after abudget in place, the OTTT will have the ability to award grantsand contracts, Dr. Reifman said.The OTTT has the potential to become an important source of newinformation and training programs, handling everything fromlanguage courses originally used by the State Dept. to the JobSkills Education Program (JSEP), a computerized job trainingprogram developed by the U.S. Army, Florida State University andFord Aerospace (see related article in HR April '90 issue).One of the main issues facing OTTT officials will be that ofproprietary rights, said Dr. Reifman, touching on ownership ofcourseware developed on behalf of the government, or by a branchof government itself.The OTTT would probably rely on terms found in the originalagreements between individual contractors and the governmentregarding intellectual property rights, she said. Dr. Reifmanadded that the OTTT, as it is currently being proposed, wouldhave the power to turn over certain proprietary rights to theoriginal manufacturer if it were found to be in the publicinterest. She added that some of the powers proposed for the OTTT"may not be practical for this office to exercise," requiring acohesive, legislated policy instead.One concern she raised was the future of material found in thepublic domain--would a private company really push a product, orseek to modernize it, if it were public material? Or if a productwere developed to work on a mainframe or very powerful PCplatforms, like JSEP, how could the OTTT facilitate JSEP'sreincarnation into a less expensive PC product, so that collegescould use it?The Heller Report will be following the formation of the Officeof Training Technology Transfer and will bring our readersperiodic updates as to its progress.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELLER REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetMay 1990RURAL ELECTRICAL AND TELEPHONE COOPERATIVES ASSISTING SCHOOLSWITH DISTANCE LEARNING AND TELECOM MATERIALIf the latest developments in Arkansas are indicative of a trend,local energy cooperatives are playing an increasingly importantrole helping to bring rural school districts into thetechnological 20th century.The Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation (AECC), theumbrella unit to which 17 of the state's 18 energy co-ops belong,is using some of its profits to purchase satellite transmissionand reception equipment for each district in the state. JimDavis, a spokesperson for the AECC, said buying and installingthe satellite equipment--transmission and reception for each ofAR's 389 districts--will cost at least $500,000, probably muchmore.To date, 300 Bentley 8 dishes (supplied by Western ManufacturingCo. of Cabot, AR) have been purchased; receivers will be boughtfrom Satellite Technology Services (St. Louis, MO). The purchasesare being made centrally by AECC, but each district is overseeingthe transport of the equipment to its locality. The dishes areexpected to be placed in district high schools, Davis said.Although there is one rural electrical cooperative that is not amember of AECC, Davis said the AECC will donate equipment to thedistrict falling within the non-member's area. One district hasalready installed its equipment; the rest of the districts areexpected to begin in mid-May, he said.The Role of Rural Co-opsRural electrical cooperatives, established to provide electricityin remote and rural areas, began to flourish in the 1930s-40s.Owned by its customers, the co-ops are run by boards elected bythe community. According to Richard Larochelle of the NationalRural Electrical Co-op Association (Washington, D.C.), thenation's 1,000 rural electrical co-ops serve 25-30 millionpeople, representing 70% of the land mass in the U.S. Each co-op,on average, serves three or four counties.Rural telephone cooperatives are patterned much the same way. Thetelephone cooperatives have also been active in helping schoolsget up-to-date technology; in several states, the rural telephonecooperatives will fund and oversee installation of a fiber opticinfrastructure so that a district can have phone, data anddistance learning communications in its schools. In Oklahoma,rural phone co-ops have been coordinating the introduction offiber optics in some districts, while in others it has beenhelping schools get grants for satellite dishes, according toShirley Bloomfield of the National Telephone Co-op Association(Washington, D.C.).In many cases the U.S. government's Rural Electrification Agencywill lend money to the rural co-op to pay for the infrastructure,Bloomfield said. If the money to retool takes the form of a loan,districts will "lend out" the school's distance learning orcomputer network after hours and gradually recoup the costs inthis manner.Interestingly, rural telephone cooperatives are not hampered bythe same restrictions as the RBOCs. Many of the rural co-ops haveestablished separate subsidiaries through which they participatein cable TV ventures--a precaution taken so that the basic phonebill does not wind up subsidizing cable or other units,Bloomfield said. While RBOCs are presently prevented by JudgeGreene's MFJ from becoming for-profit information providers,Bloomfield does not see that situation lasting for more than ayear or two. "Our only concern is that when restrictions arelifted on the RBOCs, that there are safeguards for the ruralco-ops," she said, adding that the rural organizations would wantassurance "that we would have access to the technology" tocontinue its own ventures.  Some industry observers contend thatRBOC support for pending rural distance learning legislation,such as the Rural Partnership Act of 1989 ("Rural Star Schools;"see the related story in the Sept. 1989 HR), which would provide$110 million for telecommunications and computer equipment andprogramming for rural schools, is part of the RBOC lobbyingeffort to chip away at MFJ.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELLER REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetMay 1990VITA TO USE LOW-ALTITUDE SATELLITE AND RADIO MODEMS FOR AFRICAPROJECTTo help foster communications between schools of higher educationin Africa, Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA)--anon-profit volunteer organization in Boston, MA--plans to supplyuniversities in Nigeria with computers, radio modems and packetradios to help deliver voice and data communications. This effortwill be aided by a low-altitude satellite launched earlier thisyear, called PACSAT, that will provide store-and-forwardcommunications on an experimental radio band. Moreover, thecomputer and radio components will be powered by solar panels,VITA president Henry Norman told The Heller Report.Funding for the project came from a variety of sources, includingThe Hoover Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy, thelatter granting funds for the solar equipment. Funds for thePACSAT satellite came from VITA ($350,000) as well asorganizations such as TERC (Technical Education ResourceCenters), which purchased transponder space in advance of thelaunch.The low-altitude satellite was built at the University ofSurrey's Spacecraft Research Institute in the United Kingdom,while the American-made radio modems (actually, terminal nodecontrollers) are from Applied Electronic Associates, located inWashington state. The packet radios are of Japanese origin,Norman said. The terminal node controllers (TNCs) breakinformation into small "packets" that can be transmitted viaradio to the receiving computer; another TNC at the receptionsite decodes the information "packets" for display on the PCscreen. The system can be powered either by solar cells or byconventional lead-acid battery.PACSAT is designed to act as an "orbiting mailbox," because inits low orbit (700km), it will pass over most points on earth atleast twice daily. Depending on a query's point of origin, amessage can be uploaded and then unloaded at its destination in amaximum of 12 hours' time. When PACSAT is over a ground station,it will signal the station to turn itself on to transmit orreceive messages. Based on this timed orbit, the longestquery-response cycle will be no longer than 24 hours,considerably speeding up communications in areas where there areno telephone or electrical lines.The PACSAT initiative is expected to act as a testing ground fora more expanded project, called VITASAT. It is anticipated thatthe VITASAT satellite will cost roughly $1.2 million. VITASAT isexpected to serve a minimum of 35 ground stations, although aVITA-distributed brochure on the project states that the goal isto have "an internal network of 50 stations," which will serve upto 500 remote locations. About half of those will be in Africa,with the rest in other third world spots.TERC's "Global Laboratory" ProgramTERC bought transponder space on PACSAT for the TERC-coordinatedGlobal Laboratory Project. The project, begun this Spring, wouldhave used PACSAT and radio so that high schools in Brazil couldcommunicate with schools in the U.S., Australia, the U.S.S.R. andCanada to compile information on global warming. However, asource at TERC said it has been unable to secure funding tocontinue with the PACSAT part of Global Laboratory. The projectis going ahead with countries that already have conventionalphone lines (the U.S., Australia, Canada and the U.S.S.R.).TERC's future involvement with PACSAT will be decided in aboutone month, the source said.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELLER REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetMay 1990IBM, NY STATE TEAM UP FOR $5 MIL PILOT TECHNOLOGY PROJECTIBM and the New York State Dept. of Education announced they willjointly enter the pilot phase of a plan to bring technology toall schools in the state.The pilot will serve to help validate the DOE's Long Range Planfor Technology in Elementary and Secondary Schools in New YorkState, an initiative long promoted by the DOE and expected to beapproved by the NY state Board of Regents this month. To helpinitiate the two-year pilot phase, IBM will be donating about $5million to 12 elementary schools and 12 teacher colleges. Theproject illustrates IBM's substantial commitment to increasingits penetration of the K-12 market (see related story, andanalysis, of the IBM/Apple K-12 face off on page 1).Donations of equipment will be made to schools on a competitivegrant basis; proposals from schools are due June 1.  Mostproposals will be prejudged by the 41 Boards of CooperativeEducational Services (BOCES) around the state; the five largestcities, including New York City, can submit proposals directly tothe capitol. The top five plans selected by the BOCES will beforwarded to the state DOE for final selection. Winners should beannounced by June 19, said Dr. Peter Stoll, an associate foreducational television in the Bureau of Technical Applications atthe DOE.The selected schools will receive approximately $250,000 to$300,000 worth of IBM equipment, including four or five PS/2model 25 workstations per classroom, with color monitors andvoice adaptor cards. Every school will get an IBM PS/2 model 80file server, while teachers and school principals will receivePS/2 model 30 workstations. Additionally, each school willreceive an IBM laser printer. According to Dr. Stoll, eachwinning school will also receive a "teacher presentation system,"consisting of large screen projection hardware, a computer-drivenvideodisc drive and a CD-ROM drive.The state's plan calls for networking each workstation to thefile server, linking them to the other microcomputers in theclassroom and in the building, and to other classrooms in thestate connected to NY's Technical Network Ties (TNT), astate-wide computer network.An "Overview for Superintendents" issued by the DOE describingthe IBM/NY venture states that schools having prior involvementwith IBM, such as those that have used Writing to Read or otherIBM courseware, will be given preference in the selectionprocess, as will schools currently networked to TNT.Winning schools will be required to assume the costs for anyadditional wiring necessary to network workstations in theclassrooms; networking between classrooms within the buildingmust be paid for by the district.As the Long Range Plan currently stands, the goal is to havecomputers in every NY state school and school library, withstudents having daily access to "technology-rich learningenvironments within their classrooms and in separate learninglabs outside the classroom, in the school library media center,or from home when needed."The objective is to have the plan at least partly implemented by1995.While no firm price tag has been put on such a plan (should it beapproved by the Board of Regents), Dr. Stoll noted that NY statemakes between $18 million and $20 million available each year forhardware and software purchases by schools.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELLER REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetMay 1990RR DONNELLEY/GTE TELEMESSENGER LAUNCH AUDIOTEX "IN-TOUCH"LITERACY AIDOne of the country's largest printing firms, Chicago-based R.R.Donnelley and Sons, has teamed with GTE Telemessenger (Irving,TX) to offer a telephone-accessed literacy service called "TheIn-Touch Reading Aid." In association with Literacy Volunteers ofAmerica (LVA), Donnelley and GTE are planning to launch a pilotwith 100 students in early June. If the results are positive, theservice may expand its offerings and/or become a "900" number.The fledgling "In-Touch Reading Aid" currently has a vocabularyof about 800 words; callers to the temporary "800" number areasked to spell out a troublesome word using the keypads of atouch-tone phone. A prerecorded voice spells the entered word,and gives the correct pronunciation.Robert Chainski, technical director for advanced communicationsapplications at R.R. Donnelley, told The Heller Report that thecompany originated the "In-Touch" idea out of concern over thehigh rate of illiteracy in the U.S. Through this service, adultilliterates, the disabled, children or non-English speakingpeople would be able to learn pronunciation and spelling if theybecome "stuck" on a word, Chainski said. He noted that the LVAidentified this as a major problem among adult illiterates whopractice reading skills at home--getting "stuck" with no one toturn to for help.Chainski said that through Donnelley's contacts with textbook andchildren's publishers, the company is seeking to create a jointproject that would include using the "In-Touch" line. If, forexample, an agreement was reached with a children's publisher,Donnelley could add words into the online dictionary specificallyrelated to a publisher's text. An English-Spanish vocabularyservice is one of the forms the "In Touch" line may eventuallytake, he said.Prior to Donnelley's partnership with GTE Telemessenger, most ofthe telecommunications firms contacted by R.R. Donnelley werereluctant to join the project, mainly because it was unclear howor when the system would bring in profits, Chainski said. The100-student pilot slated to begin in June is scheduled to lastthree months, after which Donnelley and GTE Telemessenger willdetermine the future direction of the service.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELLER REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetMay 1990HOWTEK PRINTER TRANSLATES TO BRAILLE; EDUCATION RESELLER SOUGHTHowtek, Inc., headquartered in Hudson, VT, has introducedBraillemaster, a line of computer printers that will interpretASCII into Braille, and are capable of printing alphanumericsymbols as well as Braille on the same page. Using proprietarysoftware and a plastic-based ink, the printers shoot out fourlayers of ink dots that dry instantly on the paper, creating theraised Braille symbols, according to Howtek business manager JackDolan. The initial sales thrust for Braillemaster printers willbe the corporate market, Dolan said, although the company islooking for "resellers" who will bring the product to theeducation/special ed market.This technology, designed to facilitate communication betweenblind and sighted employees in the workplace, may enable blindand sighted students to learn together as well. The Braillemaster(really a Pixelmaster printer will specialized software, ink andBraille drive) uses a solid ink capsule resembling a crayon, saidDolan, which melts when inserted in the printer. Inside theprinter, the liquefied ink is kept at 240 degrees Fahrenheit, sothe sudden temperature change that occurs when the ink hits thepaper causes it to solidify immediately, Dolan said.Howtek designed the printer to be used by the sighted as well; itis designed to remember 256,000 shades of color, and can printgraphs, charts, maps or images.Developed in cooperation with the National Federation of theBlind, the Braillemaster is built to accommodate Grade 2 Braillesoftware produced by Duxbury (Littleton, MA), which contractsoften-used prefixes and suffixes for faster reading by the blind.Braillemaster I, with 512K of memory, lists at $5,995, whileBraillemaster II, with 2-1/2 megabytes, lists at $7,900.

Two years ago, the state legislaturerevamped what had been ND's Educational Broadcasting Council intothe Educational Telecommunications Council; the new councilcommissioned Federal Engineering, a Fairfax, VA-based consultingfirm, to develop a plan for the installation of a state-widenetwork. However, since ND's state legislature meets every otheryear, the study will not be taken up by the lawmakers until itsnext session in Jan. 1991 (the previous session ended May 1989).The state's fiscal year begins on July 1st, so that if therecommendations (or any subsequent bids) were approved, fundswould not be forthcoming until July 1991 (the start of ND'sfiscal 1992), at the earliest. The plan, as it currently stands,its to build the network over a five-year period, according toJoel Linnertz, director of administrative services for ND's Dept.of Public Instruction. The scheduling of any RFP will most likelybe tied to the fiscal cycle, although no timetable for RFPs havebeen set.The network is expected to be funded entirely by state money.However, the state has been under great financial pressure due tothree consecutive years of drought, as well as a depressed oilmarket, affecting two important areas of commerce for NorthDakota. The decision to spread construction over a five-yearperiod may, in part, soften the financial pinch of the project.Ultimately, the network's backbone will be a "fiber opticscorridor circling the state," Linnertz said. He also indicatedthat the first aim of the project will be to establish a computernetwork for educators and students in K-12 schools. The networkwould also be used for administrative tasks. In progressivestages, the network would also be used to link colleges andlibraries around the state, and perhaps add to the state'sdistance learning efforts. So far, most distance learningprojects in ND have been carried out by local consortium,independent of one another.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELLER REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetMay 1990LEIDS CORP. INTRODUCING SINet TO K-12 SCHOOLSIn the past four months, Leids Corp. of Fargo, ND, has wired over150 schools in five states to its SINet proprietary database andinformation retrieval system. It plans to introduce systems inPortland, OR and Washington, D.C. in the near future.SINet--Secondary Informational Network--is designed to retrieve ahost of topic-specific information by accessing large numbers ofdatabases and bulletin boards, searching for data pertaining to aparticular category.For example, if the topic is ecology, SINet might scan NationalGeographic's database, as well as ECONET and other databases andnewswires to gather and present a body of information for theuser. Leids is also talking to FrEdMail and other bulletin boardproviders in order to add more of those services under SINet'sumbrella, according to Leids CEO Dr. Theodore Rosenbaum.Dr. Rosenbaum described SINet as "a distributed system" that willact as a gateway to other bulletin boards, as well as supportconferencing and e-mail (public domain databases, but no activeonline services, are accessed via SINet). Schools can accessSINet either remotely or by leasing or buying the completesystem. The system can be cost-effective for schools with limitedresources; Dr. Rosenbaum noted that Catholic schools in Minnesotalog into SINet via a remote site designated for them, at a totalcost of $80 per year. The SINet system consists of Leids'proprietary UNIX-based software running on an NCR Tower computer,which can be used as a file server for a local area networklinking user stations. There are currently two multiuser NCRTower setups in Minnesota, serving 50 schools, while two NCRTowers in AZ serve SINet to about 100 schools, Dr. Rosenbaumsaid.Schools can also lease or buy the system (line charges for onlineaccesses are paid separately). NCR acts as sales and marketingagent for the SINet package, and will send teams to schools toinstruct users and keep track of the system's performance. Ineither a lease or buy situation, Leids provides ongoing supportand troubleshooting for SINet. There is a certain amount ofcustomizing involved for each school or district. Using KERMITtelecommunications software, a public-domain product, Leidstailors SINet for IBM or Apple systems.To date, schools in Minnesota, North Dakota, Nebraska and Arizona(Phoenix) as well as one Texas school have become SINet users. Asystem tied into Novell Netware capable of serving up to 150users can cost from $10,000 to $16,000 to purchase, Dr. Rosenbaumsaid. He noted that the system bought by the Phoenix, AZ schoolscan serve up to 78 users. K-12 schools are not Leids' only marketfor the product; the Kansas judiciary system is consideringinstalling the software for its own use, said Dr. Rosenbaum.Leids' current efforts in the higher ed market include a projectto link universities in Nigeria to SINet. The team effortinvolves Leids, NCR, Nigeria's Education Ministry, and possiblysome volunteer organizations. Business representatives went toNigeria to meet with education officials about one year ago, andfollowed up with a proposal to connect with SINet via satellite.The first test of the system is expected in two months.Prior to changing its name six months ago, Leids Corp. was knownas Barrister International.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELLER REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetMay 1990NIEU's EDUCATION UTILITY SLATED FOR SITES IN AZ, NY AND FL BYJUNEAfter some false starts dating back to the early 1980s, NationalInformation and Education Utilities Corp. (NIEU) is beginning tofind customers for its Education Utility program. Technologicallyenhanced since its first introduction, EU is now a satellitedelivered service offering schools downloaded educationalsoftware, data and video on demand for a per-use fee.NIEU vice-chairman Henry Schwartz said the Education Utility (EU)system has been installed in two high schools in Arizona, withinstallation for four others to begin next month. NIEU has alsosigned on the C.W. Post College of Long Island University andthree more schools in Suffolk County, NY. Further, two sites inFlorida have signed on to receive the EU system: NovaUniversity's South Florida Education Center, and a secondEducation Center run by a consortium made up of Broward CountyCommunity College, Nova University and the Broward, Dade andMonroe Counties public schools. NIEU executives are currentlytalking with education officials in Illinois and California toexplore business opportunities in those states.The basic EU structure is as follows: using a schools's owncomputer hardware and an NIEU-supplied receiver dish, schoolsreceive encrypted database and video information that is storedon hard disc, CD-ROM and/or VHS video recorder. The system canalso be amended to accommodate interactive optical discs, saidSchwartz. The data is decoded by a Scientific Atlanta B-Macdevice placed on-site. The Education Utility currently hasbetween 350 and 400 software programs available from about 50suppliers, including Scholastic and MicroSoft, although Schwartzsaid the number of programs "will shortly top 1,000."Schools are charged a fee for use of the third-party softwaredelivered to the desktop, as well as 50 cents per hour for eachworkstation using the system; software publishers are paid aroyalty for each use. The leasing charge for the EU system is$1,750 per month ($21,000 annually); Schwartz estimates theadditional, per-use fees, based on a 190-day school year, willrun about $6,000.When used to deliver computer data, the system can handle up to250 concurrent users without any loss of speed, Schwartz said.When delivering full-motion video, the system acts "like cableTV" and can be seen by any number of users, he added.Financial Incentive in LeasingTo help recoup the costs of the system, NIEU allows clientschools to lease out the EU for non-school business, such asadult literacy classes or other community use. Recently, NIEU hasadded dial-up capabilities to the EU system, allowing users toaccess data from home using individual passwords. Aside from thephone line and program fees, NIEU charges $1.50 per hour fordial-up service, and will credit one-third (50 cents) of thatrevenue to the client school, Schwartz said.Further, NIEU has concluded an agreement with ERIC (EducationResource Information Center) for use of its databases for K-12teachers and administrators. Those databases are public-domain,Schwartz said.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELLER REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetMay 1990INTERACTIVE LEARNING '90, JUNE 29-JULY 1, 1990Interactive Learning '90, June 29-July 1, 1990 at theHerriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.

White House Press Secretary MarlinFitzwater denied the rumors Jan. 3, saying Cavazos "has done an outstandingjob."  When asked directly if Cavazos were leaving, the president'sspokesman replied, "He has the job as long as he wants it."  Similar rumorsseven months ago had also been denied, when the president himself saidCavazos "has my full confidence."     The rumors resurfaced Jan. 2, when columnist Jack Anderson reportedthat Cavazos might be on the way out because some "Washington insiders"felt that his low-key style had failed to help build Bush's reputation as"the education president."  Cavazos' style was compared to that of hisoutspoken and combative predecessor, William Bennett.  Anderson saidCavazos had also alienated Congressional Democrats and education interestgroups for not pushing harder for higher spending on education.  Thecolumnist said unnamed "White House operatives" were scouting for areplacement for Cavazos, with outgoing New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean (R) andformer Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander (R) among their candidates.     On Jan. 3, The Washington Post carried a similar story on its frontpage, including more criticisms of Cavazos.  The criticisms from liberalswere largely predictable, but even Jeanne Allen, education policy analystat the conservative Heritage Foundation, said, "We don't need a mellowsecretary.  We need somebody to really rock and roll.  He just doesn't knowpolicy."  The Post also quoted Cavazos' reaction to his critics, offeredduring an interview with the paper:  "I'm just going to keep on doing myjob.  They can just line it up and have at it, because I'm going to haveright back at them."     Later that same day, while denying rumors of Cavazos' imminentdeparture, Fitzwater said criticisms of the secretary were "unfair," andalleged that "action interest groups were trying to stimulate" Cavazos'ouster.  As of RLP press time, Cavazos still had his job.Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON LITERACY PROGRAMS via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1990GOVERNORS' ASSN. TO HOLD THIRD ANNUAL CONFERENCEON STATE LITERACY INITIATIVES IN HARRISBURG, PA.     The National Governors' Association (NGA), in cooperation with theU.S. Department of Education and Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS), willsponsor the third annual conference on state literacy initiatives April 2-4in Harrisburg, Pa.  The theme of the conference will be "Alliances forLiteracy," and it will focus on the development of state literacy policiesand the implementation of state-wide literacy systems.     The three-day meeting is expected to draw more than 400 participants,ranging from governors and their spouses to new adult readers.  Otherswill include representatives from governors' offices, state literacyagencies, nonprofit organizations, the business community, organizedlabor, education, the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Departments of Education,Health and Human Services, and Labor.  Organizers say they also hopeEducation Secretary Lauro Cavazos, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Sen.Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and Rep. Tom Sawyer (D-Ohio) will attend.     While a detailed agenda is still in the works, organizers sayconference workshops will be divided into three tracks:  TargetingServices, Creating an Infrastructure and Evaluating Effectiveness.  Becausesome state programs are further along than others, workshops are beingplanned that will address various stages of program implementation.Conference plenary sessions will be devoted to national literacy issuesthat are relevant to state efforts.

Terry E. Branstad (R), chairman of the National Governors'Association (NGA), says the nation's governors will not only adopteducation goals at their annual winter meeting in February, they will alsoissue an action agenda outlining the steps needed to acheive those goals.(See RLP, Dec. 14)     Branstad issued a statement Dec. 27 in which he said that thegovernors' "education summit" with President Bush in September had"produced an action agenda in four areas:  building national goals,providing more flexibility in federal education programs, restructuringeducation and improving accountability.  First, we will adopt nationalgoals for excellence in education.  Then, we will outline the process forachieving the rest of our agenda."     Branstad said the NGA task force on education will develop an actionagenda for the governors and the nation and issue it at the Feb. 25-27 NGAmeeting in Washington.  According to the NGA, the agenda will describe theproblems of education and the issues facing state policymakers, outline aconsensus on reasonable and achievable goals, and recommend practical waysto acheive those goals.     One of the broad goals set forth at the September summit was theacheivement of "functional literacy" by all adult Americans.  Other broadgoals addressed the gammut of educational issues, from preschool throughcollege.  In the intervening months, the NGA education task force has beeninvolved in a joint effort with Bush administration officials to developmore specific goals.Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON LITERACY PROGRAMS via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1990NATIONAL 'REPORT CARD' SHOWS STUDENTS'READING AND WRITING ABILITIES REMAIN LOW     "The reading and writing skills of American students remain dreadfullyinadequate," said Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos Jan. 9.  Cavazos wasspeaking at a Washington news conference to announce the results ofnationwide studies on reading and writing conducted in 1988 by thefederally-funded National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).  TheNAEP is conducted by the Educational Testing Service under a grant from theEducation Department's Office of Educational Research and Improvement.(See related story, RLP, Oct. 19)     Cavazos said that, overall, the reading and writing performance ofnine-, 13- and 17-year-olds remained "virtually unchanged" since the lastassessment in 1984.  Among 17-year-olds, 58 percent still could not read atthe "adept" level, which is defined as having the ability to find,understand, summarize and explain information in materials like 12th-gradetextbooks.  Writing abilities were similarly deficient, showing littlechange since the first writing assessment in 1974.  Seventy-two percent of17-year-olds could not write adequate responses on the least-difficultpersuasive-writing task in the 1988 study.     One hopeful sign amid the otherwise bad news was that Black andHispanic students continued to make gains in reading achievement, althoughthey still lagged behind white students.  In writing, the performance gapbetween minority and white students did not change for nine- and17-year-olds, and while the gap was reduced slightly for 13-year-olds, thereduction was caused by lower performance among the whites.  Officialsblamed poverty for the racial disparities.     Reading from a prepared statement, Cavazos used the disappointing NAEPresults as a springboard to call for enactment of the Bushadministration's education agenda.  "We must give parents the right toselect the schools their children will attend, and let schools compete forstudents...." he said.  "We must let parents, teachers and administratorsmanage their classrooms and schools without interference from district,state and federal governments."     Cavazos read his statement at the beginning of the news conference,then turned the meeting over to representatives of the NAEP for a detailedexplanation of the study results.  He left the room immediately, withoutinviting questions from the scores of reporters in attendance.     But during a later question-and-answer session, a reporter comparedthe lack of educational progress during the 1980s with earlier gains, andasked if the new study had not deliberately avoided criticism of Reagan-eracutbacks in education programs.  Wilhelmina Delco, vice-chairman of theNational Assessment Governing Board and a Democratic member of the TexasHouse of Representatives, used that opportunity to complain about cuts inthe Head Start program for pre-schoolers.  "The Head Start program has beensubstantially diminished in some areas and even abolished in others," shesaid.  "This was a working vehicle, and we would encourage efforts in thisdirection to be advanced, not discarded."     The NAEP will mail free copies of The Reading Report Card, 1971-88 andThe Writing Report Card, 1984-88 to some 20,000 education professionals andpolicymakers.  To find out if you are on their list, and to order thereports if you are not, contact Kent Ashworth, NAEP, P.O. Box 6710,Princeton, N.J. 08541-6710; (800) 223-0267 or (609) 734-5890.  Those not onthe free distribution list will be charged $9 for the reading report and$12 for the writing report, with shipping and handling charges included inthose prices.Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON LITERACY PROGRAMS via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1990NATIONAL COALITION FOR LITERACYELECTS NEW CHAIR, CONSIDERS POLICY ROLE     Indiana University Education Professor Anabel Newman has succeededLiteracy Volunteers of America (LVA) President Jinx Crouch as chair of theNational Coalition for Literacy.  Coalition members include nonprofitliteracy groups, government agencies and education trade groups.  Itpromotes greater awareness of adult illiteracy, attempts to fostercommunication between literacy providers, and assesses national literacyneeds and services.     Newman says that in a departure from previous practice, the coalitionis about to become involved in the national literacy policy debate.  Shetold RLP Jan. 10 that coalition leaders are working toward a consensus onvarious issues, but they have yet to agree on any specific positions.  Thisnew tack presents a problem for the coalition's governmental members (seebelow), who have said they cannot take part in advocacy or lobbyingefforts.     Newman is director of the Reading Practicum Center at IndianaUniversity.  She is a member of the International Reading Association(IRA), one of the coalition's member groups, and serves as chair of theIRA's committee on International Literacy Year (ILY).  The United Nationshas designated 1990 as ILY in an effort to promote literacy throughout theworld.  (See RLP, Dec. 28)     During her one-year term as chair of the coalition, Newman will act asits central coordinator, prepare agendas for and chair coalition meetings,and represent the coalition at various functions.  Newman can be contactedat:  School of Education 211, Indiana University, Bloomington, Ind. 47405;(812) 855-9160 (Reading Practicum Center), or 855-7167 (sec'y), or 855-0378(School of Ed.).     At its most recent meeting, the coalition accepted a request from ILYorganizers and agreed to publicize ILY in the United States.  Thecoalition will put special emphasis on getting the word out to the literacycommunity, in an effort to encourage local ILY observances.  A series ofarticles written by coalition members will be published in the newslettersof the coalition's member groups and in other periodicals.     ABC network Vice President John Harr wrote one such article forinclusion in the December issue of The Reader, the LVA newsletter.  Harr isABC's project director for Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS), another coalitionmember group.  In his article, Harr conceded that U.N. literacy conferencesin Bangkok and Geneva "might seem a little high-flown for local literacyprograms" in the U.S., but he went on to say that awareness of ILYactivities should be "a morale-builder" for local programs.     Newman says the National Contact Center, another coalition member,will function as a clearinghouse for ILY information.  The center will addinformation about national and local ILY activities to its database andrespond to ILY-related inquiries.  The center may be reached via itsnational literacy hotline number, (800) 228-8813, or by writing to P.O. Box81826, Lincoln, Neb. 68501-1826.

MOYNIHAN BERATES ADMINISTRATION FOR FAILURETO NOMINATE HHS OFFICIAL TO RUN J.O.B.S. PROGRAM     Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) wrote to Health and HumanServices Secretary Louis Sullivan Jan. 4 to express his "bitterdisappointment that the administration has still not nominated an AssistantSecretary for Family Support."  Among other responsibilities, theassistant secretary would be in charge of the Job Opportunities and BasicSkills Training (JOBS) program for recipients of Aid to Families WithDependent Children (AFDC).  (See RLP, Dec. 28)     The assistant secretary's post was created by the Family Support Actof 1988, a major overhaul of welfare programs that stresses job trainingand education for welfare mothers.  Moynihan is chairman of the SenateSubcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy, and he was the chiefSenate sponsor of the act, which was signed by President Reagan in Octoberof 1988.  At least 25 states have already implemented JOBS programs despitethe vacancy at HHS.     In his recent letter to Sullivan, Moynihan wrote:  "The program mustbe up and running nationwide by October 1, 1990.  And yet, there is stillno one to run it....  Is there some way we can help?  If you like, I willbe happy to hold a hearing of the subcommittee early in the new year inorder to give you a chance to explain your problem...."     Sources told The Washington Post that the leading candidate for thejob is Gordon Johnson, director of the Illinois Department of Children andFamily Services.  A Sullivan spokesman told RLP that the secretary iseager to complete the selection process, but would only confirm thatJohnson is "a candidate."Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON LITERACY PROGRAMS via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1990CENSUS BUREAU WILL MAKE SPECIAL EFFORT TO INCLUDEILLITERATE, HOMELESS AND DISABLED PEOPLE IN 1990 COUNT     The Census Bureau says it will make special efforts to include suchgroups as illiterate adults, the homeless, and the disabled in the 1990census.  The bureau says it will not attempt an actual headcount ofilliterate or homeless people as such, but some census forms will ask aboutlanguages spoken at home.  The bureau reasons that many illiterate and/orhomeless people would be reluctant to answer questions about their status,rendering any attempted headcount highly unreliable.  Census officials alsosay that, in the absence of universally accepted definitions of"illiteracy" and "homelessness," they will not attempt to come up withtheir own.     The 1990 census is being called a "do-it-yourself" count because itwill be conducted almost entirely by mail.  Five out of six households willreceive a short form containing 14 questions.  The rest, about 17 millionhouseholds, will receive a long form with 59 questions.  (It is these longforms that will include questions about languages and disabilities.)     The bureau will feature the "Census '90" logo prominently in a plannedadvertising campaign, in the hope that people will recognize it when theirforms arrive in the mail.  The forms will include a toll-free telephonenumber for anyone who needs help filling them out, and the bureau has alsoarranged to set up hundreds of walk-in assistance centers across thecountry.     Households that do not return census forms will be visited by"enumerators" from the bureau.  Also, special teams of enumerators willinterview some homeless "street people" at pre-identified sites, but theseinterviews are designed to collect sample data only, not to produce adefinitive count.Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON LITERACY PROGRAMS via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1990FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICES     JTPA Native American Programs.

Organisations that make available a myriad of CD-ROM-based information  empower their employees with instant access tocritical information, hence enabling them to make decisionsquicker.With a shared CD-ROM resource on the network, organisations canalso provide better support and responsiveness to customers whilepromoting better communication within the organisation.Many large organisations use several types of computing platforms,including PCs grouped together using NetWare, various Unix dialectssupporting TCP/IP, as well as several application servers runningWindows NT.Today's CD-ROM Server solutions allow these environments to sharethe same CD-ROM subsystem and information simultaneously.There are several types of solutions available, from file server-based software  to file server independent products that sit out onan Ethernet or Token Ring as an intelligent node.A networked CD-ROM subsystem incorporates three distincttechnologies: CD-ROM drive devices, network connectivity technologyand data storage management products.CD-ROM ApplicationsThe rate at which CD-ROM technology is assimilated into anorganisation is dependent upon those CD-ROM applications utilisedor about to be utilised.Because of the appeal of the medium, the number of CD-ROMs beingmade available to each professional, business and technicaldiscipline is growing exponentially. CD-ROM is becoming thepreferred publishing medium.Although the first requirements in an organisation for CD-ROMconnectivity generally occur on the workgroup level, departmentaland enterprise level implementations can also quickly becomepriorities.Consequently, as the technology extends to the corporate void moreprotocols and network operating systems need to be supported asenvironments come on-line.Networking CD-ROM drives offers significant benefits. There areseveral different methods available to achieve basically the sameresult. Some are hardware oriented, while others employ a softwareapproach. Some use existing file server resources while others arefile server independent.What to ConsiderSome factors to consider when choosing a CD-ROM networkingarchitecture:  CostHardware and software costs, license fees or per-user fees areimportant.  Ease of InstallationSolutions requiring access to file servers or a network shutdownare often not desirable. Installation will ideally be plug-and-play.  Ease of operationIdeally, users will have nothing new to learn.  Multiprotocol SupportThe product should be able to simultaneously support the majorprotocols.  Impact on File ServerSolutions that use file server resources can cause performance orthroughput problems, as file servers become burdened with the loadof handling additional overhead.  Drive LocationIn cases like major libraries, centralised drive location andmanagement is preferred. In other cases, it is desirable to havethe drives located departmentally.  Performance and throughputPerformance should be sufficient to meet the current andanticipated needs of the application.To ensure that performance is consistent, it should be independentof other activity on the network or file server.  Doubling up on Network TrafficIncremental network traffic should be minimised, particularly overWANs or through LAN segments connected to bridges and routers.ConclusionThere are various architectures to choose from to network CD-ROMs,but one thing's for sure, CD-ROM networking is here to stay.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996Why VLANs Are Now popularfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, COMDEX/ASIA'96by Douglas HillVery few modern networking concepts are as confusing as virtualLANs (VLANs). Virtual LANs are new, and their widespread use hasonly just begun.Vendors, in an attempt to take advantage of interest in the latesttrends, have blurred the concept of what a VLAN really is.There are many ways to implement VLANs in switching products -each with very different capabilities and limitations.Why Use LAN Switches?VLANs are an inherent outgrowth of LAN switching.The amount of data being carried on LANs has grown steadily andrapidly.LAN switches make it possible to transfer much larger amounts ofdata than was possible with hubs and routers. Token rings andEthernet segments can be dedicated to individual devices, or tosmall groups of devices.LimitationsLAN switches achieve high performance levels by using simplifiedprocesses.They are basically bridges, rather than routers. They switch vialayer-two ("MAC") destination/source addresses; this is muchsimpler than routing.All bridged networks have a basic limitation - bridges, since theydon't participate in the layer-three protocols which use MACbroadcasts.Although point-to-point traffic is isolated to the specific portssending and receiving those frames, broadcasts must be senteverywhere.The same is true of frames that have a destination MAC address thathasn't been learned by the bridge. They have to be sent everywhere.In most networks of moderate size, this "flooding" has almost noimpact on other traffic.However, in a very large network or one with an unusually highlevel of broadcasts, it is possible for flooding to impact point-to-point traffic.When this happens, it's important to keep broadcasts isolated in"broadcast domains".Many LANs built over the last 10 years use hubs and routers.The workstations, servers, and other devices are connected to thehubs, and the hubs are interconnected with routers.In this type of LAN, broadcast domains are built automatically,since every hub is a broadcast domain.Routers are essentially devices for interconnecting broadcastdomains.But with networks based on LAN switches we need to provide thisfunction in other ways.Virtual LANsA virtual LAN is a broadcast domain. Just as with a hub, alldevices in a virtual LAN see all broadcasts as well as all frameswith unknown destination addresses, so long as the broadcast and"unknown" frames originated inside that virtual LAN.With hubs and routers, frames are repeated within a hub and routedbetween hubs. With virtual LANs, frames are switched (bridged)within a virtual LAN, and routed between virtual LANs.A virtual LAN can be considered as nothing more than a moreflexible version of familiar networking practices.What is new is that a broadcast domain is no longer restricted tothe devices in one physical part of the network.Switching is simpler than routing, and therefore faster.To the extent that data can be switched between devices, ratherthan routed, it can be moved faster.Unfortunately for hub/router-based networks, devices that need toconnect to each other all day long are often in different parts ofa building, or even in different buildings.Virtual LANs address this issue - if they're powerful enough.A broadcast domain in a good virtual LAN implementation can span abuilding, campus, or city.So the need for routing is minimised, and data moves much faster.Multiple MAC TypesRemember that the basic purpose of moving to a switched LAN is toincrease throughput.One fundamental way to do that is to divide the network intosmaller segments or rings; this is done by switching each device onits own segment or ring.This means that workstations no longer contend for bandwidth.Modern switched networks are moving to structures which allowcentral resources to run at speeds greater than those of theworkstations.Examples include: 10 Mbps Ethernet workstations and 100 MbpsEthernet servers; 16 Mbps token ring workstations and 100 Mbps FDDIservers.The point is to switch traffic between the workstation and theservers, rather than routing it.This means that a virtual LAN must be able to accommodate a varietyof MAC types.Network ChangesIn many networks it's common for devices to move frequently withina building or a campus.You should be able to assign a workstation to one or more virtualLANs once, and after that it should remain connected to them, nomatter where on the campus it has moved.Speed OperationIncreased throughput is the reason why LAN networks are moving toswitching solutions.Virtual LANs assist this movement by keeping broadcast traffic atreasonable levels.It is obvious that the implementation of the virtual LAN capabilityshould not slow down the network.This implies that the actual forwarding of the individual framesshould be done in hardware, including checking source anddestination virtual LAN matches.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996MCAFEE DELIVERS BETTER SCANNING IN VIRUSSCANfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, COMDEX/ASIA'96McAfee will display VirusScan 2.5 for Windows 3.x, a new version ofits anti-virus software featuring dramatically improved on-accessscanning capabilities at Comdex this year.VirusScan detects over 8,000 viruses and virus variants, includingall the latest macro viruses.By utilising memory outside the first megabyte of conventionalmemory, McAfee's new VxD module leverages the full strength ofMcAfee's virus scanning engine.

SSA and JD Edwards have only been here for five years."Gangla said EDS was set up in Singapore in 1979 as a softwarehouse. It has since moved into providing software applications forIBM computers and into IT services such as outsourcing, help desks,disaster recovery and network management.Chief among Gangla's concerns is to steer the industry away fromthe perception that EDS is only an IBM solutions company.He said although more than half of EDS' revenue came fromsupporting the AS/400 and RS/6000 platforms, revenue from servicesand multivendor platforms will overtake the IBM-based revenue bythe end of the year."The market has shifted, wanting more value-added services. We'veevolved the company to do more consulting and services," he said.Gangla said outsourcing has offered EDS good potential, with thecompany already signing up 15 customers in the region."In the US small to mid-range systems market, 40 to 50 per cent ofcompanies have already outsourced their IT operations.

The Help function came in handy to find thatbit of information.However, the manual supplied has little information, its pagesmostly containing the pictures of Web Gallery.I tried Web.Transit without giving it too much of my time to seehow fast I could at least get a handle on the program.Transit converts documents into HTML format. It proved that gettingfamiliar with Web.Transit would not be a short process, simplybecause when you import a file to be formatted for HTML viewingthere are a lot of decisions to be made prior to that step.The file itself has to be in shape, whether in Rich Text Format,Word, WordPerfect or ASCII.Then a template equivalent has to be ready, with tags, then thepaths have to be right.When everything is ready, pushing the right buttons shows colouredfillers rapidly giving an effective indication of the job goingthrough and the layout is done in a jiffy - a jiffy excluding allthe work that has gone into setting everything up.Thumbs up to Corel with their submission to the arena of Web pageand HTML document design.Corel Gallery is also supplied with Designer and Transit.

That is the promise that comes with More Like This.This is accomplished using its own information base as a kind oftreasury that facilitates searches through words associated withkey words.However, the programme itself is not yet perfect: it did not filterout repeated displays of Web pages following a search.The problem may lie in how creators of Web pages write their searchhelp details.On the other hand, these Web search engines which perform siteindexing just plod their way through the Internet and if theyblindly log on to everything found, repetitions will occur.So the fault may well lie on the other side - KDL Technology inthis case.To make a fair comparison, I tested the on-line Excite search usingNetscape, and it was clear that using Excite resulted in lessrepetitions.In fact, having Excite to tap into without the need to have thesearch software located on one's own hard disk means a fair savingin disk space and the associated woes of installing it.Check out Excite at http://www.excite.com before digging into yourpockets for any installable software.Search LevelsThere are four levels of search with More Like This: standard,keyword, concept and wide angle.Standard is a straightforward search, of course using its inbredintelligence.Keyword is a more focused search where use is made of selectedwords.Concept casts a broader net and promises to be quite entertaining,while  wide angle brings in materials normally left outside typicalsearches.If strict control is required over the search, there is a customsearch feature which lets the user determine how searches areconducted.This helper application, which sits nicely atop the browser, canwork with Usenet articles as well as Web pages.KDL says this is not a plug-in, which they define as a programwhich may alter the program a plug-in works with.More Like This can be minimised and placed on the taskbar like anyother Windows 95 adapted program.It runs on Windows 95 and Windows 3.1, requiring 7 MB of free diskspace to install and works best with 8 MB or more of RAM.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CREATIVE CONTROL FOR CARD HAPPY USERS: Corel Print Housefrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36by Dwayne SerjeantFlying out of the Corel stable and into the category of "1,001useless applications to fill up your hard disk" comes Print House,your personal calendar and card maker.I know that, being a designer, perhaps I shouldn't tilt my nose sohigh at products like this because there is a market for them.It reminds me of 10 years ago, when you had a product likePrintShop for the Apple II that enabled you to print the same sortof things on a dinky little dot-matrix printer.Although slightly more sophisticated in what it can produce, PrintHouse is the basically the same application with a Beverly Hillsfacelift.The manual is a good couple of hundred pages long, but only thefirst 16 are taken up with how to use the application. Theremainder are pictures of the clip-art libraries included on theCD-ROM.InstallationInstallation is simple enough with the Corel/Microsoft Wizardtechnology taking you through the steps.Also included, and definitely worth using, is the Uninstall Wizardwhich, like most Uninstall options, gets rid of the myriadcollection of files that are installed nowadays.Print House can be used by multiple users by way of a customisedstartup.By setting up the manner in which users want their application tobe presented, Print House makes it easier on the novice to get upand running, although it would be hard to place a 'professional'option into this application.You can begin Print House with a variety of options includingstarting from an existing sample, starting totally from scratch,using a saved version/template that you have created, or by using aPaperDirect template.PaperDirect make high quality paper reams and objects which PrintHouse users can print directly to.The trouble here is that it's an IDD call to get your set of papersordered, and a DHL option for delivery. Isn't Hallmark stillcheaper?Ease Of UseThe toolbar palette includes just enough options to let you tweakand adjust the included graphics, or to draw your own.It all borrows fairly heavily from Corel's CorelDraw product andeven feels fairly similar, but is far easier to get to grips with.The standard options for type adjustment and colour changing are inplace and the interface is similar to all the Corel line ofproducts.An additional notebook option lets absolute beginners get to gripswith Print House by popping up buttons with labels like 'EditProject', 'Save Project' and 'Exit Print House'.It really would be difficult to get lost with this product and I'msure that was its main purpose.MessagesAside from the conventional collection of clip-art, Print Houseincludes a large selection of desktop printer-quality photographsand an even larger collection of canned messages like "Wishing YouA Wonderful Day" and "For A Nice Grandma. Did You Know ThatWherever You Go, Happiness Follows."If the youngster of the house wants a card making application, thenthe glove fits.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996AZTECH ZETA MASTERS ART OF SPEED READING: Aztech Zeta 10X CD-ROM Drive (CDA1068)from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36by Alan AndrewsIn increasing number of software developers today opt in favour ofthe CD-ROM drive as the preferred storage media.CD-ROM drive manufactures are also churning out ever faster CD-ROMdrives.We evaluated one such offering from Aztech Systems: the Aztech Zeta10X CD-ROM drive (Model CDA-1068).The X-factorIn its nomenclature, the X signifies its basic data transfer speedof 150 kbps, hence 10X signifies 1500 kbps.Fast CD-ROM drives like the Zeta do fill a need: a sluggish CD-ROMdrive can take ages to retrieve information from a CD-ROM.Faster CD-ROM drives speed up the transfer of information from theCD- ROM to the computer system.This results in good quality reproduction of animated files from aCD-ROM disk.Test DriveWe decided to evaluate the Aztech Zeta drive considering thereality of today's requirements instead of merely testing whetherit conformed to specifications.To ensure compatibility on different machines, we tested the Zetadrive on an assembled 486 as well as on a branded Pentium machine.Both machines were loaded with 8 MB RAM and an IDE drive interface.What immediately strikes the lay user about the Zeta drive are itsease of installation and use.It took us barely 15 minutes to connect the drive and kick startthe Windows 95 machine.Windows 95 has built in drivers that recognise the drive.Speeding TicketNext we tested it for speed.Having loaded the Microsoft Encarta 95 CD-ROM encyclopedia disk, asearch for the specific words brought up the results in thetwinkling of an eye.The Zeta drive is also capable of playing normal Audio CDs.Its front panel has an easily accessible volume control, astop/eject button and a play/skip button.The drive also has the capability to run multimedia games, minusthe jerky motion.We tested the drive with WarCraft, Rebel Assault, Power Monger andFlight Simulator.While running most games, a CD-ROM drive has to look into the CD-ROM for code or pictures.When the CD-ROM drive is slow in its search, it takes time tolocate the information, causing a temporary break in the game orintroducing a jerky motion of the animated object.With the Zeta CDA 1068 we did not experience any of these hitches.The drive is excellent retrieving data:  it took just 12 seconds toread 52 MB of data from the data CD.SupportWhile the performance of the drive was good, the documentation onthe drive is just a skimpy leaflet.It does not reveal much. For instance, it did not mention what thepurpose of a red jumper on the CD-ROM drive is.The Customer Support Number in the warranty certificate led us tochase up three other numbers.Though the leaflet mentions that the Customer Support Number is 65-741-7211, the actual number we had to call was 65-742-9633.This number is not listed in the Certificate of Warranty literatureprovided by Aztech.However the people providing help on 65-742-9633 are extremelypatient, competent and helpful.Aztech's Web site,  www.aztech.com.sg, was a good source ofinformation for Aztech products, FAQs as well as utilities anddrivers.EvaluationOverall the Aztech CDA 1,068 10X drive does answer the requirementsof today's impatient, speed-hungry users.It does its job quickly, efficiently and with a minimum of fuss,which is what the lay user wants.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996DBMS REVAMP HELPS INFORMIX PIP SYBASEfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36IN A recent report on the DBMS market, US-based market researchfirm, the Gartner Group, reported that it observed a shift in thedatabase ranks in 1995 with Sybase and Informix swapping positions.Sybase, said the report, reacted to significant technical andquality challenges with the delivery of System 11 but the damagehad already been done with System 10 and it fell to No. 3 in DBMSrevenues.Informix, on the other hand, addressed the challenges ofscalability when it undertook a complete DBMS redesign in 1990.The company also turned a corner in 1995 with a shift in focus tosupporting high-end OLTP and DSS solutions.The Illustra acquisition also positions Informix strongly tosupport the new application demands beyond the year 2000.In the Asia-Pacific, IDC figures tallied with the Gartner Group'sfindings, placing Informix third behind Oracle and IBM but ahead ofSybase.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996WILL INFORMIX BE LATE?from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36INFORMIX first announced Universal Server back in February 1996after it had finalised its acquisition of Illustra.

Why was this so?WT: One of the reasons was the strong 51 per cent growth that weexperienced in the Asia-Pacific. Some countries in Southeast Asiaeclipsed even this with 80 per cent growth rates.The economies here are growing fast with a lot of data tomanipulate. Companies here need the kind of database power that wecan offer.Worldwide, we saw our database licenses grow by 61 per cent over1995 and our new product releases and announcements such asInformix Workgroup Server for Unix and Windows NT and InformixOnLine Extended Parallel Server 8.1 and Universal Server were wellreceived.What differentiates Informix from the other database vendors suchas Oracle and Sybase?First and foremost, unlike our competitors, we focus on nothingelse but on database and database tools and are thus able tochannel all our resources toward this end.Some 70 per cent of our revenues come from our database business.We recognise that we cannot be the best in everything and thus workwith a wide range of partners from system vendors like DigitalEquipment, application vendors such as Baan, SAP, SSA andPeoplesoft, consultants like the Big Six, and systems integratorslike NCS, ST Computers and CSA.In this way, we can leverage off the core strengths of each partyother.We are also very focused on a few industries to prevent ourselvesfrom being spread too thin.These areas include the telco, manufacturing, banking and financeand particularly in Asia, the government industries.Some analysts say that difficulties in integrating the Informix andIllustra databases will delay Universal Server. Is this true?Absolutely not. Although it won't be easy task to integrate theobject-oriented database from Illustra with our relational-basedone, we are confident of meeting our year-end ship date.In September, we will launch the Datablade Developers Program andalready have at least 24 companies including the likes of AdobeSystems, Macromedia, MapInfo and Verity, writing datablades for awhole host of applications such as text search/management, videosearch and retrieval and electronic commerce.Industry analysts reported in February, after we officiallyacquired Illustra, that we had an 18 month headstart on ourcompetition in multi-dimensional, object-oriented relationaldatabase technology.What are Informix's expansion plans in the Asia-Pacific?You will see us putting in more offices, more people, more hardwareresources such as the Advanced Training Centre (see page 2 News) werecently set up with Digital, more training centres, and tighterrelations with our ISVs and channel partners.We are also looking at adding to the four offices we already havein China, and to the three in India.

Ourproducts cover 100 per cent of the marketplace as we providemultiplatform support including Windows, OS/2, Mac and Unix," saidGallivan.Corporate SalesStressing that 80 per cent of Netscape's current sales come fromcorporations, Gallivan said Netscape's initiatives in this marketinclude Navigator; Netscape One, the developers programme targetedat both developers and independent software developers; Navio, anew division that will look into using Navigator on gaming andpaging devices as well as interactive TV sets; and Actra, asolution for electronic commerce.On the server side, Gallivan said the enterprise server, mailserver and news server are now available with certificate serverand directory server  available by the end of the year.Netscape recorded US$75 million in revenues for Q2 ended June '96.Citing analyst projections, he said by end 1996, the company maywell hit the US$300 million range.In Asia, Netscape's strategy is two-fold. The first is to developlocal partnerships in every country and secondly, to set-up Asia-Pacific offices to provide in-depth technical and product supportas well as marketing functions."We want to get the Asia-Pacific faster into Netscape's productlifecycle," said Gallivan, which is why the company recently openedan office in Hong Kong, he added.Following this, there will be an office in Malaysia and Koreawithin the next six months.Netscape will also deploy mirror Web sites in the region which willhave more localised content and more accessible information.A mirrored Web site is operational  in Australia, being built up inJapan and will be set up in Hong Kong and Singapore towards the endof this year.Netscape has appointed Hong Kong's JOS Distribution as its masterdistributor in January this year. Sales have been growing 30 to 40per cent month-on-month, said Albert Chan, GM, JOS Distribution.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996NETSCAPE UNWRAPS CROSS PLATFORM OSfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36by Tim BajarinIf you had ever wondered about Netscape's intentions of turningtheir popular browser into a cross platform operating system, youcan wonder no more.Netscape recently announced the Netscape AppFoundry, which is a newapplication model for developing enterprisewide applications.Eighty per cent of Netscape's revenues come from the use of theirbrowsers and network software in enterprise systems.Their goal is to gain 30 to 50 per cent market share in corporateenvironments where client-server architecture is becoming standardeven for mission critical operations.Cross Platform TechnologyThey see their main competition coming from Lotus Notes andMicrosoft's Back Office, but Netscape is bullish about theirprojected goals since they believe that they have an edge due totheir true cross platform technology.At the heart of the AppFoundry is a set of tools that would letusers build applications based on a common intranet infrastructure.Netscape claims that with these tools a user could develop anddeploy a fully distributed knowledge repository that is built onceand can run anywhere.More importantly, it could work with legacy systems databases,platforms and even applications.This is the original vision of all of the software gurus who havebeen touting object-based back-end software for over a decade.Cross PlatformHowever, the Internet, and more particularly, intranets, make itpossible for a true cross platform object software model to emergeand Netscape plans to be in the forefront of this development.The AppFoundry could be pivotal in this scenario as it would createthe back-end network and applications layer that would work on anyexisting desktop PC, as well as thin clients.At the core of AppFoundry is something call ed Netscape SuiteSpot,where network productivity applications, such as publishing,collaboration, messaging, search and indexing and directory andsecurity reside.A user would utilise this SuiteSpot to link these applications tocompany-specific applications such as R&D, human resources, salesand distribution, finance, customer service and marketing.Over the next nine months, Netscape will create and develop thetools to deliver on this concept, starting with Netscape SuiteSpotsoftware, a full service intranet suite, followed by the NetscapeOne and Development tools.By Q1 of 1997, they will start delivering the AppFoundryapplications and tool kit, which will then give users a set ofenterprisewide solutions.This new venture is interesting since it uses Java and JavaScriptsource code, which will be given free and is downloadable,modifiable and viewable from the 'Net.With their AppFoundry program, Netscape is clearly on a path totake Microsoft head on and push to have their Netscape browserbecome the GUI not only for the 'Net but for all applications inthe future.With the AppFoundry, they now have a set of development tools thatis truly cross platform and one that should make them a formidablecompetitor.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996HK OEM FIRM turns to innovationfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36Mby Joy TangManufacturing VGA cards for OEM and ODM customers is no longerenough for Hong Kong company Express Office Automation.Six years after acting as an OEM/ODM VGA card shop, the company hasdecided to offer a value-added series of VGA cards for the retailmarket under its Elephant brand name (see photo at right).According to Andson Lam, MD, Express Office Automation, the firmcurrently supplies more than 50 per cent of the world's VGA cards.However, lack of product differentiation has forced local companiesto compete largely on price, quantity, or by cutting materialcosts.The convergence of PC, video and TV technologies were behind Lam'sdecision on VGA cards as his first retail product family."Since MPEG software technology today has already advanced tosupporting 28 to 50 fps, we believe that it's also time for VGAcards and MPEG software to replace the hardware MPEG card inproviding smooth video CD entertainment on the PC and television,"he said.Lam added that users prefer to record computer images onto videorather than storing them onto the hard disk. "To do so, they need aVGA-to-TV converter," he said.In addition, edutainment applications are best viewed on a largescreen TV than on the standard 14-inch PC monitor, he said."It is the first time we have something for retail," Lam said. "Ifwe produced a conventional VGA card, it would be the same as anyother. I could not have added a brand name."After six months of R&D by a six-man engineering team, ExpressOffice Automation came up with the Elephant Power Video series ofVGA cards which currently has 12 models based on chipsets fromAlliance, Trident, S3, and Cirrus Logic.Unique FeaturesThe distinguishing feature of the cards is the optional US$40 EV-TO-03 PC-to-TV signal converter module daughtercard, which fitsonto a custom-designed, 20-pin connector built onto each card.The value-addition comes from optimising VGA output for TVresolutions.Robert Chan, Express Office Automation's engineering manager, saidthat the latest US chipset and digital-to-analogue circuittechnology had been employed to achieve near-PC monitor quality onthe television display."The EV-TO-03 is designed with an anti-flicker and phase-lockedloop circuit to provide the best performance of VGA-to-TVconversion," he said."Users can connect their PCs to a standard TV through an externalS-Video or composite TV connector, and adjust the horizontal andvertical screen position externally."Interest in the product has been promising, with over 4,000 cardssold in two months of promotion.Bundling agreements have already been forged with PC companies TaChi Computer in Beijing and East Ocean Computer in Shanghai, whileother partnerships are under discussion in the US, Germany, Koreaand Israel.Lam projects sales of 5,000 to 10,000 VGA cards a month.About 3,500 VGA cards and 2,000 daughtercards a day are beingproduced at the company's Shenzhen factory, and production volumeis expected to reach a million units annually.The company  is also working on a project to design a motherboardfor an Internet appliance. Lam said that the motherboard willintegrate VGA, TV output, I/O, audio and modem functions in anotebook-sized form factor.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996ASIAN FIRMS TRYING TQM FOR QUALITYfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36As Asia's economies continue to boom, many companies are now facingquality management issues which will determine their future successin the global business arena.Convincing employees to take responsibility for their productionlines and make their own decisions may be the toughest obstaclecompanies in Asia will need to overcome.Positive results can be achieved through departmental initiativesthat fulfil local objectives, provided there is support from seniormanagement to implement Total Quality Management (TQM) programmes.A new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), The Questfor Quality: Mastering Management in Asia examines TQM, focusingprimarily on quality in the Asian context.The report bases its conclusions on a survey of several hundred UKand Hong Kong firms, examining how companies in Asia have adoptedTQM and what benefits and pitfalls they have experienced.To evaluate different approaches to quality, the report comparesTQM and Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) and concludes thatBPR can be seen as the successor to TQM.Pros And ConsWhile TQM involves systematic performance measures, benchmarking,empowerment and continuous development, BPR deals with the processof "deconstructing" a company to better meet customer needs.BPR examines a company's entire future structure and then attemptsto reorganise things according to senior executives' ideals.However, companies cannot achieve dramatic restructuring withoutthe right human resources co-operation and management expertise.On the other hand, TQM tends to deal with corporate and localculture first.A TQM process may involve a certain amount of restructuring - mostcommonly, a move towards cross-functional work structures.BPR and TQM can be integrated successfully through a dual-trackapproach designed to incorporate the TQM process with the corporateplanning process.Having defined its mission for quality, management must thendetermine what is critical to achieving successful results.A full review of the company's strengths and weaknesses in relationto these critical success factors should reveal important areaswhere improvements can be made.Asian ResponsesAccording to the report, Asian junior and middle managers are waryof TQM, but senior managers tend to view it as the only authenticrevolution in management practice in the last 40 years.The report offers guidelines on the different approaches toimplementation of TQM and provides various measures on how tomeasure results.The tendency to run companies in a traditionally patriarchal way iswidespread in Asia, with the CEO seen as a father figureresponsible for all management decisions.The report warns that ISO 9000, traditionally regarded as theinternationally recognised standard of quality, should not beconfused with ongoing TQM programmes.While it may increase competitiveness and satisfy clients, it isunlikely to foster a culture of continuous improvement.Most companies which implement successful TQM programmes seecertification in ISO 9000, at best, as one of a number of importantmilestones on the way to a broader and more long-term goal.A case study in the report looks at the success of a TQM systemestablished in the 1980s by Hong Kong's Kowloon-Canton RailwayCorporation (KCRC).Benefits have included significantly raised profits and increasedcustomer and employee satisfaction.Since 1990, operating costs have dropped by 19 per cent and theKCRC has re-invested 11 per cent of the profit into the company,passing on the remaining 8 per cent to the passengers through farereductions.A case study on Texas Instruments in the Philippines reveals thecompany's move away from a hierarchical structure with dogmaticleadership focused on making products, towards a "flatter" networkstructure with an inspirational leadership seeking to create newmarkets.The report concludes that an analysis of successful companies showsthat they have common characteristics: strong leadership and clearvision; an empowered workforce; effective use of informationtechnology and teamwork; and careful management of resources to letthe company do "less with more".The report shows that successful TQM strategies can be implementedand results achieved in Asia, despite the indigenous cultures andwork philosophies common throughout the region.It also shows that TQM can benefit all tiers of a company and, ifimplemented correctly, result in higher production capacity, higherbottom-line profits and job satisfaction among employees and,ultimately, end-users.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996IBM CHANGES TACK TO GAIN REVENUESfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36by Isabelle ChanIBM, the world's No. 1 computer company, raked in revenues of US$70billion last year. The years prior to that saw Big Blue's financialperformance stagnating in the US$60 - US$65 billion revenuebracket.Although the revenue figures are probably the envy of many small aswell as large companies, IBM felt it was not growing."We realised we couldn't really grow, and it was critical for us togrow," said Andrew Shields, director of Sales and Channels, Asia-Pacific, IBM Software, speaking to ACW recently.Eighteen months ago, IBM was restructured and the IBM SoftwareCompany headed by John Thompson, was born."We see software as the lynchpin between IBM hardware and services.If we succeed in software, we can sell more services and hardware,"said Shields.The IBM Software Company can be said to be facing the same problemas corporate IBM.Despite revenues of US$12.7 billion in FY'95, making it the largestsoftware company in the world, Shields said its software businesswas not growing. "Software was a profitable business for us, but itwas not growing the way we wanted," he said.One-third of the total software business was found in large systemsor mainframe, which was not growing, Shields said."The growth was in desktop or distributed systems software.Although we are seen as a major player, we need to become No. 1 inorder to compete with companies like Microsoft and Novell," saidShield."We realised that if we continued with what we were doing, we couldnot become No.1 as the competition had too much of a headstart."Therefore, Shields siad the strategic direction for the softwaregroup was to shrug off its proprietary history and be "open".New StrategiesTo do that, IBM embarked on technology acquisitions of companies incollaborative/workgroup computing and supporting multipleplatforms.In addition, it began to develop internal products that also workedin a heterogeneous environment.The Lotus and Tivoli acquisitions not only offered products thatfitted into IBM's network-centric computing focus, but alsoprovided access to markets that Big Blue did not have.The story does not end here. IBM still had a number of issues toaddress.Firstly, because its focus was solely on direct selling, it lackedresources to cover the whole market."We didn't have enough people to cover the market, and ourcompetitors were gaining market share. So we decided to focus onour business partners and formed the BESTeam programme," saidShields."Particularly in the last two years, we realised the value ofexternal business partners in growing IBM. The challenge is tobuild both internal and external channels and to work in harmony."According to Shields, the new programme essentially helps itsBESTeam members to increase revenue, reduce costs and enhance thecompany's image. IBM currently offers BESTeam members freetechnical and product training till the end of the year.The Business Enterprise Solution Team (BESTeam) programme has some700 members, and the number is expected to hit 1,000 by year-end.The initial target was 250 for 1996.Ninety per cent of IBM's Asia-Pacific software revenues last yearwere generated through direct selling. Shields is aiming for 80 percent of desktop software in the Asia-Pacific to be sold through itsexternal channels."So far, we're pleased with the results, and we are set to achieveour target. At the end of July this year, 75 per cent has been soldthrough our business partners," he said.Comparing with IBM's Asia-Pacific software revenues of US$2 billionlast year, Shields said he expects a better performance this yearwith a target of US$2.3 billion, half of which will be from desktoprevenues.Although IBM will continue to be strong in its traditionally bigmarkets Japan and Australia, its key focus will be on the growthmarkets in Asean and Greater China.Market-oriented ApproachShields also said that IBM needs to move from a sales-orientedapproach to become more of a marketing-oriented company in order tobe successful."We found that IBM is the largest software company in the worldwhich most people didn't realise,  including ourselves. We need tocommunicate it and tell our customers what we are doing," he said.When asked if the negative image of OS/2 has had any impact on therest of IBM's software products, Shields said: "There's a negativeimage of OS/2, and we've been reacting to the negative press. Butwe have to stop it, and we don't have to apologise for it. OS/2 hasdone well in the market it was targeted at, which is the corporatemarket."We have new products, but OS/2 is just a small piece of the pie.IBM's focus is on open systems software and we're focusing heavilyon middleware," he added.It appears IBM is turning around with a completely new strategy.But is the IBMer ready for this new open approach?"We are our own biggest enemy in terms of understanding what weare. But the IBM culture is very strong. Many IBM staff have beenin the company for many years, since the days when we "ran" theindustry," said Shields."Now that we are employing people from outside, the negativeaspects of the IBM culture will break down, and people will becomemore open minded."Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996HOME IMAGING HOLDS EXCITING POSSIBILITIESfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36THE day is not far off when consumers will be able to take aphotograph, manipulate the image and print it on a printer at home.This is Hewlett-Packard's vision for the future.Its Home Imaging Division, formed about 18 months ago, focuses onthe development of this new concept, said Vjomesh Joshi, generalmanager, Home Imaging Division, HP.According to Joshi, 60 million photos are taken each year, and over29 per cent of PC owners would like to manipulate photos on theircomputer.HP has earmarked 1997 as the year when its vision to bringphotography to the home PC will become reality. According to Joshi,the division will introduce a home imaging system next year.Joshi believes market opportunities exist as the number ofmultimedia home PCs is expected to grow from 40 million this yearto 120 million by the year 2000.The key success factors for the technology to become mainstream aremany.

And if itdoes, who are the users?A few years ago the answer to this question would have been in thenegative.The few existing users were restricted to the financial andgovernment market sectors.However technology has opened up new opportunities forcommunications which did not exist a few years ago.New business practices such as telecommuting, cybershopping and'Net-based financial services are driving the requirements for lowcost, convenient and effective secure communications.Security will become an integral part of data communications in thefuture. The day will come when users will purchase communicationsproducts with built-in security without being aware of itspresence.Security FeaturesBuilding security into communications products should not mean thatsecurity will be degraded.To illustrate, we can use as an example the integration of securityfeatures into the analogue dial-up modem. I use the modem as anexample only because it will be the most commonly usedcommunications device for the foreseeable future.However similar arguments could be applied to leased line modems ordigital ISDN products.There are some modem manufacturers who claim to offer a high degreeof security because they encrypt the data which passes throughtheir devices.The provision of encryption does not in itself guarantee security.The type of algorithm used to do the encryption is a criticalfeature that a user should look for.The average user is not qualified to determine the strength orweakness of a manufacturer's proprietary algorithm.To consider an example, it would be possible for a manufacturer tobuild a buffer in a modem that stored 100 bits of data.The contents of the buffer when full, would be read out in thereverse order.The effect of this would be blocks of 100 bits of data whose orderis reversed. While the data on the telephone line would appearunreadable, it would be a trivial exercise to reconstruct theoriginal message.This is a rather simple example but it demonstrates that theaverage user has no chance of assessing the strength of thesecurity in a product.The solution is to go for products that make use of securitytechniques which are in the public domain and have beenindependently assessed by experts in the field of cryptography.The use of public domain algorithms creates further problems.If the details of an algorithm are known, then the security of thedata passing through the algorithm depends on security given to thecryptographic keys  that are used.Secure Key ManagementThere are products on the market which use the DES algorithm thatmeets the criteria of being an independently verified algorithm,and uses a single fixed key for the encryption of data.Because these types of products generally have no means of changingthe cryptographic keys, the user is left with a product which isuseless.Users should look for products which offer a secure key managementfacility.One such technique for secure key management is  the Diffie Hellmankey exchange.The technique makes use of public key algorithms to securelyestablish encryption keys between communicating modems.Forward looking manufacturers of communications products arelooking to security vendors for help in combining communicationsand security.It will not be long before we will see fully secure LAN, ISDN andX.25 interface products.We will also start to see security being incorporated into thecommunications standards.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996HARDCOPY BUSINESS SET TO LEAP IN ASIAfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36Hewlett-Packard is looking to grow its hardcopy business with majorinvestments by its Business LaserJet Division and Inkjet PrinterGroup in the fast-growing Asian markets.According to Chris Morgan, marketing centre manager, PeripheralsGroup, Asia-Pacific, HP, the company's hardcopy business grew about45.4 per cent, almost doubling the overall market growth of 22.8per cent.The highest growing countries, which grew more than 100 per cent,are New Zealand, the Philippines and Indonesia, said Morgan.According to Rich Raimondi, general manager, Business LaserJetDivision, Hewlett-Packard, the division is now looking to grow themarket, and is making major investments in Singapore and China.In a bid to be more consumer-oriented, HP has introduced a changein its manufacturing process, according to Pradeep Jotwani, generalmanager, Consumer Sales & Marketing, Hewlett-Packard.Its long term strategies were to move closer to the customerthrough regional diversification;

They arenow adopted as digital input devices in mainstream businessoffices.Faraci said the new concept is "scan to share", bridging paper anddigital communications. The benefits include faster transmission ofinformation, lower costs, and greater control as users can easilymanipulate information from the desktop and print only what isneeded.Driving the demand for scanners are its ease-of-use, the growth incomputational memory power and the availability of low-cost outputdevices."Three years ago, there were no low-cost output devices to exploitthe scanner's capabilities. Today the printer quality is improving,hence the increase in scanner demand," said Faraci.According to figures from market research firm InfoTrends ResearchGroup, the number of flatbed scanners is estimated to increase from1.3 million in 1995 to 2.8 million in 1997.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996DISPLAYS BECOMING BIGGER, BRIGHTERfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36by Joy TangThe 1996 Society for Information Display Symposium (SID), held inthe US earlier this year, reflected a number of diverging trends inthe display market.According to Dave Mentley, VP of Display Industry Research atStanford Resources, there were a number of technical breakthroughswhich are close to commercialisation.The viewing angle of LCDs is set to see some changes. "In a sign ofthe maturing of the AM (active matrix) LCD market, viewing angleimprovement has become a major focus," he said. "What was once justa minor nuisance and a point of differentiation between active andpassive matrix addressing has now become an obsession. The idea isto get to the same viewing quality as the CRT monitor in an LCD."Mentley noted that some LCD monitors today have better performancethan some CRT monitors."As with everything else, the means to improve the viewing angle isvery complicated," he said."The latest and most intriguing is the in-plane switching mode.Hitachi's Super TFT is based on this technique and NEC justunveiled their version. Both samples were nothing short ofstunning."Mentley stressed that the technique is actually decades old, butthe tools to implement it became available only recently."The results so far show that they do work and clearly can bemade," he said.Other improvements in viewing angle employ high voltage drivers,such as those by Vivid, thinner cell spacing, and multiplealignment domains.Another clear trend during the show had to do with packaging, suchas that for notebook computers."Notebook computer users used to ask why the manufacturers left somuch of a border around the display. Why not just make the displaybigger?" Mentley explained.Mentley said that Mitsubishi had unveiled at the show a new 12.1-inch TFT LCD with a 3.5-mm border at the bottom, so that thedistance from the bottom of the module to the edge of the displayviewing area is only 3.5 mm."The left and top borders are larger, but not by an excessiveamount. This is quite a feat of mechanical and electricalpackaging," he observed."The ability to do this advanced packaging could separate thedisplay world into the haves and have-nots of packaging, and thiswill have serious implications for the ability to address advancedapplications. High density electronic packaging is not a trivialtask."CRTS vs Flat PanelsCRTs may lose their place one day to flat panel monitors, andprogress is being made. "The wide angle TFT LCDs discussed aboveplay a key role in the viability of this market," said Mentley."Price clearly plays the biggest role. At the SID meeting, NECquietly unveiled a 20.x-inch, 1280 by 1,024 display based on a typeof in-plane switching. The display was truly astounding. There wereone or two dead sub-pixels out of about 3 million."The viewing angle was about plus and minus 80 degrees in thehorizontal and vertical. The colours were saturated and it usedanalog addressing."Samples are expected to go out at US$5,000 later this year. Expectevery stock trader in the US to have about five of these things."Mentley felt that the progress was due to the bottom dropping outof the 8.x to 10.x-inch TFT market."Since these smaller displays apparently can't even be given away,it makes sense to take the old fabs and make something that isdesired," he said."Instead of 4-up 9.4- or 10.4-inchers, why not make a 1-up 20.8-incher? It won't be a multi-million unit market, but the high endof the monitor market has been begging for workstation-type flatpanel displays for years. IBM/DTI is reportedly doing a similarthing with their 16-inch TFT LCD, but without the in-planeswitching."Mentley added that  Fujitsu announced a workstation-quality, 25-inch diagonal, 1,280 by 1,024 colour AC plasma display by 1997."This is the first time that anything better than 0.50 mm dot pitchhas been discussed for colour plasma. How they will produce it isstill unclear," he said.Miniature displays, which are sub-one-inch, high resolution (morethan or equal to VGA format) displays, are another area to watch,according to Mentley."Some of the most intriguing research and development work is goingon in the miniature display area. Besides the poly-silicon thinfilm transistor, there are many new approaches," he said."Thin film EL, diffraction gratings with and without LiquidCrystal, polymer dispersed LC on Silicon, LED, FEDs, fieldsequential PDLC on a chip and the DMD are a few of the mostdeveloped approaches."There are probably many more. We should expect very good coloursand high pixel counts in the near future."Mentley presented his findings in the May 1996 issue ofInternational Display Report, an electronic publication from theSEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International)Newsletter Service.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHINA'S NETWORK HUNGERfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36The China networking market started to boom in 1993 and by 1994,almost all the well-known US vendors rushed in, fueling even fastergrowth. Between 1993 and 1995, the market quadrupled in size.Although the networking market accounts for less than one tenth ofthe total IT market, its share is increasing.In 1995, 1.15 million PCs were sold in China. With about 42 percent currently connected to a network, the network market was worthRMB4.5 billion (US$540 million) in 1995.Network users in China however are in general not familiar withadvanced network applications such as voice and imagetransmissions, and primarily use the network to transfer files orshare resources.China started to build large scale computer networks in the early1980s when the government built 12 WANs.These WANs included the Railway Information Network, BankingNetwork, and Meteorological Information Network.The Railway Information System was the earliest nation-widenetwork. It has 4 levels, with 70 nodes per level for a total of700 medium and small computers, 20,000 PCs, and 4,000 terminals.By the end of 1995, about 1.11 million computers were connectedinto networks. The average growth of the connection rate has beenabout 37 per cent a year since 1990.The percentage of computers networked grew about five times between1990 and 1995.Still Low-End?Nearly 80 per cent of networked computers are PCs. The rest areworkstations, servers, and larger computers. About 51 per cent ofthe networks are LANs. Over half of the LANs are primarily utilisedfor file sharing. Around 10 per cent of the LANs are also used fore-mail.Most of the WANs were low-speed. An ordinary telephone line is themost common connection method. Over half of the WANs run at 2.4Kbps, although 9.6 Kbps is becoming more popular.Point-to-point data transmission accounted for more than half ofWAN usage, while e-mail accounted for 21 per cent.Buying CriteriaChina still functions on price. The Chinese usually seek the latesttechnology at the lowest price. During the earlier phase of thenetworking industry, lower prices won the tug-of-war. However,higher functionality is starting to become more important.Price ranks as the most important criteria when buying networkingequipment, but it also represents the number one impediment to newtechnology.New technology, such as ATM, 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet, andIntelligent Switching Hubs are expected to become more popular onlyat the turn of the century.The Golden ProjectsThe Chinese government's national information infrastructureprojects are the key market. The Golden Projects alone drive alarge segment of the network market.The Golden Bridge project will run from 1993 to 2002 and develop aninfrastructure for State macro-economic planning activities. Itwill link information centres in the 30 provinces andmunicipalities, covering 500 cities.The system will involve a satellite-based ISDN network and fibreoptic land-based system and rival the ChinaPAC and SESA servicesprovided by the MPT.The total investment in the project is currently projected at aboutRMB20 billion (US$2.38 billion).The Golden Customs project will run from 1993 to 2003, linkinginformation systems in foreign trade companies to form an EDInetwork. This will also  lead to automatic customs declarations.The system will run on a satellite backbone using e-mail and EDIapplications linking many different foreign trade departments ofgovernment and industry.The first phase of EDI implementation is already complete with apilot system at Beijing's Capital Airport and two further systemsare being installed in Shanghai and Guangzhou.The Golden Card project will run from 1993 to 2003 and is designedto develop a system of national banking transaction cards.The development of two national information centres will be centralto the project. The basic aim is to build credit and cash usageamongst China's 300 million urban residents. Currently there areonly 3.2 million cards in the whole country.Network decisions are still being made and Golden Card could useeither Golden Bridge and ChinaPAC (the MPT packet switchingservice), or both.The Golden Tax project runs from 1994 to 1998 and supports therecent development of a national value-added tax system.The project will be based around the Clearing Centre of thePeople's Bank of China which already has an extensive network withover 100 servers and 4,000 terminals.In its initial phases, Golden Tax will create a demand for RMB500million (US$59.5 million) in hardware and software.The Golden Medical project started operation in 1995 and is beingdesigned to provide accurate health care information on a nationalbasis.The system will be based on the Golden Bridge network and willinitially connect around 50 hospitals.The Golden Intelligence or CERNET project began in 1995 and isdesigned to link all university campus networks, eventuallyspreading to middle and primary schools.By the end of century, CERNET will be the biggest Internet user inChina. Initially, there will be one main network centre with 10satellite centres around the country.The Golden Enterprises project will begin in 1996 and is designedto improve information flow between enterprises and betweenbusiness and government.This system will be based on the Golden Bridge network.The Golden Agricultural project will commence in 1996 and establisha national agriculture database. Again the Golden Bridge networkwill be used for the project.The Green Card project will run from 1995 to 2000 and is designedto implement a national network to support the deposits andwithdrawals from Post Office savings accounts.It is worth noting that China, after Japan, has the second highestsavings rate of any major economy at around 33 per cent.Again, the Golden Bridge network will be used for this system.Ultimately, the system will have to cover 10,000 post offices in500 cities.Forecast AheadIn addition to Golden Projects, the 12 nation-wide NationalInformation Networks established in the 7th Five Year Plan need tobe upgraded.The networks involve economics, science and technology, publicsecurity, defence, statistics, post & telecommunication,electricity, civil aviation, meteorological, railway, andpopulation control.These projects will need an estimated investment of RMB100 billion(US$12 billion) over the next 10 years. The Chinese governmentplans to provide 20 per cent of this.More than 50 per cent of the technology and equipment used in theprojects are already network industry products.Assuming that the government follows through on its commitments,the China network market will be worth at least RMB5 billion(US$600 million) over the next decade.If private investment follows, the market potential for thecountrywide networking projects will be around RMB10 billion (US$1.2 billion) per year during the next 10 years.The size of the Chinese network market in 1996 will also reachRMB10 billion (US$1.2 billion).The market will continue to grow at a healthy clip.The most popular segments will relate to the Internet, on-lineinformation services, network training and technology transfer.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996SERVICE PROVIDERS PUT USERS ABOVE ALLfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36by William OeiNETWORK servicing in the Asia-Pacific is becoming increasinglysophisticated as Western-based vendors start scaling up theiroperations here.Anixter, for example, recently unveiled a grand masterplan toexpand its presence here, spending over US$10 million in 1996 aloneon building up its infrastructure.ITS, a division of the SITA Network Group, also announced anincrease in its service offerings in the region, unwrapping threenew services for Cisco users and a flexible package scheme from itsCisco Technical Assistance Centre in Australia."We are not in the drop-ship business where you can get by withoutinterfacing with the customers," said Bob Grubbs, president andCEO, Anixter, who was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, recently."We have to get down to the end-user level and get in touch withthe customers."This, as the company found out, was not always so easy in this partof the world."Restrictions in some parts of Asia such as Indonesia, India andVietnam sometimes prevent us from achieving this," said KualaLumpur-based Jimmy Goh, managing director, Southeast Asia, Anixter."In these cases, we have no choice but to work through partners anddistributors. We have to be flexible enough to adapt to differenteconomic and political situations."Anixter, who has reseller agreements with vendors such as BayNetworks, IBM and Xylan, plans to leverage its core competencies invalue-added distribution, cabling systems and projectimplementation for networks.According to Grubbs, the greatest challenges for the networkingindustry in Asia is the shortage of skills here and the incompletepublic network infrastructure.To help ease the skills shortage problem and to add value to itsbasket of service offerings, the company is in the midst of settingup training facilities for the transfer of networking skills toAsia."We want to be the greatest value-added providers," said KH Wun,president of Anixter Asia-Pacific."The holders of technical knowledge in the US currently don't havea proper means of transferring knowledge to Asian customers. Wewant to help fill this void."He added that training and education only accounts for about 3 percent of Anixter's total business but the company seems happy withthat level of revenue contribution."We are transitioning to a specialist company to focus on buildingthe network infrastructure," said Wun."That's our vision and our ultimate goal. In some parts of theworld, we have already achieved this but not in Asia."To achieve its objectives here, Anixter has been steadily puttingthe necessary pieces in place."The staffing for the Asia-Pacific has increased by a large scale,both in numbers and skillsets," said Wun."For example, the Southeast Asian offices have tripled itsrecruitment of skilled personnel over the past year. We have alsoboosted our infrastructure with bigger sales and warehousinglocations and ventured into new territories such as Vietnam."In Southeast Asia, the fastest growing market for Anixter,Malaysia, has been at the centre of the company's expansionactivities."Malaysia is now the regional headquarters of our Southeast Asianoperations," said Low."We are setting up training facilities and an interoperability labin the Malaysia office to better serve our customers in thesurrounding areas."He added that the interoperability lab will serve as a testbed forfunctional testing of different LAN and WAN configurations when itis fully operational by year-end.SITA subsidiary, ITS, is also increasing its service offerings tocater to the maturing demands of its networking customers in theregion."As a service company, it is imperative that we look after ourcustomers," said Andy Cocks, director of the newly set up ITS Asia-Pacific Australasia client services division."The new client services division will enhance this strategy byintroducing a number of customer-focused initiatives."Three new packages - Cisco Essential; Cisco Plus; and Cisco Select,boost the company's Global LAN Internetworking Solution, aworldwide integrator partnership that the company signed in Junewith Cisco."Customers no longer require break/fix support," said Cocks."As products become more complex, we need to be able to offervalue-add in troubleshooting, product information and softwareupdates."Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996ANIXTER PICKS SCITOR FOR DATACOMMSfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36Value-added network services provider Scitor has been awarded aUS$8 million, three-year contract by Anixter, to provide datacommunications services for Anixter in 60 locations across theworld.Anixter has replaced its multi-vendor overseas data network withScitor's global network, a network which spans 225 countries.Anixter will implement Scitor's Frame Relay, ISDN dial back-upservices and real-time network monitoring platform.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996NETMANAGE HOLDS ALL THE ACESfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36NETMANAGE, the vendor behind the Chameleon range of desktopapplications, is taking a holistic approach to the intranet marketwith a full suite of products."Browsers only constitute one-sixth of the intranet market and willnot be our main focus," said Bobby Srinivasan, managing director,Asia-Pacific & Latin America, NetManage."We have been involved in the Internet ever since we wereestablished in 1990.

The two companies that took part in the trialswere the Hospital Authority and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club.Trials have also been conducted internationally with Cable &Wireless Trans-Atlantic, Taiwan's ITA and US-based Sprint oversatellite link.There will be three phases to Hongkong Telecom's ATM project whichinvolved HK$70 million (US$9 million).The first phase will provide ATM connection; the second willprovide integration with its FrameLink service, based on FrameRelay technology; and the third will be to provide internationalATM access and integration with other services.The second phase is expected to be launched within a year, and thethird phase depends on market demand, said Lui.Four ATM loops have been built, two each in Hong Kong island andKowloon.Explaining Hongkong Telecom's focus on both ISDN and ATMtechnologies, Lui said the company will continue to offer bothservices, with ISDN phase target small and medium businesses andATM at large corporate customers.Hongkong Telecom is also investigating 25 Mbps ATM technology as anoption on the desktop.The monthly rental for the first 15 km of the ATM service isHK$16,000 (US$2,064 ) and every additional 20 km costs  HK$10,000(US$1,290).Other tariffs involved are installation costs of HK$32,000(US$4,128), internal relocation at HK$16,000 (US$2,064) andexternal relocation costs of HK$32,000 (US$4,128).Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CAN CA'S OPENINGRES LAST THE LONG HAUL?from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36TALK about rebirth of a product, one can't help but take a hardlook at OpenIngres.This RDBMS, formerly the core product of ASK/Ingres, was acquiredby Computer Associates (CA) three years ago, but now seems to behanging cold out there in the market.To be fair, CA has added new features to OpenIngres, in line withits intention of acquiring first and integrating later.Recently, this RDBMS was given another injection to ensure itslongevity. CA wants it to be open and to run on hardware platformsfrom desktops to enterprise servers.The maintenance release of OpenIngres 1.2/01 will be first madeavailable for Sun Solaris 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5x by next month.Other platforms targeted for release before the end of Novemberthis year are HP-UX 9.x, 10.x, IBM AIX 3.2x, 4.1x, Windows NT 3.51,DEC Open VMS 6.1, 6.2 (Alpha and VAX), DEC Unix 3.2x, Sun OS 4.1.3,SCO OpenServer 5.0, UnixWare 2.0x, NCR GIS 2.03x as well as serversfrom Data General, Pyramid, Sequent and Siemens.Added FeaturesAdded features include SMP, cluster SMP and MPP technologies toensure support for intelligent datawarehouse and replication acrossall environments, and OpenIngres/ICE for Internet/Intranetfunctionalities.Despite these additions, the survival of OpenIngres in themarketplace is doubtful.Allan Tan, industry analyst, Worldwide Services Group, DataquestAsia-Pacific, said OpenIngres is comparatively not popular in HongKong.Overall, the largest RDBMS player in Asia is still Oracle, followedby either Informix or Sybase.On the Unix platform, OpenIngres is facing challenges from IBM'sDB2 as well.While there is a potential market for OpenIngres, Tan does not seeit coming  close to what has been achieved by the other threeplayers."A database vendor should be perceived as having good allianceswith hardware vendors. CA's profile hasn't really been strong inthis region," said Tan.He said another drawback is CA's strategy of offering dual databasewith OpenIngres and Jasmine, the OODBMS with a multimedia andInternet-enabled toolset.No Hybrid ApplicationsAt CA World '96 in New Orleans recently, chairman and CEO CharlesWang  made it clear that CA does not believe in hybrid applicationsin the database arena and has no plans to combine the two products,except to leverage on each other's technology."History has shown that it is hard for any vendor to offer twotypes of databases as it create confusion in the marketplace," saidTan.According to Dataquest's first half 1995 estimates, the worldwideRDBMS revenues of US$2.5 billion are split between IBM with 35 percent market share, Oracle with 19 per cent, CA with 11 per cent,Sybase 8 per cent, Informix 5 per cent and the remaining going tosmaller players.However, on both the server database and Unix database market, CAwas not even listed in Dataquest's top list of players.The first half 1995 estimates for server database worldwide areUS$2.2 billion and a significant market share is split between IBMwith 40 per cent, Oracle 18 per cent, Sybase 9 per cent andInformix 6 per cent.On the Unix platform, however, Oracle dominates.Out of the US$770 million estimates for the first half of 1995 forUnix database, Oracle grabbed 48 per cent, Sybase 21 per cent andInformix 16 per cent.OpenIngres' survival is further challenged with the emergence ofUniversal Server offered both by Oracle and Informix.CA has not made any indication of ever offering Universal Serverfunctionality.In a white paper by market research firm Aberdeen Group for July1996, Universal Servers have been considered the RDBMS technologyfor the next decade.Although RDBMS has survived for 20 years focusing on simple typesof data such as integers, scientific floating point, characterstrings, date/time and money, the research firm said RDBMSes areunder considerable technology pressure as "they do not handlehighly complex information well".Universal Servers, on the other hand, the paper said, "will allowIS organisations to extend their current RDBMS to handle complexdata types and work better with new technologies such as Intranets,relational OLAP and latest development toolsets, ensuring thatenterprises can continue to leverage their existing investments inRDBMS".Challenges AheadWhile CA's effort in injecting more features and functionalities toOpenIngres is commendable,  there are also others who remainsceptical.At Ingres World '96 in New Orleans in conjunction with CA World'96, John Gilworth, Ingres System Administrator, InformationSystems Department of US-based HealthCare Compare was positive tothe changes and enhancements made to OpenIngres."Ingres is starting to lose third party support but with the newenhancements, I believe CA is coming up as a strong player now. Itis important for CA to continue development support for Ingres," hesaid.Another Ingres user, Randall Eash, VP, Technical Service said CA'smajor problem is implementation and belated execution of marketingstrategy.It looks like CA has an uphill task ahead in getting Ingres backinto the mainstream of enterprises.While it remains to be seen whether OpenIngres can survive further,pressure is definitely mounting on CA's shoulders to prove itscritics wrong.The heat is on, CA.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996DIGITAL MCS GETS ISO 9002 FOR CUSTOMER SERVICESfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36Customer requirements are behind the recent ISO 9002 certificationawarded to Digital's Multivendor Customer Service Centre, saidMatthew Liang, director, Multivendor Customer Services, DigitalEquipment Hong Kong.He said Digital MCS is the first vendor to obtain an ISO 9002certification for multivendor customer services in Hong Kong.In the case of the MCS, ISO certification revolved around creatinga framework for standard processes and continuous improvement forcustomer services like complaint handling.Regina Luk, logistics and distribution manager, Digital MCS, HongKong, said the ISO certification effort began in November 1995,culminating with the ISO 9002 award from the Hong Kong QualityAssurance Agency this July.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996SCO AIMING TO BE LEADER IN UNIX SYSTEM SOFTWAREfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36THE Santa Cruz (SCO) has extended its product offerings, aiming tobe the leading supplier of Unix system software for businesscritical environments.Explaining SCO's vision, Certina Ma, sales and marketing manager,North Asia, SCO, said product directions will focus on three areas.The first area is its commitment to deliver Windows to Unixintegration, with the announcement of a new product called VisionFS, a file and print server. This follows its acquisition of IXIand VisionWare.Vision FS is the latest addition to SCO's Vision Family of Windowsto Unix integration products that include XVision, a PC server;TermVision, a terminal emulator which allows PC users to store andretrieve files in Unix; SQL Retriever, a tool to access SQLdatabase and SuperVision, a systems management tool.The second area is the merged product of OpenServer and UnixWarecalled Gemini, scheduled to be out by mid-1997.In Asia, Ma said OEM sales for Gemini will be concentrated inTaiwan, Korea and Japan.However, in the run up to Gemini, SCO will continue to deliverenhanced versions of OpenServer and UnixWare i.e. OpenServer 5.0.4and UnixWare 2.1.1, bundled with migration tool kits for Gemini.A layered product solution is SCO's third focus. Aimed at providingInternet and connectivity services, its latest announcement is theOEM availability of Network Client Operating System (NC/OS).SCO claims NC/OS is the first low-cost, small footprint softwaredesigned as a reliable, time-to-market solution for developingNetwork Computers on standard Intel-based processors.by Yap Cheng ThengCopyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996MOTOROLA PREPARES TO HIT MOBILE PC MARKETfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36by Joy TangMotorola has begun the Asian rollout for PC Card-basedmultifunction peripherals to catch the wave in the fast growingcorporate mobile computing market."Three million PC Card (PCMCIA) modems are expected to shipworldwide in 1996," said US-based Bob Leibowitz, director ofmarketing, Mobile Computing Products Division, Information SystemsGroup, Motorola."Modem-and-LAN adapters are a small but important part, with about300,000 expected to ship in 1996." Leibowitz said that untilrecently, it had been more expensive to buy a combination PC cardthan purchasing each function separately.The company will focus on countries where the notebook market ismore mature, namely Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Singaporeand Hong Kong.Said Leibowitz: "We will provide features that customers want at areasonable price with Motorola quality and support."Leibowitz said that compressed transmission of voice, video anddata would fuel the popularity of applications likevideoconferencing, whiteboarding, and technical support throughremote diagnosis.The killer application for PC card modems, however, would be theintranet, he said.Though the products were launched in the US in March, theirintroduction was delayed in Asia because of homologatoryrequirements. According to the company, products which conform toPTT requirements are approved in 30 to 90 days.Motorola's Information Systems Group, the umbrella organisation forthe Mobile Computing Products Division, plans to seek out resellerswho can offer custom bundles unique to their areas."The resellers are closer to the marketplace," said Ron Waeghe, VPand GM, Asia-Pacific, ISG, Motorola.

It had beencode named Gryphon.The CE stands for Compact Edition, but it could also stand forconsumer electronics.It is so named because Microsoft will push this OS for use invarious consumer electronics products that deal with digital dataaccess and delivery.When the HPC makes its debut later in November, it will bepositioned as a mobile desktop companion.The HPC concept is a hand-held computer that reportedly looks muchlike the popular HP 200 LX, only slightly larger.It will be positioned as a mobile Windows device that allows usersto carry desktop data with them wherever they go.Although small in size, it will have a very clean approach tosynchronising data with the desktop.Think of it as a data take-away device that allows you to pullfiles off the desktop and take them with you anywhere you go.While Windows CE is a different OS from Windows and allapplications for it will have to be written from scratch, it hasthe same GUI as Windows 95.That makes it very easy to learn and use.Critical ProductThis new OS from Microsoft is a critical product for them if theyare to take Windows beyond the traditional desktop PC market.There is no way that they can downsize the original Windows 95 OSfor use on low-powered, small memory and low-cost based digitalconsumer appliances.Windows CE can work in one megabyte of DRAM and can also be used onsystems with processors other than those made by Intel.Microsoft' s Windows CE will cause the analytical community tofocus on this operating system and its potential for use in realconsumer products.This new OS is Microsoft's response to the recent Navio challengein their current tit for tat browser war with Netscape.Microsoft stressed that Windows CE is for any "digital appliance"and used examples of smart phones, smart set-top boxes and evenauto GPS systems to explain how Windows CE can be used in themarket.The smart phone idea is perhaps the most important first realdigital appliance for the home that either Microsoft or Netscapecan focus on.Web ApplicationsAlthough there are many vendors trying to get a Web TV into thehome as the first low cost Internet appliance, many of us who lookat the consumer adoption cycle for technology are not convinced theWeb TV will be successful.For one thing, the traditional consumer is used to getting hisinformation from nightly newscasts that come in the form of livefull motion video, with various media rich illustrations.But, the Web as it is today, delivers information only in text andpictures.The traditional consumer wants information delivered over the Netinstantly and with real time video, audio, animation and 3D.Getting that on the Web will take much greater bandwidth and couldbe years away.On the other hand, I think that the consumer is ready andinterested in a phone that lets them e-mail.One approach to this is a smart phone that is application specific.That means that this device would connect to an existing phone andbe a keyboard and small screen in which the consumer can send e-mail messages at will.All they would need is a connection to some type of e-mail service,such as ATT Mail or MCI Mail and the e-mail address of the personthey want to send their message to.This "smart phone" could also be modular and although at firstmight just be a small screen, keyboard and modem, it might beupgradeable to take a larger screen, which you could then use forInternet access to Internet Yellow Pages and the Web.The initial smart phone for e-mail access would be very low cost,although it would need to be based on some type of consumer OS.That is where Microsoft's Windows CE and Netscape's Navio productshave real early consumer potential.Future PotentialOver time, a consumer electronics OS, whether it be an off shoot ofWindows 95 like Windows CE is, or Navio's consumer technology,which would be tied to Netscape's Navigator, could also be used onsmart set-top boxes, CD-ROM- and DVD ROM-based systems connected tothe TV.Someday in the future, it may actually become the OS for use on thedigital TV, stereo systems and any other digital appliance in thehome.That is why these new announcements from Microsoft and Netscape areso important.They are clearly set to be the big guns going after the consumerelectronic space where digital appliances will rule, and where nosingle OS or Web environment is a standard today.Whoever wins this battle for the hearts and minds of the consumervendors and users, will be the biggest winners of this digital crapshoot to bring technology to the home, which to us marketing folks,is where the real numbers are.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CA REAPS BENEFITS OF

"We understand thecustomer requirements better. Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan are allChinese speaking countries, and the economies are very close."He added that NCR Greater China will continue to focus on its corecompetencies. "We are definitely in the computer business,especially for high availability, transaction processing, anddatawarehousing technologies," said Zee."We are also a leading IT solutions provider in the financial,retail and computer industries."Zee said that NCR had invested heavily in the financial industry inGreater China in the past and is now expanding into mid-range andhigh-end computing. The current focus is to support Unix andWindows NT.As such, Zee said that the corporate structure within NCR GreaterChina would be leveraged to help customers understand and managetheir businesses better.Another challenge for Zee is the rapid growth of China, where NCRGreater China is based."We do not have enough resources to keep up with the growth," hesaid. "China is too big for us to set up branches in everylocation."NCR's solution is to work with channel partners, but a delicatebalance has to be achieved."We need enough partners to help us to grow, but not too many as tocreate a price war," Zee said."We are looking for value-added channels, who can providesolutions, rather than just box-movers."Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996NETSCAPE BOOSTS NAVIGATORfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36NETSCAPE has added more punch into Navigator 3.0 focusing on fourareas: collaboration, content, connectivity on client platform andproduct development with corporate management and securityfeatures.New features include collaboration technology for Internettelephony and shared whiteboards, support for Live3D, LiveAudio andLiveVideo; Netscape Inbox Direct, an e-mail service; integratedWeb-client; personal publishing tool - Navigator Gold; support for16 platforms as well as support for Java and JavaScript.Navigator 3.0 is downloadable from http://home.netscape.com.Copyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996SYBASE AND SUN JOIN ON PROMO PACKAGEfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36Sybase and Sun have announced a three-month joint packagepromotional offering covering Sun's hardware and Sybase IQ datawarehouse server software and services required to implement a datamart.The Sun/Sybase-IQ Quickstart package offers a technical consultancyservice for up to eight days; three days Sybase-IQ training; afive-user license of Sybase-IQ applications software; and twooptional hardware configurations.The US$75,000-Quickstart 3000 package has a hardware configurationcomprising a Sun Enterprise 150 Server with 512 MB RAM, 1.44 MBfloppy; 2.1 GB Internal SCSI disk; 4x2.1 GB deskpacks, CD-ROM and4mm 4 - 8 GB tape backup.For US$60,000, the Quickstart 150 hardware package includes a SunEnterprise 3000 Server, 512 MB RAM, 1.44 MB floppy, 2x4.2 GBInternal SCSI disk, CD-ROM and 8mm 14 GB tape backup.Steven Hong, country manager, Sybase Singapore, said the newoffering is an affordable solution for users contemplating adatawarehousing installation, which is typically very costly.DW Consultancy"The consultancy in the package allows users better control todevelop a blueprint on how datawarehousing can be later deployed atan enterprisewide level," he said.Jim Khoo, director, ISV Business Development, Asia South, Sun,expects five to 10 sites to be up in each country by the end of thepromotional period in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.by Isabelle ChanCopyright 1996 Asia Computer WeeklyBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY                         via NewsNetSeptember 29, 1996CHECK POINT SETS UP BASE IN SINGAPOREfrom ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36Check Point Software Technologies has formally set foot in Asiawith the opening of a Singapore office.The company has close to 10,000 installations worldwide, 15 percent of which are in the Asia-Pacific, including Japan.The office, headed by regional manager Anthony Lim, will developand support Check Point's OEM and channel partners in Asia,excluding Japan."Singapore was chosen as it is an easy place to do business in,"said Marius Nacht, VP, Check Point Software."Everything is wellorganised.

NT seemslike a better strategic solution - it can do file and print, runapplications, and includes native support of TCP/IP.""So far, Novell's marketing message - that NetWare will seamlesslytransition into the Intranet - has fallen on deaf ears."IT managers are already building the Intranet with Netscape,Microsoft or Lotus. Novell is not even on the radar screen," saidOltsik.While Novell prepares products to address user needs - like nativeTCP/IP and cross-platform services - it will face 18 months ofdecreased sales volumes.Forrester estimated that Novell's revenue will decrease by 25 percent this fiscal year and continue to decline until 1998 when itsettles at around US$1 billion.Oltsik added: "Before its next-generation products are ready,Novell will have to lower prices and offer bundled solutions toencourage its installed base to upgrade."While Novell is in trouble, it is not out of the game. Oltsik hastwo things in its favour: a strong balance sheet and a largeinstalled base.But according to Forrester, intranet technologies will ultimatelyreplace NetWare, so Novell needs to quickly transition into aprovider of standards-based services that enable the intranet.NetWare On IceThe report recommended that large companies put their NetWareenvironments on ice for the next two years and evaluate newintranet technologies and vendors as they emerge."CIOs should not panic and rip out NetWare.

The low-level players, now holding a smaller piece ofthe pie, are buckling under pressure from the big boys like Compaq,Hewlett-Packard, Acer and IBM.Quoting the top five rankings by IDC in Q2'96 for the Asia-Pacificserver market, Steve Haslett, marketing manager of HP's PersonalInformation Products Group, said Compaq continues to lead the packwith a 22.7 per cent share, followed by Hewlett-Packard with 13.3per cent.Trailing behind are Acer and Digital with 10 and 7.8 per centrespectively, followed by IBM with 6.6 per cent.The "others" category accounted for a total of 26.8 per cent marketshare. This percentage is a significant drop compared to theconsolidated market share of 42.8 per cent in Q1'96."The server business is booming, but market figures show the startof a shake out with the bigger hardware vendors gaining moredominance," he said. "Historically, the 'others' category accountedfor about 50 per cent of the total market."The figures increasingly show that customers are looking forreliability and quality in the big brand names. Our market sharegain is probably gained at the expense of the other small players,"he said.Managing analyst Norman Miranda feels this is true particularly inthe high-end segment where service and support are important.Although Miranda and Janardan Menon of Dataquest Asia-Pacific agreeon the general trend of a shake out, both believe there are marketswhere the small vendors will continue to be a major force.Meanwhile, No.2 player Hewlett-Packard is investing in two keyareas with the intention of overtaking Compaq as market leader.The first is to marry its server and networking business, anapproach which Hewlett-Packard admits it should have adoptedearlier."We ran the networking and server businesses separately, andtherefore, failed to capitalise on our networking strengths. Wehave since realised that, and are now working hand-in-hand to boostour market offering," said Haslett."We're positioning our networking product portfolio as anadditional accessory to the servers."According to Haslett, HP believes it will be able to emulate itssuccess in China where it has managed to capture the No.1 spot withits NetServers, and displace reigning leader Compaq as the leadingplayer in the Asia-Pacific by next year."We're closing the gap between ourselves and Compaq.

Sony plans demonstrations of working AC-3 mockup at Bally'sHotel suite, while "cosmetic" nonworking prototype is likely to bedisplayed at Las Vegas Convention Center room where company ismounting its main exhibit, Hi-Fi Vp Vic Pacor said.  Bally'sdemonstration will be of prototype processor using discrete digitalprocessing, meshed with existing high-end "M"-series speakers soldunder ES franchise, including new SS-M1CN center-channel speaker,due for spring delivery at $500 list.  Pacor said Sony will billAC-3 showings as "technology demonstration only," indicating thatcompany "is not yet prepared" to discuss specific marketing plans. He said additional specifics on AC-3 launch could be available inspring, when Sony has scheduled series of annual "zone" salesmeetings.     Sony's first AC-3 product is likely to be outboard processorrather than integrated receiver, Pacor said.  Product delivery isexpected to "coincide" with launch of its first DVD players, hesaid.  Commitment to show AC-3 in Las Vegas was hastened byagreement last month designating that as mandatory DVD audio systemin NTSC markets and as optional system in PAL and SECAM territories(AW Dec 11 p1).  Sony's AC-3 support is "a follow-through on ourcommitment to take a leadership position on DVD," Pacor said.  Heindicated that if AC-3 had been confined to audio system forlaserdisc, "we probably wouldn't have been interested."     Statement of Sony support gives important boost to fortunes ofAC-3, although Dolby technology has been on significant momentumroll since system was unveiled by Denon, Pioneer and others at LasVegas show 2 years ago.  Statement seemed to quash speculation thatSony would develop home adaptation of Sony Dynamic Digital Sound(SDDS) system now competing with AC-3 and Digital Theater Systems(DTS) technologies in theatrical community.     Notwithstanding Sony plans, AC-3 would have been significantstory anyway at Las Vegas show, where "AC-3-ready" will beubiquitous buzz term reminiscent of "digital-ready" marketing labelthat greeted CD bandwagon launch decade ago.  Typifying others,Definitive Technology plans demonstration of "AC-3-ready"PowerField subwoofer, 125-w, 12" box available separately at $549and marketed as part of BP 2002 home theater speaker system.  Alsofollowing suit is Phase Technology, which plans 5-model"AC-3-compatible speaker system" for home theater at $500.     Wide range of AC-3 is promised throughout CES, includingTechnics, which said it will join growing roster of companiesplanning audiovideo receivers combining AC-3 with THX processing. However, specifics on Technics product weren't available by ourdeadline.  Harman Kardon said it will "preview" AC-303 outboardprocessor for AC-3, which is set for late-spring delivery at $799list.  "The availability of program sources with full 5.1-channeldiscrete audio is one of the most exciting developments in hometheater in recent years," Harman Kardon Pres. Chris Stevens said.     As for DVD movement itself, number of player prototypespromised by primary and secondary vendors could fill ownindependent trade show.  With unified DVD specifications in place,Las Vegas show marks unofficial start of competitive DVD derby,even though first products won't reach store shelves for at least9 months.     Companies not showing DVD players at Las Vegas seem exception,not rule.  Scarcer still are those not promising DVD leadershippositions or not pledging to be involved in first round of productdeliveries.  While much of DVD news will be generated on main showfloor, highlight will be series of consecutively timed DVD newsconferences planned for eve of show Jan. 4 (Thurs.) by Pioneer,Sony, Thomson, Toshiba.  At our deadline, Pioneer and Sony wereclose-mouthed as to what they planned for announcements later thisweek.  However, Thomson and Toshiba have taken more aggressivepostures, promising to lay out DVD product and promotionalspecifics.     Thomson news conference invitations promised DVD marketingannouncements under RCA, GE and ProScan labels, as well asunspecified software component.  Retailers that met with Thomsonofficials last month said company has drafted definite plans on howit wants to bring DVD to market, based on philosophy that firsthardware dealers will be encouraged to carry software titles. Retailers told us Thomson seemed poised to announce specific waysof helping retailers market DVD software, but Dec. meetingsproduced few specifics.  Other expected highlight of Thomsonannouncements will come when it identifies "major Japanese partner"with which it says it has struck multiproduct OEM agreement onwhich company is basing pledge to market first-generation DVDplayer at $499 (AW Dec 18 p4).Back to Headline List CopyrightAUDIO WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996     Sony Pictures Entertainment in Japan is forming new subsidiary     Sony Pictures Entertainment in Japan is forming new subsidiaryto produce and market movie titles domestically on MPEG-1 Video CDformat, Japanese news accounts said.

Eosone products will be exclusive to Best Buy in U.S., butalso will be marketed outside country through internationaldistributors.  Nudell said Eosone goods will be produced at Polkfactories in Baltimore and San Diego.   Genesis and Polk executivesoriginally had planned to discuss specifics of Eosone project atthis week's Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show as means ofgenerating publicity for line and attracting internationaldistribution.  But Nudell and new Polk Pres. James Herd said planwas scrapped in favor of lower profile rollout.     With few exceptions, Eosone line will include dipolar speakersand will be marketed as ideal for home theater and musicapplications, Nudell said.  Line includes 3 tower speakers that useso-called "radiant surround field" technology.  Flagship model willbe called RSF-1000, $2,200 per pair, featuring own built-in 175-wpowered subwoofer.  Lower priced RSF-600 and RSF-400 towers won'tbe self-powered, Nudell said.  Two separate powered subwoofers areplanned for Eosone line, 12" model with built-in 150-w amplifier,10" variation with 100-w.  There's also molded satellite speakersystem called "the Egg" and RSC-300 center-channel speaker.     Dedicated rear-surround speakers are among few Eosone modelsnot to have dipolar design, partly because they're intended to meshwith new Dolby AC-3 system, Nudell said.  He said all Eosonedrivers will have been "designed from scratch," not pulled fromshelf.  Line is aimed for maximum mix-and-match flexibility forBest Buy customers interested in assembling high-end home theaterspeaker package, Nudell said.     Announcements last spring publicizing Eosone collaborationbetween Polk and Genesis said Eosone line would be aimed at "anupscale buyer" with "design attributes spun off from the Genesisline of high-end loudspeakers."  Herd has said agreement to formEosone venture followed 2 years of talks between Polk and Best Buythat started when companies agreed to explore ways of bettermerchandising specialty audio speakers in Best Buy'sself-service-oriented "concept" stores.     Polk executives have emphasized that its label won't appear onEosone products or marketing materials because of fear that thatwould cause "an unnecessary distraction" from telling "verypowerful" Eosone brand story.  Fear of offending Polk specialtyaccounts presumably also played key role in decision to divorcePolk brand name from Eosone-labeled products.     Meanwhile, "Eosone International" was one of 4 "strategicbusiness units" (SBUs) created by Polk in "major organizationalrealignment" announced last month.  Other SBUs are for Polk HomeEntertainment Products, Automotive Products, Manufacturing. Automotive and home SBUs will be managed as "free-standing profitcenters," Polk said.  It said goals of restructuring are tosimplify organization to "clarify lines of authority andaccountability" and move "operational" decision-making further downin organization.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUDIO WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EIA HAILS RECORD OCT. AUDIO SALES     Double-digit increases in portable audio and componentsovercame modest declines in systems and aftermarket autosound topush factory audio sales to 13.9% increase, setting all-time recordfor any previous month, EIA Market Research Dept. said.     Overall Oct. shipments climbed nearly 14% to $1.066 billionfrom year-earlier $935.73 million.  Record was set despite 2%decline in systems to $216.42 million and 0.8% dip in aftermarketcar audio to $165.07 million.  Home theater boom continued to sparkonce-beleagured components category, pushing shipments to 33.4%gain to $258.18 million.  Portable audio shipments were up 20% inOct., posting monthly record sales total of $426.03 millioncompared with year-earlier $354.91 million.     For 10 months, total shipments topped $7-billion, rising 5.9%to $7.03 billion.  Components led all categories with 13.8% salesincrease to $1.58 billion.  Other segments posted modest increases,portable audio climbing 5.4% to $2.37 billion, aftermarket caraudio up 3.1% to $1.68 billion, systems rising 1.9% to $1.4billion.     Home theater boom prompted surge in audio components salesthat followed many months of consecutive declines.  EIA's ConsumerElectronics Mfrs. Assn. (CEMA) credited recovery to "white-hotsales" of speakers and audiovideo receivers.  For Oct., receiversrose 41% to $66.4 million, and surpassed $400 million forJan.-Oct., CEMA said.  Turntables also were pleasant Oct. surprise,rising 27%, said CEMA, which didn't reveal actual sales estimate. Overall home speaker sales doubled in Oct. to $84.3 million,spurred partly by fivefold rise in sales of surround sound speakerpackages for home theater, CEMA said.     Trade group said 20% Oct. sales rise in portable audio torecord $426 million was category's best posting since April 1992,when shipments rose 20.2% from year earlier to $156.74 million (AWJune 15/92 p5).  CEMA reported 6% rise in sales of boombox stereoswithout CD to $28 million, while CD boomboxes posted "healthy" 17%increase.     Unspecified decline in rack system sales hurt overall systemscategory in Oct., CEMA said, emphasizing that sales were up 2% for10 months.  Pattern for most of 1995 repeated itself in Oct., withstrong sales of compact systems supporting category.  Aftermarketcar audio sales "held relatively steady" in Oct., CEMA said,without mentioning 0.8% decline in month.  Shortfall came despite11% rise in sales of car speakers, CEMA said.     CEMA quoted Yamaha Mktg. Dir. Thomas Graham as saying that 33%rise in Oct. components sales "gives further affirmation to theescalating home theater ownership trend."  He said:  "Consumers arelearning that home theater is more than just video and requireshigh-performance audiovideo receivers and components coupled withquality speakers to truly recreate the movie theater experience."

Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) low-end RCA DSS system thatstarted 1995 at $699 was being advertised by year-end at $499 andretailers said profit was in danger of drying up.  To combatfalling prices, some retailers are focusing on stepup RCA and SonyDSS products that promise 20-25% profit margins, but slower sales. Overall, 1995 sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to dealers were expectedto surpass 1.5 million, while rival Primestar reported close tomillion subscribers.     "You've got some very big players coming into the business[next year] and many aren't going to be able to take the highroad," Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say youare 6 to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."  Lower retailtickets are expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshiba and Unidenenter DSS race this year, with Uniden already indicating it mayprice product in $499-$549 range.  In addition to DSS, Alphastarand EchoStar plan to introduce own services -- latter partneringwith Philips to bring Magnavox product to CE retail.  EvenPrimestar, which primarily has leased equipment to consumers, hastested sales through multicable operator TCI.     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCAand GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has beenadvertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony model, whichoriginally had $749 suggested price tag, was featured in Wiz ad at$648.     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze CE suppliers whohave said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones wherehardware is offered to consumers virtually free and profits aremade on service.  EchoStar spokeswoman conceded as much, notingthat as hardware becomes low-margin product, programming could beused to offset lost profits.  EchoStar hasn't formally releasedpricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardware retails couldhit $500 with programming at $20.     Alphastar has said it will avoid selling own brand at CEretail, relying instead on combination of Amway, satellitedistributors and multilevel marketing.  Company signed agreementwith Samsung Electromechanics in Aug. to build integrated receiverdecoders (IRDs) and said it's seeking similar agreement with 2ndsupplier.  Both Samsung and 2nd supplier are expected to sellbranded product to CE dealers.  "I would think that for thisproduct the equipment would pass the cost curve much more rapidlythan the marketing cost of attracting a subscriber," said AlphastarPres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein, whose company plans to launch120-channel service in first quarter with hardware packages at$600-$700.  "When that happens it makes sense to give the box awaybecause the long-term value is in the subscription and the ongoingrevenue that comes from that subscription."     But with so many satellite systems to choose from, future ofcategory hinges on manufacturers' ability to differentiateproducts.  Many retailers already have said they won't givecategory same amount of shelf space dedicated to other productssuch as VCRs, meaning that suppliers will be battling for everysquare inch.     "The big question will be whether manufacturers can createclear differences for consumers so they can make choices," TopsAppliance City Senior Vp-Gen. Mdse. Mgr. Rick Jones said.  "Whenyou can't [tell differences] you end up dealing with a price issueand end up with $499 satellite systems."Back to Headline List CopyrightAUDIO WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996     DMX Inc. said it will mount its first official display at Las     DMX Inc. said it will mount its first official display at LasVegas Consumer Electronics Show to trumpet DMX Direct, 120-channel,CD-quality direct-to-home digital music service delivered viaKu-band satellite.

Few engineers figuredout why so many people found the Mac appealing, so theyfocussed on what looked obvious: the mouse.     After the moving mouse moves the screen's cursor to theexact spot a user has chosen, perhaps to a box designed tosignal "start," the user hits a button built into themouse's head.  And that starts the program.  But nearlyevery program also builds in a way to issue commands withouta mouse.  So the mouse is not an absolute requirement.     When IBM compatible computer engineers failed toduplicate the appeal of the mighty Mac, they turned tosoftware engineers.  At least  they  discovered the majoraspect of the Mac's appeal: its every-program-works-the-same-way-and-looks-the-same user interface.  Apple's mousehas little to do with this similar look and feel.     The real equivalence comes from the way Appleaccommodated software programmers who were interested inwriting for the Mac.   They gave all the programmers smallshortcut programs (called  tools  in computer jargon)enabling them to finish their programs quicker.     Prominent among tools was the pull-down menu, dialogue-box facility that's at the heart of all Macintosh programs.Behind the scenes, programmers don't have to reinvent waysfor each of their programs to send output to hundreds ofvarious printers, because the Macintosh computer itselfhandles that onerous chore.     The Mac machine came first.  And along with its closedarchitecture came detailed requirements for programs,graphics, looks, commands, files.  Mac programs were writtento match the Mac standard which has hardly changed since thefirst Mac.     The IBM PC came with open architecture, and withoutstandardized requirements.  Now that the IBM compatiblepeddlers would like to develop a Mac-like interface, everymajor program has to go through major, expensive rewrites.     Microsoft itself had some problems using Windows.After years of effort, it just finished writing the Windowsversion of its cornerstone word processing program,  Word.     Mac has one other major plus going for it.  Users seemable to perform many tasks on-screen at one time.  In truth,only one program is ever at work, but your other programsand their files stand ready to be used.  Unlike IBM users,Mac owners moving around among programs don't need to save afile and quit a program, then load the other program andfile.     At least five years ago, we tested Quarterdeck's  DESQ,subtitled  The Multi-Window Software Integrator.   It letuses move among windows from phone list to database tospreadsheet to whatever.     While its developers couldn't make computer users situp and take notice, they did patent key aspects ofwindowing.  That may eventually be their ticket to fortune.     This year, four other major companies are trying tosell Mac-type pseudo-multitasking on IBM compatibles.Microsoft (and IBM's) Windows is one.  They're still tryingto breathe life into the Presentation Manager pseudo-multitasker that operates on Windows which was announcedfully four years ago!     Tandy has its own pseudo-multitasking shell for its IBMcompatibles, DeskMate User Interface.  It features the Mac-like pull-down menus and pop-up dialogue boxes.  Mostly,Tandy's sold it to use with Tandy computers and few non-Tandy programs run under it.     Wang's expensive Freestyle software does very smoothpseudo-multitasking.  You can use it with some existinghardware and existing software, or buy it complete with Wanghardware.  Technologically, Freestyle most lives up to themultitasking promise.     Wang also offers an add-on system called ClearView.When you add ClearView to Windows, it forces your computerto look and act like the traditional Macintosh interface.     Hewlett-Packard is banking on New Wave, its version ofthe "iconic environment" that works with Windows on IBM typecomputers.  To run on their interfacer, they're putting onsale a database, network and e-mail manager, and peripheralsrouter they're calling New Wave Office.     A few years ago, it seemed obvious that the Microsoft-IBM combo would be hands-down winner among IBM Mac mimics.But IBM and Microsoft seem intent on smashing Windows.     All the smart software makers were betting on Windowsand modifying programs to run on it.  All the smart softwarebuyers were also betting on Windows and hedging budgetsuntil it developed.  Both of these foresighted groups arestill waiting to see something in the Windows.     It does look like IBM and Microsoft will finally emergeas the bruised winner.  But while IBM and Microsoft havedirtied their windows in public, smart buyers have stoodaround waiting until the product is absolutely positivelyfinished before investing heavily in new PCs.     With so many big names pushing windows andmultitasking, we're betting that the early 1990s will seeconsumer shift to IBM style windows.  But windowingtechnology can't be used effectively on most IBM compatiblePCs sold before 1990.     Chips in those computers can't manage more than amillion bytes (1M) of RAM memory.  1M is enough RAM to holdthe chapters of two typed books.  But it's not enough tohold several sets of program instructions plus the filescurrently using each of those programs.  That's why today'sMac IIs come equipped with 5M of RAM.     Many pioneers are using clever makeshift chips combinedwith software to get around this problem.  Sold by acronymssuch as LIMS, EMM, EMS, EEM, they all try to make do withpuny RAM.  They work-or don't work-depending often onnothing more predictable than luck.     Computers with the relatively new 386 chip can finallymanage enough RAM memory to juggle multiple files andprograms.  But programmers are still rewriting most programsto take advantage of this skill.     If you're tired of waiting, you'll probably have toupgrade the RAM memory in your older IBM compatible PC.  Andyou may have to upgrade your computer's display circuit anddisplay monitor.  Watch for a forthcoming column on thattopic.

Only months after Judge John Prosser rejected adamages claim from a Reuters journalist describing RSI as"meaningless", the highest RSI settlement to date (#79,000) was made toa former Inland Revenue typist. Below we look at what RSI means and howto minimise the risk of an outbreak.RSI affects the hands and arms and can cause extreme pain anddisablement. It is increasingly associated with keyboard use. But theterm is misleading, according to Khaled Choudhury, a consultantergonomist at London-based System Concepts, because there is nospecific medical condition called repetitive strain injury at thispoint in time.He says: "RSI is an umbrella term, which is used to describe a range ofmedical conditions affecting the upper limbs. Such conditions includetenosynovitis (inflammation of the tendon sheaths in fingers), carpaltunnel syndrome (inflammation/irritation of the median nerve in thewrist), tendinitis (in the hand and forearm), and various othershoulder and forearm problems."Risk factorsThere is no foolproof way of preventing RSI but the risks candefinitely be minimised. A number of factors are common to mostoutbreaks:* A physical/ergonomic deficiency in the workstation, or in the way theperson works at it. For example, poor posture or a keyboard positionwhich encourages excessive movement of the wrists.* Added pyscho-social stress, such as a problem with the work itself,or between a group of workers and their boss. Other possible pyscho-social risks factors include software which is difficult to use, or thethreat of redundancy.* The pressure on the individual to carry out the work (both at thecomputer and away from it) whether imposed by the employer or by theindividual themselves. This means that RSI can affect even people whodo not spend many hours typing continuously at a computer.* Adverse environmental conditions, such as poor lighting. People maybe adjusting their sitting position in order to avoid screenreflections, or get enough light and this may lead to bad posture.Minimising the risksSuch ergonomic and job-design issues are not normally top of thecompany agenda, but if heeded they can help to reduce the risks of anoutbreak.It is, for example, possible to buy ergonomically designed keyboards.These look quite different from the standard QWERTY keyboard and putmore emphasis on the user's comfort.The new keyboards attempt to minimise wrist movement when typing,reducing stress on the neck and shoulder muscles. Suppliers includeApple Computer, which also sells an ergonomically designed mouse, andKinesis of Bellevue, Washington.Choudhury says the QWERTY keyboard encourages poor wrist posture, butthe cost of replacing standard keyboards with ergonomic ones (except inspecial cases) will prove unrealistically high for most organisations.Apple's costs around #199 ($300 ).But there is much more to RSI than the keyboard used. Jeffrey Boyling,a consultant ergonomist and chartered physiotherapist who advises theFinancial Times, says RSI cannot be blamed on a particular design ofkeyboard. "I have seen cases of RSI involving all manner of keyboards,"he says. Usually two or more of the risk factors mentioned earliercontribute to a case of RSI.Perhaps more important than worrying about keyboards is to get riskassessments carried out on staff who use computers, looking at both theequipment used and the way each user works at it.Such assessments are now a legal requirement, following theintroduction of new Health & Safety regulations on display screen workin January 1993.New regulationsAndrea Caws, a consultant ergonomist at System Concepts, says under thenew regulations employers must:* Assess their workstations and the health and safety risks of workersusing them. They must then take steps to reduce those risks.* Adhere to at least the minimum ergonomic standards for screens (egscreens should be flicker free), keyboards, mice, desk, chairs and thephysical environment, such as lighting.* Plan display screen work to introduce variety and breaks.* Pay for eye tests related to display screen work. If glasses areneeded specifically for VDU work, the employer must pay.* Provide information and training on how to work safely at a computer.Once employers start to carry out risk assessments, they often findthat there are already RSI problems among staff. One foreign-owned Citymerchant bank found RSI among some of its secretaries. And a big-sixaccountancy firm has RSI problems among some of its accountants, butconsiders its professional staff too valuable to spend their timecompleting self-assessment forms to show whether their workingenvironment complies with HSE guidelines.At the opposite extreme some companies are prepared to pay heavily tomake sure that they comply.One Japanese merchant bank based in the City has spent well over#30,000 to get the working environment of its 300 computer usersassessed by ergonomics consultants. It used consultants costing #600 aday and able to carry out about five assessments a day.However, it is cheaper to send a number of staff on training coursesand transfer assessment skills in house, especially if staff changedesks and offices frequently. This is because the legislation says thatevery time someone moves desk, they have to be re-assessed. Prices andcourse lengths vary from #300 for a one-day one-person course to #3,000for a two-day 20-person course.Whatever approach is chosen, Choudhury warns that the government'sestimate of how much it costs to conform to the regulations is woefullyinadequate, especially if you discover problems and have to get someonein to sort them out.What if an employee gets RSI?But what do you do, if despite the best intentions, an employeecomplains of RSI? Choudhury advises employers to treat the complaintseriously and carry out a risk assessment of the employee's work spaceas required by the HSE regulations. This can be performed by a staffmember who has been on an appropriate training course or examined theregulations, or by a consultant. But if no steps have been takenbefore, and the employee's condition is serious, the employer mayalready be in trouble.The next step is to get a medical diagnosis, either from a generalpractitioner (GP) or, if the GP is out of his/her depth or does notwish to get involved, a specialist. The advantage of employing aspecialist (such as a chartered physiotherapist with experience of RSIcases) is that he/she will keep you up to date on the employee'scondition, so you won't have to depend on secondhand information fromthe employee.Boyling says: "Medical advice should be sought early, even if it isonly to reassure the individual that they have not got a clinicalproblem." If they are suffering from aches, pains and fatigue, this maybe remediable by improving the ergonomics of the work environment.However, if there is a clinical problem, RSI is curable if theindividual is treated early enough.The first thing a specialist is likely to advise is that you reduce theamount of time the RSI sufferer spends at a keyboard. This depends onthe severity of the case, but it is not unusual for RSI sufferers to berestricted to using a keyboard for five minutes an hour.Under the regulations, employers can also be asked to providemeaningful alternative work for staff with RSI. Many are confused as towhat this means and, if the wrong alternative work is provided, it canadd to the stress the RSI sufferer is under. For example, if a temp isbrought in to do the RSI sufferer's work under his/her supervision, theperson with RSI may feel that they aren't needed.Stress-related RSIA more constructive approach is to look at the design of the originaljob and see if there is something about it which is causing stress andneeds to be changed.In fact, Choudhury expects many future RSI actions to be brought byprofessional (as opposed to secretarial) staff on the grounds that theywere subjected to too much stress. This is a feasible line of attack,because amongst other clauses, the HSE regulations say that softwareand job design shall not be a source of stress.He says: "Many organisations call us in to see their secretaries and wetell them that their professional staff are equally at risk." One RSIcase going through the courts concerns a City worker who is seeking toprove that he was working under undue stress.Choudhury believes that companies' neglect of the requirements ofprofessional staff using computers will come back to haunt them.Contacts: HSE Information Centre is on (UK): 0742 892345; Jeffrey DBoyling & Associates is on (UK): 081 748 0001; Systems Concepts is on(UK): 071 240 3388.The Hand Book (Preventing Computer Injury) by Stephanie Brown, a New-York based professor of piano, is available from Ergonome, 145 West96th St, Suite 800, New York, NY10025.

Alan Denbigh, executivedirector of the Telecottage Association, says the course givespractical tuition in everything from business viability and finance(for those wanting to set up their own businesses) to informationtechnology, self-management and business administration.The first courses will be run at Axe Vale Telecentre in Devon, LeekCollege in Staffordshire, Ryhl in Wales and Moorlands.  So far thereare no set fees for the courses.  At Leek College the course is freeand Axe Vale has sponsorship from BT to help keep costs to a minimum.Lynn Chadwick, who is in charge of the teleworking course, says: "Sofar most interest has come from people planning to set up telecentresor start their own businesses from home".The Teleworking Association was set up in 1993 to provide help andsupport to those working from home or involved in running telecottagesor telecentres.

Theintroduction of several lower-cost ranges of pcs and portables hashelped to fuel its growth.Earlier this months, the company introduced its first sub-notebook pc -the Compaq Contura Aero, which it says is 33 per cent lighter and 40per cent smaller than most notebooks pcs.  Aero is smaller than mostnotebooks pcs.  Aero is smaller than an A4 sheet of paper and weighsless than three-and-a half pounds.  It costs #999 (excluding VAT) forthe monochrome-screen version with 84 MB megabyte hard disk.The machine has an Intel 486 processor operating at 25 Mhz and a PCMCIAType II slot into which credit-card sized peripherals (such as modems)can be added.  More expensive versions are available.The Aero can operate for four to six hours, depending on whether aninternal battery charger is used to recharge extra batteries whileothers are in use.  It is pre-loaded with Dos, Windows, TabWorks (whichsimplifies the management of Windows files), Lotus Organizer (anintegrated package with a calendar and planner), and WinLink filetransfer software and cable for exchanging files with a desktop pc.  Inthe office, Aero can be connected to a large monitor and keyboard via#75 Desktop Convenience Base which provides extra ports for pluggingsuch things in.Compaq describes Aero as a `no compromise' notebook.  One compromise isthat, although it can be connected to a floppy disk, it doesn't haveone of its own.Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS COMPUTING BRIEF via NewsNetFebruary 17, 1994MOTOROLA PLANS `WIRELESS DATA' COMMUNICATORSYet another personal communicator is being described as "not likeApple's Newton".

Lotus,the market leader, says it has doubled the number of users of itscc:Mail electronic mail (email) package in the past year.On pages six and seven of Business Computing Brief, and in three pagesof the next issue, we take a look at email products from over 30suppliers, with details of their features, the standards they support,and the kind of computers they run on. By comparing this data with our1992 survey, it is possible to see some of the key trends emerging inemail for local-area networks (Lans).Support for standardsStandards compliance is now an issue with almost all users and theproducts listed reflect that demand. X.400, the international standardfor addressing messages sent to different systems, is now offered bymost suppliers. X.500, the directory services standard, is starting toappear in some suppliers' literature.Another standard, of a de facto nature, is MHS (Message HandlingSystem) from Novell. This provides a useful common platform for makersof email software. It incorporates the means for exchanging messagesbetween different systems, leaving the product supplier free toconcentrate on adding features for the user.Mail filtering and workflowTwo of the new features that users are beginning to look for areworkflow and mail filtering. Both can easily be adapted to the user'srequirements. Workflow can, for example, direct mail to another personif the addressee is on holiday. Or it can manage the flow of a messagearound a group of users.Mail filtering differs in that it acts only on messages in the user'sin tray, prioritising messages. Both workflow and mail filtering arebridging the gap between electronic mail and specialist groupwareproducts.IntegrationUsers, and third-party suppliers, want software that will integratewith other programs and systems. Email is becoming the corporate datahighway for transporting any kind of electronic cargo. Links withdocument management systems, with transaction systems and with externalcommunications systems are now a common requirement.Two competing sets of programming interfaces have emerged to meet thisneed to connect with other systems - MAPI (Messaging ApplicationsProgramming Interface) and VIM (Vendor-Independent Messaging), whichwas instigated by Lotus and has the support of Borland, IBM,WordPerfect and others.In 1992, we drew attention to the rise of the terms, 'client' and'server'. In the context of email, client software gives users themeans of displaying and creating messages. The server supplies variousservices to the client machines connected to it. These include the"post office" (or message store), the directory of users, and anygateways to other systems.Most major suppliers offer client software for different machines, suchas pcs and Apple Macintoshes, that can work from the same serversoftware.

When 10,000 invoices a year land on the desk,however, the difficulty becomes one of keeping track of them andensuring that the item billed has been supplied satisfactorily andinvoiced correctly.Amerada Hess, the US-owned oil company with offices in London andAberdeen, found its payment procedures even more complex: as a memberof a number of consortia operating North Sea exploration and extractionprojects, Amerada Hess also has to allocate portions of some invoicesto its varying consortia partners.Accounting for wasteAmerada Hess, which had a UK turnover of US$734m in 1993, became anoperator, as opposed to just a consortium partner funding othercompanies' operations, in 1983. Since then, it has become the biggestoffshore acreage holder in Britain."We have expanded tremendously," says financial controller RogerThorne. "But our objective has always been to do so at minimum cost -which includes minimum headcount. One average accounts payable clerkused to process around 4,000 invoices per year - with other personnel,such as accountants, business planners and engineers, also examiningmany of the invoices. We couldn't expand our business without incurringmore invoices - requiring more resources.By 1991, Amerada Hess knew that Scott Field, the largest North Seadevelopment of the decade, was to come on stream in 1993. "As a partnerin consortia developing Scott, we were looking at 100 per cent growth.We did not want a 100 per cent increase in clerks, accountants orbusiness planners," says Thorne. "We knew we had to get an electronicsystem of some sort to capture and process financial information."Investigation across all industries led to a six month review ofworkflow systems. Chevron, a California-based oil company, was usingFilenet's image processing and workflow software, which seemed the mosteffective.Installation and applicationAmerada Hess signed Filenet and UK-based IMI Computing to develop anInvoice Payment System (IPS) in January 1993; installation was completeby September.Every paper invoice received is scanned into the system using imagingtechnology, and given a unique number which is also stamped on thepaper invoice. This is filed in case the auditors, consortia partners,VAT office or any other body wishes to see it later.Once scanned in, each invoice is checked on screen to ensure it iscorrectly added up, has the vendor name and invoice number and itscommitment reference, which tells the company when it purchased orrented the item or requested the service. The clerk can tell by thisnumber whether she is looking for a contract, purchase order, serviceorder, or work order (part of a large purchase order, similar to a sub-order).Windows technology enables the clerk to verify certain elements of thecommitment, called compliance. She can see if the goods billed havebeen received - based on data keyed in by the recipient of the goods.If the invoice is for a simple order and the goods have been receivedand match the purchase order, the bill is paid. If the compliance isoutside the scope of the clerk, it is routed electronically via DigitalEquipment's Teamlinks package to an accountant and/or engineer whoreceives a message flashed onto the screen saying there is an IPSreferral. This message remains on screen until deleted by the user."Engineers validate work done, while the accountant verifies thecommercial terms of the invoice and cost-codes it to the right account,which may be a department of Amerada Hess or one of our consortiapartners," Thorne explains. "With 102 joint ventures now in place,accounting can be complicated."The system knows at all times where an invoice is and when it has to bepaid. Reports are called off by accounts payable, which show when amember of staff has "sat on" an invoice for too long, and indicate thatthe invoice is due for payment.Once approved, the invoice goes back to the clerk, at which point thesystem reads the code and automatically sends the bill to the paymentqueue at the general ledger department for a cheque to be issued. Whenthe invoice is paid, details are passed back to IPS to provide acomplete audit trail.If at any time the vendor/service provider telephones to check on aninvoice, instead of ringing round the building to locate it, the IPSgives the clerk its current status. It used to take a day or longer totrace an invoice; now it takes minutes. If someone goes away, thesystem automatically routes the invoice to a delegated employee.Once paid, invoices are electronically archived with all vendorinformation, who approved the invoice, commitment compliance, goodsreceipt information etc.Time is moneyThe IPS is much quicker and more accurate than the old system, in whichall accounting information was keyed in to the computer from the paperinvoice, and added to by an engineer and/or accountant if necessarybefore being sent to the general ledger. Now accountants can alsointerrogate the general ledger on screen when analysing costings ormaking forecasts, switching to the IPS if any particular item needs tobe checked.Reports which can be obtained from the system include invoices whichwill become overdue if not paid immediately, payment by vendor permonth, payment history of a single vendor (useful when investigatingcomplaints about slow payment), and volumes of work handled by anyemployee.IPS provides another very important benefit, too, when Amerada Hess isbeing audited. "Because we spend #350m ($525m) on exploration andproduction, our joint venture partners want to audit us," explainsThorne. "In the past we would have to dig out all the paperwork and tryto segregate information. It took the equivalent of two full-timeemployees per year - and paper was easier to lose."Now we tell IPS to look for all relevant invoices and leave theauditors in front of a screen for as long as they wish."Amerada Hess now handles 50,000 invoices per year, still with fiveaccounts payable clerks and six or seven accountants. If the VAT officeever decides that it will accept imaged copies of invoices, vendorswill be asked to keep invoices electronically, eliminating all paper.In the meantime, 65 people use the system, based on six cornerstonelarge-screen pcs in accounts payable for heavy-duty image processing(such as checking images which have just been scanned), and smaller pcsfor other users (also used for other business tasks). Although AmeradaHess couldn't say what the complete system cost, as it has developed itjointly with Filenet, it estimates that it has saved up to #200,000 peryear in projected staff increases."IPS has allowed us to maintain our previous high standard with 100 percent efficiency, and given us the confidence to manage an invoiceprocessing system in a secure environment." Paying invoices has, infact, become almost painless.Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS COMPUTING BRIEF via NewsNetFebruary 17, 1994TAKING TIME TO LOOK AT SCHEDULINGStaff at Rockwell Collins can now book appointments with each otherelectronically, using pc-based scheduling software. Previously,scheduling meetings between busy people was a Herculean task. But todaymany wasted phone calls can be avoided, and countless Post-It notessaved, by using the group scheduling system.A scheduler is a computerised diary for each individual in acorporation, which can be accessed by others to register appointments,check availability and post messages. Linked to the corporateelectronic mail (email) system, a scheduler can contact a number ofpeople simultaneously then route replies back to the originator. Itwill also keep track of available resources such as meeting rooms,audio- visual aids and the like, and allocate them on request (ifavailable) and according to pre-determined criteria.Schedulers have been available to mainframe users for some years, buthave entered the limelight with the advent of groupware (software thatsupports team work), and of powerful pc-based systems which willoperate in a client-server environment (where processing is sharedbetween high-speed computer servers and pcs on a network).So now is a good time to take a fresh look at schedulers in the lightof new products and downsizing. Also, because many users have becomecomputer-literate, they may be ready to move to a computerised diarysystem.Rockwell Collins UK, a subsidiary of the US avionics and communicationscorporation Rockwell International, has recently expanded the use ofschedulers at its Reading offices, where some 200 staff are employed.Last autumn, Jenny White, software engineer at Rockwell Collins, wasasked to identify a system which would help to coordinate theactivities of senior managers. Although there was a scheduler availableon the in-house IBM system, it was memory-hungry and not very user-friendly. What was needed was a system which would run on a variety ofpcs on the Banyan Vines network from a server pc, and integrate withthe existing Vines email system.Staff at Rockwell Collins were used to Franklin organisers - a loose-leaf paper diary/organiser which is issued as standard throughout thecompany, and which provides a methodology for identifying andaccomplishing tasks. Jenny White looked at the computerised version ofthe Franklin organiser - Ascend - but found it expensive at around #100($150) per user, and slow under the Windows graphical user interface.She also found it difficult to move between users' schedules.Rockwell Collins' US parent was already using Calandar fromMicrosystems Software (a company based in Boston, USA) on two of its 96Banyan servers on a wide area network (Wan). At around #35 per user,Calandar was very competitively priced, and a powerful product. LastNovember it was installed in a department of 20 people at RockwellCollins UK on a trial basis.How it worksCalandar provides a daily or weekly view of your appointments, tasksand messages, a yearly navigator screen which gives an overview ofyearly activity or allows you to move quickly to another day, and amonthly group graph, which shows availability of all group members andresources at a glance.The Windows version has an optional button bar which provides access toother views and features. For example, you can click on the "change"button to access another individual's records, if security allows. Youcan also click and drag to create, move and delete appointments.Using the create/modify screen you can ask the system to suggest a timewhen various individuals and resources are free. Then you can make theappointment and await replies - the screen shows the status of eachappointment by a traffic-light icon (green denotes everyone hasaccepted, red tells you someone has declined and amber that all replieshave not yet been received). If not everyone can attend, the peopleinvolved must sort things out, perhaps by phone. However, the systemwill not allow you to make appointments which create conflicts forresources.When you receive a new activity, you can easily view, reply, or forwardit to another person or leave it unanswered for the time being, througha pop-up menu.Diaries are password-controlled, but you can allow proxy access toyours without a password at various levels.Additional useful "accessories" are an address book, called Calodex,which can be integrated with word processing or automatic phonedialling; a telephone message facility; a hot-call facility, whichallows you to see if another call is waiting and notify the operator ifyou want them to hold; and a "pegboard" which shows who is in or out ofthe office. You can also print a record of appointments to refer towhen away from your desk.Appointments and messages can be emailed to others who do not have aCalandar account if their details are recorded in Calodex, and otherindividuals can be included on invitation lists for reference.User reactionsJenny White says the scheduler has been readily accepted by stafftaking part in the trial. "I have been surprised at how quickly it hascaught on. If I want to upgrade the system now, I have to do it out ofhours because everyone's using it. We quickly started to get requestsfrom other departments and this month we have implemented Calandaracross the organisation on a 70 user licence, using a variety of pcs --XTs, ATs, Dells, PS/2s and Toshiba laptops." A training programme willinvolve Microsystems Software's UK reseller, Accurate Technology, intraining for key individuals who will then train others in theorganisation.Has there been any adverse reaction from users? "Some people thinkthere's a duplication of activity between the Franklin organisers andthe scheduling system," says White. "After all, you can take yourorganiser to a meeting, and so can everyone else, but you can't alltake pcs along just yet. So there is some duplication, but it's amatter of showing the result is worth it, and creating a culture inwhich everyone consults the scheduler regularly. That is what thetraining will aim to achieve."White believes the scheduler will not only save time for people makingappointments, but will also help staff with their work in other ways."For example, here in the computer department, we work to service levelagreements. If you're going to be away, you can actually print out yourtasks and give them to someone else to follow up."Cross platform capabilityThe email system provides the engine for Calandar, which integrateswith all leading local-area-network-based email systems includingcc:Mail, Microsoft Mail, Vines Intelligent Messaging and Novell's MHS,and is available in Windows, DOS and Macintosh versions, all sharingthe same database. There is also a Wan version which can support up to128 databases with up to 1,000 users in each database. At RockwellCollins, the scheduler is used locally in Windows and DOS versions.Calandar has been on the market since 1989 in the US, where it has over300,000 users, but it has only recently become available in the UKthrough Accurate Technology, based in Wokingham, Berks. According toBob Getchell of Microsystems Software, the product is particularlysuitable for "corporate entities with many servers and many email usersand connectivity between local area networks and a corporate emailfacility."Other UK corporate users include Walker Crisps, Guinness, Inchcape  andBritish Telecom. In the US, Calandar is sometimes used to schedulevideo conferences because it supports different time zones.Scheduling software can save many unproductive phone calls foradministrative staff who need to make appointments, book meeting rooms,arrange conference calls and keep track of itineraries and key tasks.With remote access from portables, schedulers can also be useful whenaway from the office. But even so, rumours of the death of the diaryare greatly exaggerated.Back to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS COMPUTING BRIEF via NewsNetFebruary 17, 1994SPECTRUM COUNTERSUES SCULLEY FOR $300 MILLIONJohn Sculley, Apple's former CEO, resigned abruptly after only fourmonths as chairman and chief executive of Spectrum InformationTechnologies.

The only question iswhen.By:Alan Joch, Senior EditorThe days when one programmer could bang out a commercial-grade applicationare over. The size and complexity of most applications are just too greatfor one mind. Enter components--prefabricated parts of applications that adeveloper can string together to create a sum greater than its parts.Today, componentware is neonatal, residing largely in the incubators oforganizations such as Component Integration Labs, Microsoft, and the ObjectManagement Group (OMG), with their OpenDoc, OLE, and CORBA standards. Inthis series of articles, we tell you how you can deal with and developapplications using these developing standards.But are they the future? David A. Fisher thinks not. As a program managerfor the National Institute of Standards & Technology (Gaithersburg, MD), hehelps administer $150 million in government funding to find new and betterways to create component-based software. So far, NIST has chosen to fund 16projects. ``We picked the radical ideas floating around,'' he says.   These ideas come from organizations at polar extremes. On one side arethe almost-mythical research institutions, such as AT&T Bell Labs andXerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). On the other side are obscurestart-ups, with names like Aesthetic Solutions, Semantic Designs, and evenTom Sawyer Software.   At the heart of NIST's program is the goal to make components and theskeleton applications that they plug into easier to build. The benefits tocorporate developers would be shorter development time, more-reliable code,and more efficient use of development resources. The program also seeksways to create a viable component market that spawns an industry ofcommercial component developers who can expect sales volumes large enoughto recoup their programming costs.   How might we fulfill these goals? Check back in five or seven years.That's when Fisher expects the research NIST is funding today to start tosee daylight as commercial products. These products might consist of newlanguages with radically different ways of expressing program requirements.``In the past, we've had some success by focusing on interface standards,but that's not a long-term solution,'' Fisher says. ``Interface standardshave life expectancies shorter than the standards-setting process.''   New automation tools would generate both the needed component and themechanism for gluing it together with other components. If languages andtools address the details of building component-based applications,software developers can focus solely on an application's features,performance, and reliability. ``We want developers to concern themselveswith content over form,'' Fisher says.   But that desire isn't new. It's what spawned CASE, object-orientedprogramming, and today's more down-to-earth version of componentware.What's more, developers don't often complain that there aren't enoughcreative ideas for making software development easier; missing arehere-and-now technologies that can help developers build programs today.   It's to that strength that OLE and CORBA (and soon, perhaps, OpenDoc)play. That's what we will explore in the following pages.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. INTEGRATION, NOT PERSPIRATIONCORBA, OLE, and OpenDoc: Three technologies for desktop components faceoffBy:DAVID S. LINTHICUMChoose one from column A, one from column B, and one from column C. Presto:You have an application.   Why shouldn't it be that easy? After all, you can build an entirepersonal computer by selecting off-the-shelf components. Why can't youbuild a software program the same way?   You can, if you understand how to use today's three main componenttechnologies: CORBA, OLE, and OpenDoc. Developers who work exclusively inWindows have it easiest: Microsoft has been chumming the waters for morethan two years with Visual Basic custom controls (VBXes) and OLE controls(OCXes).   But all is not perfect with Microsoft's Object Linking and Embeddingtechnology. Its learning curve can be daunting, and even when you'vemastered it, you hit disappointing limitations like its lack ofinheritance. (Inheritance is one of the cornerstones of object-oriented(OO) development.) Ask developers about the alternatives, and they'lldescribe OpenDoc as if it were an objet d'art on a pedestal. Unfortunatelyfor most production shops, OpenDoc will remain as impractical as a museumpiece until the technology finally ships and is embraced by third-partycomponent vendors.   The ground is even shakier for developers who code for Macintosh, OS/2,or Unix. They have nothing like OLE for get-it-done-now jobs. And theirbest-hope component environments, from OpenDoc to CORBA descendants likeSunSoft's NEO (Networked Objects), are infants.Controlling OLE   Unless you've been lost in Myst for the last three years, you'veprobably heard the hoopla over Microsoft's OLE 2.0. In short, it providesthe event-handling, file-managing, and information-sharing mechanisms thatserve as the plumbing of application components like OLE Controls.Moreover, OLE is an integral part of Windows 95 and other Microsoftoperating systems.   But OLE has a big drawback: Despite its name, it does not support OOdevelopment. OLE-based components don't offer inheritance--the capabilityto move data and functions from existing objects into new objects for useinside an application. You can alter OLE components using aggregation, butyou cannot extend the capabilities of an OLE component through standard OOprogramming operations.   (In contrast, CORBA-based platforms, like OpenDoc, do support the OOmodel religiously. Developers can extend the capabilities of OpenDoccomponents, or other CORBA-based object request brokers (ORBs), through thesame OO development practices found in C++, Smalltalk, and many specialclient/server tools.)   OLE Controls are a mix of an OLE automation server, which allows one OLEControl to expose its class modules to other OLE Controls, and an OLEin-process server, which is a server OLE implements as a DLL. OLE Controlssupport embedding; OLE automation; event notification; and the capabilityto connect objects, which establishes two-way communications between anobject and an application. This link lets an object notify an applicationwhen there's a change in its data or when a user has fired an event, suchas executing a mouse click. In addition, OLE Controls register themselvesin the Windows registry (through the DllRegisterServer function), provide alicensing feature, and offer property editing. These new features ease somedevelopment chores for those who build OLE Controls.   How do OLE Controls work within an application? As the figure belowshow, they transform user-generated events (such as mouse clicks) intomessages that communicate with the application (the container in OLEparlance). OLE Controls use these events to trigger event handlers thatcarry out the bidding of the OLE Control.   There are two major steps in the process of creating an OLE Control.First, you must design the control, which means creating, writing, andcompiling the code that draws the control and sets up all the methods anddata encapsulated inside it. The code eventually becomes a DLL with an .OCXor .DLL extension. Second, you need to design the interface that will allowMicrosoft's Visual Basic, Borland's Delphi, or other appropriatedevelopment environment to use the OLE Control. OLE Controls are DLLs andare not linked to a single application.   The communication between applications and OLE Controls is through amessaging interface. The host application tells the control what to dothrough this interface, and the control carries out the operation. EveryOLE object has a receptor, known as a sink, to receive an application'sinstructions. In some cases, however, a user may generate an event withinan OLE Control, and the control needs to communicate this to theapplication. OLE Controls set up these two-way communication linksdynamically. The control first tells the application what language it canspeak. The application then sets up the proper sink to accept thislanguage, and the two sides make a connection.   To ease development, OLE provides standard events (called stock events)for each OLE Control. These are the base events that developers build on tocreate their OLE controls. The OLE Control parent class, MicrosoftFoundation Classes' COleControl, manages stock events by default. To makean OLE Control interactive, developers must add interface methods andproperties. Methods provide the OLE Control with basic behaviors;properties generally include color and fonts for use in the OLE Control.Methods and properties together make up the basic mechanism that allows theappearance and values in the control to change as application processingtakes place.   But OLE Controls are difficult for many developers to understand andeven more difficult to build. For instance, OLE requires that a developerinvoke 126 functions just to get at 13 interfaces. However, Microsoft'sfirm support for the standard has led to such handy tools as the AppWizard,a dynamic template generator for use with Visual C++ that lets you developOLE Controls and other OLE parts without having to code from the groundup.   Support for OLE Controls is growing. Development packages such asBorland's Delphi, Microsoft's FoxPro and Access, and Visual Basic allsupport OLE Controls, as do most Windows-based client/server developmentproducts.OLE Control Roots   While OLE Controls may represent the future, VBXes are by far the mostsuccessful implementations of component-based development. VBX-basedapplication development typically consists of setting up many of thesecomponents within a host environment and allowing them to interact as anapplication. Developers usually just place VBXes inside interface windows,then tell the appropriate component properties within the tool what willhappen when the program invokes the VBX. You can often add these VBXcomponents to an application without having to write a single line of code.It's plug-and-play programming. Most Windows development tools, such asVisual Basic, PowerSoft's PowerBuilder, Borland's Delphi, and most C++compilers can use VBXes.   VBXes are everywhere. You can purchase them by the score at pricesranging from free to $3000. They'll do everything from faxing within anapplication to providing visual buttons to managing complex financialinformation. On-line services, BBSes, and Web servers offer many freewareor shareware VBXes.   But all has not been well in the VBX world. VBXes aren't based on anyparticular standard, and many developers consider them kludges that areclosely linked with Visual Basic. And precisely because the list ofthird-party vendors is so varied, ``buyer beware'' is the mantra for usersof VBX components. Generally speaking, VBX vendors test the products onlywith a few select development tools, not with all potential developmentenvironments. Some PowerBuilder developers say many VBXes aren't compatiblewith that platform's client/server development environment. Even VisualBasic developers find that bugs in VBXes keep them from playing well withother VBXes.   These problems will soon become moot. Microsoft is abandoning VBX infavor of OLE Control to promote the OLE agenda. For those of you who buildVBXes, Microsoft provides a VBX-to-OLE Control migration toolkit as part ofVisual C++ 2.0, the premier development environment for VBX and OLEControl.Using OpenDoc   If OLE Controls are king for Windows environments, then OpenDoc is thecrown prince for many Unix, OS/2, and Macintosh development efforts.OpenDoc has a lot on OLE, including its full support for inheritance.OpenDoc has a better interface than OLE partly because developers can domore with fewer API calls. OpenDoc also supports irregularly shapedobjects, overlapping parts, and the capability to have a variety of partsactive at the same time. (However, ``active all-the-time'' OpenDoccomponents can cause performance problems since they all require CPUcycles.)   OpenDoc programs consist of documents, parts, container applications,part editors, part services, and a part viewer. You build applications bygrouping OpenDoc parts inside a document (see the sample below). Partstypically have part editors or part services, which enable users to view ormanipulate parts, depending on the application.   The container is a stand-alone application that a developer has modifiedto support embedded OpenDoc part editors and services. Part editors displayand modify the contents of a part, as well as provide a user interface formaking these modifications. The user interface could include menus,controls, tool palettes, or other elements for interacting with thecontents. For example, an OpenDoc part could be a bar graph that will gointo an annual report. By invoking a part editor, a user can display andalter the information.   Part services provide the background features of an OpenDoc part and theuser interface for manipulating the contents of that part. For example, adatabase-access part would build in the database-access functionality as apart service. Part viewers allow users to see and print the contents of apart. A viewer is useful if a developer would like the user to be able toexamine but not change the information in an OpenDoc part.Something Completely Different   Developers will find OpenDoc a radical departure from traditional GUIapplication development because it gives them a component discipline thatother architectures, including OLE, have yet to match. OpenDoc is a set ofshared class libraries with a platform-independent interface defined by aninterface definition language (IDL). It uses object skeletons based onCORBA-compliant System Object Model (SOM) base classes. It's easy to addnew parts at any time because the SOM objects dynamically bind.   The IDL and SOM base of OpenDoc allow part editors built with variouscompilers and programming languages to talk with each other using a commoncommunications mechanism. SOM includes a component-packaging mechanism.When building OpenDoc objects, developers can use this mechanism to packagepart editors using binary class libraries for shipment as DLLs; you cansend a part to someone and be sure the recipient will have the appropriateviewer to see the part. SOM is the OO heart of OpenDoc, and it's whereOpenDoc gets its inheritance capabilities. Inheritance lets developerssubclass OpenDoc parts and either use or override methods and datadelivered using the DLL binaries. This feature brings the concept ofextendable parts to OpenDoc, which is one of the real selling points ofthis technology.   On paper, OpenDoc offers a number of technical advantages. But iscreating parts any easier than coding controls in the OLE environment?Actually, the process of programming an OpenDoc part is straightforward.You create the interface in an IDL source file, run the SOM precompiler onyour IDL code, add the body of the implementation code, compile the wholething into a DLL for Windows or the equivalent in other environments, andyou're ready to roll. Building OpenDoc parts requires fewer steps thanbuilding similar components as OLE Controls.   When creating an OpenDoc part, you must first subclass ODPart, which isan abstract class that brings with it 60 methods to define the behavior ofa part. You customize behavior of a part by overriding any of the defaultmethods that came with the part. You can create a workable OpenDoc part byimplementing as few as six methods. Thus, creating OpenDoc parts is a snapfor most developers in almost any programming environment and platform. Theonly real trick is to track which methods OpenDoc calls while your part isworking in a production environment.   With OpenDoc, you can also create links between objects, or a permanentreference from one part to another. When data changes in one OpenDocobject, it automatically changes in the other. For example, developerscould use one OpenDoc component to track information in the stock market inreal time, and send information to update a graphical depiction of the datain another OpenDoc object.   The component-based nature of OpenDoc allows developers to create ormigrate components on one platform and use them on other platforms thatsupport the standard. OpenDoc, as with other CORBA offspring, supports OLE2.0 by encapsulating OLE components inside OpenDoc components. Apple andthe other proponents of OpenDoc are realistic. They are well aware that thetechnology has a tough battle to win the desktop, so OpenDoc's OLE supportallows developers to mix and match both OpenDoc and OLE components in thesame development environments.Mac Development   Thanks to Apple's strong support, OpenDoc is the obvious choice ofcomponent technology for the Macintosh. Apple is a member of ComponentIntegration Laboratories, the consortium that is creating and promotingOpenDoc. And Apple now uses OpenDoc to deliver a component-basedarchitecture for System 7. (Microsoft is also porting OLE 2.0 to System7.)   In many ways, System 7 and OpenDoc are functionally equivalent toWindows 95 and OLE. However, Macintosh developers have only a few selectOpenDoc tools to use, many of which are still evolving. Oracle PowerObjects uses BASIC and will support OpenDoc component development on theMac. (Power Objects also supports VBXes and will probably someday supportOLE Controls.) Novell's AppWare and the forthcoming MacApp also supportOpenDoc. But there's a significant problem: Commercial OpenDoc componentsare basically nonexistent. For the near future, developers will have todepend on OLE components.   OpenDoc's cross-platform capabilities bring a great advantage tosoftware developers. These capabilities offer much better interoperabilitywith other environments (such as Unix and even Windows) than OLE does. IBM,for example, will sell OpenDoc for Windows 95 and Windows NT, as well asOpenDoc for OS/2 and A/IX. Macintosh developers are looking to straddle thestandards by using a mix of OpenDoc and OLE development environments.Unix: Up For Grabs   In the Unix world, the component market is still anyone's game.SunSoft's Solaris, Hewlett-Packard's HP/UX, and Next's NextStep operate inthe world of CORBA as well as environments defined by proprietarycomponent-based solutions.   SunSoft's Solaris clearly stands in the CORBA camp with the company'sNEO specification. NEO, under development for three years, was scheduled toship in volume early this year. NEO is not just a component-baseddevelopment standard; it's Sun's vision of how it will deliver OS andapplication software in the future.   The problem with NEO is it's just now becoming available. SunSoftprovided early developer release (EDR) toolkits for NEO to a few selectcustomers last year. The EDR provided a CORBA-based object request brokerthat supports C and C++. The NEO ORB routes object requests from objectsthat reside on Solaris-based workstations to a network link.   Another problem is NEO's shaky adherence to the OO model. Thespecification supports single instead of multiple inheritance. SunSoft'sfirst release of NEO will include support for CORBA 1.2-based services suchas naming, event, life cycle, and persistence. After adopting the new CORBA2.0-based services, SunSoft promises NEO will support transactions,concurrency control, externalization, licensing, and querying.   For developers, the most compelling reason to investigate NEO is thepower of the environment. If you develop in an all-Solaris shop, NEO may bethe only way to go when moving toward components in the short term. If NEOlives up to its promises and fully supports CORBA 2.0, it will be a solidcontender in the distributed object market. However, OpenDoc will stillshine for component-based development on the Unix desktop, and developersshould focus on the tools and technology that make use of OpenDoc. It willprovide component compatibility within Solaris and within otherenvironments as well.   Next is crashing ahead with its own proprietary component-basedstandard, Portable Distributed Objects (PDO). Through an alliance with Sun,Next sells the OpenStep environment for Sun workstations. OpenStep is alsoavailable for Windows 95 and Windows NT systems, thus competing with OLEand OpenDoc. OpenStep supports PDO and NEO, and it could be theCORBA-compliant client of choice for both Unix and Microsoft OSes when thedust settles. There is even talk of a PDO-based distributed OLE standard.   PDO, however, is proprietary. You use the Objective C environment toassemble PDO components into applications. PDO objects communicate over anetwork through standard Objective C messages. In many ways, the ObjectiveC language delivers the ORB features of PDO, rather than an underlyingstandard such as CORBA or Microsoft's COM. This limitation makes NextStepno better than other proprietary development environments. However, PDOwill provide connections with CORBA-compliant ORBs and OLE 2.0.   To build applications using PDO within the NextStep environment, youmust rely on the NextStep developer tool suite. Although Next provides aneffective development environment, it's the only game in town. Therefore,developers looking to hedge their bets with several development tools maywant to steer clear of this environment. The tool suite includes a ProjectBuilder, Interface Builder, Object editor, and Class browser. On top of theDeveloper tool suite, Next provides Enterprise Objects Framework, whichoffers links to standard relational database servers so that they appear asobjects within the Objective C environment.VHS or Beta?   The issue of component-based development may be more political thantechnical. OpenDoc, from a developer's perspective, is far superior forcomponent-based application building than OLE. However, OpenDoc is still inthe ``too new to tell'' phase, while OLE is a reality. OLE is alsoassociated with the applications juggernaut: Microsoft. There are a fewinnovative vendors that support OpenDoc development, but mostnonproprietary components and component-based programming tools you canpurchase today are based on OLE and OLE Controls.   In many respects, 1996 will be the year that determines how significantOpenDoc and other CORBA-based component environments are in yourdevelopment efforts. OpenDoc will succeed or get out of the way soMicrosoft can take over the component-development market. Successfulcomponent-based development will come to pass only when we finally have asingle standard. Today, there are just too many oars in the water.Where to FindComponent Integration LaboratoriesSunnyvale, CA(408) 864-0300fax: (408) 864-0380cilabs@cil.orgMicrosoftRedmond, WA(800) 426-9400(206) 882-8080fax: (206) 936-7329http://www.microsoft.comNextRedwood City, CA(415) 366-0900fax: (415) 780-3714Object Management GroupFramingham, MA(508) 820-4300fax: (508) 820-4303http://www.omg.orgSunSoftMountain View, CA(800) 786-7638(512) 345-2412http://www.sun.com/sunsoftOLE 2.0PROS-- Available today for commercial development projects-- Widespread third-party component support-- Extensive and growing development-tool support-- An integral part of Windows 95 and Windows NT-- Microsoft aggressively promotes the technologyCONS-- Steep learning curve for developers-- Uses a complicated interface-- Doesn't support inheritanceOpenDocPROS-- Supports inheritance and other object-oriented principles-- Easy-to-use interface-- Requires fewer API calls than OLE-- Supports irregularly shaped objects, overlapping parts-- Components can be active in the background-- Designed for cross-platform applicationsCONS-- Formal version hasn't shipped yet-- Nascent third-party component market-- Few development tools currently support the technologyIllustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: OLE Control Messaging InterfaceAn OLE Control interface consists of a pointer to a function table thatsits between the container (an application) and the OLE Control.Illustration: Figure: How an OLE Control Works with an Application1.

OLE 2.0 is a great fit if you develop only for Windows 95 and Windows NTsince it's part of those operating systems. If you go OLE, you base yourapplication-development efforts on an obtainable technology. Thishere-and-now advantage led approximately 375 software vendors (so far) topublicly declare their allegiance to OLE. But OLE comes with a price:Applications are difficult to build because OLE 2.0 has an overly complexinterface. Thus, developers need to absorb a lot of low-level detail beforethey get OLE to sing and dance.   With OpenDoc, you can build CORBA-based objects that have the capabilityto operate within a desktop environment. OpenDoc provides an easierapproach to development and is better for cross-platform applications, soit's a solid fit for Unix, Macintosh, and OS/2 environments. OS/2, in fact,is built using the System Object Model (SOM), which gives it and OpenDoccommon ancestry to CORBA.   OpenDoc even supports OLE, so you can embed OLE 2.0 objects directlyinto its OpenDoc components. Also, OpenDoc is a better bridge to networkedapplications, thanks to its kinship with CORBA 2.0, whose creators havealready worked out how to distribute object throughout enterprises. On theother side, Microsoft has still not released the final version of NetworkOLE (see ``Components Everywhere,'' page 99).   But delays plague OpenDoc also, and the success of OLE 2.0 andMicrosoft's considerable influence give many potential OpenDoc supporterssecond thoughts. Development tools using OpenDoc have also been slow toappear, so only a handful of products, such as AppWare, will supportOpenDoc when it finally becomes a reality sometime later this year. Novelldidn't help the situation at last year's Unix Expo; the company appeared tobe hedging on its OpenDoc support and seemed to be flirting with OLE. Newslike this places OLE alternatives in a holding pattern.   OpenDoc has a better approach to component-based development and betterplatform support, but it could still lose the big game to OLE.   Other component technologies include Iona's Orbix, Digital'sObjectBroker, IBM's SOM, Expersoft's XShell, SunSoft's NEO, and HP's ORBPlus. Although these six technologies provide CORBA compatibility, most arebased on CORBA 1.2 and therefore can't play well with each other. Thingsare changing, however. The OMG's new CORBA 2.0 specification finallyprovides enough detail to allow developers to create object request brokers(ORBs) that work together.   Some development shops take the politically correct approach: Theysupport OpenDoc, CORBA, and OLE. But it's expensive to keep developers upto date on tools and training for all the different technologies. Someother organizations have chosen the cheaper path of waiting to see whichway the industry goes before committing resources. However, watching andwaiting could be the most dangerous option of all, since componenttechnology moves so quickly. Those who choose to stand still now could findthat it's almost impossible to catch up later. You can't blame developersfor getting frustrated with the entire situation as they watch the factionsof component development fight it out.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. COMPONENTS EVERYWHEREMicrosoft's Network OLE and the OMG's CORBA are competing to distributecomponents on your networkBy:TOM R. HALFHILL AND SALVATORE SALAMONEStick an object on a network and assume that applications will be able touse it. The idea is simple in the broadest sense, but the devil is in thedetails. So far, nobody has been able to come out with a standard way ofdealing with distributed components that addresses enough of the problemsand has enough support to take hold. Two standards stand a chance.   OLE may be the 800-pound gorilla of desktop-component technologies, butit's more of a rhesus monkey in the jungle of distributed components. Togain bulk, the upcoming Network OLE will use remote procedure calls (RPCs)to let companies scatter components throughout the enterprise and enablethem to communicate.   But there's already a gorilla in this territory: the Object ManagementGroup's (OMG's) Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard.It tackles the same problems, but its object-request-broker (ORB)architecture gives developers greater programming-language and OS freedomsthan OLE. And with technical roots that extend back to 1990, CORBA is aspecification that's further along the evolutionary path.   So which one is for you? Like all other complex questions, the answer isa hedge: It depends. But to make your decision, you need to understand howNetwork OLE and CORBA work.Network OLE   Due in 1996-97 with the next version of Windows NT, Network OLE adds athird tier to your client/server network. It lets you encapsulate thecritical code that contains your business rules into relatively lightweightcomponents that you can distribute across the network as you see fit. Forsecurity, performance, or upgrading ease, you may locate the components onclient systems, enterprise servers, or special component servers. Thus, thethird tier can be more conceptual than a physical entity.   A three-tier architecture requires a mechanism that keeps track ofdistributed components and lets clients access them. Network OLE has justsuch a feature.   Network OLE is an OS layer that insulates applications and componentsfrom the hairy details of network transports and component tracking. If itworks as Microsoft is promising, it will be transparent to users andtranslucent to network administrators. Users won't need to know whether theOLE objects they're using reside on their local machines or on othernetworked systems. Administrators will decide where to install the objects,and Network OLE will maintain the invisible links even if the administratormoves or updates the objects (see ``Extending the Reach of OLE,'' November1994 BYTE).Priming the Pump   Microsoft is doing two things to pave the way for Network OLE. First, itis urging software developers to support OLE 2.0 in all new software. Themore OLE 2.0 features that programs support, the more benefits they'llautomatically inherit under Network OLE. Second, Microsoft is offering aglimpse of what's to come.   A new remote automation mechanism in Visual Basic 4.0 (VB4) EnterpriseEdition lets you build and deploy distributable objects (they're called OLEautomation servers). You can scatter these objects across a network andcall their methods from any client application that's an OLE automationcontroller. Some examples of OLE automation controllers are Microsoft'sWord, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, and VB4; Borland's Visual dBase andParadox for Windows; Novell's Quattro Pro; and Powersoft's PowerBuilder.   Until now, the only way you could use OLE over a network was todynamically link or embed OLE objects in your applications. In other words,you could manually embed an Excel chart in a Word document if Word was onthe client machine and Excel was on a file server, but you couldn't write aWord macro that called Excel's OLE methods on the file server. VB4 providesthe remote automation mechanism that lets the OLE controller applicationcall the remote OLE object's automation methods programmatically.   For example, today you could write a VB program that sends 10 values toa copy of Excel on the same computer and ask Excel to compute and returnthe sum of those values. But you can't do that if the copies of VB andExcel are on different machines on a network. With VB4 remote automation,you can.   Remote automation uses a new OLE proxy on the client machine and aremote automation manager on the server (which could be a traditionalserver, another client machine, or a component server). When a clientapplication calls the methods of an OLE automation object, it first checksthe OLE object registry (see the figure ``Stepping Stone to Network OLE'').The registry knows whether the called object is on a local machine or aremote machine. If the object is on a local machine, the request passesthrough the regular OLE proxy to the object.   If the called object is remote, the new OLE proxy handles the request.It translates the OLE call into a Windows NT-standard RPC and sends it overthe network to the server. At that end, the remote automation managertranslates the RPC back into a regular OLE call and forwards it to the OLEobject. OLE callbacks are handled the same way.   It's not quite as cool as full-blown Network OLE, but it's enough towhet your appetite. Network OLE will be more robust and will offer manymore features. For example, it will work with the NT file system toautomatically keep track of objects if you relocate them on the network. Itwill also let you link applications and objects created with anydevelopment tools, not just VB4. (Technically, VB4 makes this possible, butMicrosoft's licensing agreement requires that one of the OLE objects mustbe VB or created with VB.)   The advantages of a three-tier architecture will become more obvious asthe technology becomes more widespread. By delivering a preview of NetworkOLE in VB4--and by laying the groundwork with OLE 2.0 in today'ssoftware--Microsoft is building a solid distributed-objects strategy forthe future.Technology Tango   Network OLE isn't the only technology to consider. The OMG recentlyreleased CORBA 2.0, a revision of the original CORBA specifications. Butwhat happens to CORBA in the next year--especially how the standard evolvesto enhance portability and interoperability--could hold the key to thefuture of componentware.   ORBs are the cornerstones of the CORBA architecture. In a distributedenvironment, they provide a common platform for objects to request data andservices on the client side and for servers to send their responses back tothe client objects (see the figure ``Objects in Orbit''). ORBs hideinteroperability details from the client and server objects, so such issuesas what programming language and OS each object uses don't stand in the wayof their communication. Thanks to ORBs, a client object doesn't even needto know the location of its server counterpart, which may be on the samemachine or on a computer thousands of miles away. It's the ORB's job to bethe matchmaker.   A client application makes a request for some kind of information. Therequest has two basic parts: an object reference for a particular objectand the action the object is to perform. The client creates this request bycalling stub routines specific to an object (through the interfacedefinition language, or IDL, interface) or by constructing the requestdynamically. Either way, the client sees the same interface regardless ofwhat language the object is written in or where it lives on the network.   The stub routine (or dynamic request) routes the request to the ORB. TheORB is responsible for maintaining mechanisms to find the requested object,preparing the object to receive the request, and communicating the datainside the request. During the request, the ORB locates the appropriateobject implementation, transmits the parameters of the request, andtransfers control to the object. Once the object is done with the request,it passes control back to the ORB along with the results. The ORB thenpasses control back to the client application.   CORBA 2.0 built on this architecture and addressed some of theshortcomings in the original version. Specifically, it includes bridgingtechnology, which provides for communication between ORBs, and an optionalDistributed Computing Environment-based (DCE) interoperability scheme.CORBA 2.0 also adopted TCP/IP as the standard communications protocol tohelp ensure out-of-the-box interoperability between different vendors'TCP/IP implementations of CORBA. The DCE can also be used as a way forobjects to communicate, but it is an option that users must choose toimplement. These enhancements extend the portability and interoperabilityof the standard.   CORBA is part of the larger Object Management Architecture (OMA), whichincludes CORBAservices and CORBAfacilities. CORBAservices provide basicoperations, such as object class management, instance management, andsecurity. CORBAfacilities offer link management, print services, andE-mail. Such facilities will help extend the portability of CORBA into suchareas as groupware and transaction monitors.   In some ways, what is happening to CORBA is analogous to what hashappened to network OSes (NOSes) in recent years. When they wereintroduced, many NOSes offered such basic services as print and fileservices. But for those NOSes that moved from being aimed at the workgroupto being honed for the enterprise network, developers added morecapabilities, such as directory and security services.   In a similar way, the OMG has added services to CORBA and expanded theways users access them. For example, the proposed licensing service lets aCORBA developer use the Object Licensing Service for monitoring andpossibly metering an object's usage. This lets users write a program thattracks an object's usage and bills customers based on the number of timesthey accessed an object and how long an object was used each time. Such aservice goes beyond the basic functional interoperability that is requiredin object-oriented applications development.Looking Ahead   Back to the jungle. For better or worse, OLE is the object technologythat dominates most desktop-development efforts today. As Microsoft extendsOLE's reach into a distributed environment, the combination of the clientstranglehold with strong network services could create an insurmountablemountain for CORBA.   A possible compromise scenario is an object-development environment,where the desktop is dominated by OLE and the backbone is CORBA. Ideally,there would be a simple way to link the Windows desktop with objectsresiding on Unix and OS/2 servers. Today, companies such as Expersoft (SanDiego), Iona Technologies (Dublin, Ireland), Genesis Development (WestChester, PA), and Visual Edge Software (Montreal) offer products designedto bridge the OLE-to-CORBA gap.   However, all these solutions are proprietary. The OMG is working on anOLE/CORBA specification that would standardize the process in which a userwould be able to carry out an operation on a CORBA object from OLE-enabledapplications. Last summer, the OMG received over a dozen vendor proposalson how to close the OLE-to-CORBA link. Basically, the OMG's efforts couldlead to the definition of an OLE/COM (Component Object Model)-to-CORBAgateway that provides a mapping between COM and OMA.   In the meantime, developers are left to watch the standards evolve andto bet development resources on a large gorilla or a committee-designedcamel.Where to FindMicrosoft Corp.Redmond, WA(800) 426-9400(206) 882-8080fax: (206) 936-7329http://www.microsoft.comObject Management GroupFramingham, MA(508) 820-4300fax: (508) 820-4303http://www.omg.orgIllustration(s):Illustration: Figure: Stepping Stone to Network OLEVisual Basic remote automation uses a remote OLE proxy that converts OLEcalls into remote procedure calls (RPCs) and sends them to a remote system.An automation manager translates the RPCs back into normal OLE calls andforwards them to the appropriate OLE object through the local proxy.Illustration: Figure: Objects in OrbitObject request brokers (ORBs) act as a common platform for objects tocommunicate.

Here are some interesting variations.By:JON UDELLThe sun never sets on The BYTE Site. Once I launched it, I becameresponsible for a service that a growing international clientele expects tobe able to use 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.   How do you keep this kind of service humming? Two crucial variables--theWorld Wide Web server application and the OS--govern your managementoptions. Here's a look at some combinations I've tried so far.NCSA Server, BSD/OS   The most manageable Web servers run on Unix (or Unix-like) OSes.Consider the Dell PC on which I've been running the National Center forSupercomputing Applications (NCSA) server + BSD/OS combination. It's aheadless box; I borrowed the monitor long ago and never returned it. Whybother? A telnet window on another workstation--located on the localEthernet or anywhere on the Internet--is fully equivalent to the Dell'smissing console. I can dial BIX from a DOS subnotebook, telnet to the Dell,stop the NCSA server, launch EMACS, edit the server's configuration files,and restart the server.   If the server and its related utilities were GUI-oriented rather thancommand-line-oriented applications, they could export the same controlcapabilities using the X Window System. You'd need more than a DOSsubnotebook to run the X server, of course. But the point is that locationdoesn't matter in Unix computing: You can do just about anything fromanywhere.   A healthy Web server needs to be running on a healthy system, of course,so the scope of the management task goes beyond just monitoring the httpd(the Hypertext Transport Protocol daemon) itself. You also have to payattention to ftp and mail services; organize, prune, and back up files; andread and analyze system logs.   Unix doesn't make any of this easy for a novice, and mastering theseemingly endless number of interactions between shell scripts andconfiguration files requires a huge investment of time and effort. Butadvanced users leverage that investment by packaging routine managementtasks into shell scripts and scheduling them to run periodically.Automation and remote access are the keys to effective system management.Unix shines in both departments.Netscape Commerce Server, Windows NT   Telnet and EMACS get the job done, but should you really have to dependon 25-year-old character-mode tools? A number of second-generation Webservers, led by Netscape's, export management interfaces as Webapplications. The Netscape server's administrative tool set has two parts:a collection of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) forms that document thetasks a web master can perform--creating a user database, viewing a log,securing a directory--and a corresponding set of Common Gateway Interface(CGI) programs that perform those tasks.   When you install a Netscape server, you really install two serversattached to different TCP/IP ports. The public server,http://www.byte.com:665/ in my case, presents a home page. Theadministrative server, which I set up at http://www.byte.com:666/, presentsan authentication dialog box and then a page of management options.   Why a separate server? One key administrative task is stopping andstarting the primary server. Because the Netscape server's process controldepends on CGI, you might be able to shut down the primary server using itsown CGI mechanism, but you'd be sawing off the branch you're sitting on.   Because it leverages Web technology, Netscape's server administrationenjoys the same portability as all other Web applications. Local and remoteX, Microsoft Windows, and Mac browsers all run the administrativeapplications identically. On the server side, the CGI wrapper provides thesame capabilities on any server OS. For example, I ran the NetscapeCommerce Server on Windows NT, which lacks the remote access features thatUnix provides. No matter. A user of Netscape's administrative tool setdoesn't have to know what OS underlies the server.WebStar, Mac System 7.5   A new member of The BYTE Network Project's family of Web servers is theApple Internet Server, a Power Mac 6100/60 running StarNine's WebStar.Currently this machine is running as an intranet server--it's connectedonly to the BYTE LAN, not to the Internet. I've mirrored the contents ofThe BYTE Site onto the WebStar server, and I'm now using it to collaboratewith BYTE's design department on a redesign of the site's graphics.   WebStar's administrative application handles the usual chores: definingusers and groups, configuring logging and suffix mapping, and tweakingcommunications buffers. It communicates with the WebStar server entirely bymeans of Apple Events. This means that on a LAN, you can administer WebStarfrom any Mac, since Apple Events readily cross machine boundaries on anAppleTalk network. This scheme won't work on an IP network, however. Thisis because even with Open Transport, Apple's latest transport-independenttechnology, core Apple networking services, such as file sharing and AppleEvents, can't yet ride on IP.   What to do? Eric Zelenka from StarNine pointed me to a CGI applicationcalled RemoteAdmin.acgi (not shipped with the Apple Internet Server, butavailable from http://www.starnine.com). It exports an HTML forms interfaceto WebStar's administrative functions.   Like Netscape's approach, this arrangement affords both remote accessand portability. Any browser, whether Mac-based or not, can now control aWebStar server over the Internet. The browser speaks HTML toRemoteAdmin.acgi, which in turn sends Apple Events to WebStar (see thefigure ``Managing WebStar on an AppleTalk Network'' above). Because theSystem 7.5 Finder can itself be driven by Apple Events, it should bepossible to write a more ambitious CGI application that can manage files ona Mac server, operate Control Panels, and even restart a Mac.WebSite, Windows NT   O'Reilly and Associates' WebSite provides a suite of Win32 managementtools, including Server Admin, which controls security settings, data-typemappings, and transaction logging. It's really just an interface to theWindows NT (or Windows 95) registry where WebSite stores the values of itscontrol variables.   Because the NT and Windows 95 registry editors are remote procedure call(RPC) enabled--that is, you can point one machine's copy of RegEdit atanother's registry, even across the Internet--WebSite is as capable of thesame sort of limited remote management as any Windows 95 or NT applicationthat stores configuration data in the registry. To make RegEdit work acrossthe Internet, add a line like192.168.1.1 MYSERVERto the WINDOWS\LMHOSTS file. This line maps the target machine's IP addressto a NetBIOS name that Windows networking services, such as RPC, require.(See ``Wide-Area Windows Networking,'' January 1994 BYTE, for more onNetBIOS-over-TCP/IP.)   This setup works, but it's slow over dial-up IP because RegEdit uses aslow link inefficiently. To improve performance and simplify the interface,WebSite's designers made Server Admin RPC-enabled. From my Windows 95machine at home, I can tweak WebSite registry values on an NT server atBYTE over the Internet.   But while Server Admin works well in RPC mode, I've had poor luck usinganother tool, WebView, to remotely scan The BYTE Site for broken hypertextlinks. With WebSite, as with Windows NT in general, RPC-based remoteadministration is a hit-or-miss affair. You must specifically modify eachapplication that exports a control interface through RPC, and even thenyour mileage varies, depending on the characteristics of the administrativeapplication and its data.   So what's the general solution for remote management of NT systems andapplications? Enter WinFrame.Purveyor, WebSite, and WinFrame   Citrix Systems' WinFrame transforms Windows NT into a multiuser OS witha flexible and efficient remote GUI. For the past month, WinFrame has beenrunning on one of The BYTE Site's development servers (a dual-processorIntergraph TD-4), and it has revolutionized how I develop and manage thesite.   Check out the screen on page 107 showing The BYTE Site's WinFramecommand center. You're looking at my home Windows 95 PC on a 28.8-Kbpsdial-up link to the Internet. The window titled ``TD4'' is a projection ofthe Intergraph server's console, and it could just as easily appear on aLAN- or dial-up-connected Windows 3.1 or DOS machine, or on one of the newWinFrame-aware terminals from Wyse.   There are a lot of things going on at once in this window. A detaileddescription follows.   WebView. The WinFrame server is running WebSite. In theory, I can scanits web from home using WebView's RPC capability. In practice, this processworks faster and more reliably when I run it directly on the server andexport its user interface using WinFrame.   Perl. The MS-DOS icon represents an instance of Perl running a scriptthat summarizes the IP addresses in the production server's log.   Performance Monitor. Here I'm watching two Web-server processes: WebSiteon the WinFrame and, through the WinFrame system, Process Software'sPurveyor on the production Windows NT/Alpha machine. The WinFrame box cansee the Alpha/NT box's Performance Monitor, because vanilla NT'sPerformance Monitor is RPC-enabled.   Until I installed WinFrame, I couldn't remotely monitor the Purveyorprocess because I couldn't directly access the Purveyor box's PerformanceMonitor. Ditto for Event Viewer, shown here watching both systems' eventlogs. Ditto also for Registry Editor, Server Manager, and User Manager.   File Manager. With megabytes of log data and reports accumulating everyday, my server management routine involves slinging a lot of files around.With the two servers' file systems cross-mounted, I can run plain old NTFile Manager on WinFrame's remote console and effectively manage both.   Users of Purveyor 1.1 will especially like being able to use FileManager remotely. Although 1.1 exports all its Control Panel functions toremote Web browsers by means of CGI/HTML, you still have to use a FileManager extension to set permissions on uniform resource locators (URLs).Purveyor on Windows NT can't export that function to remote administrators;Purveyor on WinFrame can.   Control Panel. Under Unix, GUI administrative tools are just wrappersaround more-primitive command-line tools; that's why you can manage Unixremotely using just telnet. NT's versions of these tools are nativelygraphical, so they're easy to use, provided you're sitting at the console.But even if you use a third-party telnet on NT, you can't stop,reconfigure, and restart the system services that the Control Panelcontrols. WinFrame exports control over these vital services to the remoteadministrator running Windows 95, Windows 3.1, or even lowly DOS.Back to the Future   So far I've described only the benefits of Windows NT remote control.WinFrame is currently the only player in this field. None of the Windows3.x remote-control programs has yet stepped up to the plate, nor hasMicrosoft's own Systems Management Server. When they do, will Citrix windup on the bench?   I don't think so. WinFrame's remote GUI is a godsend for the manager ofan NT-based Web server, but its multiuser dimension makes it much more thanjust an NT remote-control product. The Citrix vision of Web-based computingrepresents a serious alternative to both the existing CGI/HTML standard andthe distributed-component architectures currently being advanced by Sun andNetscape (Java) and Microsoft (Blackbird).   Consider the suite of Web-based tools I'm now writing to supportadministration of the Virtual Press Room (see ``Perl Magic,'' DecemberBYTE). First-generation Web technology dictates a CGI/HTML solution. That'sdoable, but if you've been following my CGI adventures, you know thatmimicking a live GUI using a series of forms-based transactions can gethairy.   Second-generation Web technology (the Java/Blackbird approach) promisesto export the live GUI through the Web as a dynamically acquired component.Sounds great, but I won't deliver tools next month based on Java orBlackbird; these technologies aren't ready yet.   WinFrame, in contrast, relies on old-fashioned development tools, suchas Visual Basic and Delphi. And it updates the even-more-old-fashionedmainframe- or X-like model of computing, enabling Visual Basic/Delphiapplications to run on a multiuser host with local access to data whiledisplaying on Windows terminals.   Too retro for your taste? By the time you read this, Citrix will haveshown a Web browser that displays off-the-shelf Windows and Win32applications running on a WinFrame host located across the Internet. I'mbullish on Java and Blackbird, too, but there are a lot of Windowsapplications kicking around, and Citrix's approach ought to make you stopand think.   WinFrame also pours fuel onto the NT-versus-Unix debate. JohnMontgomery, who edits this column, neatly frames the issue this way: ``NTgets you from zero to 60 more easily than Unix, but you need Unix to getfrom 60 to 100.'' I agree. And now that I've experienced the power ofCitrix's Unix-like extensions, I'll never want to settle for vanilla NT.TOOLWATCHMicrosoft Paint(included with Windows 95)Microsoft Corp.(http://www.microsoft.com/)Not until I hit the road with a Windows 3.1 notebook and then needed totweak some icons for the site did I realize how dependent I've become onthe handy new bit-map-editing features of the Windows 95 version of Paint.Now if only it would read and write GIFsBOOKNOTEBuilding Internet Firewalls, $29.95by D.

Now comes the payoffwith the Pentium Pro. Intel's new chip delivers RISC-level performance andx86 compatibility, too.   The 150-MHz Pentium Pro is fast; our BYTEmark CPU test (32-bit code)shows its integer performance is 2.1 times that of a 90-MHz Pentium, andits floating-point performance is 2.6 times faster. The 200-MHz PentiumPro, announced after we completed these tests, should be as fast--or fasterthan--any RISC chip except Digital Equipment's 21164 Alpha. Intergraphplans to ship a 200-MHz version of its TDZ workstation before 1996, withprices $2500 higher per CPU than the 150-MHz models.   We tested the first Pentium Pro system, a $24,195 Intergraph TDZ-400with two 150-MHz Pentium Pro CPUs, 64 MB of RAM, a 2-GB SCSI hard drive,and a 21-inch monitor. The systems come with Windows NT 3.51, a PCI-bus GLZgraphics card, built-in Ethernet, PC Card slots, a quad-speed CD-ROM drive,and a keyboard with microphone and stereo speakers. The TDZ-300 has asingle Pentium Pro, the TDZ-400 has two, and the deskside TDZ-600 has four.The new models carry slightly higher prices than the old Pentium line(around $1000 more for comparable TDZ configurations with 150-MHz PentiumPros).   Our test configuration used Intergraph's newest 3-D card, the GLZ1T--aGLZ1 accelerator with an added texture-processing board. In addition to 12MB of video RAM (for double-buffered, 1152- by 864-pixel graphics with24-bit z-buffering), the card has 8 MB of memory for storing texture maps.It has the same $8000 price as the 24-MB GLZ2 we tested in the TDZ-40 (see``3-D Graphics Go Zoom,'' September BYTE). All GLZ cards support the OpenGL3-D API under NT.Exceeds Expectations   We were surprised by just how much the Pentium Pro boosted the TDZ-400's3-D graphics performance. The TDZ-400 ran the OpenGL PerformanceCharacterization Committee's Viewperf 3.0 test 2.5 to 13 times faster thanthe TDZ-40 with two 100-MHz Pentiums and ran the rendering tests withBentley Systems' MicroStation three to four times faster (not shown).   Based on the BYTEmark tests, the floating-point speed difference betweena 100-MHz Pentium and a 150-MHz Pentium Pro is 134 percent (2.3 times),while the GLZ1T's texture processing provides only a 15 percent boost(based on Intergraph's tests). Intergraph attributes the gain to thePentium Pro's floating-point speed, better memory architecture (i.e.,interleaving, an integrated L2 cache, and a more efficent CPU bus), andimproved OpenGL drivers for its GLZ cards. Intergraph's Mogle, amultithreading OpenGL driver for the MicroStation, provided a 5 percent to50 percent performance boost by putting both processors into play.   Intergraph cast its lot with promising standards: x86 compatibility,PCI, Windows NT, and OpenGL. For 3-D visual computing applications likemechanical CAD, it's a winning combination.Product InformationTDZ-400.......................$24,195(two 150-MHz Pentium Pros, 64 MB of RAM, GLZ1T 3-D graphics card, 2-GB harddrive, 21-inch monitor)Intergraph Computer SystemsHuntsville, AL(800) 763-0242(205) 730-5441http://www.intergraph.comCircle 1139 on Inquiry Card.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: Graph: 3-D Performance with Viewperf 3.0With two 150-MHz Pentium Pros, the TDZ-400 easily bests a TDZ-40.

The latesttriad--the Power Mac 7200, 7500, and 8500--come equipped with integratedaudio, video, networking, telephony, CD-ROM, conferencing, and speech. Asyou go higher in the line, the bundled support gets richer.   Perhaps the best pitch of all is the pricing. These Power Macs, withtheir healthy collection of built-in features and prices ranging from $1949(for the 90-MHz 7200 with 8 MB of RAM) to $4199 (for the 120-MHz 8500 with16 MB of RAM), will compete well against even the most aggressively pricedIntel-based machines.Common Denominators   All three Power Macs in this group share a remarkable number of similarfeatures. Even though some of the similarities are architectural (all havethree Peripheral Component Interconnect [PCI] slots, for example), most ofthem fulfill multimedia and communications requirements.   All models include stereo-audio input and output ports. The digital sideof the systems' audio-generation capabilities boasts 16 bits of resolutionand a sampling rate up to 44.1 kHz (CD-quality sound). On thecommunications side, all models include 10Base-T and AAUI-15 Ethernetconnectors. And all models include high-speed DMA serial ports, compatiblewith GeoPort telephony/fax hardware.   As usual, Apple paid close attention to the design of the boxesthemselves. For example, the 7200's top is held on by hidden latch releasesunder the front bezel. Release those, and the top slides off to reveal thepower supply, disk drives, and a hinged inner cover that holds the PCIcards in place. The memory slots are beneath the drive units--a positionthat at first appears impossible to get at without major disassembly. Butthe entire drive and power supply unit is also hinged, and it swings up toprovide easy access to any corner of the motherboard.   Of course, hardware is only part of the story. If there's Windowssoftware that you can't live without, all three models can run SoftWindowsfrom Insignia Systems. Both the 7500 and 8500 models' impressive softwarebundles include PlainTalk (the combined text-to-speech andspeech-recognition engine) and Apple Media Conference (a QuickTimeapplication that incorporates videoconferencing, whiteboard collaboration,and more).   We tested Media Conference by hooking a Power Mac 8500 to a 7500 across10Base-T Ethernet (see the screen on page 114). The video was jerky butusable, and we could relay messages and freehand sketches on the sharedwhiteboard. Unfortunately, application sharing is not supported, and theaudio quality was poor.Power Mac 7200   The low-end model of the series, the Power Mac 7200, houses a 75- or90-MHz PowerPC 601 processor. Memory starts at 8 MB, but you can expandthat to 256 MB. Similarly, a baseline 7200 houses only a 500-MB SCSI drive,but an internal expansion bay supports another SCSI device (and, remember,there's always the rear SCSI connector for external drives).   The 7200's graphics system is built around a 64-bit data path to thevideo memory (a standard feature on the other models as well), and you canexpand the baseline 1 MB of video memory to 4 MB for up to 1280- by1024-pixel resolution (or 1024 by 768 in 24-bit color).Power Mac 7500   Although the 7500 system we tested included a PowerPC 601 processorrunning at 100 MHz, you can upgrade the system to a 100-MHz 604 processorvia a swappable CPU daughtercard. (A 604 has a significant performanceadvantage over a similarly clocked 601, thanks to the 604's increasednumber of execution units and dynamic branch prediction.)   The chassis of the 7500 is virtually indistinguishable from that of the7200, and it shares the 7200's easy access to internals. However, the 7500incorporates hardware beyond that of the 7200, including an S-video inputconnector and an internal DAV (digital audio/video) connector that acceptsvideo compression/decompression cards. (The 7500 also has a composite videoinput.) The beefier processing power of the 7500 supports real-time videoplaythrough, as well as video capture (up to 320 by 240 pixels of NTSC at15 frames per second).Power Mac 8500   The 8500 is a desktop minitower design, as opposed to the``monitor-stand'' design of the 7500 and 7200. Inside beats the heart of aPowerPC 604 with a pulse rate of 120 MHz. You can upgrade the 8500's systemmemory from its base of 16 MB to a dizzying 512 MB.   While the 7500's composite and S-video connectors are input only, the8500 adds output connectors for both. The 8500 also supports videoplaythrough and capture. Capture rates for the 8500 are 25 fps with NTSC(but the documentation warns that you'll need a 2-GB hard drive for that).PowerPC Performance   The models that we received from Apple all had 256 KB of L2 cacheinstalled. The 7200 came with 16 MB of RAM and a 500-MB hard drive, whileboth the 7500 and 8500 had 24 MB of RAM and a 1-GB hard drive. We compiledthe BYTEmark native-mode benchmarks using version 7 of Metrowerks'CodeWarrior and ran them on each system, being careful to set 604instruction ordering on the 8500.   All three models performed well in the integer BYTEmark tests, but lessso in the floating-point tests. The 90-MHz 7200 turned in an integer indexof 1.05 and an FPU index of 0.64--what you might expect from a 90-MHzPentium with a throttled FPU. The 100-MHz 7500 scored 1.18 on the integertests and 0.71 on the FPU tests. The 120-MHz 604-based 8500 produced aninteger index of 2.1 and an FPU index of 1.4, putting its integer score ona par with that of a 150-MHz P6 system.The Attraction   These are desktop machines, not server boxes you'd want to hang drivesfrom and slide into a closet. For the price, all these systems provideexcellent performance, good expandability, and a generous serving ofprepackaged peripherals: CD-ROM, stereo audio, video ports, networkhardware, and so forth. The only people we'd advise against buying one ofthese Power Macs is anyone whose business involves a great deal ofnumber-crunching.   But for those looking for an easy-to-set-up home machine, or a workhorsemultimedia system for the office, these Power Macs can definitely do thejob.Product InformationPower Mac 7200................$1949(90-MHz 601 CPU with 8 MBof RAM and 500-MB hard drive)Power Mac 7500................$3099(100-MHz 601 CPU with 16 MBof RAM and 1-GB hard drive)Power Mac 8500................$4199(120-MHz 604 CPU with 16 MBof RAM and 1-GB hard drive)Apple Computer, Inc.Cupertino, CA(800) 776-2333(408) 996-1010fax: (408) 974-6412www.arborsoft.comCircle 1091 on Inquiry Card.THE SPECS                        7200            7500            8500CPU                     601             601 or 604      604MHz                     75 or 90        100             120Internal cache (KB)     32              32              32External cache          256 to 512 KB   256 KB to 1 MB  256 KBSystem memory (MB)      8 to 256        16 to 512       16 to 512Video memory (MB)       1 to 4          2 to 4          2 to 4Hard disk               500 MB          500 MB to 1 GB  1 to 2 GBIllustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: QuickTime Conferencing supports a sharedwhiteboard and videoconferencing over Ethernet.

The stakes are high for a company that has lost significantground in the workstation market to sexy systems from Hewlett-Packard andSilicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI). But with the Ultra's innovativepacket-switched crossbar and specialized Visual Instruction Set (VIS), Sunhas a strong hand to play. Although its benchmark numbers are nowhere nearthose of a Digital Equipment Alpha running Microsoft NT, the 170E easilyoutperforms everything else that runs the Solaris OS on a singleprocessor.   For this review, we tested the Ultra I Model 170E, the higher-end,167-MHz system with 64 MB of RAM standard. The less elaborate Model 140hosts a 143-MHz UltraSparc processor and includes a standard 32 MB of RAM(see the table ``Sun Specifications'' at right for a list of standardfeatures for both models).   Both systems are enclosed in the same compact chassis, about the size ofa deep-dish pizza box (16 by 17 by 4 inches), and both models support twoRS-423/RS-232 connectors, a parallel port, a CD-ROM drive, and a 3 1/2-inchfloppy drive. Sun had not finalized pricing at press time, but the Model170E will list for under $30,000; the Model 140 will come in under$20,000.By the Numbers   According to our benchmark testing, the 167-MHz Ultra 170E performs atroughly 1.8 times the speed of a 90-MHz Pentium. But because the BYTEmarktest suite does not take advantage of the UltraSparc's specializedinstruction set, the benchmark results do not tell the whole story. And youreally need a shared-memory multiprocessor system to fully appreciate thenew UltraSparc Port Architecture (UPA), a distributed-arbitrationmultimaster crossbar (see the Technology Focus box for details).   When we ran real-world applications--applying special-effect filters tolarge graphics images, rendering complex texture maps, and displayinghigh-motion MPEG video clips--the performance advantages of the UltraSparcarchitecure became obvious. The 64-bit VIS versions of these kinds ofgraphics and video applications will realize another order-of-magnitudeboost in performance. Even without software recompilation, the Ultra Idelivers an extremely fast platform for graphics applications.UltraGraphics   The UltraSparc processor includes a set of dedicated single-cycleinstructions to enhance performance. VIS dramatically cuts the number ofclock cycles required for graphical and video operations.   For example, VIS includes an array operation for slicing 3-D volumetricdata. This operation, accomplished with a single UltraSparc instruction,typically requires 24 instructions, according to Sun. Other specializedone-cycle instructions support such operations as conversion instructionsfor packing and expanding pixel data, arithmetic instructions formanipulating large graphics images, and fixed-point compare instructionsfor examining the z-buffer during 3-D rendering.   The UltraSparc uses two sets of registers to process graphical commands:The integer registers crunch address calculations for the image data, whilethe floating-point registers handle manipulation of the image data. Thisdivision of labor deploys the maximum number of registers and augmentsinstruction parallelism.   The UltraSparc also supports a wide range of video-compressionalgorithms, including H.261 (the standard compression algorithm for H.320videoconferencing), MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, and JPEG. Again, the UltraSparcsupports specific functions for motion estimation, the most commonoperation used for video compression. The result is outstandingfull-motion, full-screen video playback without any externalvideo-acceleration hardware (see the table ``Features of the Ultra I'' formore of the processor's features).   The Ultra graphics board does not have special-purpose 3-D graphicsengines, such as you would find in SGI systems. But the 24-bit RAMDAC andframe-buffer controllers, combined with VIS operations and UPA datatransfers, generate the kind of 3-D effects that you would expect to seeonly on high-end 3-D boards, such as the SGI Reality Engine. We createdsmooth fly-throughs of complex 3-D objects with Gouraud shading, lighting,depth cueing, and even texture mapping.   Of course, your applications can't tap the Ultra's graphics enhancementsuntil the specific 3-D modeling libraries are compiled and linked for theUltra architecture. But all your UltraSparc-based systems will benefit onceyou've made that initial investment. With workstations that supportdedicated 3-D processors, you have to budget for that specialized 3-Dhardware each time you invest in a new system.Long Life and Good Fortune   With regard to raw number crunching, Ultras may not be peers to Alphas.But when evaluated as graphics workstations rath-er than as computeservers, these systems have no peer in price/performance.   With applications that take advantage of the VIS instructions, such asCAD and Photoshop, the Sun Ultra I Creator3D Model 170E performs well aboveany other single-processor workstation currently available.Product InformationSun Ultra I Model 140.........less than $20,000Sun Ultra I Creator3DModel 170E....................less than $30,000Sun Microsystems Computer Co.Mountain View, CA(415) 960-1300fax: (415) 969-9131Circle 1044 on Inquiry Card.Sun SpecificationsModel 140                       Model 170E143-MHz UltraSparc              167-MHz UltraSparc32-MB RAM                       64-MB RAM1-GB hard drive                 2-GB hard drive17-inch color monitor           20-inch color monitor10-Mbps Ethernet                10- and 100-Mbps Ethernet10-MBps SCSI                    20-MBps fast and wide SCSIThree Sbus expansion slots      Two Sbus expansion slotsTurboGX graphics                UltraSparc graphicsLess than $20,000               Less than $30,000FEATURES OF THE ULTRA I-- 64-bit address pointers-- Specialized Visual Instruction Set-- Branch prediction-- Four-way superscalar design with nine execution units-- 16-Kb data cache; 16-Kb instruction cache-- Integrated second-level cache controller-- 128 data lines to packet-switched crossbar-- 3.3-V operationIllustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: Graph: Raw Performance: The VIS-less Ultra ISun's Ultra I Model 170 lags behind the PowerPC, and far behind the 266-MHzAlpha, but the BYTEmark test suite does not tap the Ultra's most compellingperformance technologies: the Visual Instruction Set (VIS) and thepacket-switched crossbar bus.Photograph(s):Photograph: Photograph: Sun's Ultra I Creator3D Model 170E (top) with its64-bit UltraSparc (inset)About the Author(s):Ben Smith is a Unix and IP networking consultant with the firm Ronin Housein Peterborough, New Hampshire.

Casein point: Hewlett-Packard's new LaserJet 5Si MX. It's fast, and it comeswith some great features for printing on the LAN. The 5Si MX's print-enginespeed is 24 pages per minute (ppm). Its predecessor, the 4Si MX, has a17-ppm engine. The 5Si MX holds 1100 sheets of paper, can handle 11- by17-inch paper, and comes with bidirectional management software. Thissoftware supports real-time monitoring and control of the printer byadministrators as well as users. All this for $400 less than the 4Si MX.   We tested the LaserJet 5Si MX on a mixed NetWare 3.1 network with Macsand Windows-based PCs. We ran NSTL's network-printer benchmarks andcompared the results to other recently tested network printers (see ``12Network Printers Set the Pace,'' November 1995 BYTE). Our testing revealedthat although the new LaserJet didn't have the highest numbers in any onecategory, it consistently ran near the top in all categories (speed, printquality, features, and usability). As a result, the LaserJet 5Si MXproduced an overall score higher than any printer in that group.   The 5Si MX has a slightly improved print-quality score over the 4Si MX(both are 600-dpi printers) but ranks considerably higher in features,usability, and speed. HP's new LaserJet is fastest in its price class. Infact, it's competitive with the more expensive 30- to 32-ppm printers,although its 100,000-page monthly duty cycle is still only half as high.   Options include a 2000-sheet input tray ($1299), a mailbox with eight100-sheet bins ($1889) for separating print jobs, a duplexing unit ($669),and an envelope feeder ($549).   If you don't need a direct network connection and PostScript, you canconsider the LaserJet 5Si (no MX) for $3499. It lacks the MX's 350-KBpsJetDirect Ethernet/Local Talk card and PostScript SIMM, and it has 4 MB ofRAM instead of 12 MB.Cool Software   HP has upgraded the JetAdmin software so that it now provides easynetwork configuration and management, including installing printer driversfor users over the network. With bidirectional printer communications, youcan now track print jobs over the LAN in real time, getting such details aswhere the job is in the queue, how much of the job is complete, or where itwill be output.   Bidirectional drivers adjust to configuration changes automatically, soyou always know what type of paper is in each of the 5Si's size- andcapacity-sensing trays. With easy configuration, slick software interface,and neat new features like booklet printing and gray-scale watermarks, thisprinter is fun to use. If you're looking for a faster network printer thatwon't keep you from balancing that budget, check out the 5Si MX. It's thebest in its class.NEW AND IMPROVEDThe LaserJet 5Si MX beats the 4Si MX in every way. We derived scores usingNSTL test and evaluation methodology.

Ideally, it adjuststhe patterns for perspective and surface shading. More capable workstationskeep texture maps readily available in dedicated memory within the graphicssubsystem. Texture mapping can then move quickly into a rendered imagewithout bogging down the host system. Several of Intergraph's GLZ graphicscards, for example, store 8 or 32 MB of texture data and pipe it to theimage midway through the rendering process via a 64-bit, 256-MBps graphicsbus.   Though fast, dedicated texture memory is costly and limits image sizefor some applications. Storing texture data in system memory extendstexture storage. Using OpenGL texture-object extensions, Intergraph'stexture-processing hardware can store large texture maps in system memoryand use the dedicated texture memory as a cache, moving data between thetwo areas over the relatively fast Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)bus.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. PLAINTALKThe recognition engine inside PlainTalk (which is bundled with the PowerMac 7500 and 8500) gets better all the time. We ran some informalexperiments on it, testing its recognition tolerance. Even if we used fakeItalian, fake Russian, or genuine Southern American accents, PlainTalkcorrectly identified its commands.   The recognition engine is based on phones, context-sensitive rudimentarysounds used in speech. (These rudimentary sounds are known as phonemes.)Phones are context-sensitive in the sense of their phonetic usage. Hence,the t in truck is one phone, while the t in bottle is a different phone.   PlainTalk's phones are speaker independent. They are the composite of500 speakers from North America, which has the effect of eliminating theinfluence of accents. If our contrived Italian and Russian accent testswere any indication, PlainTalk's recognition engine apparently works betterthan its designers anticipated.Photograph(s):Photograph: Photograph: The AudioVision 14 display supports an internalmicrophone and speakers.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. THE CROSSBAR: AN END TO INTERRUPTSThe Ultra uses a packet-switched crossbar instead of the more traditionalinterrupt-driven bus. This design cross-connects many different subordinatebuses of varying widths and speeds.   Conceptually, it's a multiplexed bus (i.e., multiple data transfersoccur simultaneously). In an interrupt- or control-line bus, only twodevices can communicate in one direction at one time. All other devices orsubordinate buses must wait until the bus controller handles theirrequests. This design works well for single processors and single-tasking(or cooperative multitasking) OSes, but it does not work well formultiprocessor systems with intelligent subordinate systems.   The packet-switched crossbar passes data from subsystem to subsystem via18 small chips located near the memory bus on the motherboard. Eachconnection to the crossbar supports its own buffering and can handledifferent subordinate bus speeds and widths.   The 64-byte cache size determines the size of the packets (the basicelement of transfer data). A 128-bit-wide subordinate bus will not degradeto four fetches of 32 bits each just because the subordinate bus at theother end of the switch is only 32 bits wide. The 32-bit circuit may takefour clock cycles to load its data, but the 128-bit circuit still consumesthe data in a single clock.   While the smaller data path is loading (or unloading), the wider channelcan service other transfers. For that matter, other subsystems can carry oncommunications even while data is moving between the first two. Thepacket-switched crossbar solves the problem of bus contention as well asthe inefficiencies of connecting at varying data widths and speeds.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: The UPA DifferenceCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. MIB MAKES LIFE EASIER FOR LAN MANAGERSBy:SUSAN COLWELLThe LaserJet 5Si MX is one of the first printers to support the standardSNMP management information base (MIB) for printers. To provideadministrators with a consistent means of managing LAN printers, thePrinter Working Group developed, and the Internet Engineering Task Forceaccepted, the standard MIB in mid-1995.   The standard MIB means that each printer will store status informationand respond to SNMP requests in a consistent manner through its SNMP agentsoftware. In the case of the LaserJet 5Si MX, the SNMP agent resides in theupgradable firmware of the printer's JetDirect network card. The agentsoftware monitors network traffic directed at the printer, filters out SNMPcommands, and returns or sets values stored in the printer MIB to monitorstatus or change printer configuration.   To provide better response (asynchronous) to SNMP and other managementsoftware, HP changed the LaserJet 5Si multifunction I/O port, creating aseparate channel for printer management (a datagram service). As a result,you can still control the printer while it is receiving printdata--canceling a print job before it finishes, for example.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. WEB SITES: DON'T BLINKFrom your mind to the Web--it's frightfully easy to build an on-linebusiness. The only dangers: Timidity. Planning. Meetings.By:Raphael NeedlemanI am in my office at BYTE's headquarters talking to my boss, publisher DaveEgan. He is asking me about the Internet, about this site and that service,grilling me with rapid-fire questions that are making it obvious to me thateven my best efforts to keep up with the state of the 'net are not enough.Question, answer, question, answer. Finally I get frustrated and say, ``Idon't know! I can't keep up!'' I put my head down on my desk. And Dave saysto me, ``My boy,'' (Dave really talks like that when he thinks he knowssomething you don't), ``My boy, that is the definition of opportunity.''   I hate to say it (and I never will to Dave), but he is right. On theInternet, business can transcend the physical world. Building equipment andmailing reports gives way to simply posting bits on-line, and the basicrules of commerce change dramatically. Have an idea? From your mind to the'net--it's that simple. No factories, no offices, no heavy start-up costsrequired. Take your idea, put it on-line, and see if it sticks.   Some Web business ideas are lousy, of course. In fact, like mostsmall-business ventures, the majority of Web concepts will fail. But youdon't know until you try. We recently discovered, however, that there isone way to guarantee the failure of an on-line venture: Wait on it.   True story: We had a great idea. It was unique; it was hot. So we hadmeetings, we drew up plans, we drafted proposals. Because we first wantedto plan it perfectly, we did not build it. But by the time we were ready toget moving, somebody else had come up with the same idea and implementedit. We lost.   We learned from that experience and have applied that knowledge to ourcurrent on-line venture, our Web presence. The BYTE Site (www.byte.com)changes daily. Sometimes the changes are subtle.   In 1 hour, I watched our Webmeister, Jon Udell, implement and refine atotally new interface on our search results page. He created a navigationaltool for lists that, in its broadest sense, is similar to a tabbed dialogbox--you really have to see it yourself to understand how well it works.   Sometimes the changes are dramatic, as they are once a month when wepost selected stories from the latest issue for all the world to see. Andevery now and then, we clean house completely, as we did in November, andtotally revamp and redesign the site.   But the point is, we've learned. Jon doesn't seek endless planningmeetings before he improves the site. He just does it. The only limit toour site's improvements is the speed at which we can think.   And here's what we've thought up: It's called the Virtual Press Room.Jon has been writing about this application for a few months in his monthlyfeature, the Network Project. Briefly, VPR is an application running on ourWeb server that lets people in the computer industry--the people who sendus baskets of paper press releases every day--submit their releases to uselectronically. The concept is simple: A vendor logs on to the VPR andpastes the press release into an on-line form.   Once that is done, a program running on our server full-text-indexes therelease and puts it in the database. Any of our editors, including those onthe road and in our satellite offices, can scan for releases by company,product, technology area, and date.   If you've visited the BYTE Site, you know that we already have two yearsof BYTE magazine archived and fully searchable. We now index press releasesalongside our archive, so when you look for articles on a topic, you havethe option of also seeing the vendor-supplied press releases relevant toyour search. We think it's a pretty cool implementation of a simple butpowerful idea.   But the important point is that we got this thing up and running quicklyand cleanly, without a lot of fuss, because we have a smart guy who likestinkering with the Web and who understands the business of BYTE's editorialdepartment. Jon will be changing and updating the BYTE Site, and the VPRcomponent of it, frequently. Fortunately, because the application runscompletely on our site, we won't have to send out masses of update disks toall the people who regularly use it. We'll just improve the product as wego. So don't blink.About the Author(s):RAPHAEL NEEDLEMAN, EDITOR IN CHIEF(rafe@well.com)Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. SELF-SERVE INFORMATIONFax-on-demand delivers Touch-Tone access to timely news and data.Long-term, it can save labor and marketing costs.By:DAVID ESSEX AND STEVEN J. VAUGHAN-NICHOLSI'll fax it right over,'' you say, and thus begins a solid 20 minutes ofwasted time: Find the document, stand in the fax line, dial the wrong faxnumber, find the right one, stand in the line again, send the fax, go backto your desk, and take the inevitable call: ``Could you fax that again? Our machine ate the last page.''   There is a better way. It's called fax on demand (FOD), and it appliesto a number of new products that enable callers to request faxes directlyfrom your fax server. No matter what your business, if you get a lot ofcalls requesting printed information, you should consider FOD.   FOD systems deliver documents stored in a dedicated repository (and,occasionally, corporate data that isn't normally stored in faxable formats,such as PCX and TIFF). Callers can dial in from their fax machine's handsetand get documents returned during the same call, saving phone costs for thesender. More typically, they choose documents and enter the fax numberusing a Touch-Tone phone. The FOD system then transmits the requesteddocuments on a separate line.   FOD systems for in-house use are often sold in turnkey form, withpreconfigured voice and fax boards already installed in a computer. You canalso put one together using Visual Basic-like development toolkits. Welooked at DOS-/Windows-based software that is also available in kit form(i.e., the software vendor also sells voice and fax boards).FOD Facts   Conceptually, FOD systems are simple. The voice board receives DTMFtones generated by the caller's handset and passes them to the FODsoftware, which reads and plays back the appropriate voice messages storedon the PC's hard drive. (None of the reviewed programs accepts pulses fromrotary dialers.) When the caller identifies a specific document, the FODsoftware loads it and sends it to the fax board for transmission. The faxboard then transmits the document to the phone number specified by thecaller.   To put the four FOD systems we tested on equal footing, we ran all ourtests on an IBM PS/1 57C, a 33-/66-MHz 486DX2 system with 700 MB of diskspace and 16 MB of RAM. The machine was equipped with a one-line DialogicD/41D voice card and a one-line GammaLink GammaFax CPi/100 fax card (IbexTechnologies' FactsLine required a second Dialogic board). Two outgoing faxlines is a more typical setup, but little is gained by testing the secondline, since the relevant queuing issues exist on a one-line system.   To flood the system with requests, we made three calls in rapidsuccession, requesting two one-page documents during each call. We measuredfax-throughput times for each pair of document transmissions and thenaveraged the results. We sent all faxes to the same machine, a Ricoh RF860. VP Express was slightly faster than the other programs at transmittingfaxes held in a queue, but the difference in performance among thesesolutions was negligible.   All four programs have some features in common. For starters, each isbest run on a dedicated machine. Even in these days of gigabyte-capacitydrives, disk-space requirements alone make putting FOD software on a user'sPC unrealistic. Also, FOD software doesn't get along well with otherprograms. Almost all these programs specifically discourage the use ofmemory management software, and with good reason: They don't work well--ifat all--with a memory manager loaded.   None of these programs is easy to install. Be ready to spend at leasttwo days shaking out all the software conflicts and putting together adecent voice-menu tree. Once our installation wars were over with, though,each program performed well. All worked with the basic file formatstypically used in faxing--PCX, TIFF, and ASCII--without any trouble. Eachalso proved reliable in the face of disconnections and other failures.Copia International's FaxFacts   All these programs were troublesome to install, but CopiaInternational's FaxFacts 5.0, which requires you to make directories in DOSand manually invoke the installation routine for each program disk, tookthe installation-complexity prize. Once in place, however, this MS-DOSprogram worked well.   FaxFacts comes with a Windows interface, but it limits you to printingand viewing faxes and playing back voice messages. All the real actionhappens from the program's MS-DOS interface.   In our tests, we found FaxFacts to be a solid, reliable performer. Forexample, you can call from one phone and have FaxFacts send a documentwhile you're still on the line. Still, if you want to make significantchanges to your setup, such as add-ing new menu items, you need to bringthe program down.   FaxFacts also does a decent job of tracking its work, saving daily datainto dBase DBF-compatible files. However, to generate the best reports, youmight need to buy a dBase-compatible report writer. We found FaxFacts'reporting module to be insufficiently detailed for serious data tracking.   The program supports broadcast faxes using ASCII mail-merge lists. Whileit would be better if FaxFacts could work directly with data from apersonal information manager (PIM), this is still a handy feature.Particularly noteworthy is the fact that it can fax directly from an ASCIIfile.   FaxFacts requires relatively few system resources, as FOD programs go.You can run it on as little as a 386SX, but we don't recommend using thecomputer for anything else.Ibex's FactsLine for Windows   Ibex Technologies' FactsLine for Windows 2.0 is by far the simplest ofthese four programs to install. Unlike the others, it uses a standardWindows installation routine. The Windows interface makes it far easier toconfigure than the other programs, which require you to fight your waythrough scripting languages to call data from a database or to change themenu tree. With FactsLine, these jobs are a breeze. You can automaticallyturn off menu items leading to old documents, and FactsLine lets youreconfigure the system, and even update the voice-menu tree and documents,while you're on-line.   As you might expect, FactsLine, with its dBase databases and Windowsinterface, comes with a variety of easily accessible reports. These reportscan be displayed on-screen, printed, or (which we were amused to find)faxed.   But all this comes at the cost of system resources. You won't want torun FactsLine on anything less than a 33-MHz 486DX with 8 MB of RAM. Moreof both, as always, would be better.   When all is said and done, though, FactsLine is the best of the group.It costs more--in addition to its heftier system requirements, it uses aminimum of two voice boards--but you'll find its ease of use, flexibility,and reporting power to be worth the extra expense. Highly recommended.Nuntius's CommandFax   Nuntius's CommandFax 3.5 handles all the usual FOD jobs (e.g., sendingrequested faxes on the same call or via a return call) with aplomb. That'sa good thing, because getting CommandFax to that point can be a pain. Whilethere should be a Windows version of CommandFax out by the time you readthis, the DOS version we tested will have you manually tweakingconfiguration files before you're done.   CommandFax is also the most demanding of these four programs when itcomes to system resources. For example, it won't work well with anyexpanded-memory manager (according to the documentation), but it requiresat least 1 MB of expanded memory. For people with old LIM expanded-memoryboards, that's fine, but others will be left in a quandary.   CommandFax's reporting tools are nonexistent. While the program keepscopious logs in dBase format with FoxPro-compatible indexes, you'll needanother program to make sense of the data.   That said, CommandFax has a pair of shining virtues that may make it thebest choice for some users. Unlike the other programs, CommandFax can usenetwork fax servers for its outgoing faxes (Telephone Response Technologyhas a higher-end product that does this, too), and LAN users can send outfaxes via the program's fax card. CommandFax manages this remarkable featby using Intel and DCA Communications' Communicating ApplicationSpecification (CAS). This additional capacity makes CommandFax an idealchoice for any office that needs to send ready-made and impromptu faxesalike to a large number of customers.Telephone Response Technologies' VP Express   VP Express (VPX) 1.1 is a good middle-of-the-road product. While itdoesn't have all the virtues of FactsLine, in our testing it was marginallythe fastest at handling an overload of fax calls. VPX is alsostraightforward to install and maintain--if you can keep an eye on it.While the program has the simplest Windows interface of the group, some ofits setup query boxes aren't what they appear to be. The menus don'tspecify what will happen when you try certain buttons and other menuchoices.   Although the manual says you need a 75-MHz or faster computer for decentperformance, we found that VPX actually ran better than its competition onour supposedly suboptimal 33-/66-MHz 486DX2 system. VPX is also veryflexible at handling incoming lines. While CommandFax and FaxFacts mighthave you negotiating arcane commands for each line, VPX has one easy-to-usewindow display that makes managing separate lines simple.   Unlike the other programs, VPX can be expanded into separate fax andvoice-mail systems. While full-featured voice mail is separately priced($395), small offices looking for a catch-all solution might prefer VPXover the other programs.   VPX also has adequate reporting capabilities. But if you want to workover the numbers to see what your customers are up to, you need separateDBMS or reporting software. All told, we still prefer Ibex's FactsLine forits fast installation and superior ease of use.Product InformationCommandFax 3.5................$800(per line, up to four lines; $400 per multiline port thereafter)Nuntius Corp.St. Louis, MO(314) 968-1009fax: (314) 968-3163fax on demand: (314) 776-7076Circle 1092 on Inquiry Card.FactsLine for Windows 2.0.....$4790 and upIbex Technologies, Inc.El Dorado Hills, CA(800) 289-9998(916) 939-8888fax: (916) 939-8899fax on demand: (916) 939-8875Circle 1093 on Inquiry Card.FaxFacts 5.0..................$3800(two lines each for fax and voice)Copia International, Ltd.Wheaton, IL(800) 689-8898(708) 682-8898fax: (708) 665-9841fax on demand: (708) 924-3030Circle 1094 on Inquiry Card.VP Express 1.1................$1295 (introductory)(eight lines voice; 10 lines fax)Telephone Response Technologies, Inc.Roseville, CA(800) 878-3947(916) 784-7777fax: (916) 784-7781fax on demand: (916) 784-7004trtsales@trt.comhttp://www.trt.comCircle 1095 on Inquiry Card.DialogicParsippany, NJ(201) 993-3000fax: (201) 993-3093Circle 1096 on Inquiry Card.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: What's on the Menu?Fax-on-demand programs use printed flowcharts to explain voice-menu trees,but, disappointingly, they don't provide programmable, on-screen versions.The chart above shows the tree programmed on all four FOD products duringtesting.Illustration: Table: FOD FEATURES COMPARED (This table is not availableelectronically.

ARMOUR VAN HORNOn the heels of the office-suite successes (and Microsoft's apparent TKO),graphics heavyweights Corel and Micrografx now battle for the Windows 95graphics market. Both companies tout the obvious advantages of buying agraphics suite from one vendor: a comprehensive one-buy solution, smoothintegration across modules, one-stop support, and a discounted overallprice.   But we think the two products will attract different markets. WhileCorelDraw 6 will appeal to current Corel shops and other graphicsprofessionals, the Micrografx ABC Graphics Suite targets the generalbusinessperson's graphics-production needs by skillfully wrapping thecompany's most popular graphics applications in a MicrosoftOffice-compatible interface.Big, Fat Graphics   Also in the spirit of the office suites, these bundles are huge andungainly. The basic installation of CorelDraw 6 takes a whopping 180 MB.The ABC Graphics Suite fills about 85 MB. You can run CorelDraw from aCD-ROM, but it still requires up to 32 MB of hard disk space. When we ranthe Corel applications from a double-speed CD-ROM, performance wasunacceptably slow, even on a 60-MHz Pentium system.   We also had problems installing from some CD-ROM drives. Information onCorel's World Wide Web site blamed real-mode CD-ROM drivers. Older systemsmight also experience problems with scanners, drawing tablets, video cards,and other hardware not specifically supported by Windows 95 drivers. Thestability of drawing-tablet drivers was so poor at the release of Windows95 that Micrografx chose not to support any pressure-sensitive tablets withthis version, even though earlier versions supported them.   For all practical purposes, these suites need Pentium systems with 16 MBof RAM and a 1-GB or larger hard drive. It's time to bite the Windows 95resource bullet.   If you've got the hardware, though, these suites are significantlyimproved for Windows 95, with judicious right-click menus, drag-and-dropsupport, long filenames, multithreading, and OLE 2.0. This type offunctionality, as well as upcoming Windows 95 software, such as PageMaker6, should let Windows 95 (or, better yet, Windows NT, which can host bothof these graphics suites) compete with the Mac for the professionalgraphics market.   But unlike the office-suite market, graphics shops have not embraced thesingle-bundle philosophy. The graphics market has responded well tospecialized niche products from Adobe, Macromedia, and Quark. Nor does thismarket show any signs of becoming Windows-only. Adobe Illustrator,PageMaker, Photoshop, and Macromedia FreeHand are clearly committed to bothWindows and Mac platforms. Corel and Micrografx remain specific toWindows.The Reigning Sumo Champ   Corel has removed Ventura Publisher from the CorelDraw package but, asusual, has added lots of new stuff. The problem for Corel has always beenintegrating new modules into a consistent whole. The company has madestrides in this area, especially with PhotoPaint, but the overall suitestill feels somewhat cobbled together.   Corel has made some features, such as layer control in CorelDraw, easierto use by bringing more functions to the first level of a roll-up menu. Butoverall, the applications are hard to learn and use unless you're aseasoned CorelDraw designer.   Dedicated Corel shops should appreciate the upgrade. The newapplications are impressive, especially when it comes to 3-D illustration.Corel Dream 3-D, a Windows 95 port from RayDream Designer for Windows andthe Mac, is a high-end tool for 3-D modeling and rendering.   If you're familiar with 3-D design (and especially if you've usedRayDream Designer before), you'll be immediately productive with CorelDream 3-D. Another new application, Corel Motion 3-D, animates your 3-Dmodels. The Micrografx Instant 3-D application generates slick texteffects, but the ABC suite does not support 3-D modeling.   The new Corel Presents module supports a full range of multimediaelements, including sound, video, and transitional effects. Corel alsobundles an excellent screen-capture applet, a module that the ABC GraphicsSuite needs and lacks.   Corel's inclusion of professional illustration tools infuses the bundlewith high-end functionality that you simply won't get from the ABC suite.But if you're looking for a general-business graphics solution, CorelDrawis overkill.Sumo Business Graphics   Micrografx has pulled together a focused graphics suite for themainstream office. When installing the suite, you can include Micrografxicons on the toolbar of Microsoft Office applications. When you click onthe Micrografx icons from within either Word or Excel, you end up in an OLEframe, with the launched application activated.   Picture Publisher and Designer (but, sadly, not FlowCharter) work withinthe new Office Binder. The Binder requires plenty of resources toefficiently handle a large set of integrated files, but if you've got afast Pentium system, it's a convenient way to manage work projects.   Neither Corel PhotoPaint nor Micrografx Picture Publisher can match thefull functionality of Adobe Photoshop, but with either of these suites youget a powerful image editor. Picture Publisher shows off its Windows 95architecture with a task window that displays multithreading in action andwith its support of Kodak's 32-bit Precision Color Management System.Meanwhile, Designer has moved closer to the professional power of CorelDrawby now handling up to 32,000 layers, matching CorelDraw's placementprecision of 1 micron, and making Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) its nativeformat.The Suite Choice   CorelDraw 6 has more-powerful applications for the graphicsprofessional. But if you want an easy-to-use set of graphics tools for theoffice (and Office) user, the ABC Graphics Suite is the better choice.Product InformationCorelDraw 6...................$695/$249 upgradeCorel Corp.Ottawa, Ontario, Canada(613) 728-3733fax: (613) 761-9176www.corel.comCircle 1140 on Inquiry Card.Micrografx ABC GraphicsSuite.........................$299/$149 upgradeMicrografxRichardson, TX(214) 234-1769fax: (214) 994-6227www.micrografx.comCircle 1141 on Inquiry Card.WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

Signal Computing System Architecture(SCSA), a standard that's supported by a wide range of CTI vendors, definesa modular architecture for seamlessly integrating computer-basedapplications with diverse telephony hardware.   SCSA includes both a software and a hardware specification. The SCSATelephony Application Object (TAO) Framework and the SCSA Hardware Modelare independent. The TAO works over a variety of hardware models, includingproprietary devices, by implementing a switch-fabric controller. Thiscontroller, specific to the underlying hardware, receives resource requestsfrom TAO and translates the request to the specific hardware interface.   The Service Provider Interface (SPI) sits on top of thehardware-specific switch-fabric controllers, providing developers with aconsistent interface to different vendors' hardware devices and softwarecomponents. The SPI enables different hardware and softwarecomputer-telephony modules to interoperate seamlessly.   The application worries only about the abstract telephony features itneeds from the system, instead of the specific hardware devices thatsupport those features. This design delivers resource and locationindependence to the application. When an application requests a particularset of features (e.g., a text-to-speech component and a fax line), SCSAcreates a group of resources that can service the request.   Such a group can contain one or many physical resources. SCSA managesthe resources for the application, in effect pooling a diverse set ofphysical devices into a single, customized system. Once a call or otherapplication event is over, the functional group is destroyed and thephysical resources become immediately available to other applications.   Simple fax-on-demand solutions, such as those reviewed here, don'trequire the rich functionality enabled by SCSA. But vendors such as Copiaand Telephone Response Technologies rely on SCSA to integrate higher-endresources (e.g., speech recognition or conferencing) and to negotiatecomplex switching across multiple lines.   The final result: a portable, cross-platform, hardware-independentarchitecture for CTI.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: The SPI provides a consistent interface betweentelephony hardware and software.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. NATIVE TRANSFERA Windows graphics suite must handle large data files and distribute themacross multiple application modules. In the past, the challenge has been intransferring these large data sets without bogging down the system. OLE2.0's Uniform Data Transfer technology makes this process more efficient.   Before OLE 2.0, applications used global memory as the medium of datatransfer, and a Clipboard format (e.g., CFXT or CFTMAP) to describe thedata. Different transfers (OLE 1.0, DDE, the Clipboard, or drag and drop)required different protocols and API functions. Under OLE 2.0, a pointer istransferred from the data source to the data recipient. The data objectitself then determines a standardized format for the transfer.   When you select a data object and drag it out of its source, thedestination OLE container supports two data types--the Native Format andthe Presentation Format--each of which might contain several additionalcomponents. The Native Format can be almost anything. Corel applicationsuse the Corel Metafile Exchange (*.CMX) format, introduced as the clip-artformat with CorelDraw 5. The Presentation Format includes elementspreviously supported by the Windows Clipboard (Device-Dependent Bitmap,Windows Metafile, Rich Text, and text), along with two new formats forWindows 95: Device Independent Bitmap and Extended Metafile.   When a client application accepts a data object, it selects the formatof the highest quality. If the program is privy to the Native Format (whichis likely if the client and server are from the same vendor), there's noneed to revert to a less accurate format for the transfer.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. 20 BIG-PICTURE MONITORSNSTL evaluates the best large-screen monitors for today's highly graphicalapplicationsBy:CHANDRIKA MYSOREOnce you've experienced a big screen, it's really hard to return to a15-inch box. Becoming less of a luxury, a 21-inch monitor can support 1600-by 1200-pixel resolutions, a Plug and Play (PnP) architecture, and slicksoftware controls. Power users will appreciate running multipleapplications on the desktop. Graphics designers, CAD engineers, desktoppublishers, and heavy-duty spreadsheet junkies absolutely require a large,high-resolution tube for mission-critical work. We tested 21-inch monitors(and 20-inch ones from Apple, IBM, and Tatung) to find the best overallmodel, the model with the highest-quality display, and the best overalldeal on the market.   Out of the 20 monitors, 10 use the Hitachi picture tube, five use theMatsushita picture tube, and the other five use tubes from Sony,Mitsubishi, or NEC. We tested the monitors under Windows 95. Some of themwere too new to support specific drivers for Windows 95. Thanks to the PnPavailability, Windows 95 configured the PnP monitors on the fly. For themonitors that did not support PnP, we configured them in 1280- by1024-pixel SVGA resolution.   With an average dot pitch of 0.26 mm, the text appears crisp and clearon the screen. The maximum vertical refresh rate was 97 Hz at 1280- by1024-pixel resolution and 82 Hz at 1600- by 1280-pixel resolution. At thesehigh refresh rates, the display is absolutely flicker-free.   These neat features, however, come with a huge price tag. Themost-expensive monitor we tested was Nanao USA's Flexscan FX2-21 ($3499),and the least expensive was Smile International's CA2111 ($1780). In thisroundup, the average price is $2255. (In our last report, the average pricewas $2243.)   You'll need a strong back to lift these behemoths and a large work area;the average weight is 74 pounds, and they take up voluminous desk space.The Philips Magnavox CM2137 consumed the least power at 110 W, and the NECMultisync XP21 the highest at 197 W. Fortunately, all the monitors wetested, except for the Daytek DT-2102M, are Energy Star-compliant, so theyconsume less than 30 W in idle mode; and with VESA Display Power ManagementSignaling (DPMS) compliance, the internal power management system kicks in(consuming less than 30 W of power) when the monitor is idle. If themonitor is in idle mode for a long time, the VESA DPMS will put the unit insleep mode, consuming less than 8 W of power.   The IBM P201, Nanao Flexscan FX2-21, Nokia Multigraph 445X, and thePhilips Magnavox CM21BA cost more than the rest of the products tested herefor a reason; they have higher bandwidths (up to 250 MHz) compared tolow-priced products at around 130 MHz and thus provide higher verticalrefresh rates (close to 85 Hz) at higher (1600- by 1200-pixel) resolutions.Because we tested all the monitors in 1280- by 1024-pixel resolution, wedid not evaluate these four monitors at these high refresh rates. Weconsider them to be in a class of their own, offering a higher usableresolution that is worth the price for those who need it.How to use this guide   Our overall score for the best color monitor is based on theweighted-average results from quality tests and usability and featuresevaluation. The quality tests are executed using the NSTL-developedsoftware tools, Klein gauge, power meter, luminometer, and eyepiece. Thebest-overall and low-cost winners are based on overall performance scores.The high-quality winners are based on the quality scores.If this column is checked, the monitors are shipped with software controlsto adjust the display orientation. Press a menu button on the front panel,and the control menu pops up on the screen.The prices listed here are the manufacturer's suggested retail price(MSRP). Street prices will be lower.The viewable size is the diagonal measurement of the maximum display area.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: A Look at the Big PicturePOWER MODULEIncludes the power supply for the monitor with integrated power managementcircuitry. When the power-saving feature is forced, the power consumptionis less than 8 W in idle state. Look for Energy Star- and TCO-compliantmonitors.DEGAUSSING COILWraps around the picture tube. The Earth's magnetic pull and movement ofthe active display cause the picture tube to magnetize, resulting in imagedistortion. By pressing the degauss button, the degaussing coildemagnetizes the picture tube.YOKEThe coil around the CRT drives the electron beam to a specific pixel on thescreen.VIDEO BOARDResiding at the rear of the CRT, it controls, amplifies, and processes thevideo-signal input from the system's video card.SCREEN SURFACEThe flat screen is treated with antistatic coating. The antistatic coatingreduces the electric charge on the screen, and the antiglare coatingreduces the reflection on the monitor. Also look for ergocoated andergopaneled screens. These special coatings provide sharp images and reduceeyestrain.FLYBACK TRANSFORMER (FBT)The power source to transfer the electrons from the back of the monitor tothe screen in the front.HORIZONTAL SCANNING CIRCUITRYBrowses the electron beam horizontally on the screen (measured in kHz). Themonitors with higher horizontal scanning frequency provides less flicker onthe screen.BNC/D-SUB CONNECTORSLook for monitors with both BNC and D-sub connectors. At high scanningfrequencies, we preferred BNC connectors over the D-sub because theconnectors provide additional shielding between the video input and thesignal lines.LCDDisplays the status of the monitor operations, selected main andsubcontrols (to adjust the display), resolutions, scanning frequencies, andso on. The monitors with an LCD don't come with the on-screen menus toadjust the display.CONTROLSThe functions of the control buttons should be labeled clearly. Wepreferred on-screen controls with a minimum set of buttons over theold-fashioned two buttons/control or thumbwheel control.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. HIGH-QUALITY MONITORSMonitor manufacturers are changing the concept of access to monitorcontrols. Fading away is the traditional monitor with control buttons orthumbwheels for adjusting brightness, contrast, and so on. Monitors of thenext generation have just a few buttons and on-screen menus.   Of the 20 large-screen monitors tested here, 14 of them had on-screenmenus. These menus include controls to adjust brightness, contrast,degauss, horizontal and vertical size, position, pincushion, barrel, andcolor matching. In addition, progressive vendors add controls forconvergence, geometric distortion correction, horizontal and verticalmoire, dynamic focusing, video select, and input port select.   To access these controls, you press a button on the monitor, and a menupops up on-screen. Most of the monitors have similar buttons that functionas the menu, select, and exit buttons. Some of the monitors still havebuttons or thumbwheels for brightness, contrast, and degauss. Our testingteam was impressed with the organization of the on-screen menu used by theNEC Multisync monitors.   As these monitors move onto desktops, manufacturers are making themeasier to view by building them with antistatic, antiglare, antireflective,ergocoated, and ergopaneled screens. Of the 20 monitors, 17 support 1600-by 1200-pixel resolution in noninterlaced mode. At this resolution, thetext on the screen or data in spreadsheet cells must be flicker-free toreduce eyestrain. To achieve a flicker-free display, these monitors usevertical refresh rates of as high as 82 Hz. Nine of the monitors complywith the TCO emission standards, and only 12 of them carry FCC Class Blabels.   These heavyweight monitors use a lot of power to display sharp and crispimages. Power consumption ranges from 110 to 197 W in active mode. All themonitors (except Daytek's DT-2102M) are equipped with the built-in DisplayPower Management System (DPMS). With this electronic circuit embedded, themonitor automatically saves power and switches to a low-power modeconsuming less than 30 W in idle mode. If the monitor stays in idle modefor a long period of time, it further saves energy by switching to sleepmode, where it consumes less than 8 W. Users can set the time to switch tothese modes. In our power management test, the Philips Magnavox CM2137received the highest score, consuming 84.6 W. It was followed by the NECMultisync XE21. All the monitors, except the DT-2102M, are Energy Starrecipients.   The NEC Multisync XE21 rated higher than all the other monitors in ouroverall performance and usability tests. For under $1900, this monitor isalso a winner in our low-cost category. The Viewsonic 21PS and thePanasonic C-2192P come behind the overall winner in the performanceevaluation.   The Viewsonic 21PS and the Panasonic C-2192P cost just under $2000 andhave the same physical appearance, with similar control buttons andsoftware used in the pop-up screen menu. These monitors perform similarlybecause they both use the Matsushita picture tube. During our series oftests, we noticed that both monitors squeak when switching from text tographics, with a lot of delay. The Panasonic C-2192P's quality performanceis close to the top score, and it received an outstanding score indistortion tests.   NEC's XP21 rated the highest in the image-quality tests. The XP21 costs$400 more than the XE21, but it provides a higher 1600- by 1200-pixelresolution, higher horizontal and vertical scanning frequencies, and morefactory presets and user-settable display modes. This is the only monitorthat comes with the Access.bus connector. The Access.bus supportsbidirectional communications for future enhancements (see the text box``Access.bus Technology'' on page 125).   The Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 21TX scored the highest in our featuresrating, providing a high resolution of 1600 by 1200 pixels, extendedwarranties, on-site service, and BBS support service. It also has suchhigh-end control features as focus, signal level, and digital control. Mostother monitors lacked some of these features. Although the Diamond Pro 21TXwas our high scorer in this area, it is not an FCC Class B residentialmonitor, lacks unlimited technical support, and has a high dot pitch.For superior quality and control...BEST OVERALLNEC Multisync XE21The NEC Multisync XE21 uses an opticlear screen and an NEC picture tube.

Portrait Display Labs recentlyunveiled a 17-inch color monitor displaying images in both landscape andportrait modes. The Pivot 1700 monitor is compatible with Macs, Power Macs,and PC compatibles running Windows. The provided software does not delivera portrait view in full-screen DOS mode, but it offers 50 lines ofportrait-viewing capability in a DOS window. The DOS-window capability islimited to simpler applications, such as word processing, programming, andanalyzing code. It is not recommended for heavy-duty CAD work.   It is as easy as pressing a hot key or clicking on a screen icon torotate the image without closing any of your applications. With thisflexibility, you can switch between the two modes depending on yourapplications and work load. If you think you need a 21-inch monitor forviewing long documents in high resolution, the Pivot 1700 could be acost-effective alternative. For a street price of only $1199, the Pivot1700's vertical height is 12.7 inches; for over $2000, the vertical heightof 21-inch monitors is only 12 inches.   The Pivot 1700 supports resolutions of up to 1024 by 768 pixels (768 by1024 pixels in portrait mode) at 76 Hz and 1280 by 1024 pixels at 60 Hzwith a dot pitch of 0.26 mm. It is compatible with most Windows graphicscards having at least 1 MB of video memory. But the WinPortrait 2.0 driverthat comes with the monitor did not support the MGA Matrox graphics card.The driver for the Matrox card will be available in later versions. ThePivot 1700 is capable of displaying a full, readable, life-size display ofan 8.5- by 11-inch document, with lots of room for toolbars, icons, andother windows in portrait mode. It comes with the WinPortrait graphicsdrivers (the rotating capability) and a three-year limited warranty.   The layout of the monitor's digital controls is designed with long, softtouch buttons. These buttons reside on a semicircular projection at thebottom of the screen in landscape mode. When the monitor is rotatedclockwise to display portrait mode, the control buttons move along with themonitor and reside at its left side. This monitor complies with the EnergyStar and MPR II standards.Product InformationPivot 1700....................$1199Portrait Display Labs, Inc.Pleasanton, OR(800) 858-7744(510) 227-2700http://www.portrait.comCircle 1121 on Inquiry Card.Photograph(s):Photograph: Photograph: For those who need to view long documents in highresolutions, the Portrait Display Labs' Pivot 1700 is an inexpensivealternative to the 21-inch monitors.

Peripherals that support the Access.bus provide aconnector or port connection that is similar to a phone-jack connector. Itcan connect peripherals such as monitors, printers, modems, mice,keyboards, scanners, and digitizers to the system.   The advantage of the Access.bus is hassle-free installation. You canconnect an Access.bus device (e.g., a monitor) to your system, and thesystem automatically identifies and configures it for optimum performance.The system and the attached device automatically configure themselves bycommunicating via the Access.bus, thus eliminating the memory-hoggingplatform-specific driver installation, DIP switches, jumpers, orterminators.   The Access.bus connection protocol was developed by Digital Equipmentand Philips Semiconductors in 1985. Because of its simplicity, it is widelyaccepted as an industry standard. Many hardware peripheral vendors plan toprovide this connection in future products. This connectivity can beprovided on existing peripherals and software-controlled devices. NECTechnologies has a head start in this game by offering an Access.busconnector on its XP series of 17- and 21-inch monitors.   With the Access.bus connection, you can connect up to 125 devices toyour system in daisy-chain fashion, without having to manually configureeach device. For example, you can connect your system to the monitor viathe Access.bus, connect the printer to your monitor, connect your modem tothe printer, and so on. The order in which you connect is irrelevant. Ifyou want to add another device into the chain, it can be plugged inanywhere, and the system will know what I/O to use to address that device.   The system communicates with each of the connected devices via theAccess.bus, and each device is intelligent enough to respond to the systemcalls. Because the device communicates via the Access.bus, the platform onwhich it is connected becomes irrelevant. The Access.bus can also be usedto update the flash ROM on the peripheral.   Windows 95 provides a Plug and Play device featuring an automaticdetection of the monitor. Here, the monitor identifies itself as a Plug andPlay-compatible device easing the setup and configuration time. WithAccess.bus compatibility, peripheral manufacturers should make theirproducts more intelligent to accept and send instructions back and forth tothe system.Photograph(s):Photograph: Photograph: NEC's Multisync XE21 features an Access.busconnection (shown above) for hassle-free installation.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. HOW WE TESTEDWe tested the monitors in noninterlaced mode at 1280- by 1024-pixelresolution at a refresh rate of 60 Hz and determined image sharpness,resolution, convergence, legibility, contrast ratio, and power managementin a Windows 95 environment. In DOS mode, we tested the image quality anddistortion using Displaymate Professional 1.0 from Sonera Technologies.   We installed the monitor-specific Windows 95 drivers for each monitor,if they were provided. Because Windows 95 was released only shortly beforetesting commenced, only two monitors (from Nokia and Tatung) came withspecific drivers for Windows 95. We tested the rest of the monitors withconfigurations based on manufacturers' suggestions. Many suppliers advisedthat we let Windows 95 automatically configure their product as a standardPlug and Play monitor. For those monitors not compatible with Plug andPlay, testers configured them to SVGA at 1280 by 1024 pixels.   We tested the monitors on an S.A.G. Electronics STC 120 running at 120MHz with a Matrox Millennium video card. Only two NSA Hitachi monitors werenot compatible with this card. At the time of testing, Matrox did not havethe drivers available for the NSA Hitachi monitors. This incompatibilitycaused the monitors to lose their settings during testing. Our technicianshad to restore the settings for each screen resolution. Thisincompatibility did not affect the performance of these monitors. Matrox isin the process of including support for these monitors, and it should havereleased the drivers by the time you read this.DISPLAY QUALITYWe used the NSTL-developed software utility to measure the image sharpness,contrast ratio, and misconvergence of the monitors. Using 1- and2-pixel-thick RGB lines at the edges of the screen, we measured thesharpness of the image. We also displayed horizontal and vertical linesacross the entire screen, looking for the resolving capability of themonitor. We then examined the monitors for overlapping and spacing betweenlines.   To measure the contrast ratio, we used a large, white rectangular box atthe center of the screen and measured the luminance levels for both thewhite rectangle and the unilluminated border surrounding the white box incandellas/meters2, using a Tektronix Lumacolor II J18 Photometer. A higherratio indicates greater contrast, making the image more visible in highambient-light conditions.   To measure misconvergence, we used Klein Optical Instruments' opticalgauge, which contains three prisms. By varying the red and blue prisms inthis device, the displayed white line on the screen was alignedhorizontally and vertically. This is the convergence correction required todisplay the image without misconvergence.   We measured the quality of the image by examining a series of 25 screensusing Displaymate Professional 1.0. Screens included color and gray-scaledisplays, blooming effect on color and black-and-white text, moire patternson multiple resolutions, consecutive text and graphics switching, andgeometric display of rectangles and circles. We used the same software tocalculate the distortion index of the monitor by recording a series ofscreen measurements.   We also tested these monitors in a real-world scenario for legibilityand power management capabilities. We inspected various fonts in multiplesizes for legibility and readability in a Word document from a normalviewing distance. Testers measured the power consumption in a full, activeWindows environment; in a Windows screen-saver mode (using the blankscreen); and in an idle or a low-power state using a Digital Power Meter.   The price cutoff to qualify as a low-cost monitor was $1900, which is$355 less than the average price. We were able to select the best low-costmonitor from a group of four monitors.   Our best-overall score included the weighted average of 42.9 percent ofthe overall performance score, 14.3 percent of power rating, and 21.4percent of features and usability each. The quality score was determined bythe weighted average of 46 percent of image-quality tests and NSTL testseach and 8 percent of distortion tests. We determined the overalldisplay-quality score by calculating the weighted averages of theimage-sharpness (40 percent), contrast-ratio (10 percent), convergence (20percent), and legibility (30 percent) tests.FEATURESWe weighed some features more heavily than others to determine the featuresscore for each monitor. Some of them are dot pitch, minimum and maximumhorizontal and vertical frequencies, display modes, display controls, andinternal power management. Energy Star- and TCO-compliant features wereweighed heavily overall.EASE OF USEWe examined the ease of use for each monitor by scoring documentation,technical support, and physical use, such as tilt, swivel, and cablelengths. Our technicians gave a subjective score (based on guidelines) foreach usability feature. The usability testing was completed by the sametechnician on all the monitors.ContributorsChandrika Mysore, Project Manager/Editor NSTL, has evaluated systems andhardware peripherals for the past six years.Tom McAndrew, Technical Analyst/NSTL, specializes in testing hardwareperipherals and OSes.Susan Colwell, Technical Editor/BYTEThe Lab Report is an ongoing collaborative project between BYTE magazineand National Software Testing Laboratories (NSTL).

The buttons on the monitor display the pop-up menu, select thecontrols in the menus, and increase or decrease the selected control. Someof the monitors automatically remove the menu from the screen if the menuis idle for a given period of time. This can be annoying when you haven'tfinished with the adjustment. Testers preferred that the menus stay onuntil the testers wanted to exit.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. CIRCULAR VS. RECTANGULAROf the 20 monitors we tested, half of them used circular bases as opposedto the rectangular type. Based on our subjective usability testing,technicians expressed a preference for those with circular bases, citingthem as easier to move, tilt, and swivel.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. CONGESTED BNC CONNECTORSWe tested the monitors using BNC connectors, if provided. A BNC cableconnector has five connectors, one each for RGB (a total of three), H-sync,and V-sync signals. Some monitors place the five connectors in one row,with equal spacing in between the connectors. This is the preferred,easy-to-use placement. Other manufacturers, such as Nokia, position theconnectors in two rows, with RGB in the first row and the H- and V-syncconnectors in the second row. This arrangement is inconvenient, becausethere is not enough room between the rows to grasp and twist theconnectors.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. POWER TOOLS FOR DATA DRILLINGIQ/Objects and PowerPlay help you find information buried in complexdatabases. One is a better analyst, the other a better query/report tool.By:DAVID S. LINTHICUMWhen it comes to automated tools that deal with masses of data, differentproducts take different approaches. Query/reporting packages help youcreate views from complex queries, pass them along to a DBMS, and take theresults and format them for presentation. Analysis packages slice and dicedata, perform what-if analyses, and ``drill down'' to get more detail. Thebuzzword that describes what they do is on-line analytical processing(OLAP). Many of these tools don't perform the initial queries. Instead,they operate on data tables provided by a separate query package. Althoughthere is some overlap in functionality, the two types of tools complementeach other. In many organizations, both will find homes as the eyes andears of busy executives.   In this review, we look at one tool from each category: IQ/Objects, aquery/reporting tool from IQ Software, and PowerPlay, a data-analysispackage from Cognos. (Note that each vendor also makes a package in theother category: IQ's analysis tool, announced in November 1995, isIQ/Vision. Cognos's query tool is Impromptu.) Both packages reviewed hereprovide connections to popular relational database servers, produce a widevariety of reports and graphs, and run under Windows 3.1 and Windows 95.Because of their different purposes, however, that's where the similaritiesend.IQ/Objects   With its many features, IQ/Objects (IQ/O) is a good general-purposereporting tool for Windows. It comes with a Report Designer, a run-timeReport Viewer, and a Knowledge Base Editor for creating logical databaseviews.   The reporting capabilities are impressive. IQ/O supports single- andmultiple-column layouts, with vertical and horizontal data depiction. Youcan embed OLE 2.0 objects inside reports and print multiple reports, eachfrom a different query and with its own format and data representation(e.g., charts and tables) on the same page. You can define 2-D and 3-Dcross-tab reports using single or multiple columns and put multiple objectsin cross-tab cells.   IQ/O offers eight types of graphs, including pie charts, bar charts,scatter diagrams, and line charts. Report developers can include logicalprint objects and report areas that appear only when a predeterminedcondition is met. This means you can create reports having multiple detailand summary sections with different formats (e.g., each specific to a givenstate), and the appropriate query and format will be automatically chosenat run time. Also, you can use the results of one query as input toanother.   Using IQ/O, you can create custom columns that extend a database'sphysical schema, and you can also create user-written functions tomanipulate data and perform calculations. IQ/O provides complete controlover formatting, allowing borders, shadows, background images, and fillsfor objects, selected report areas, and the entire report. You can exportyour report to Windows metafiles and to text, comma-delimited, PostScript,and Excel files.   You design a report graphically, dragging and dropping columns from anobject window to a report. IQ/O comes with several predesigned reporttemplates, and you can add custom templates. Group editing lets developerschange multiple objects at once, and you can define and apply object stylesas needed. You can browse data while you're designing a report and seeon-screen what the report will look like, eliminating the need for mosttest printing and saving time and materials.   The object-oriented structure of IQ/O lets you create reusableobjects--reports, charts, queries, and documents, as well as imported OLEobjects--and incorporate them into new queries and documents. IQ/O can linkreport objects so that an object will change automatically when you changeanother object that's linked to it. This saves time in report maintenance.   Report output can be saved for later viewing either in IQ/O or by theseparate, smaller IQ Viewer that's included with the less-expensivepersonal edition. You can also create prompts to make it easy for users torequest reports directly.   While IQ/O can do its query processing entirely on a workstation, it canalso off-load some of the computing to one or more IQ SmartServers. Thesecan query back-end databases, create formatted reports and views, and shipthe query results back to the workstation.PowerPlay   PowerPlay is a suite of four programs that lets developers and end userscreate interactive reports and graphs and perform some what-if analysis.PowerPlay comes with Explorer, Reporter, Portfolio, and Transformercomponents, plus a separate Cognos Scheduler.   PowerPlay Explorer provides a point-and-click interface to check outdata. Transformer takes 2-D data from database tables and creates themultidimensional data that Explorer and Reporter use. Portfolio organizesPowerPlay reports into interactive briefing books. Cognos Scheduler canexecute Transformer as a batch process at specified times.   With Reporter, the heart of the PowerPlay package, you can buildinteractive and automated reports in a variety of formats. The Reporterenvironment is similar to that of Explorer, and you can display data incross-tab, column, and free-form reports. PowerPlay supports pie, bar,line, simple point, and correlation graphs.   With Reporter, you select only the specific subset of data you need towork with, without having to deal with a complete answer set from thedatabase. In Reporter, as with IQ/O, you create reports by dragging anddropping data elements from a multidimensional view created by Transformer,called the Category Tree. Each report includes a dimension line that showswhat dimensions are available in your extract and the levels of detail youcan access in each dimension.   Developers can include ad hoc calculations to derive new data fromvalues in the database extract. Automatic features let you suppresszero-value data as well as highlight exceptional (i.e., out-of-range) data.You can create data filters, and rank and format the data for customreports.   One feature that differentiates PowerPlay from the kind ofreport-writing packages that have been around for years is its interactivenature. When you want more detail, you just double-click on a categorybutton to drill down. To show data as a graph, you simply click on theappropriate PowerBar button. This interactive capability lets developersdistribute reports that end users can continue to explore and interact withto get information they need.Finding the Data   IQ/O and PowerPlay can work with a wide range of local databases andremote database servers, including Oracle, Sybase, and Informix, as well asothers through Open Database Connectivity (ODBC). Each tool has its own wayof rerepresenting physical data to provide developers with new ways oflooking at the data as well as ways of subsetting or sanitizing data forthe end user (see the Technology Focus).   With IQ/O, you can directly edit the SQL statements it produces beforeprocessing the query. You can have it query multiple databases, and thepackage supports distinct and aggregate functions. To use a database fromIQ/O, you must first create a special data dictionary using the KnowledgeBase Editor. The result is a repository file that contains a profile ofyour database, the objects in it (e.g., tables, views, and synonyms), andthe relationships between those objects. (The newest version, IQ/Objects5.1, released after this review was done, automatically sets uprelationships between tables and other repository objects.) A knowledgebase covers one or more databases, each with one or more tables and anynumber of columns. You can also create global custom columns.   In addition to an IQ/O knowledge base, you must provide a data sourcethat defines the name or location for the physical database plus connectioninformation. You can change the data source and knowledge base globally orfor individual reports. We found this feature quite useful when workingwith several databases that store information using the same schema. Theend result is an object browser that you can use with the Report Designerto select data for your report.   Using a database with PowerPlay is slightly more complex and confusingthan with IQ/O, but the Cognos product adds multidimensional capability.PowerPlay organizes data using three basic concepts: dimensions,categories, and measures.   PowerPlay represents standard relational data using dimensions, whichgive developers and end users a flexible way of looking at data.Multidimensional analysis is the exploration of data up, down, and acrosscritical dimensions of data. This capability increases the value ofcorporate data. For example, multidimensional reports help you distinguishthe impact of each business area on other areas.   Categories are individual items of data that make up a dimension.PowerPlay organizes data within a dimension; categories are grouped intohierarchical levels. You move down the hierarchy by drilling down to moredetail. The drill-down levels provide the flexibility to work on data atany level you want. With Explorer and Reporter, you select databaseinformation from a Category Tree. Measures are indicators that representvalues, such as revenues, expenses, and target inventory levels, calculatedor summarized from a combination of categories.Creating Reports   To create a report using IQ/O, you start by selecting from the availablereport templates: an empty report, as well as free-form, column, cross-tab,and label templates. After this, you can drag and drop objects from IQ/O'sObject Directory into your report. As we added objects to the IQ/O reportwe were creating, we discovered that we could set their attributes,formatting, and other look-and-feel features. From here, we grouped headeror footer areas by selecting objects that we wanted to relate. It's here inthe group headers/footers that you place totals, subtotals, and counts foreach data element. You can format these pretty much any way you want. Ifyou aren't using a group footer or group header, you select Report/SortOrder.   We could see how the report was taking shape by selecting Quick Preview.IQ/O queried the database and selected only enough data for a single page.It then opened a report viewer window showing how the printed report wouldlook. After making further changes, we could return to the viewer windowsand select Refresh to see the effect of the changes. Another option is AutoRefresh, where the viewer windows update automatically as you make changes.Only when our report was complete did we print a sample page to confirmthat the hard copy looked like the graphical image. Then we saved thereport to disk.   PowerPlay provides similar features, but it requires a different,somewhat more involved procedure. To begin a new report, you select the NewReport icon from the PowerBar, which opens up the Samples directory, wherethe report templates are stored. From here, you double-click on the reportyou want to use as a default. Now you can add data categories--detail,summary, or a mixture of both--by navigating through PowerPlay'smultidimensional structure. You add categories via the Category Tree dialogbox. By double-clicking on categories, you can expand or contract thehierarchy, selecting data as you go. For example, if you press the Add Rowbutton, Reporter adds a category. A plus sign next to a category indicatesthat lower-level detail is available.   To filter data, you change the dimension line of PowerPlay through theFilter dialog box. You format the data by changing fonts, applying styles,and displaying formats, as well as by resizing columns and rows. You canalso rank categories from the Explore menu. Here you enter columninformation, and Reporter automatically ranks the data within the report.To perform calculations, you need to create a calculated category, a datapoint that exists only in PowerPlay and not in the physical database. Youdo this by holding down the Control key while selecting one column, thenanother, and defining the mathematical operations (i.e., add, subtract,multiply, and divide) to use.   After the report is complete, you enter title information. Then you'reready to save the report or send it to the printer.Power or Convenience?   When looking at these two reporting and analysis tools together, you'refaced with the issue of power versus convenience. IQ/O provides an easymethod to create simple reports and graphs for all sorts of reportingapplications. It's easy to extract data from existing databases and fromdatabase servers, and the Knowledge Base component lets you customize thedatabase view to suit your reporting needs precisely. Drag and drop is afirst-rate method of selecting objects for a report, and the ability to seewhat a report looks like while you're defining it is a real help. It's alsoquite useful to be able to control the query down to the SQL level, and thereusable objects make it fast and easy to create new reports.   PowerPlay is more complex than IQ/O but provides more power. TheTransformer provides the developer with the means to look at 2-D databasesas if they were multidimensional. This model greatly improves an end user'sability to analyze data inside a corporate database. In addition, theinnate ability to make reports interactive makes PowerPlay the better typeof tool for creating ``point-and-shoot'' applications for nontechnicalusers.   Which tool you pick depends on your requirements. If you need aneffective query tool for ad hoc reporting, IQ/Objects is your best bet. Ifyou need to do hard-core OLAP and don't mind spending the extra time to getthere, you're ready for PowerPlay.Product InformationIQ/ObjectsPersonal edition, run time and viewer, $250; enterprise edition, includesReport Designer, $695; administrator edition, includes Knowledge BaseEditor, $995.IQ Software Corp.Norcross, GA(800) 458-0386(770) 446-8880fax: (770) 448-4088http://www.iqsc.comCircle 1135 on Inquiry Card.PowerPlay 4.1.................$695Cognos Corp.Burlington, MA(800) 426-4667(617) 229-6600fax: (617) 229-9828http://www.cognos.com/Circle 1136 on Inquiry Card.IQ/ObjectsSTRENGTHS-- Employs reusable, intelligent objects (e.g., data, reports, groups,   graphics, documents, and text) with a consistent access interface.-- Incorporates OLE 2.0 objects in reports.-- Allows conditional and multiple queries and data representations   in a single report.WEAKNESSES-- Difficult to see the mass of on-screen forms and data without   SVGA graphics.-- Requires creation of the data repository before you can create reports.PowerPlaySTRENGTHS-- Creates multidimensional views from 2-D data tables.-- Allows drilling down into the data hierarchy to more detail.-- Has powerful filtering and highlighting capabilities.WEAKNESSES-- Cumbersome for creating calculated categories and measures.-- More difficult to create reports compared with   some other products.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: IQ/Objects Report Designer makes it easy toinclude multiple queries, each with its own data and reporting format, on asingle report page.About the Author(s):David S.

Just how does aquery tool organize its data?   One approach might be a large, comprehensive multijoin, but this couldbe impossible or impractical, as well as highly wasteful and inefficient.IQ/Objects takes a different approach, creating what's called a starschema. In essence, this is a table formed by joining the most importantbase tables and connecting to it smaller subsidiary tables. The subsidiarytables hold keys for accessing other data (see the figure ``Data Is theStar''). At first blush, this might sound like a slight variation on arelational database system, but it differs significantly in that thesubsidiary files are all linked to a central data table. This creates adata topology similar to that of a star network. Database systems thatsupport star schemata include Red Brick, Oracle, Sybase, and Informix.   The alternative is a true multidimensional database, such as Oracle's(Redwood Shores, CA) Data Warehouse or Arbor Software's (Sunnyvale, CA)Essbase. A relational table represents data as a 2-D flat matrix. Amultidimensional database, however, stacks multiple tables into a 3-D block(see the figure ``Cubic Data''), much like pages in an Excel spreadsheet orQuattro Pro notebook. More-powerful multidimensional databases extend thismetaphor into higher dimensions by ``stacking'' blocks into hyperblocks.While these constructions offer greater flexibility, they also consume morecomputing power and considerably more overhead. For a query tool, creatinga true multidimensional database is overkill; for an analysis engine, amultidimensional database is ideal, giving maximum flexibility for slicingand dicing data to create new views and for drilling down to increasinglevels of detail.Illustration(s):Illustration: Figure: Cubic DataMultidimensional databases don't use flat tables related by key fields andvalues. Instead, they stack 2-D tables into cubes, cubes into 4-Dhypercubes, and so on. This structure lets you create different views andslices of data by approaching it from different directions and alongdifferent dimensions.Illustration: Figure: Data Is the StarIQ/O creates a star schema for its data, taking original relational tablesand combining them into a new format that speeds up report generation.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. HOW THE WEB WILL CHANGE COMPUTINGBrowsers and dynamic interpreted languages like Java enable developers towrite client/server applications that are inherently multiplatformBy:STEVEN J. VAUGHAN-NICHOLS AND RACHEL SCHMUTTERWeb browsers, those graphical front ends to the Internet, are multiplyingfaster than bunnies on a rabbit farm. As fast as they can, software vendorsare adding Internet connectivity to their programs.   Fax-software vendors like Delrina have added browsers and other Internetconnectivity programs to their communications suites. Lotus Development'sintegrated InterNotes Web Navigator browser in the new version of NotesRelease 4) merges Notes- and Web-based data. Other software developers areupgrading their word processors, document managers, and even CD-ROMprograms with Internet connectivity.   Internet mania is more than a fad, however: It marks the beginning ofwhat many analysts feel is a fundamental shift in how we compute. ``Thebrowser will increasingly be the user's interface to the corporation andthe world,'' says Dennis Freeman, marketing director at Frontier Technology(Mequon, WI), an Internet-software developer.   The latest version of the Navigator Web browser from Netscape (MountainView, CA; (415) 254-1900; http://home.netscape.com) typifies this trend.Navigator 2.0 provides a wealth of new features (see the screen), but oneof the most important is its support for the Java programming language fromSun Microsystems. Java lets developers of Web servers extend thecapabilities of browsers beyond merely viewing information. A Java-enabledWeb browser can download programs, called applets, such as data-entryforms, spreadsheets, animations, and graphics. Any client, provided it runsa Java-enabled browser, can access the Java application (for moreinformation on Java technology, see ``Wired on the Web,'' page 77).   Netscape's Navigator is the most popular Web browser (various estimatesgive it about 70 percent market share), and version 2.0 will be availablefor the Mac, Windows, and Unix. The company's lead in the Web browser fieldlets it promulgate extensions to HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language usedto create Web pages, and to add new functionality such as the fast loadingof low-resolution images and real-time chat to home pages. Othercapabilities like fully threaded newsgroup reading and NetScape's SecureSockets Layer for secure transactions, which other commercial companies canlicense, illustrate how Netscape is becoming much more than a mere vendorof browsers.   ``Netscape is not trying to build Web browsers or Web servers, it'strying to build an infrastructure to support public and private distributedcomputing,'' says Jeremy Allaire, president of New World Media(Minneapolis, MN), a consultancy specializing in on-line systems and theInternet. ``Netscape is building an operating system.''   Netscape's browser isn't the only one that will support Java. Otherbrowsers, including ones from Spry and Sun, will also support the newlanguage.   Web browsers are changing in other ways. A more robust version ofNetscape's program, called Navigator Gold (priced at about $79), breaks theboundary between browsers and HTML authoring tools by integrating a WYSIWYGauthoring environment. Navigator Gold also provides you with a wordprocessor.   Meanwhile, other browser developers continue to improve on the Web'sbuilt-in hyperlinking capabilities. The SlipKnot 1.13 browser fromMicroMind (slipknot@micromind.com) for Windows and OS/2 downloads data fromall local HTML links (i.e., links specific to a given Web site) to yoursystem in the background. This allows you to get a broad view of a Web siteeither on- or off-line. Spyglass and NCSA are adding a similar feature totheir browsers, but SlipKnot lets users pick and choose what links theywant downloaded.   As browsers encroach on the turf of traditional applications such asword processors, as well as that of tools for developing custom front ends,companies like Microsoft are adapting. For example, Microsoft isinvestigating ways in which Visual Basic can act as a front-end developmenttool for the company's Internet Explorer 2.0. The company is alsodeveloping an electronic publishing tool (known as Blackbird) for theMicrosoft Network and the Web.   Internet connectivity is important, agrees Chris Flores, Microsoft'sproduct manager for Visual Basic. But he also says the Internet is justanother extension for Visual Basic, which is a popular tool today amongcorporate developers for creating custom front ends. More than 1000 customcontrols are available for Visual Basic developers today, Flores says, andseveral companies are developing controls for Internet access. However,Visual Basic is not a strong cross-platform solution thanks to Microsoft'sWindows-centric strategy: There's no Visual Basic for the Mac, and few, ifany, OLE Controls that will run natively on the Macintosh.   Netscape faces formidable competition but is ahead of Microsoft andother developers in building the ultimate TCP/IP network tool interface,says New Media's Allaire. Furthermore, Netscape is doing so at theapplication level for three major end-user operating systems: DOS/Windows,MacOS, and Unix.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: The new Netscape Navigator, available forWindows, the Mac, and Unix, delivers E-mail with graphics. Navigator 2.0will also include bidirectional E-mail that supports encryption and digitalsignatures, as well as fully threaded newsgroup reading that corporationscan use for secure internal discussion groups. The Netscape word processor,available only in the Gold edition, lets you drag and drop text and objectsand link images to HTML code. It also provides tools for document and imageconversion.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. INTEL BEATS THE CLOCK ... AGAINBy:Dave AndrewsIntel's surprise rollout of its 200-MHz Pentium Pro (aka the P6) processorwill force its competitors in both the RISC and CISC camps to play catch-upthis year. Most industry insiders expected Intel to release a 150-MHz,256-KB-cache version of the Pentium Pro for desktop PCs and workstations in1995, then follow with a 166-MHz, 512-KB-cache version for servers in thefirst quarter of 1996.   Instead, Intel is releasing those chips as scheduled, plus 180-MHz and200-MHz versions during this quarter. (Both will have 256-KB cache and,like the 166-MHz Pentium Pro, will be built on Intel's .35-micronmanufacturing process.) Intel will also release a 200-MHz, 512-KB-cachePentium Pro in the second quarter of this year.   Intel experienced better-than-expected yields with its .35-micronprocess, which helped accelerate the release of the 200-MHz processor,company officials said. Several PC manufacturers told BYTE that the earlyavailability of the 200-MHz version was a pleasant surprise. Intel'scompetitors were probably not as pleased: BYTE's cross-platform CPUbenchmarks indicate that the 200-MHz Pentium Pro delivers 2.8 times theinteger performance of a 90-MHz Pentium, and about 3.5 times thefloating-point performance.   The 200-MHz Pentium Pro will show up in the kinds of workstationstypically powered by RISC CPUs. Peter Lowber, senior analyst forworkstations and servers at Datapro (Lexington, MA), says the 200-MHzPentium Pro undermines the RISC value proposition. Although Digital, SGI,and HP will likely surpass Pentium Pro performance when they release newchips this year, Lowber says the RISC vendors must demonstratesubstantially superior performance over relatively inexpensive Intelsolutions.   The news is worse for Intel's x86 competitors, AMD and Cyrix. AMD, whichrecently acquired NexGen, and Cyrix both sell Pentium-class processors nowand won't ship Pentium Pro competitors for running 32-bit software beforethe end of this year. Meanwhile, Intel's Pentium prices have plummeted. A200-MHz, 256-KB-cache Pentium Pro sells for $1325 (in quantities of 1000);a 75-MHz Pentium costs just $158 (the 60-MHz Pentium originally sold for$878). ``I think Cyrix and AMD will have problems,'' Lowber says. ``They'replaying catch-up again.''Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: Graphs: Looking Good at 200Intel's RISC competitors will release new processors this year that shouldpass the Pentium Pro in performance. Also, while Pentium Pro processors arecurrently being built on a .35-micron manufacturing process, Intel'scompetitors are expected to release even higher-performing .3x-micron chips(not included in this chart) late this year.Illustration: Illustration: Graphs: P6 Competition Heats Up in 1996Intel's RISC competitors will release new processors this year that shouldpass the Pentium Pro in performance.

First made popular by Visioneer (PaloAlto, CA) and its PaperPort hardware/software system for Windows and theMac, personal scanners typically integrate OCR, archiving, annotation, andother software tools with a small sheet-fed scanner.   Personal scanners will soon offer more extensive support for color. Manyproducts already let you add existing color images to a black-and-whitedocument, but PageScan Color ($399) from Logitech (Fremont, CA) also letsyou scan and capture color images at 24-bit resolution. Support for colorcapture will become more important as inexpensive color printers increasetheir penetration into businesses, analysts say. PageScan Color can alsocapture images at 8-bit gray-scale resolution. You can detach its scanninghead to scan bound material or book pages.   Another new entry, PaperEase (about $249) from Primax Electronics(Sunnyvale, CA), comes with an automatic document feeder, which can handleup to 10 sheets at a time. PaperEase integrates with most Windowsapplications (a Mac version is planned for the first half of this year),including fax and E-mail, and comes with document-annotation and archivingsoftware. You can fax directly from the PaperEase hardware without usingfax software. The copier controller in the scanner lets you enlarge,reduce, crop, and change the brightness of scanned documents. PaperEasecurrently scans at up to 400 dots per inch (dpi) and 256 levels of gray(8-bit gray-scale). Primax says it will have a model that can capture colorin the first half of this year.   Visioneer's latest unit, the new PaperPort Vx (about $369, available forMac or Windows), offers an enhanced hardware and software system. It'seasier to install, it's faster, and it supports 8-bit gray-scale images,the company says. New SharpPage technology automatically focuses and cleansup scanned images to provide more accurate OCR or higher-quality faxes,according to Visioneer. Maximum scanning resolution will be 400 dpi. The Vxwill connect to either the serial or parallel port. Visioneer wouldn'tconfirm that it will release a color version during the next 12 months, buta company official says it is reasonable to expect one.   A new entry from Hewlett-Packard, the 4S, is about the same size asVisioneer's original PaperPort and uses Visioneer's PaperPort 3.0 software.HP's 4S doesn't support color capture. At $349, it's almost as expensive asthe color Logitech unit, but analysts say HP's entry will furtherlegitimize this market. HP will offer the PaperPort software with itsflatbed scanners so users can get the functionality of the integratedfiling and OCR with any HP scanner.   Look for increased improvements in ease of use and lower prices, saysKristy Holch, who tracks image-capture products for BIS Strategic Decisions(Norwell, MA), a market research and consultancy firm. MicroTek (RedondoBeach, CA) already sells its PageWiz bundle, which offers 8-bit gray-scalescanning, an automatic document feeder, and other features, for just $199.The company is also developing a color version. Holch says ease of use willbe a critical factor in a personal scanner's success.   ``Conventional things like image quality, bit depth, and high resolutionthat are often used to differentiate professional flatbed scanners are notthe issue here,'' she says. ``The whole thing has to be easy andautomatic.''Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: Graph: Personal ScannersPersonal scanners fit on the desktop and are designed for individual use.They offer lower- resolution scanning than flatbed scanners because theirprime focus is document management, not professional desktop publishing.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. EXPERT ADVICE HARD TO GETUse of expert systems at help desks is declining, despite these systems'potential and value for support.

One technology, called asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL),is an intriguing solution for Internet access, video on demand, andvideoconferencing. Unlike a related technology called high-bit-rate digitalsubscriber lines (HDSL), which supports equal transmission rates (typically1.5 or 2 Mbps) both upstream and downstream to the user, ADSL delivers muchhigher bandwidth downstream than upstream. Telephone companies andinformation providers will use ADSL--with existing phone lines--to deliverhigh-speed services to the home or the small office.   ADSL uses digital signal processing and multiplexing techniques todeliver between 9 and 10 Mbps of downstream data over existing copper phonelines (typical systems will offer about 6 Mbps). This is much faster thanV.34 modems, which offer 28.8 Kbps, and ISDN, which offers 64 Kbps (or 128Kbps if you combine the two B channels of a Basic Rate Interface line).Cable modems offer comparable 10-Mbps data delivery rates but requirecoaxial cable to run into the home or office. Cable modems may also sufferperformance degradation as the number of users increases, but ADSL is apoint-to-point solution that shouldn't suffer from decreased performance.   ADSL and HDSL devices plug into a regular phone line like a modem, butunlike traditional modem technology, two people can't each just buy a modemand dial each other up. Transceivers must be installed at the users'premises and at the phone company's central office (see the figure).   In addition to supporting high-transmission rates to the user, ADSL cansustain speeds up to 640 Kbps upstream, a transmission rate suitable forsending commands to control a movie on demand. Similarly, you can use theupstream channel to send commands to Web pages and to take advantage ofADSL's ability to transmit graphical images at a higher bandwidthdownstream.   At last year's CeBIT show, Orckit Telecommunications (Tel Aviv, Israel)demonstrated the transmission of MPEG-2 video from an NTSC videotape playerat 8 Mbps downstream and 640 Kbps upstream using a pair of ADSL modems. (A6.2-Mbps downstream link can support four channels of compressed MPEGvideo.) At the Telecom '95 show in Geneva, many companies demonstrated newADSL equipment and applications.   Aware (Bedford, MA) and Analog Devices (Norwood, MA) have codeveloped achip set for Aware's ADSL Internet Access Transceiver. The transceiverdelivers slightly more than 6 Mbps downstream and 224 Kbps upstream over adistance of 12,000 feet between the transceivers (data rates of up to 8Mbps can be achieved over shorter distances).   Until recently, HDSL required two or three pairs of copper wires (ADSLrequires one pair). But Orckit and Meta-link (Tel Aviv, Israel) haveannounced HDSL chips that require just a single pair of copper wires.Analysts say that HDSL's limited downstream bandwidth makes it lessattractive for Internet access, but these improvements should strengthenHDSL's position as a more efficient alternative to today's T1 lines. ADSLwill enable the telephone companies to deliver entertainment services. Andusing both ADSL and HDSL, they'll be able to provide PC services, such asaccess to remote LANs and the Internet.Illustration(s):Illustration: Figure: ADSL: High-Speed DeliveryA typical ADSL system uses existing copper wires. It can deliver data fromdifferent bandwidth-intensive services at a rate of about 6 Mbps whilegiving the user a 640-Kbps upstream channel.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. FASTER ADSLBy:S.S.The next generation of ADSL promises to deliver even higher bandwidth overexisting copper phone lines. Several semiconductor manufacturers, includingAnalog Devices and Motorola, have developed signal-processing chips for aversion of ADSL that will operate at 25 or 51 Mbps. However, delivery atthese speeds will be over shorter distances than with otherimplementations--about 4000 feet for 25-Mbps transmission and 1000 feet for51-Mbps.   The faster versions of ADSL will be used in fiber-to-the-curb projectscurrently being deployed by telephone companies. Such systems offer higherbandwidths by bringing fiber-optic cabling to the curb of a home orbusiness and then using the existing copper connection to get from the curbto the building.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. BLASTS FROM THE PAST5 Years Ago in BYTE386 replicant on the loose.

Analysts don't think this improved connectivityalone will make PDAs a household item--long battery life, a seamlessinterface with wireless services, and the ability to fit in the pocket arealso important--but they say it is critical.   Officials at several PDA companies admit that their first iterations ofPDA-to-PC connectivity solutions were limited, despite indications thatconnectivity was a high priority among PDA users. A study conducted by BYTEin 1994 showed that 89 percent of users felt that the ability toautomatically synchronize their PDAs with their desktop PC files was eithersomewhat or very important; they also wanted to be able to send and receiveE-mail and faxes (see News and Views, June 1994, page 34). Now thoseimproved connectivity solutions are either available or under development.   Developers are also adding PDA-to-Internet connectivity. For example,AllPen (Los Gatos, CA; 415 399-8800), a developer of Newton OSapplications, will release Web browsing software for Newton-basedapplications this year. Although the software won't initially supportgraphics, it will let you upload and download information through HTMLforms.   ``Handwriting recognition is not the PDA's killer application,'' saysJon Hulak, senior analyst at BIS Strategic Decisions (Norwell, MA).``What's more important to people is the ability to synchronize basictwo-dimensional database information found in personal informationmanagers. That's critical information, and it's constantly changing.''   The PDA-to-PC connectivity programs are improving, but they could bebetter, says Ed Colligan, vice president of marketing at Palm Computing(Los Altos, CA), which develops PDA applications. ``Synchronizing your PDAwith your personal computer needs to be as simple as pushing a button.''New PDA-to-PC Solutions At a GlanceAPPLE COMPUTER'S MESSAGEPADImport/export, backup/restore, for PCs and Macs.

The phone companies, aswell as major database vendors like Oracle (Redwood Shores, CA), areproviding new ways to make it easier to access the Net.   Philips Home Services (Burlington, MA) is collaborating with Oracle todevelop a system that will let you send and receive electronic mail overthe Internet and other E-mail systems using a screen phone. Subscriberswill receive a Philips P100 screen phone (see the photo), which has analphanumeric keyboard, and their own E-mail account. Paul Chapple, aspokesman for Philips, says that although the P100 costs about $399, thatprice will drop to $300 later this year and will probably fall to $200 in1997.   Such a phone will have numerous advantages over a PC, Chapple says,including lower cost, faster boot-up, and smaller size. You could use it inyour kitchen or living room to tap into services ranging from electronicbanking, shopping, E-mail, and, of course, for conversing.   The Internet-enabled screen phone does not compete directly with a PC,Chapple says. ``You're not going to use a screen phone to manipulate largeamounts of data,'' he says. ``Instead, we see it as adding PC functionalityto the telephone.''   At the recent Telecom '95 show in Geneva, Oracle CEO Larry Ellisondescribed a $500 computer that would contain almost no software and woulddownload its operating system and applications when turned on. The device'sprimary applications will be Internet browsing, sending and receivingE-mail, word processing, and videoconferencing. The low cost of thesedevices will promote more plentiful networked computers, Ellison says.Users will carry a smart card to pay for rental time on these computers.And cable TV companies plan to use their infrastructure to deliver low-costInternet on-ramps.This approach is currently being test-trialed in parts ofFrance.   One variable still unknown is how much consumers will have to pay to hopon the Internet over these low-cost devices. Philips says it hasn'tdetermined if it will bill subscribers at a flat monthly rate or on aper-call basis. Officials at AT&T, which plans to roll out a dial-upInternet access service this year, say they haven't determined theirpricing structure either. The company does plan on having more than 200access points to give as many users as possible Internet connectionswithout having to pay additional long-distance phone charges.Photograph(s):Photograph: Photograph: The Philips P100 screen phone, which has analphanumeric keyboard, will soon let you send and receive E-mail.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. TWO-WAY PAGERS: THE NEXT PDA?SkyTel (Washington, D.C.) is offering two-way paging service in the U.S.,and others are expected to follow this year. SkyTel says it will continueto expand coverage of its personal communications service (PCS) beyond the1300 cities currently supported. Analysts predict that as the hardwareshrinks, and links to personal computing improve, this product categoryshould see tremendous growth.Two-way Pagers TodaySkyTel Pager ($399), service starts at $25/month; 5.5 ounces; several weeksof power on AAA battery; receive messages of up to 500 characters;15-character responses, or 95-character responses when using optionalconnection to HP palmtops; E-mail gateways.Near Future (1996)Two-way pagers from other companies; links to notebooks and other palmtops;rules-based E-mail routing; bigger message capacities; two-way PC Cardpagers.Distant Future (1997 and beyond)Two-way pager chip sets integrate directly into palmtops, notebooks; PDAswith integrated wireless messaging.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: Graph: Forecast For Narrowband PCS SubscribersCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. THE METER'S RUNNING WITH COMPUSERVE'S SPRYTEBy:Steven J. Vaughan-NicholsMonthly Internet access for the cost of a burger and fries soundsappealing, but a closer look reveals the amount of on-line consumption timewill be less than satisfying. CompuServe's (Columbus, OH) new SpryteInternet services will soon be available throughout North America and majorEuropean and Asian cities for $4.95 per month. ``Now every family can jointhe Internet,'' says Tim Oren, vice president of CompuServe's InternetDivision.   Spryte customers will receive the Spry Mosaic Web browser; Spry Mail;and a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) authoring tool called Home PageWizard. But under the $4.95-per-month plan, Internet connectivity will belimited to three hours a month. Other pricing plans are available,including one in which 20 hours of connectivity will cost $19.95. But afterthat, additional hours on all of the plans are $1.95 an hour.   ``Customers want flat-rate pricing. They don't want to have a timergoing when they hop onto the Web,'' says Joe Picard, marketingrepresentative for Digital Express, an Internet provider on the East Coast.Picard notes that his company offers SLIP/PPP services at a rate of $35 amonth. Dan Cunningham, chief financial officer of PSI, one of the oldestnationwide Internet providers, echoes Picard's sentiments. ``CompuServe isjust doing the same old thing by offering an hourly based pricingsystem.''   Nielsen Media Research and CommerceNet's recent survey of Internet usageindicates that the average Web user spends six hours a week on the Net.Under CompuServe's best plan, that means the typical user would pay $28 amonth, which is about the same as the flat-rate pricing schemes of mostInternet service providers. One advantage Spryte will have over some localservice providers in rural areas is its local-call availability, thanks toCompuServe's widespread X.25 network.   But even this advantage may not last for long. Ameritech, atelecommunications company, and Concentric Network, an Internet servicesprovider, are collaborating to provide local-phone-call Internet access.The two companies will offer a range of options, ranging from five hours ofmonthly connection for $7.95 ($1.95 each additional hour) to unlimitednumber of hours of monthly access for $29.95. A Concentric Networkspokeswoman said this service will allow any rural carrier in the U.S. tooffer low-cost local Internet access.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: Graph: Direct Connections Outpace On-lineServicesSource: O'Reilly & Associates (Sebastopol, CA)Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. INTERNET SEARCHING SOFTWARE WINS BEST OF COMDEX(LAS VEGAS)Innovative search software for the World Wide Web won BYTE's Best of Showaward at Fall Comdex '95. The awards recognize new products that will havea significant impact on computing.   Voted by the editors as the best of the best new products at Comdex,Quarterdeck's WebCompass is an intelligent Internet search engine thatqueries specified Web resources in the background. WebCompass (which alsowon in the Best Internet Software category) wraps a slick agent-basedinterface around any searchable Web servers you specify. The program isable to refresh the results of its searches periodically.   The editors awarded the Best Technology prize to Digital Semiconductor'sFX!32, a translator/emulator that allows 32-bit x86 applications to run onAlpha/Windows NT at approximately 70 percent of native Alpha performance.   Tseng Labs took the top spot in the Display and Sound Devices categorywith its 128-bit ET 6000 graphics and multimedia engine. The ET 6000integrates a 128-bit graphics accelerator, a video image processor, and a24-bit DAC into one chip.   Apple Computer's Newton 2.0 operating system for PDAs clinched the titlein the OS category. This new version is better at handwriting recognitionand offers better connectivity to personal computers and a spiffier userinterface.   Iomega's Jaz drive, which can hold a gigabyte on removable, $99 media,was voted Best Storage Device. Deneba took the prize of Best Applicationfor Canvas 5, its integrated, multiplatform graphics program. The graphicsprogram provides image editing, text and page layout, and drawing tools. Inthe Best Utility category, PowerQuest's PartitionMagic 2.0 filled the topslot. The program lets you use partitions as flexible superdirectories.   IBM won the Best Notebook category with its ThinkPad 760 CD. The firstthing you notice about this Pentium-powered baby is its 12.1-inch SuperVGAactive-matrix display. Intergraph iced the Best System award for itsTDZ-400 Pentium Pro personal workstation.   Panasonic's KX PS-8000--a multifunction color laser with 1200- by1200-dpi output--was picked as Best Printer. Ricoh's RDC-1 Digital Camerawas voted Best Input Device. This color camera also captures audio andvideo clips.   Best Communications Software went to Symantec's PC Anywhere32remote-control program for Windows (3.x and 95), Windows NT, and DOS. TheCommunications Hardware winner was Wyse Technology's Winterm 2000/2500terminals that complement Citrix WinFrame to provide an NT workstation forabout $700.   Multimedia Development winner was miro Computer's Video DC20, a videoediting system that combines hardware-assisted Motion JPEG compression ofS-VHS-quality video with PAL/NTSC output; it's priced below $1000.   The honors for Best Development Software went to Oberon's Prospero, arapid application development tool that implements building-block-styleprogramming.Where to FindApple Computer 408 996-1010; http://www.apple.com)Quarterdeck 800 683-6696 or 310 309-3700; fax 310 309-3215;http://www.quarterdeck.comDeneba Software 305 596-5644; fax 305 273-9069; e-mail deneba@aol.comDigital Semiconductor 800 332-2717IBM 800 426-2968; fax 919 517-1950Intergraph 205 730-2000; fax 205 730-2461Iomega 800 697-8833; fax 801 778-1000miro Computer 800 249-6476 or 415 855-0940; fax 415 855-9004Oberon Software 617 494-0990Panasonic 800 742-8086PowerQuest 801 226-8977; fax 801 226-8941; e-mail magic@powerquest.comRicoh Consumer Products 702 352-1600; fax 702 352-1615Symantec 800 441-7234 or 541 334-6054; http://www.symantec.comTseng Labs 215 968-0502Wyse Technology 408 473-1200; fax 408 473-2080Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. BEST OF COMDEX FINALISTSInternet Software:Fountain, an integrated VRML tool/Web browser; from Caligari (415-390-9600;http://www.caligari.com).HindSite, a personal Web-browsing tool indexes Web pages; from ISYS/OdysseyDevelopment (303 689-9998).Development Software:ClassAssist brings object oriented features to Visual Basic 4; fromSheridan Software Systems (516 753-0985).DB2 for Windows NT brings IBM's relational database development system toNT; from IBM (800 426-3333).Systems:Raptor 3 workstation, powered by the 333-MHz Alpha 21164 processor; fromDeskstation (913 599-1900).Powerized LX, fueled by dual 150-MHz PowerPC 604s; from FirePower Systems(415 462-3000).Portables:The Z-Note GT features a 12.1-inch active-matrix screen; from Zenith DataSystems (708 808-5000).OmniGo 100, a Geos-based PDA ($349) with an innovative flip-top design thataccepts input from pen or keyboard; from Hewlett Packard (800 443-1254).Applications Software:DecideRight decision-support software; from Avantos (510 654-4600; fax 510654-1276).MapInfo 3 Pro is a Win 95 mapping program with GPS software for real-timetracking; from MapInfo (518 285-6000).Operating System:Linux Pro 3.0 includes customer support; from WorkGroup Solutions (303699-7470; info@wgs.com).Utility:MPEG Converter software can do two-way conversion of Video for Windows AVIfiles to MPEG files; from Ulead Systems (310 523-9393; mkt@ulead.com).Perfector is a power-conversion device; from International PowerTechnologies (800 944-0356; fax 801 224-5872;http://www.sdic.com/IPT.html).Communications Software:CommSuite 95; from Delrina (800 239-2254; http://www.delrina.com).VideoPhone for low-cost Mac and Windows ($149 with camera) networkvideoconferencing; from Connectix (800 950-5880; info@connectix.com).Communications Hardware:The SSA Data Pump, a PCI card for high-performance Serial StorageArchitecture connectivity; from Pathlight Technology (607 266-4000; http://www.pathlight.com).Air Power, hardware/software package for one-way and two-way paging; fromMotorola (512 434-1502).Multimedia Development:Buster, low-cost video playback, tv tuner, and video capture/displayhardware; from Quadrant (610 964-7600).SAA7145, a multimedia bridge chip for low-cost video/audio capture; fromPhilips Semiconductor (408 991-2000).Printer:LaserJet 5Si; from Hewlett-Packard (800 752-0900).The Color Jetprinter 1020 provides black-and-white and color output; fromLexmark International (800 358-5835; http://www.lexmark.com).Input:LexiPen, a Chinese-handwriting-recognition program, from Motorola, LexicusDivision (800 LEX-ICUS).ScanJet 4Si, a $2999 networked scanner that delivers documents to yourdesktop; from HP (208 396-2551).Storage:The SmartCache IV SCSI RAID controller supports up to 64 MB of hardwarecache; from Distributed Processing Technology (407 830-5522).The DW-S114X Quadraspin CD-ROM Writer sells for less than $1300; fromPioneer New Media Technologies (310 952-2111; fax 310 952-3031).Display and Sound Devices:The WaveForce SW70XG chip set delivers outstanding audio, from Yamaha Sound(714 522-9011).The PanaFlat PF17 uses a flat tube in a 17-inch (diagonal) slim CRT topresent optically undistorted images; from Panasonic Communications andSystem Company (201 348-7000, 800-742-8086).Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. A PROGRAMMER NEEDS A MAIDBy:RICK GREHANBYTE columnist Jerry Pournelle occasionally summarizes certain products bysaying, ``If you need this, you need it bad.'' I hope he doesn't mind myborrowing that expression, because I have to use it to describe GeodesicSystems' Great Circle.   The Great Circle library fixes memory-management problems. By insertingthe library at the head of your linker's library list, you allow GreatCircle to take over the C/C++ memory-allocation/deallocation routinesmalloc(), free, new, and delete. The product's manual says that afterinstalling Great Circle, you may never have to call delete (if you're a C++programmer) or free() (if you're a C programmer) again. The manual isprobably correct.   Great Circle turns the C library's ``manual'' memory management systeminto an automatic garbage-collecting one. Great Circle keeps track of allallocated memory and all pointers referencing memory. And when a chunk ofmemory is no longer ``pointed to,'' Great Circle deallocates it for youautomatically (it even handles ``bizarre'' structures such as circularlists).   The package actually contains several variations on the basic GreatCircle library. One, for example, reports memory errors. When you link itin and run your program, it tells you where the memory leaks are while alsodescribing the extent of the problem.   In one sense, Great Circle is kind of spooky--especially on the C sideof things. The manual indicates that one reason why a piece of memory maynot be reclaimed is because an integer in your program may coincidentallycontain a value that's equal to the address of an allocated block. Thismeans that Great Circle prowls through your program's data regions,searching for pointers that are attached to allocated memory blocks.   When you install Great Circle, you're tempted to simply recompile yourapplication with it and never think about it again. You can certainly dothis, but Geodesic recommends a less lazy approach: The company suggestsyou include the reporting library in your project at development time. Thisallows you to catch and correct memory errors during development ratherthan rely on Great Circle to pick up your messes.   And this points to my one concern regarding this product: It's like asoftware housekeeper. When I was young, my family was lucky enough to havea daytime maid. She cleaned up after us. Consequently, I became quite aslob.   If you're a Windows user running Borland C++ or Microsoft Visual C++,Great Circle costs $495 for full support, or $345 for 60-day support. Unixworkstation users have to pay $1095 and $795 for equivalent packages. Ifyou need this, you need it bad.

GIORGISNetwork administrators need an easy way to track down their company'shardware and software assets. They also need tools to distribute andinstall software automatically during off-peak hours. And when users callthe in-house help desk, support personnel should be able to fix problemsremotely. Printer and queue management, centralized virus protection, andstorage management are added bonuses.   For this roundup, we looked at five network management products thataddress these desktop issues. All provide server and workstationmanagement, inventory control, electronic software distribution (ESD),software metering and license control, and network monitoring. We did nottest device- and wire-management programs for this review.   The reviewed products fall into two functional categories. Microsoft'sSystems Management Server (SMS) and Symantec's Norton Administrator forNetworks support WANs in addition to LANs and are therefore suited toenterprise management. Intel's LANDesk Management Suite, McAfee Associates'BrightWorks, and Frye Computer Systems' Frye Utilities for Networks workonly on LANs. We summarize the major features common to all five in ``TheRoles of Network Management Software'' on page 148.The Manager's Choice   Intel's LANDesk Management Suite is the best in the LAN category, aswell as the best overall. It has a comprehensive and well-integrated set oftools for NetWare LANs, an excellent tutorial, and a good reporting engine.Its modules for monitoring applications, traffic, and servers areespecially good.   For WANs, Microsoft's SMS beats Norton Administrator for Networks by awide margin. By using a SQL database for data collection, SMS provides anexcellent platform for building an enterprise-wide managementinfrastructure.McAfee's BrightWorks   With its excellent on-line references, good report writer, andversatility, BrightWorks nips at the heels of LANDesk Management Suite fortop honors. It's a good choice for administrators managing a NetWareenvironment.   Though the BrightWorks help system is a bit skimpy, its Adobe Acrobatviewer makes accessing the well-organized on-line manuals easy. LikeMicrosoft SMS, it comes with Crystal Reports. This software gives you lotsof flexibility in designing and generating reports, as well as importingdata from ODBC-compliant databases. Only LANDesk Management Suite'sreporting tool is comparable.   BrightWorks' cluttered interface makes some operations awkward, such ascreating software distribution packages and setting up software metering.But BrightWorks' real sore point is performance. In our test that measuresthe average size of frames transferred during an inventory scan (wherelarger frames mean more efficient use of network bandwidth), BrightWorksfinished dead last, not far behind Frye Utilities for Networks but lightyears behind LANDesk Management Suite and Microsoft SMS. Still,BrightWorks' competitive feature set and pricing make it a viable choicefor NetWare installations.Frye Utilities for Networks   Consisting of 10 separate DOS-based modules accessible from a menucalled the Frye Menu Integrator, Frye Utilities for Networks is the mostpoorly integrated product we tested. Only a few of its management modulesshare a common database, while each of the modules in the other fourproducts write to and read from a single database.   This virtually nonexistent support for Windows and a proprietarydatabase scheme hamper the usefulness of Frye Utilities. The company saysit plans an upgrade that addresses these shortcomings and that will employa single, ODBC-based database engine.   Individually, the Frye Utilities are by far the easiest to install, setup, and use. But since they are all DOS applications, Windows users mustpay special attention to conventional memory allocation. Some applications,such as the LAN Directory, can easily run out of memory after you've loadednetwork drivers, multimedia device drivers, and memory managers.   In addition, a lack of flexibility in data management and systemadministration, and a total lack of an on-line reference, earn FryeUtilities the lowest ranking in the LAN category.   This is not to say that Frye Utilities lacks good points. The packageprovides a wealth of statistics, is very versatile, and is jam-packed withfeatures (see the comparison tables on pages 150 and 151).Intel's LANDesk Management Suite   The sole four-star product in the group, LANDesk Management Suite standsout as the only one both to fully integrate all its management andadministration components and to use a single database. Its competitors allrely on utility modules to complete their offerings.   LANDesk Management Suite provides a wealth of network administrationutilities with a robust desktop management environment that includes anapplication monitor, an excellent traffic monitor, and an effective servermonitor with very good alert handling. It does not take much time to set upand configure. All told, LANDesk Management Suite scores extremely well inall our major evaluation criteria (see the ratings box on page 147).   Very good database maintenance and system administration, coupled withan excellent help facility, tutorial, and reporting engine, make thisproduct's lack of an on-line reference seem unimportant.Symantec's Norton Administrator for Networks   Symantec approaches desktop management strictly from the end-node angle,so its product does not provide services such as network and servermonitoring, threshold setting, and alert notification. Instead, the NortonAdministrator for Networks integrates the three core desktop services ofinventory management, software distribution, and application metering.   This package's chief weakness is its lack of support for NetWare fileservers. But it also suffers from a limited, inflexible reporting tool;below-average versatility; and poor performance that is only slightlybetter than that of second-worst Frye Utilities for Networks.   On the plus side, Norton's management console facilitates many tasks,such as managing sites, launching core applications, and interfacing withadd-on administration utilities. Good print documentation and acontext-sensitive on-line help facility make up for the lack of on-linereferences.   Norton Administrator for Networks' significant advantage over MicrosoftSMS (which did, however, beat it in the overall rankings) is its openness.Operating at the applications level, Norton's functions are independent ofunderlying network transports and should perform equally well under anytype of LAN and WAN connection method. Symantec's software is also lesscomplex than Microsoft's, which is based on a sophisticated SQL databasemanager.Microsoft Systems Management Server   For companies with geographically dispersed LANs and mixed networks,Microsoft SMS is the best choice. It combines high quality, ease of use,efficient performance, and decent versatility. SMS lacks software metering,but it is excellent at software distribution and has very good inventorycomponents. Extensive on-line help and tutorials guide you safely throughcomplicated tasks.   To provide a SQL database engine for its management product, Microsoftdesigned SMS with slightly higher resource needs than its competitors.Besides a full-scale copy of Microsoft SQL Server running with Windows NTServer 3.51, SMS requires 28 MB of RAM. Additional management consoles alsorequire Windows NT Server or NT Workstation 3.51. SMS has a complex setupprocedure; but, once up and running, its drag-and-drop interface and goodon-line documentation make it easy to use.    SMS also has the most complete security system, and its performance iscomparable to that of Intel's LANDesk Management Suite. It is alone withthe Intel product in supporting the Desktop Management Interface (DMI), anemerging standard for identifying and managing network components.This report contains the partial results of a recent issue of SoftwareDigest, a monthly publication of NSTL, Inc.

SNMP does not address theconfiguration and systems management requirements of end nodes (servers andworkstations). So, proposals for distributed desktop standards, such as theDesktop Management Interface (DMI), have arisen in the last few years.Among the products evaluated for this roundup, only Microsoft SMS and theIntel LANDesk Management Suite support DMI-enabled products.   Defined by the Desktop Management Task Force, a 300-company consortium,DMI is an open architecture framework designed for managing computers,servers, peripherals, and software products. When it is complete, DMI willcontain rules for creating management interface files (MIFs). These filesspecify, in ASCII text with defined grammar and syntax, attributes forclasses of products.   The openness of DMI's architecture allows it to coexist with standardssuch as Plug and Play and SNMP. DMI complements Plug and Play by drawingconfiguration information from it into the standard MIF database. DMI workswith SNMP by allowing MIFs to be mapped to SNMP management information base(MIB) files (see below).Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: In the Desktop Management Interface standard,each network component has a management interface file (MIF) thatidentifies it. MIFs can be mapped to, and closely resemble, SNMP managementinformation base (MIB) files. That's a sample MIB file right above.MIB.NGC-------monitor OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso org(3) dod(6) internet(1) private(4)enterprises(1) ngc(110) ngcsystems(1) servers(1) monitor(1) }consoles OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso org(3) dod(6) internet(1)private(4)enterprises(1) ngc(110) ngcsystems(1) consoles(2) }    --syst(1) servers(1) }    ngc OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { enterprises 110 }    ngcsystems OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ngc 1 }    --servers OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { syst 1}    monitor OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { servers 1 }    traps OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { monitor 1 }    pcc OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { consoles 1 }Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. STRONGARM TACTICSThis amazing little RISC chip has PDA written all over itBy:DICK POUNTAINThe handwriting is on the wall: Personal digital assistants (PDAs) needmore horsepower if they' re ever going to excel at handwriting recognitionand other CPU-intensive tasks. And the breakthrough that might carry PDAsto the next level may be a new RISC chip called the StrongARM.   This fascinating microprocessor is a joint project of Digital Equipmentand Advanced RISC Machines (ARM). Digital, of course, makes the Alpha AXPfamily, the fastest RISC processors in the world. ARM makes the ARM610 andARM710 processors that drive Apple's Newton MessagePad and 3DO'shome-videogame machines. The StrongARM is founded on a hybrid technologythat combines the raw power of the Alpha with the super-efficient powerconsumption of the ARMs.   It's a combination tailor-made for PDAs. The conflicting requirements ofhigh speed, low power consumption, and a small chip package rule out thevast majority of off-the-shelf microprocessors.   The first StrongARM will be a 1.5-volt chip that runs at an astonishing160 MHz. That might seem slow compared to the 333-MHz Alpha 21164, but it'sfour times faster than the speediest chip currently available from ARM, andit blows away everything else at this low voltage. A 2-V, 215-MHz StrongARM will follow shortly. For the first time, a CPU that outperforms ahigh-end Pentium will be available for use in battery-powered PDAs.   ``At these performance levels, handwriting recognition stops being ahard problem, and voice recognition is what you can start to worry about,''says Dave Jaggar, ARM's market-development manager.Fabricating for Low Power   Creating a hybrid design like the StrongARM isn't as simple as gluingtogether two architectures as disparate as the Alpha and the ARM. To attainthe desired clock speeds, engineers from both companies worked together toredesign the whole data-path and cache structure of the CPU. Nevertheless,Digital's leading-edge fabrication process is ultimately what permits theStrongARM to run four times faster than previous ARM chips. Thearchitectural changes exploit the speed of this silicon.   Digital's newest fabrication plant uses a next-generation process calledCMOS-6, the same process Digital uses for its Alpha 21164A, which willexceed 350 MHz. It's a 0.35-micron, four-layer-metal CMOS process thatyields high-speed, low-voltage transistors, thanks to extremely thin oxideinsulation layers only 65 angstroms deep. Ultimately, this process willyield transistors that run at 0.9 V.   Low voltage is a crucial design point because power consumption varieswith the square of the voltage. A chip fabricated on the 2-V CMOS-6 processwill consume only 37 percent as much power as a chip fabricated on acomparable 3.3-V process. At 1.5 V, the power consumption is only 21percent as much. The small feature size also reduces capacitance, savingeven more power.   The actual die size will depend on how much cache memory is on the chip.Although this hasn't been announced, the first StrongARMs will probablyhave 32 KB of primary cache. By any measure, however, the StrongARM core istiny--a mere 115,000 transistors, compared to 3.3 million on a Pentium.Digital and ARM say their goal is to achieve performance of at least 300million instructions per second per watt, at a cost of about 35 cents perMIPS. The first StrongARM chips are expected to consume around 500milliwatts (less than half that consumed by a PowerPC 603).   In the consumer-electronics market, it's not sufficient just to have thecheapest CPU. The peripheral chips--such as memory and graphics--must becheap, too. Very few low-voltage peripheral chips are available today, sothe Strong-ARM is designed to work with regular 3.3-V components. This wasa tough bullet to bite because it requires two different voltages on thesame silicon, with separate sets of power rails and the attendant problemsof eliminating noise and current leakage.   To further trim costs, the engineers designed the StrongARM's systeminterface so it can be either 32 or 64 bits wide. System designers cansynchronize the interface to the CPU core (at fractional speeds rangingfrom one-half to one-ninth the core frequency) or to an external clock asfast as 66 MHz.   An even more radical design twist is that the circuits useedge-triggered latches with conditional clocks, instead of the more commonlevel-triggered latches. This means the StrongARM inputs the clock signalinto a section of logic only when that section is needed, so a functionunit consumes power only when used. To go along with this, a newinstruction stops all the internal clocks until they're awakened by aninterrupt. These features should make it easier to implement energy-savingsleep modes.The StrongARM Pipeline   The StrongARM team decided against a superscalar architecture.Superscalar pipelines, multiple execution units, and all the extra logicrequired to issue multiple instructions and check for dependencies wouldhave increased the StrongARM's cost, power consumption, and design time.The engineers omitted out-of-order execution for the same reasons.   Instead of going superscalar, the StrongARM engineers chose to lengthenthe execution pipeline. While the ARM7 has three stages, the StrongARM hasfive. An even longer pipeline would allow higher clock speeds, but it wouldalso exceed the power budget. The architecture is kept as simple aspossible, with clean data paths and low-latency execution units to takeadvantage of the fast silicon.   The original ARM architecture has a dual-purpose barrel shifter closelycoupled to the ALU. The barrel shifter handles arithmetic-and-shiftoperations, and it also aligns data and extracts bytes. In the StrongARM,the barrel shifter has been moved aside so that shifts by zero bypass itcompletely. This yields a faster data path for the majority of instructionsthat don't need shifts.   Older ARMs used the main ALU to calculate address displacements, but theStrongARM does it with two dedicated +4 adders that can calculateconcurrently. These adders are attached to the program counter and theload/store bus. The StrongARM's register file now has five ports--three forreading and two for writing--so a load can complete simultaneously with awrite to a register, yielding a load-use penalty of only one cycle.   The five stages of the Strong-ARM's pipeline are instruction fetch;register read and instruction issue; execute; buffer and cache access; andregister write. In typical Alpha style, this pipeline has extensive pathsfor the forwarding of branch addresses and ALU results.   There is no branch prediction at all. Instead, the StrongARM minimizesbranch penalties by executing branches at an early stage in the pipeline.It calculates branch addresses during the issue stage and forwards thempast the other stages. It can also forward condition codes from aninstruction in the execute stage. For example, assume the followingsequence of compare and branch instructions:CMP R0,R1 ; compare registersBNE loop1 ; branch if not equal   During the execute stage, the CMP instruction sets the N, Z, C, and Vcondition flags. Meanwhile, during the same cycle, the BNE instruction isin the issue stage, computing its destination address and the address ofthe next instruction (thanks to those parallel +4 adders). The StrongARMforwards all these results directly to the fetch stage, which costs aone-cycle penalty if the branch is taken, but costs no penalty at all for abranch not taken.   This yields very good performance, considering how much extrabranch-prediction logic (and hence power) it avoids. Of course, it onlyworks this well for a single-issue processor. With a four-way superscalarchip, the branch-taken penalty would be four instructions.   The StrongARM has no on-chip FPU. However, the multiplier-adder unitattached to the ALU is significantly enhanced. The multiplier performssigned and unsigned multiply and multiply-accumulate operations, generating32- or 64-bit results. The multiply-accumulate instruction is similar tothe MAC instruction in a digital signal processor. The multiplier canretire 12 bits of result per cycle, and the adder can retire 32 bits. Thisyields a total latency of two to four cycles for a 32-bit result and threeto five cycles for a 64-bit result. (The timing varies because the unitcompletes short operands more quickly.) While this may seem long comparedto the latest CPUs, remember that a cycle on the StrongARM is less than 5nanoseconds.Down to the Crossroads   The StrongARM chip will drive into the intersection of computers andconsumer electronics. When Digital launched the Alpha processor in 1992, itpromised that the new architecture would span the whole spectrum fromworkstations to hand-held devices. But the latter category has alwaysseemed an improbable use of the Alpha because of the chip's voracious powerconsumption. The StrongARM could fill that niche.Where to FindAdvanced RISC Machines (ARM)Cambridge, U.K.+ 44 1223-400-400http://www.arm.comDigital SemiconductorAustin, TX(800) 332-2717Illustration(s):Illustration: Figure: StrongARM Core ArchitectureThe StrongARM is very simple by modern microprocessor standards. It devotesno hardware to superscalar pipelines, branch prediction, or out-of-orderexecution. Its data paths are streamlined to exploit Digital's high clockspeeds.

Is he referring to the existing GUIs on top of X Windowor to the architecture? If he is comparing to NeWs or NextStep, then therecan be a lively discussion about it. But if his comparison is withMicrosoft Windows, then he doesn't know what he is talking about. You canimplement any GUI toolkit (including Windows and the Macintosh GUI ) on topof X. Try doing this with Microsoft Windows (in all its different flavors).I would prefer the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) over Windows 95 anyday. If you want a slick interface, try SGI's DeskView. Lest readers thinkI am unduly biased toward X, I have a few bones to pick with X, but I guessI have the entire skeleton to pick with Microsoft Windows.Harish P. Hiriyannaiahharish@infosoft.comI've used and programmed under X Window far longer than under MicrosoftWindows. While I'll confess to being a fan, X Window's support forcommercial applications is still sadly wanting compared to Windows orMacintosh. Pick either of the most widely used toolkit layers--OSF/Motif orOpen Look--and check out any complex element (the standard File Open dialogbox, for example) that also exists in Windows. The Motif version doesn'tmeasure up to Windows' when viewed from any perspective: look, feel, orAPI. CDE is gorgeous, but it doesn't fix toolkit-level issues. I use XWindow every day, but when I run commercial applications, I run them on aWindows system. There are reasons we find far more mainstream applicationsfor Windows than Unix.

StoughtonLoyal users of earlier versions of Lotus Approach and anyone looking for aversatile desktop database will love Lotus Approach 96. Always a winner ofhigh marks for ease of use, this 32-bit version for Windows 95 and NTstands toe-to-toe with its worthy opponent, Microsoft Access 7.0.   SmartMaster, which is a new applications builder, quickly puts togetherforms and tables for more than 50 familiar applications. Several newassistants, interactive aids that do the intricate relational-design workbehind the scenes while you focus on defining the business aspects of dataand results, make their debut in Approach 96.   The find assistant's point-and-click, fill-in-the blank query builderallows you to quickly find database records. You can then name thestatements you build and save them for recall and execution. Named queriesalso help select items for a report, a set of mailing labels, a worksheet,or a chart. During report design, data appears in your layout due to theenhanced report assistant, which shows a WYSIWYG preview of printedoutput.   Enterprise users will find improved integration and connectivity toLotus Notes and tighter integration with Lotus SmartSuite and MicrosoftOffice. A new team-security feature controls access rights, assignspasswords, and manages group or individual privileges. Approach 96 canparticipate as a basic OLE client or as an OLE 2 automation client orserver. You can register, select, and address OCXes as you can internalobjects.   The program continues its use of dBase IV as its default databasestructure, with options to work with dBase III, FoxPro, Access, Paradox,SQL Server, Oracle, and ODBC data sources. The beta version BYTE evaluatedstumbled when asked to open an Access 2.0 database, but it worked fine witha FoxPro 2.5 file. The company explained that the problem was related tothe unavailability of Microsoft drivers for Access 2.0 and higher. Asolution is expected.

It'sone of the first portables with Intel's new 120-MHz Pentium for mobilesystems. It also offers the new Start and application keys found in Windows95 keyboards for desktop systems. The Solo V120 comes close to supplying aone-system solution, with the features of a high-end desktop PC in alightweight multimedia notebook.   Intel's 0.35-micron manufacturing process accounts for the CPU's smallfootprint (less than half the size of its 75- and 90-MHz siblings) andsubsequent low power consumption. However, the Solo systems use Opti'sViper-N chip set rather than Intel's, which limits data streaming to around60 MBps, whereas Intel's Mobile Triton chip set would support 100 MBps.   With 256 KB of external burst-mode cache memory, 16 MB of RAM, aremovable 720-MB hard drive, a double-speed CD-ROM drive, 16-bit sound,Microsoft Office Pro, and a 10.2-inch active-matrix VGA LCD (Super VGA isoptional) with 1 MB of video memory on a VL-Bus, the Solo V120 easilyfulfills Gateway's features and power goals. At 6.3 pounds without the ACadapter but with the floppy drive, its weight is acceptable. The resultsturned in by the Solo V120 on BYTE's Thumper II battery tests--2 hours, 43minutes--are about 30 minutes less than that of the 90-MHz Pentium-basedDell Latitude XPi P90T.   The sleek 2-inch-thick letter-size case feels solid. The screen is largeand well protected but difficult to see in bright light. The Alps EZ Padpointing device and the floppy drive are integrated rather than hanging offthe notebook's edges. Other features are a PC Card Type III slot and amodular bay (not hot-swappable) for a floppy drive or CD-ROM drive. Themachine has IR, serial, parallel, VGA, and PS/2 mouse ports. An optionaldocking bar duplicates many of these but adds a line-out audio jack and aMIDI/game port.   The Solo V120 represents a remarkable achievement: a cool-running120-MHz mobile computer that performs 30 percent faster than a 90-MHzdesktop system. But after just 2 hours and 10 minutes of word processingwith advanced power management on, the battery is kaput.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: Graph: Benchmark ResultsPhotograph(s):Photograph: Photograph: Solo V120 (as tested) $4899Gateway 2000North Sioux City, SD(800) 846-2000(605) 232-2000on CompuServe, go gatewayCircle 976 on Inquiry Card.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. SHARE APPLICATIONSBased on Rockwell's chip set and the DigiTalk standard, V.34 Boca OfficeCommunicator and SoundExpression 28.8SVD let you talk and shareapplications simultaneously over a single analog telephone line.

Usually, therearen't any sources to which I can point them.   But even though we had to wait two years for this book, it's still worthreading. It covers the Pentium in more detail than anything except theofficial manuals from Intel. Unlike the official manuals, it offers a moreindependent point of view. For example, it doesn't shy away from discussing(albeit too briefly) rival microprocessors from AMD, Cyrix, NexGen (beforethe announced merger, of course), and the leading RISC vendors.   Is this book truly indispensable? Yes, if you're a systems designer, CPUengineer, or avid wirehead. But average users will find it too technical.The book stumbles when it tries to woo beginners.

Fogel IEEE Press, ISBN 0-7803-1038-1, $49.95Evolutionary Computation serves as an introduction to the murky crossroadswhere hot new technologies--genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzylogic, and AI--collide. The underlying notion is attractive. Instead ofdesigning software from algorithms, let a thousand flowers bloom. Generatemany possible software solutions, let them compete against each other, pickthe top performers, and combine their features according to rules thatmimic natural selection in the living world. Given enough ``generations,''so the theory goes, you will end up with a superior solution that embodiessurvival of the fittest.   The practice is more complex, and the theoretical underpinnings aremessier. For one thing, not even biologists agree on what they mean by theword fitness, and Fogel points out that the two major definitions (genefrequency and population fitness) have very different implications fordesigning software that evolves. Concentrating on gene frequency produces abottom-up approach that stresses decomposing the process and building fromelementary pieces. Using population fitness tends toward top-downsolutions. Given that the algorithms for real-world problems are complexand nonlinear, neither approach is completely satisfactory.   Evolutionary Computation's strength is David Fogel's approach. He isneither immersed in the minutiae of his subject nor does he make grandpronouncements. The general reader who wants to know what the fuss is aboutwill find Fogel's approach both informative and stimulating.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELLBy:Jeff MacClayWITH OPEN EYES Voyager, 1 Bridge St., Irvington, NY 10533, (914) 591-5500,$39.95BEETHOVEN LIVES UPSTAIRS BMG Interactive Entertainment, 1540 Broadway, NewYork, NY 10036, (212) 930-4000, $39.95CD-ROMs meant for children are either great or horrible.

Just start with a good foundation.By:DAN THOMSEN AND WINN SCHWARTAUWhen building new systems, there are always design trade-offs to be madebetween functionality and security. Do we include the cool widget or thatboring, constraining security feature? Historically, the widget usuallywon. But as Internet connectivity grows, a new class of criminals iscausing electronic mayhem and committing crimes.   Despite the fact that strong, easy-to-manage information security is onthe top of corporate wish lists, it is often pushed to the bottom of theheap when it comes to implementation. Security is never free, but you canreduce the cost of secure systems by creating flexible security mechanismsas a solid base to build on. Type enforcement is a straightforward securitymechanism that provides the flexibility to balance security andfunctionality.The Dawn of Computer Security   In 1985, the federal government published the first set of computersecurity criteria that computer professionals could understand and buildinto systems. Officially called the Trusted Computer Security EvaluationCriteria, it is more popularly known as the Orange Book. It offers a rangeof ratings for secure systems. The ratings start with D, for systems withno security, and go to A1, which requires formal methods to verifysecurity.   One of the key elements of the Orange Book was mandatory access control,where all the resources in the computer (i.e., users, files, services, andprograms) are labeled with a security level, or sensitivity. The labelidentifies the degree of sensitivity of each resource, such asUnclassified, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. Labels effectivelyassign the data on the system to separate ``buckets.'' The goal, orsecurity policy, is to keep sensitive data from getting into theleast-sensitive bucket.   Many initial Orange Book implementations were too restrictive. Thefederal government funded seven years of R&D to create a flexibleimplementation. At the heart of this solution is the type-enforcementsecurity model.Type Enforcement   Type enforcement is a security mechanism that gives every program on thesystem permission to do only those things it requires to do its job. Thisis called least privilege and applies to applications, files, and OSes.   Type enforcement works by grouping all the processes of the system intoclasses based on least privilege. Each process group is called a domain. Ina similar manner, the files on the system are grouped into classes calledtypes. The Domain Definition Table on page 156 describes each domain'saccess rights for each type. The table cannot be changed while the systemis running.   The DBMS can interact only with database files, and the text editor caninteract only with user files. The World Wide Web server can read userfiles but not modify them and is the only domain with access to thenetwork. A similar table is constructed for controlling how domains caninteract with each other.   One of the most important file types is the executable file. Tightcontrols are placed on which programs can be executed in a domain and whocan modify them. Destructive software, such as viruses and Trojan horses,can be stopped cold because they cannot modify the executable files.Assured Pipelines   Providing separation of applications is not enough to ensure security;you must also control how the information flows through the system. Typeenforcement creates a kind of pipeline to organize data flow betweenprograms (see the figure ``Assured Pipeline'' above).   Many applications are part of larger systems. To assure that informationmoves securely, type enforcement controls the data each program can readand write. Each program can only read from the stage in front of it andwrite to the next stage of the pipeline. No stage of the pipeline can beskipped, and how the data flows through the system is tightly controlled.   A divide-and-conquer approach to building secure applications is anotheradvantage of assured pipelines. By splitting a large program into smallerpieces, it is easier to analyze and be sure the pieces are operatingcorrectly.   For example, suppose you wanted all the outgoing mail messages to bedigitally signed before leaving your network, to prove who sent themessage. You could modify the word processor to include the digitalsignature, but it would be difficult to make sure you modified it in allthe correct places. If instead you created a program whose job was to checkfor the digital signature, you could feel confident the program was workingcorrectly. By using an assured pipeline, you can make sure no data reachesthe network software unless it has passed through the new data filter.Type Enforcement in a Firewall   Today, type enforcement has been incorporated in a firewall to provideflexible isolation between networks. Isolation between the Internet and anorganization's internal network is extremely important to protect againstmalicious attack. Type enforcement offers an ideal mechanism to isolateinternal corporate and organizational networks from the Internet.   If a firewall is to secure internetwork access, placing it on aninsecure platform makes little sense. Incorporating type enforcement allowsfor a flexible policy to be enforced. Equally important is to make thepolicy mandatory--do not let key security information be changed while thesystem is connected to the hostile network. This eliminates the possibilityof ``helpful reconfigurations'' by Internet hackers.   Separate the two networks on the inside of the machine. An Internetfirewall's prime goal is to keep the information separate until a securitycheck has been performed to verify that the information is permitted tocross the policy-driven barrier. The solution is network stack separation,using two distinct network cards.   A type-enforcement firewall with two network cards can also always tellwhere information originated, no matter how clever the intruder. The twonetwork feeds are connected to two domain-separated network drivers, thuspreventing network protocol spoofing (i.e., an advanced hacking techniquewhere attackers handcraft network packets to mask their true origin). Thetwo stacks maintain control over the information coming from either side.Only software defined and controlled by type enforcement can determinewhich information may move between networks (see the figure ``Using TypeEnforcement in a Firewall'' below).   Always be on the lookout for malicious acts. If any software on thesystem tries to access information outside its bucket, either the softwareis flawed or a potentially harmful entity is controlling it. Take controlof the situation. Watch the software more closely through auditing, or shutthe software down immediately.   Finally, apply the concept of least privilege. By limiting the privilegea system has, the amount of damage that can be caused if that system iscompromised can be limited. Consider, for example, the sendmail program. Itis the network server that receives and forwards mail on most Internethosts. Unfortunately, sendmail has been littered with vulnerabilities thathave let attackers take control of an entire system. The latestvulnerability revolved around the syslog system call letting attackersoverwrite sendmail's stack and take control of sendmail. Once in control,the attackers started an interactive shell program and launched theirattack on the rest of the system.   Using type enforcement and least privilege prevents the syslogvulnerability from being exploited without changing the sendmail code.Sendmail is placed in a separate domain that can only read data from theexternal network and write data into the queues to be forwarded to theinternal network. Sendmail cannot cause other programs to be created orexecuted.   Even if the attacker got control of sendmail, all he or she could do isinterrupt the mail service, which could have been done anyway using anetwork flooding attack. Because type enforcement controls execution, thehacker could not even execute an interactive shell and would have no hopeof penetrating other domains.Not Just for Firewalls   Many other applications can be secured cost-effectively using typeenforcement. Nowhere is security as critical as it is in cryptographicsystems. Key management controls, encryption algorithms, key distribution,public-key repositories, and other critical subsystems can all be tightlycontrolled in their own protected domains.   Applying type enforcement and its data separation is a natural extensionto databases containing sensitive information. And in environments wherestrict controls are placed on communications resources, type enforcementcan control access to the communications resources and make sure that thesoftware allocating the resources cannot be tampered with or bypassed.   By their nature, secure systems are more expensive to build. As aresult, secure products often lag behind in current functionality. If youare going to get the features into secure systems in a timely andcost-effective manner, good tools are needed. Nowhere is that moreimportant than in putting the right building blocks in the OS.   The type-enforcement security mechanism gives the OS a solid foundationfor securing applications. Type enforcement can be used to protectapplications from malicious modification by outsiders, other errantapplications, and the application itself.DOMAIN DEFINITION TABLEA file's type specifies what domain, or application, can access the file.Application             Database        User file       NetworkDBMS                    Read, write     No access       No accessText editor             No access       Read, write     No accessWorld Wide Web server   No access       Read            Read, writeIllustration(s):Illustration: Figure: Assured PipelineIllustration: Figure: Using Type Enforcement in a FirewallA type-enforcement firewall secures data by separating information from theInternet and the internal network.About the Author(s):Dan Thomsen is a senior research scientist at Secure Computing Corp.

You've probably got alist of tools you'd like for that purpose. A centrally administered menu(in the form of a Program Manager-like shell) on each desktop could helpcontrol how users access networked applications and control what users haveaccess to. This kind of control can reduce LAN support costs.   A configuration management tool can help you manage all those desktops.Several vendors, such as Novell, Symantec, McAfee Associates, and ComputerKnacks, offer such tools today. Typically, these packages allow a managerto edit WIN.INI files, script commands, and limit a user's desktop choices(for example, by removing the DOS-prompt option or by making ``Open'' underthe File menu nonfunctional).   The desire for configuration management is not limited to Intel-basedPCs running Windows. Last year, configuration management was one of thefactors that earned Digital Equipment's Multia MultiClient system the BYTEBest of Comdex award in the category of desktop computers (see ``Notebooks,NT Clusters Capture Awards,'' February 1995 BYTE). The Multia isessentially a low-cost Alpha-based Windows NT workstation that comesbundled with configuration management features. One of the main advantagesof Digital's Multia line is the set of configuration tools; they give usersa lot of control over their desktop environment.Integration with OS and NOS   Configuration management tools are becoming more tightly integrated witheither the network operating system or with systems management tools. Forexample, rather than just linking an icon on a user's screen to anapplication on a specific server, a configuration management program mightlink the execution of an application with a software metering program. Inthat way, when all the licenses for a particular application are used up,the icon associated with that application would no longer be displayed on auser's screen. Or, you might connect levels of access (e.g., read-only vs.write) with an organizational structure previously defined in a NovellBindery or network directory service. So when a new sales associate isadded to the network, for example, that person would automatically be ableto look up customer account information, while a newly added sales managerwould automatically be given the privilege to make changes in customerfiles.   Configuration management of the desktop is becoming increasingly popularbecause many managers see it as a way to reduce their rising LAN supportcosts. Over a five-year period, the average cost per user for LAN supportis $3278, according to the Gartner Group. That's more than $2 million peryear, on average, for a 700-node LAN. In contrast, the average annual costper user for equipment (including network server hardware, desktop adaptercards, cabling, hubs, connectivity software, and installation fees) is only$885 (most of which is spent in the first year when equipment ispurchased).   A cost-of-ownership study by the Meta Group found similarly high numbersfor LAN support. Meta estimates that the cost per client over a five-yearperiod is $19,504 (or about $3900 per client per year).   Configuration management tools can reduce the administrative burden on aLAN staff in a number of ways (see the list on page 160). By replacing thestandard Windows Program Manager with a centrally administered desktopmanager, you can get rid of many potentially confusing options. Forexample, you might provide icons only for programs the user has accessrights to. Or, you can remove the Properties Menu option on a user-by-useror group-by-group basis to prevent tampering.   At a higher level, you could integrate network rights into the desktopenvironment to reduce administrative tasks. For example, if the marketinggroup is allowed access to a graphics application, adding a user to themarketing group in SYSCON would make the graphics application icon appearon the user's desktop automatically. Therefore, double administration isnot required.   User interfaces also make it easier for people to get at networkedapplications and resources. Users need only click on an icon to start anapplication or to gain access to a resource, such as a printer. Thisreduces training costs.   A well-designed user interface hides the complexity of a networkoperation. For instance, launching an application from a UI cantransparently handle changes of directories (to load a data file) and candirect the output to a printer specifically set up for a particularapplication. Without the UI, the user might need to know where a data fileis located, how to change directories to load that file, and how to directthe output to that printer. None of these tasks is monumental, but for auser unfamiliar with network directories or, for that matter, uncomfortablewith working on a computer, commands to perform these tasks may seem like aforeign language.Helping Win 95 Users   Some companies are looking at configuration management tools to savetraining costs associated with moving to Windows 95. As Windows 95 isrolled out in an organization, a company using a configuration managementtool may opt to keep a Windows 3.x Program Manager-like interface displayedon everyone's PC. That way, the users see no change at all. When adepartment completes its Windows 95 training, the LAN manager can go to acentrally administered configuration tool and make the necessaryadjustments so that each PC shows a Win 95 display rather than the ProgramManager-like display.   Another way a configuration management tool can help with the migrationto Win 95 is by controlling access to Win 95 applications. Suppose you'removing to Win 95 department by department. You'd like users who've beenupgraded to have access to the new applications, but you don't want usersstill running Windows 3.x to try running Win 95 applications (that couldmean nervous breakdowns at the help desk).   Ordinarily, it's a nightmare trying to handle this mixed environment.However, this administrative task could be made easier if a configurationmanagement tool is tightly integrated with systems management software. Forexample, you might use a software-inventory program to determine if a PC isrunning Win 95. Ideally, you'd like to be able to take this information andautomatically make it available to a centrally administered desktopconfiguration management tool; then, a user will see a Win 95 applicationicon only if his or her PC is capable of running it.   In some cases, you might have two versions of an application on thenetwork--say Word 6.0 and Word for Win 95. You can probably appreciate theadministrative nightmare one would face trying to match a user's access tothese programs based on whether (and when) they've been upgraded to Win 95.Again, you'd like to be able to off-load some of this administrative work.It would be very helpful to have the icon for the most current applicationbe displayed automatically when a user's PC is upgraded.Limit Options and Limit Problems   Good user interfaces also reduce network management costs. Basically, aUI limits a user's options, thus restricting the types of problems a staffhas to deal with. A central configuration tool can make certain thingsinvisible to the users. For example, as you add file servers, a particularapplication might move from one machine to another. For some users thischange can be upsetting. They may have step-by-step instructions on how toopen a particular file. Then when a file moves, their normal routine won'twork. They might not know enough about DOS directories, NetWare drives, oroff-the-shelf applications to be able to figure out how to do things likechange a directory to get the file.   You could also use a configuration tool to link a hardware-inventoryprogram and a user's ability to run an application. This would let youcheck to see if a user's PC has the appropriate video card or enough memoryto run a particular application, for example. If a user's machine doesn'thave the right stuff, you'd like that information to be passed to a Windowsconfiguration management program so that the icon for that application isnot displayed on that machine. This would head off an application bombingand mean one less call to the help desk.   Configuration management tools can also be used to help project thecorporate identity. A bank that uses PCs to show customer accountinformation might not want a Beavis and Butt-Head screen saver flashing onthe screen. A configuration tool can make sure every terminal displays thecorporate logo instead.   Such control over the desktop environment will be possible as newconfiguration management tools become more tightly integrated with the NOSor with systems management tools. LAN administrators will thus have bettercontrol of user access to applications and data.Product InformationComputer KnacksShrewsbury, NJ(908) 530-0262fax: (908) 741-0972Digital EquipmentMaynard, MA(800) 344-4825(508) 493-5111fax: (508) 493-8780http://www.dec.comMcAfee AssociatesSanta Clara, CA(800) 866-6585(408) 988-3832http://www.mcafee.comNovellOrem, UT(800) 453-1267(801) 222-6000fax: (800) 668-5329http://www.novell.comSymantecCupertino, CA(800) 441-7234(408) 253-9600fax: (408) 252-4694http://www.symantec.comHow Centralized Configuration Management Helps-- Masks complexity of the network from users-- Reduces user options, making LAN support easier-- Reduces training costs-- Facilitates changes when applications move or   devices are added to the network-- Keeps users from trying to run programs their PCs cannot support-- Enforces uniform corporate image in customer-service settings-- Tightens securityIllustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: Graph: Where LAN Support Dollars GoIt costs an average of $3278 per year to support an average LAN user,according to analysts at the Gartner Group (Stamford, CT).About the Author(s):Salvatore Salamone is a BYTE editor who often covers the network beat.

WebsterGrady Booch calls it ``one of the dirty little secrets of softwareengineering'': Success in software development depends most upon thequality of the people involved. In his book Software Engineering Economics(Prentice-Hall, 1981), Barry Boehm rigorously shows individual and teamproductivity to be the leading predictor in estimating software costs; it'stwice as significant as product complexity. And any decent book on buildingand managing a software team urges you to ``hire the best people.''   Ah, there's the rub. Perhaps you've noticed that it's getting more andmore difficult to locate and then hire the best people. This isn't anillusion; it's real, it's significant, and it's only going to get worse. Itis, in fact, the heart of the real software crisis: There is more softwareto be developed than there are capable developers to do it. Demand willcontinue to outstrip supply for the foreseeable future. Hence, more andmore software will be behind schedule, over budget, underpowered, and ofpoor quality--and there's nothing we can do about it.   ``Nothing?'' you ask. ``What about better schools, better tools, betteron-the-job training, better methodologies?'' Those are essential becausethey raise the quality of most developers. But they do not solve thefundamental problem.   The conclusion I have reluctantly come to after more than 20 years ofsoftware development is this: Excellent developers, like excellentmusicians and artists, are born, not made. The number of such developers isa fixed (and tiny) percentage of the population. Thus, the absolute numberof such developers grows very slowly. At the same time, the demand for themexpands rapidly due to the world's increasing use of, and reliance on,software.   The situation is worse than it appears. Some of these innately talentedpeople never go into the computer industry. Many who do never develop theirfull potential. Others become prima donnas, demanding large salaries andextreme benefits. Or they become ``cowboy programmers,'' shooting from thehip and holding teams, projects, or entire companies hostage. A few burnout and leave the field. Of those left, only a fraction meets therequirements for your project.   This is not to slight the decent, talented software engineers, the oneswho study hard and work hard at developing and maintaining their skills.Indeed, if not for them, we wouldn't have a software industry at all. Buteven they can't meet the demand, and their efforts are undermined by themediocre (or worse) programmers.   Suppose that companies needed in-house orchestras to produce qualitymusic. The demand for musicians would explode, and their starting salarieswould soar. Think about the vast number of people (especially collegestudents) who would take up music regardless of their talent orinclination, guaranteed an entry-level position because companies weredesperate to fill all those seats.   Here and there, a great soloist or ensemble would play with passion,skill, and creativity, but much of what musicians produced would becacophony, especially as the newcomers and those lacking talent and skillstruggled with unfamiliar instruments and pieces. Now imagine that jobs,companies, and lives depended on how flawlessly the players performed.   This scenario describes the current state of software development. I sawthis for the first time when I went back to teach computer science at thesame place I had studied a decade earlier. The enrollment of computerscience majors had gone up by almost a factor of 10, yet a professor whohad been there since I was a student noted that the absolute number ofreally excellent computer science students remained the same.   In the years since my graduation, my experience in building and workingwith development teams has confirmed this. Ask any manager how many resumesand interviews it takes to find a top-notch software architect ordeveloper.   As needs, costs, and opportunities escalate, some great breakthrough--a``silver bullet,'' to use Frederick Brooks' classic phrase--may yet quellthe software crisis, reducing the complexities of development. If you wishto bet on that, go ahead. But in the meantime, keep your eyes and yourcheckbook open and grab the great programmers when you can--they're gettingreally hard to find.About the Author(s):Bruce F.

Maybe it deletes an object more than once--perhaps two, eventhree times.   These related problems can manifest themselves in mysterious ways. Atemporary string object doesn't get deleted; your program continues to runbut inexplicably exhausts memory. Other times, the manifestations are notso mysterious. A routine attempts to dereference a pointer that is pointingto a deleted object and the whole program crashes spectacularly.   It's difficult to keep track of all the objects you have to delete.Consequently, during design time, you're forced to repeatedly ask: ``Whenis it safe to delete this object?'' Because this is often a tough questionto answer, this ongoing wrestling match with memory almost alwayscomplicates your design. And even the most meticulous programmer makes anoccasional error, leading either to a global protection fault (or itsequivalent) or memory that's never freed.Pandora's Box Closed   The solution to all this is a garbage collector. With a garbagecollector, you never have to delete anything. The collector automaticallydeletes an object when your program no longer references that object. Ifyou've seen garbage collectors, you're probably concerned about theirperformance. Some work by ``waking up'' intermittently and searchingthrough memory for objects that can be deleted. This can bog down theapplication.   The speed of a garbage collector depends on its type. The most generaltypes of garbage collectors--which do, in fact, search through memory--areslow if you compare them to ``manual'' memory management (i.e., explicitlyusing delete). However, most of the time your program won't need such acomplicated collector. A reference-counting garbage collector issufficient.   A reference-counting garbage collector is fast because it doesn't haveto search through memory. Instead, for every object, it keeps a runningcount of the number of pointers that point to that object (this runningcount is the object's ``reference count''). Every time a pointer isassigned to point to an object, that object's count is incremented. Everytime a pointer is reassigned to point to a different object, the originalobject's count is decremented, and the count on the object to which thepointer is newly assigned is incremented. Also, every time a pointer goesout of scope, the count for the object to which it pointed is decremented.   Because the garbage collector keeps track of the number of pointersreferencing the object, it knows that when the reference count for anobject reaches zero, the object can be safely deleted (if there are nopointers to the object, your program can't access the object).Limitation   The only drawback to such a garbage collector is that it can't``collect'' cyclical structures. For example, suppose you have threeobjects, A, B, and C. They are tied to one another in the form of acircular list: A contains a pointer to B, B contains a pointer to C, and Ccontains a pointer to A. Initially, some other pointer may have pointed toA, but that pointer has gone out of scope and, consequently, this circularstructure is no longer accessible from your program. It should be put inthe garbage.   However, since each object points to the next member of the loop, eachof these objects still has one outstanding reference. As a result, areference-counting garbage collector won't collect the members of thisstructure; they will be ``leaked.''   If your program does include a circularly linked list, that doesn't meanyou cannot use a reference-counting garbage collector. You can arrange tohave the garbage collector properly delete the structure, using what I callthe ``linchpin'' method. With this technique, you pick one object in thecycle to be the linchpin object. When your program no longer needs to use acircular structure, it pulls the linchpin; that is, your program sets allpointers inside the linchpin object to null, thereby breaking the loop.Since the loop has now become a linear list, the garbage collector candelete the remaining objects appropriately.C++ to the Rescue   At this point, though you may be inclined to agree that areference-counting garbage collector would be a fine programming tool,you're probably concerned about the time you'd have to spend to build one.And if you do decide to build one, you must be exceedingly careful in itsconstruction: Any errors in the reference-counting code of the collectorwould produce an unacceptably leaky garbage collector.   Happily, C++ operator overloading permits you to implement a completelytransparent and foolproof means of reference counting. I've used thisconcept to create the reference-counting garbage collection systemaccompanying this article.   RGC, my reference-counting garbage collector, defines two templateclasses. These template classes emulate pointers by overloading the =, ==,*, and -> operators. Behind the scene these operators do the referencecounting for you. Whenever the reference count of a particular object fallsto zero, these operators delete the object.   You needn't be aware of the reference counting at all--it's entirelytransparent. And because you're unaware of the ongoing reference counting,you can't make any mistakes regarding it. This ensures the accuracy of thereference counts and hence the reliability of the garbage collector.Using RGC   Incorporating RGC in your next C++ development project is simple. First,you'll need to include RGC.h in your source files. This file defines threeclasses: TRGCObj, TRGCRef, and TRGCRefObj. The first, TRGCObj, should bedeclared as the virtual public superclass of any object to be managed bythe garbage collector. TRGCRef is a template class. Its parameter is thetype for which it will act as a pointer. This type must inherit fromTRGCObj. The third class--TRGCRefObj--is also a template class. TRGCRefObjis just like TRGCRef, but it inherits from TRGCObj so that it can betracked and deleted by the collector. TRGCRefObj exists so that the systemcan support the equivalent of pointers to pointers.Inside RGC   TRGCObj includes two member functions, RegisterReference andDeregisterReference. These functions respectively increment and decrementan object's reference count. Additionally, they return the updated numberof outstanding references.   Garbage collection takes place inside the TRGCRef template class. At anygiven time, one of its instances (which I'll call a reference from now on)either points to a valid object in memory or is null. TGRCRef overloads theassignment operator so that every time a reference is assigned a value, twothings happen. If the reference had previously been non-null,DeregisterReference is called on the object to which it had been pointing.Then, if the reference is being assigned to a non-null value,RegisterReference is called on the object to which it is to point. Thiskeeps an object's reference count accurate as assignment operations occur.   Additionally, the TRGCRef destructor handles the situation of areference's pointing to an object when that reference is destroyed. Thedestructor calls DeregisterReference on the object to which the referencepoints. This keeps an object's reference count accurate when references goout of scope or are deleted.   Finally, if DeregisterReference ever returns a 0, indicating that thereare no outstanding references to a particular object, the reference willdelete the object.An Example   Examine the following listing fragment:#include ``rgc.h''class myclass : public virtual TRGCobj{ };typedef TRGCRef Pmyclass;void main(){Pmyclass A = new myclass;Pmyclass B = new myclass;A=B;}   When A is assigned to the pointer returned by new, theTRGCRef::setpointer function is called. This stores the pointer to which Ais being assigned and calls RegisterReference on the object to which itpoints. The second assignment (of B) does the same thing.    But when A is assigned to B (the third assignment), a series of callswithin the overloaded assignment operator cause DeregisterReference to becalled. DeregisterReference will return a 0, since A had been the lastreference to the object it had been pointing to. The garbage collector willdelete this object (the result of the first new).   This assignment also causes RegisterReference to be called on the objectto which A is being assigned. This increments the reference count in theobject.   When the main function concludes, the destructors for the localvariables (A and B) are called. The destructor for B is called first, whichcauses DeregisterReference to be invoked on the object to which B refers.DeregisterReference returns a 1, since A still points to the object. Butwhen the destructor for A is called, DeregisterReference will be invoked onthat same object and this time will return a 0, causing the object to bedeleted.   Note that it is important not to use ``regular'' pointers to an objectthat is to be garbage-collected. A regular pointer will not be counted inthe reference count, so it's possible that the object will be deleted whileyour program still holds an outstanding pointer to it.Keep It Clean   RGC also handles pointers to pointers. For a reference that is a``second level'' pointer--i.e., a reference that points to another objectand that is itself pointed to--you must use TRGCRefObj. This allows thegarbage collector to work on references just as it works on objects; whenthere are no references to the reference, the reference will begarbage-collected.   The above applies to arbitrary depths of pointers. In general, theoutermost layers of pointers may be implemented as either TRGCRef orTRGCRefObj types; inner layers must be implemented as TRGCRefObj types.   RGC is a simple, efficient, and robust reference-counting garbagecollector that releases you from having to keep track of when to delete anobject. It thereby ends memory leaks, ensures that you never free an objecttoo soon, and simplifies your code. In short, it will make you moreproductive and make your C++ programs more reliable.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: A reference-counting garbage collector'sweakness is a circular structure. Even though all outside references to thestructure are gone, each member still has an outstanding reference pointingto it.Illustration: Illustration: RGC is available from the BYTE Web Site athttp://www.byte.com. RGC includes RGC.h, a test-driver program, and aself-tracing program that prints messages whenever an object is created ordestroyed or its reference count changes.About the Author(s):Justin Miller is studying electrical engineering and computer science atthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

He sighed and said, ``Theworst of it is that we'd probably advertise warm, dead chicken.''   So AT&T bought NCR and turned it into AT&T Global Information Solutions.Having admitted they couldn't market a cure for death, AT&T took a companythat could market small computers and slaughtered it. While they were atit, they let NCR wring the neck of AT&T's most exciting product, the Safarilaptop. It was one of my favorite laptops--small, very portable, built-incommunications. While AT&T desktop marketing wasn't very hot, they had somegood technology, and they were beginning to move with the Safari. After NCRwas dragged in, no journalist I know ever heard from either AT&T or NCRagain. The Safari was never updated--if there are new models, I never gotthe word. We can't review what we don't hear of.   It's up to marketing to make us aware of new products, or at least thatthere are new products, because I guarantee you there are plenty of outfitsout there who do let columnists know. I confess I hadn't thought of AT&Tfor a year when I was reminded by a Wall Street Journal article of justwhat a fiasco the AT&T/NCR merger became.   The pity of it all is that if ever there was a company that ought to bebooming in these days of Internet and Unix popularity, it surely ought tobe AT&T. Who else would be better suited to sell you a Unix box that youcan hook directly to the Internet? I used to have one here at Chaos Manor.Perhaps there's an updated system, but if so, they sure haven't let me knowabout it. Alas.Every now and then I get a panic E-mail message about disk drives with lostchains, cross-referenced or nonmatching file allocation tables (FATs), andother disk woes. Alas, I don't have time to do more than send a genericanswer. I usually advise them to try Norton Disk Doctor run from a floppydisk. I figure that if they had Norton Utilities (NDD comes with NU)already installed on the hard disk, they'd have tried NDD and said so. Inany event, the one thing you don't want to do if you have a disk in troubleis install something new on it or write to it in any way.   NDD allows you to make an Undo disk that will put things back the waythey were. You can put that on a floppy disk or on a network disk (never onthe disk you're working on!). As long as you do that, you're reasonablysafe, with one exception I'll get to in a second.   If NDD fails, your next step depends on how important the data is. Ifall you stand to lose is a few hours of installation time, you can trymucking about with NU yourself. For example, DOS keeps two copies of theFAT. They're supposed to match, but sometimes they don't. If you know whichone is good, you can tell NU to use the good one and ignore the other.There are other such tricks. All are fairly dangerous in that you can loseyour files forever, but that's the worst that can happen. If that won't bea complete disaster, you can use NU to try to recover from some stupidapplication that wrote garbage in the wrong places--or more likely,something dumb you did.   You may even be able to recover compressed files. It doesn't say so onthe box, but NU for Windows 95 works quite well in DOS (which is where youought to be working if you're trying to recover files; using a disk editorin Windows or Windows 95 [W95] is just asking for trouble). It will work onDoublespace compressed drives.   Understand, I don't recommend file compression. Gigabyte disk drivessell for under $299 now, and recently we got a 3-GB drive for about $700.With hardware that cheap, why take chances? Although file compressionusually works fine, there's a small but real chance that you'll loseeverything on one of those compressed logical drives. It's alsoinconvenient.   If you do use compression software, you really need to have NU installedin your system. It probably won't be good enough to recover you from yourdisaster, but it might be.   If all else fails, there are data-recovery experts. My son Alex is apartner at Workman & Associates in Pasadena, California. While they mostlydo installation and maintenance consulting, they also do data recovery. Youshould be aware that this can get downright expensive. You're much betteroff buying the hardware and software it takes to do frequent backups. Mostof the people who end up paying Alex to recover their data knew that, ofcourse.   If your data is important enough to pay recovery experts to retrieve it,don't use NU. And don't write to your hard disk if you can help it; becauseif your problem is a failing hard disk, recovery is going to be verydifficult, and anything you write to that disk is likely to make thingsworse.   Clearly, your best bet is to make good backups before you have problems;and if your data files are important enough that you'd be willing to payfor their recovery, they're important enough for you to buy a tape drive.For that matter, they're probably important enough to protect with a RAIDsystem or full mirroring.I don't like Franklin Quest's Ascend 5.0. I don't like the colors, and Iparticularly don't like the way it handles telephone calls. It uses theMicrosoft Dialer, which means that if you hang up the phone after yourcall, your software doesn't know you've done that; and until you go backinto the software and tell it that you've hung up, it keeps the phone tiedup. It also keeps a log file open that is ``timing'' the call long afteryou hung up.   The result was that I didn't use Ascend 5.0 to dial. I'd look up thenumbers in a paper book; but since I wasn't using Ascend 5.0, I wasn'tentering new numbers in it, so I got to losing phone numbers.   I'm not sure what I had against the rest of Ascend 5.0, but I went foralmost two months without using it. The result was a mess. I wasn't able tokeep track of appointments. I was losing phone messages. I didn't have anypriority to my work. That clearly could not go on.   Therefore, I went back to Ascend 4.0. It has a few flaws that version5.0 was supposed to fix, but I can live with them; and it's just easier forme to use. The colors are brighter. It has a phone dialer that knows when Ihave hung up the phone. It took me about 2 hours to go through the nineweeks in which I hadn't updated appointments, kept my journal, done myreports, and dealt with my priority task lists, but eventually I was donewith all that.   The effect on my work was immediate. No more jotting down little noteson scraps of paper and losing them. Now I have a record, and even better,it's a record I can search. With luck, version 6.0 will be as good asversion 4.0, but with the bugs fixed; until then, I can't live withoutAscend, but I can sure live without version 5.0.   One good thing came of all this: I rediscovered the joys of paperlogbooks. The problem with an electronic log is that you often don't haveit with you, and often you want to make handwritten notes. Carrying aprinted copy of the electronic log and using that to jot notes in doesn'twork well because the resulting book is too thick to carry easily.   For years I carried Borum & Pease hardbound composition books. They'relike the ones you see in the drugstore, but they come page-numbered. SinceI have the habit of taping business cards, letters, and newspaper clippingsinto my logbook, I've found it makes sense to use nylon strapping tape toreinforce the binding. When I dropped Ascend, I started a new logbook. I'mgoing to continue to carry that. The result is I have a book thatsupplements my electronic Ascend records nicely.   One day I suppose I'll have a personal digital assistant (PDA) that Ican carry about and jot notes into. My son uses a 286 DOS-only monochromeGateway HandBook for that purpose and has mastered the art of typing fastwith one hand while holding the system in the other. I still need a placeto set the HandBook down, and thus it's as easy to keep the Gateway 2000Liberty in my briefcase. The bottom line is that so far there is no PDA asconvenient as a paper logbook, especially if you also use Ascend on yourlaptop and desktop.   Incidentally, I have friends who like Ascend 5.0 and can't figure outwhy I don't.I love little computers, but every now and then I wonder. I have twocommunications from the Gas Company. One threatens my life, or at least mycredit, as well as warning that they're about to cut my gas service off fornot paying my bill. The other letter tells me I have overpaid my bill, havea credit balance, and should not send any money.   Something else from the same mail is prettier: two beautiful simulatedhandwritten notices from a charitable order I belong to exhorting me to paymy Pentecostal obligation. They are identical, and you have to look closeto see they weren't handwritten.   Alex says these are reminders of how awful the world would be if it werewritten in COBOL.I guarantee you a frustrating experience installing the CDSourceBook ofAmerican History, especially if you're running W95; but eventually you'llget it up, and if you're at all interested in the fundamental documents ofAmerica, you'll be glad you persevered.   I had two distinct experiences with the installation from CD-ROM. Thefirst time, the installation program ran; but at about 98 percent done, itsaid there was an error copying system files. If that happens to you,cheer, because you're nearly done; just ignore the error message. You'llstill have to make your shortcut and put it on the start-up toolbar, butthat won't be a real problem.   Alas, I didn't do that after it happened on Pentafluge, the big Pentiumthat runs W95. I went over and tried the installation on SuperCow, theGateway 2000 486DX2/66 that runs Windows for Workgroups 3.11. It didn'tinstall easily there, either, requiring that I reset the machine at leastonce, but eventually it was finished with no harm done.   The CD-ROM is packed with information, from accounts of Columbus inSpain, through George Washington's early military career through theRevolution and right on up to World War I. All the major documents, such asMagna Charta, the Mayflower Compact, Declaration of Independence, Articlesof Confederation, and Constitution are there. So are the entire FederalistPapers. There are eyewitness accounts, literary works, Washington Irving,and so forth.   But there's more. You get Woodrow Wilson's six-volume work, History ofthe United States. There are all the inaugural addresses of the presidents.There's James Madison's two-volume Journal of the Constitutional Debates.There is, in a word, nearly every original source and most secondarysources needed to teach American history, all indexed and searchable.   The viewing engine is Folio Views, about which more later. There's onequirk you need to know about. To make it easier to find and copy materialfrom this wonderful collection, there is extensive paragraphidentification, useful for scholarly quoting but annoying if you're justtrying to read the documents. It's neither intuitive nor documented, butyou can turn that off. Pull down the View menu, and click on the itemHidden; that will toggle the paragraph identifications.   Every schoolroom and home student in America ought to have this disc.It's that good. Highly recommended.Attendees at Comdex and other computer shows know something about FolioViews, because for the past few years, the convention directory has beengiven out on a floppy disk. BYTE chooses the Best of Comdex show awards,and the Folio Views-based disk sure has made my life easier. I can searchout new products by category, find booth and suite numbers, and suchlike.This year, I am going to take the neat little Citizen PN60 printer and usethat to make out my show itinerary.   The Folio Views 3.1 Infobase Production Kit builds databases you cantake with you. It comes in several levels, from a simple user databaseconstruction kit through a professional kit that includes licenses that letyou distribute the run-time viewer with your product--that's what comeswith the American-history CD--to a Software Developer Kit that lets youextend their tools and hook the whole thing in with other programs. It'sall industrial-strength software and priced accordingly. It's also prettysolid.   You can get your data nearly anywhere, provided you respect applicablecopyright restrictions, of course. Nexis and Lexis are obvious sources, butin fact almost any Internet site may furnish one. If you have any level ofFolio Views, you can get a free tool called Folio Retriever that goes outon the Internet, grabs information, and puts it into a Folio Views-editableflat file complete with links and a table of contents. You compile that tomake a Folio Views database you can use off-line. It's portable, and it canbe copied. You can use this technique to grab a whole bunch of stuff fromthe World Wide Web and evaluate it at leisure. You can then use anothertool to turn all that into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents andput them on your own Web server.   The Folio Views 3.1 Infobase Production Kit comes with conversionfilters for getting data out of most word processor document formats. Theversion I have doesn't seem to know about older database formats like Q&A,but I'm told the Software Developer Kit has the tools for constructingnearly any filter device you like; and Folio Views knows how to bring indata from any ASCII file-format system.   Like askSam, Folio Views isn't the simplest thing to learn, but once youhave it down, it's a lot more powerful. It can be used to build salableproducts from document collections or just to organize data for your ownuse. I can't claim great familiarity with Folio Views and Folio Retriever,but as Chaos Manor appears to be sinking beneath vast amounts ofinformation retrieved from the Web, I think I'm about to be. I've seen manyuseful products built from Folio Views. If you're drowning in unorganizeddata or you have an idea for a product based on documentary information,this may be just what you need.In The Mote in God's Eye (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, Pocket Books),the characters all carry pocket computers that are tied into a centraldatabase, thus linking everyone to everyone else, as well as to all theknowledge of humankind. When we wrote that in 1970, we carefully did notdescribe how it all worked, but we did make it clear that you used a stylusrather than a keyboard.   We now have Zenith's CruisePad set up in Chaos Manor. CruisePad is aclipboard-size, stylus-controlled system that uses radio to link into aregular computer network. You can connect a keyboard to it if you want, butthat gets clumsy, and if you're going to do a lot of typing, you'd probablybe better off with a laptop or palmtop. Where CruisePad shines is withmouse-controlled operations. You can use it to make a big desktop doanything you could do with a mouse.   That includes accessing your Internet server or other databases. It alsoincludes Internet access; and most Web browsing is done by mousing around.You can also ``type'' short replies with the stylus: you call up an imageof a miniature keyboard and tap away at the keys. That's frustrating fortouch-typists, but hunt-and-peck addicts get pretty fast with it.   The real merit of CruisePad is for structured actions. Years ago, Ispeculated that one day doctors making hospital rounds would have aclipboard computer that would give them the patient's chart, let them makeentries, digest the information, and offer suggestions on diagnosis andtreatment. That's no longer speculation. Teaching hospitals are testingsuch systems. You can even enter prescriptions with CruisePad. The resultprobably won't be reliably machine-readable, but the handwritten bit mapcan be attached to the patient's chart, a copy can go by fax to thepharmacy, and a clerk can complete the data entry from a central location.   I don't know if anyone is doing this now, but it wouldn't be difficultto construct a program that compares the recommended treatment with what isstandard; does the same thing with dosages, taking into account thepatient's body weight; looks in the record for contraindications; andflashes a warning if the physician has specified something outside thenormal envelope. That would certainly eliminate careless errors.   To go from the sublime to something else, muffler and transmission shopsare also using CruisePad. Tap the screen, and up comes a list of makes andmodels. Use the stylus to let the computer know the model and year, and upcomes a picture and a list of symptoms. Tap (as opposed to click) in theappropriate places, and out comes a repair recommendation and costestimate.   The U.S. Navy is trying to replace paper with CD-ROMs. The problem withthat was summarized by Gordon Eubanks, who was a submarine driver beforebecoming CEO of Symantec. If you're crawling around inside an engine tryingto find out where to put a wrench, the last thing you need is to have tocome out to look at a screen. With CruisePad, you can carry the screen withyou, and as long as data access is mouse-controllable, it would be plentygood enough.   To utilize CruisePad, there are three ways to connect to your network:CruiseLAN/PCMCIA, for computers with a PC Card Type II slot; CruiseLAN/ISA,a card for AT-type bus desktop PCs and servers; or CruiseLAN/Access Pointrelay boxes, for extending coverage to up to 1000 feet in diameter innormal office environments. With a CruiseLAN/Access Point connectedupstairs, I was able to control SuperCow from every downstairs room. Alarger establishment like a hospital could put CruiseLAN relay boxes inseveral places; one would almost certainly be enough for a small clinic ormechanic's shop.   Setting up CruisePad isn't all that hard, but you do have to get thedrivers loaded in just the right order and just the right way, and that canbe tricky. Small companies without technically competent people may wantsome help, either from a franchising parent organization or outsideconsultants, to get it running.   Designing the custom database applications to make CruisePad useful is amuch bigger deal. On the other hand, given tools like Visual Basic andFolio Views, even that's getting a lot easier, since mostly you're tryingto anticipate what data will be entered. Body temperatures, after all, havea rather narrow range.   More on CruisePad after we get used to it. It's not the pocket computerfrom Mote, but it's sure a lot closer to it than I thought I'd have atChaos Manor in 1995.For years I've talked about Mrs. Pournelle's reading program, which teachessystematic phonics. Now, the state of California has rediscovered phonicsafter over 30 years of denigrating phonics instruction, and everyone isinterested. The older version required a tutor, but the fancy new Macversion teaches reading by using the Mac sound system to give the lessons.She's been trying it out in selected Los Angeles schools, and thedocumented results are pretty astonishing: up to five years' grade-levelimprovement in reading ability from a few months of lessons with herprogram.   Roberta got enough inquiries that she wanted to make a fancy new manualwith a color cover. Unfortunately, the images she wanted to print were onthe Mac version of the program. And the only color printer we have is theFargo Electronics Primera, which works only with PCs. That meant we'd haveto transfer the image from Mac to PC.   You can do that with CorelDraw 5. I have CorelDraw 6, and at some pointI'll have to install it; I'm told there are a lot of new features. You maywant to hang onto version 5 if you get version 6; readers are reporting avariety of odd bugs. In any event, CorelDraw 5 did the job. Reading animage in Mac format and then cropping and adjusting it to be saved in DOSformat turns out to be tedious but not all that difficult.The most intriguing thing I read this month wasn't a book but an article inthe October 1995 Atlantic Monthly, in which Clifford Cobb, Ted Halstead,and Jonathan Rowe examine the concept of Gross Domestic Product. When I wasin aerospace engineering, we were warned against what was called ``thefigure of merit fallacy'': the notion that you could take a complex systemand use some math to reduce its performance to a single number, which youcould then optimize. GDP is a classic case of that. The theory is that thefaster GDP grows, the better the economy. The problem is that GDP includeseverything, good and bad; under the GDP concept, the greatest economic herowould be a cancer patient getting a triple bypass while starting divorceproceedings. GDP, in a word, is all credits and no debits, and that'sinsane.   The authors propose a remedy that would be worse than the disease, buttheir diagnosis of the problem is good.   When I first began writing this column, I got a call from the thendirector of the office that prepares the Consumer Price Index. He wanted toknow if there was some way the government could use small computers andmodems to compile the CPI. At that time, they were getting data from citiesall over the country, punching it onto IBM cards, and mailing the boxes ofcards to a mainframe. The postage alone was running a couple of hundredthousand dollars a month.   The CPI is in the news this week: since Social Security and otherentitlement increases are keyed to it, getting it right can be thedifference between government solvency and bankruptcy. Everyone is sureit's wrong. There's no agreement on new ways to compute it, but at leastsmall computers make adjustments possible.   GDP is in many ways more important than CPI; and my guess is that smallcomputers will make it possible to adjust it so it discriminates betweenproduction and crime. All we have to do is agree on how.The computer book of the month is by Charles Kaufman, Radia Perlman, andMike Speciner, Network Security: Private Communications in a Public World(Prentice-Hall, 1995); it's both readable and complete, and if you haveanything to do with network security, you need this book.   One last bit of advice: if you have W95 running stably, be very carefulhow you muck with it. More on that next month.For More InformationEvery schoolroom and home student in America ought to have CDSourceBook ofAmerican History ($49.95). It's that good.

HALFHILLIt takes a lot of nerve to add new instructions to the x86 instruction setif your name isn't Intel. And it's especially cheeky if you're a tinycompany like NexGen, barely a mosquito on Intel's back.   Yet that's what NexGen hoped to do. Last October, the company announcedits latest microprocessor, the Nx686. It was the first x86 chip tointegrate a multimedia execution unit and a new set of multimediainstructions. Never before had anyone but Intel attempted such a boldrevision of the 18-year-old x86 architecture. Could anyone take NexGenseriously?   Then came stunning news. NexGen--which ranked last behind Intel,Advanced Micro Devices, and Cyrix as a vendor of x86-compatiblechips--agreed to be acquired by AMD. And AMD promptly scrapped its ownsixth-generation CPU project in favor of the Nx686, which will now bemarketed as the AMD K6.   The surprise announcement instantly boosted the prospects for NexGen'smaverick microprocessor. AMD is a $2 billion company that has seriousmarketing muscle and high-profile customers, including five of the top sixsuppliers of PC compatibles. In addition, AMD has its own processtechnology and wafer-fabrication plants. NexGen, a fabless company,subcontracts its manufacturing to IBM Microelectronics. (This partnershipmay continue for some products, including the Nx586.)   Suddenly, Intel faces stiffer competition for an emerging market ofmultimedia CPUs. While NexGen was developing the Nx686, Intel has beenworking on its own multimedia x86 processor, code-named the P55C. ThisPentium variant will probably make its debut in the second half of thisyear, about the same time as the Nx686/K6. Intel isn't releasing manydetails, but we know the P55C will also define new multimedia instructionsfor the x86 architecture.   Of course, Intel still wields more clout than AMD and NexGen. Only byjoining forces with compiler vendors, software developers, and perhapsother chip makers can AMD ensure that the K6's multimedia extensions willsurvive alongside Intel's. Before the merger, NexGen claimed it was part ofsuch an alliance but said the other members weren't ready to go public.When the time is ripe, company officials say, it will be apparent that thealliance has enough strength to make the extensions a de facto industrystandard.   That remains to be seen. Even without its multimedia enhancements,however, the K6 is still an impressive chip. If it lives up toexpectations, the K6 could match or beat the performance of Intel'sflagship processor, the Pentium Pro (formerly called the P6).Multimedia Marvels   The K6's multimedia execution unit is one of seven execution units inthe new processor. NexGen says it occupies only about 5 percent of thechip's die area. Because the K6 is not yet in production, NexGen won'treveal the actual die size, other than to claim it will be ``substantiallysmaller'' than the Pentium Pro's die of 306 square millimeters. Themultimedia unit probably accounts for less than 300,000 of the K6's sixmillion transistors.   That's not a lavish expenditure in the transistor budget of aleading-edge microprocessor these days. But what does it buy? NexGen saysthe multimedia unit recognizes about 10 to 20 new instructions. All aredesigned to streamline multimedia processing, such as digitized audio,digitized video, 3-D graphics, MPEG-2 decompression, motion estimation, andpixel manipulation. According to Greg Favor, who directed the chip'sdevelopment, the extended instructions are fairly general in nature, sothey won't become obsolete as the industry defines new standards.   One new instruction performs the same kind of multiply-accumulate (MAC)function often seen in digital signal processors (DSPs). Programmers canuse the MAC instruction to multiply and add a series of numbers repeatedlywithout a branched program loop. It's faster than regular x86 code becausethe CPU doesn't have to execute separate instructions for the multiply andadd operations or evaluate a branch during each iteration of the loop.   NexGen won't say much about the other new instructions, except that theyadhere to a single-instruction/multiple-data (SIMD) model, just like someDSPs. In other words, each instruction operates on multiple operands ofdata. That's ideal for multimedia, which typically consists of lengthy datastreams that must be compressed, decompressed, or otherwise transformed. Inconcept, the K6's new instructions resemble a similar subset of multimediainstructions that Sun Microsystems defined for its UltraSparc processor in1994.   Externally, the new K6 instructions are as accessible to programmers asany other x86 instructions. However, NexGen hints that applicationprogrammers probably won't have to explicitly call the new instructionsbecause they'll be encapsulated by higher-level APIs, such as Microsoft'sDirect-X for Windows. Certainly an ally such as Microsoft would be usefulto an industry alliance that wants to extend the x86 architecture withoutthe blessing of Intel. (Microsoft has no comment on this.)   Internally, the K6 translates the multimedia instructions into RISC86operations--the RISC-like primitives that were the most innovative featureof the Nx586 when it appeared in 1994. The Nx586 was the first x86processor to introduce this concept of a decoupled CISC/RISCmicroarchitecture. On the outside, to x86 software, the chip behaves like anormal x86 CPU. But inside, special decoders translate the variable-lengthCISC instructions into fixed-length (albeit long) RISC-like operations thatexecute in a RISC-like core.   NexGen, Intel, and AMD are now using decoupled microarchitectures in alltheir latest CPUs. They believe it's a better approach than trying toexecute multiple CISC instructions in parallel and out of order. The onlyholdout is Cyrix; engineers there say a decoupled microarchitecture willbecome too difficult to manage in wider superscalar designs.   Favor says the K6's multimedia instructions are easy to execute inparallel because they're more efficient than most x86 instructions. Eachone breaks down into just one or two RISC86 operations. The MACinstruction, for example, translates into a single RISC86 primitive thattypically executes in a single cycle.   According to NexGen, the multimedia unit can execute up to 6 billionoperations per second (BOPS). That's amazing if true. The fastestgeneral-purpose DSP--Texas Instruments' TMS 320C80 Multimedia VideoProcessor--executes about 2 BOPS.   Until AMD makes the K6 available for independent benchmarking, however,it's unclear how often the processor will be able to sustain 6 BOPS. TI'schip appears to have more internal bandwidth, and it uses amultiple-instruction/multiple-data (MIMD) model instead of a SIMD modellike the K6 uses. If the K6 comes anywhere close to sustaining 6 BOPS whenrunning real-world multimedia software, it will be a significantaccomplishment.Bottlenecks Begone   There's a lot more to the K6 than its multimedia unit. The new chipfixes several shortcomings of the Nx586 by adding larger caches, multipledecoders, more registers, deeper queues, and additional execution units. Asa result, the K6 is now a four-way superscalar processor; the Nx586 is athree-way design.   However, NexGen has discarded two key features of the Nx586: theintegrated cache controller and the dedicated bus for the secondary (level2) cache. These were casualties of NexGen's last-minute decision to makethe new chip pin-compatible with the P54C-series Pentiums. As apin-compatible part, the K6 will work with the same peripheral chips as thePentium--for example, PCI chip sets designed by third-party vendors.   But the downside of this decision is that the K6, like the Pentium, nowrequires an external cache controller and will access its secondary cache(if present) over the same 64-bit bus it uses for memory I/O. Sharing thesame bus hurts performance because of bus contentions.   To compensate for this performance loss, NexGen has greatly expanded theK6's onboard cache. The primary (level 1) caches in the K6 now total 64 KB,compared to 32 KB in the Nx586 and only 16 KB in the Pentium. The cachesare evenly split, with 32 KB each for instructions and data. Both cachesare two-way set-associative and support the MESI protocols forcache-coherent multiprocessing. The data cache is dual-ported and isn'tbanked, thus eliminating bank conflicts. It can handle one read operationand one write operation per cycle.   NexGen also added a 16-KB predecode cache that's closely coupled to theinstruction cache (I-cache). The predecode cache holds special informationthat's generated when the K6 fills the I-cache. For example, as part of itspredecoding, the K6 locates and marks the boundaries between x86instructions, which are variable in length. (This step is unnecessary in atrue RISC processor because RISC instructions are always fixed-length.)Predecoding speeds up full decoding further down the pipeline; AMD's K5 hasa similar stage.   However, one drawback of predecoding is that it lengthens the x86instructions by appending extra information to them. In the case of the K6,each instruction byte gains 4 bits (1 nibble) of predecode data. Thisthreatens to effectively reduce the working size of the I-cache by 50percent. To avoid this size penalty, the K6 stores the extra nibbles in the16-KB predecode cache. Then, when the K6 fetches instructions from theI-cache into the instruction buffer, it simultaneously retrieves thenibbles.   The K6 also marks branch instructions during the predecode stage andcalculates their target addresses. All branch predictions are based on atwo-level dynamic algorithm with a 2-bit history flag (strongly taken,weakly taken, weakly not taken, and strongly not taken). The K6 storesthese flags in an enormous branch-prediction table that can hold 8192entries. It also stores the return addresses and target addresses in twoadditional caches that each hold 16 entries. As a result, the K6's branchprediction is well over 90 percent accurate, putting it in the same leagueas the Pentium Pro and ahead of other x86 processors.Parallel Decoding   Where the Nx586 could decode only one x86 instruction per cycle becauseit had just one instruction decoder, the K6 has two decoders and can handletwo x86 instructions per cycle.   The Pentium Pro has three x86 decoders, but two of them can deal onlywith simple instructions, and the most complex instructions are detouredinto a microcode ROM. NexGen claims the K6's decoders are more capable:They're not constrained by instruction groupings that would stall thePentium Pro's simple decoders, and they can decode a larger subset of x86instructions without using microcode. (Of course, the most complex orrarely used x86 instructions still invoke microcode.) NexGen says itconsidered adding a third decoder, but simulations revealed a performancegain of only 2 to 5 percent in return for a frequency loss of 15 to 20percent--not a good trade-off.   Although the maximum input to the decoders is two x86 instructions percycle, the maximum output is four RISC86 operations each cycle. That'sbecause the CISC instructions usually break down into two or more RISC-likeprimitives.   Examples: INC register translates directly into a single RISC86 registeroperation; ADD register, memory gets reduced to a load operation and aregister operation; ADD memory, register results in a load operation, aregister operation, and a store operation. The worst x86 instructions cangenerate dozens or even hundreds of RISC primitives. In those cases, the K6can issue as many as four RISC86 operations per cycle from its microcodeROM.   The K6's pipeline gets wider toward the middle. During each clock cycle,two x86 instructions can enter the decoders; four RISC86 operations canexit the decoders; six operations can issue and execute; and fouroperations can retire. This bulge in the middle of the pipe minimizesbubbles and stalls and keeps the seven execution units from twiddling theirthumbs.   The traffic cop that manages all this action is the instruction controlunit (ICU). It temporarily holds up to 24 RISC86 operations and issues themto the appropriate execution units. This is also where the instructions getout of order. The ICU can issue up to six instructions per cycle in anyorder to any available execution unit, as long as there are no dependenciesbetween instructions. (An example of a true dependency is when oneinstruction depends on the result of a previous instruction.)   To reduce the chances of so-called false dependencies--instances whereregister-dependent instructions might stall because there aren't anyavailable registers--the K6 has a large set of 48 general-purposeregisters, compared to 14 in the Nx586. Eight of them represent the eightlogical registers of the x86 architecture. The K6 can temporarily renamethe other 40 physical registers to represent any of the eight logicalregisters. When a register operation retires, the K6 copies its value intothe corresponding architectural register. This is quite similar to how thePentium Pro uses its set of 40 physical and eight logical registers.   A feature called register-result bypassing allows the K6 to makecompleted results immediately available to subsequent instructions withoutaccessing main memory. Because register operations are much faster thanmemory accesses, register-result bypassing can save numerous clock cycles.Also, NexGen claims the K6 is particularly fast at loading segmentregisters and at handling partial register operations. This means that itshould outperform the Pentium Pro when running 16-bit software.   However, the K6's ICU draws from a smaller pool of pending instructionsthan the Pentium Pro's instruction scheduler: 24 versus 40. And the ICUcan't track more than 12 x86 instructions at a time. A larger instructionpool--which is a window into the running program--would allow moreflexibility when issuing instructions out of order. Still, the K6 is moreflexible in this regard than the Nx586.Execution Time   In addition to its innovative multimedia unit, the K6 has six otherexecution units: a load unit, a store unit, two integer units, a branchunit, and an FPU. Again, this is a significant improvement over the Nx586,which has only three execution units and is the only fifth-generation x86processor without an integrated FPU.   The K6's separate load and store units will speed up memory reads andwrites, a prominent barnacle on the hull of CISC instruction sets. Eachunit has a two-stage pipeline. The store unit feeds results into aseven-entry queue that temporarily holds them until the CPU completes allprevious instructions and resolves any dependencies. Holding them assuresthat all instructions retire in original program order, regardless of theorder in which they executed.   One exception: If a load operation depends on a pending store, the loadcan bypass the store and fetch the value directly from the results queue.Since this happens before the store unit actually writes the value tomemory, it eliminates another slow memory access.   The K6's two integer units are not symmetrical; one can handle asuperset of arithmetic operations, including multiplication and division.Most operations execute in a single cycle, and multiplication requires onlytwo cycles. Floating-point math appears to be fast, too. Although the K6'sFPU is not as heavily pipelined as those in the Pentium and Pentium Pro,its latencies are shorter. NexGen says most floating-point additions,subtractions, and multiplications will execute in only two cycles.   As mentioned, the branch unit is among the most efficient in any x86processor. Much of its work is done early, because it calculates targetaddresses while decoding. If the correct target address isn't cached, thebranch unit calculates and fetches the new target during the next stage,paying only a one-cycle penalty. However, if the branch unit mispredicts abranch, it needs about five cycles to recover--not an unreasonable penaltyfor a CPU whose predictions are more than 90 percent accurate.   Overall, the K6's pipeline is five or six stages long, depending on theoperation. Register and integer operations typically require five stages,and load/store operations need six. The K6 isn't superpipelined like thePentium Pro, so it probably can't be driven to the same high clockfrequencies. NexGen hopes to achieve superior performance witharchitectural efficiency, not extreme clock speeds.   NexGen has been testing silicon samples of the chip since September, sothe engineers can roughly estimate its actual performance. They say theyexpect that the K6, at equivalent clock speeds, will beat the Pentium Prowhen running 32-bit software, and perhaps outrun it by as much as 33percent. With 16-bit software, NexGen expects the K6 to run about twice asfast as a Pentium Pro.   If the K6 can deliver that level of performance on a die as small asNexGen suggests, the new processor could achieve a significantprice/performance advantage over Intel's top-of-the-line chip. When youthrow in the multimedia goodies, the K6 looks even better.   Of course, nobody--including AMD and NexGen--expects to dislodge Intelas the king of the x86 market. But the K6 chip could carve out arespectable niche and presage the multimedia microprocessors of thefuture.K6: What's New-- Multimedia execution unit; first x86 CPU to have one-- New subset of multimedia instructions-- Four-way superscalar pipelines-- Hybrid CISC/RISC microarchitecture-- Seven execution units, including FPU-- Executes up to six operations per cycle-- Out-of-order execution, dynamic branch prediction,   and speculative execution-- Six million transistors-- 32-KB primary instruction cache; 32-KB primary data cache-- Clock frequency at debut: 180 MHz-- 0.35-micron, five-layer-metal, CMOS process technology-- Pin-compatible with P54C-series Pentiums-- Claimed performance: At least as fast as Pentium Pro with 32-bit   software; twice as fast with 16-bit software-- Production scheduled for mid- to late 1996Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: NexGen has advanced its hybrid CISC/RISCmicroarchitecture by widening the execution bandwidth and adding speciallogic for multimedia processing.

CORCORANIt was a long and stormy flight. A voice rang out, ``Fasten your seatbelts, return your tray tables to their upright and locked positions, andplease refrain from grepping until we're safely on the ground.'' Unix hasinvaded the cockpit.   You're probably thinking, off-the-shelf software is fine for wordprocessing, but only custom code has the right stuff for life-criticalapplications such as aerospace. Right? Not anymore. Granted, the Boeing777's autopilot isn't built on a Microsoft Word for Windows macro, butBoeing did break with tradition by incorporating commercial code in themaintenance display system on its new 777. The result: Engineers say theycut costs, reduced development time, and still met the FAA's requirementsfor quality-assurance testing and reliability.   The Unix-based Maintenance Access Terminal (MAT) displays the health ofthe plane. According to its designers, MAT is one of the first systemsusing off-the-shelf software that the FAA has allowed on an aircraft. MATcould be a first step toward eventually using standard software inmore-critical parts of the plane. The 777's overall maintenance system,including MAT, could further save money by reducing the time planes stay onthe ground while mechanics diagnose and fix problems.   The challenge for Boeing was to find a ready-made OS that could handleits need for real-time response and reliability yet still be small enoughto fit within the memory constraints of an aircraft. Furthermore, thesystem had to be compatible with third-party applications and add-ons.   Boeing subcontracted Rockwell International-Collins Avionics (CedarRapids, IA) to write custom software and integrate it with Venix EDS, acommercial version of Unix from VenturCom. Rockwell also specified MAThardware and aircraft-based LAN components, which had to meet the specialrequirements of an aircraft environment.Keep It Up   The 777's maintenance equipment tracks dozens of systems on theaircraft, including the engines, engine-control systems, and landing gear.The data-collection devices and the system that runs them are not part ofMAT. MAT provides only the hardware and system software for a maintenanceapplication and user interface (UI). MAT displays maintenance data on aflat-panel LCD connected to a 486-based PC. The display sits in thecockpit behind the first officer, so the pilots and ground crew can see itas they board. Ground crews can also receive MAT data by connecting PCs toports outside the plane.   Designers say the maintenance system reduces paperwork and centralizesdiagnostic information that was previously scattered across the plane onvarious systems. In the past, flight crews and pilots examined thesedisparate systems, each with a display reflecting its state of readiness.The crews then noted the information on long checklists.   The maintenance application now downloads the readiness information fromthe on-board LAN, and MAT presents it to the crew on a central display.Users can print the information or copy it to floppy disks for downloadingto a maintenance database. (On older aircraft, someone has to manually keyin information from the paper checklists to update that database.) Themaintenance application saves time by telling the crew what work needs tobe done and which procedures are optional, rather than requiring a crewchief to examine several reports of data and figure out what parts need tobe replaced.   The maintenance application may also increase the quality and type ofdiagnostic information available to the crew. On the 777, sensors insidethe engine and other systems measure fluctuations in temperature and otherstates.   The sensors take temperature readings every few seconds. By assemblingthe information in the database and analyzing it, the maintenanceapplication can catch slight variations that might indicate that the fuelnozzle is blowing too much fuel into the combustion chamber, for example.The nozzle might not be broken, and the temperatures may not exceedacceptable levels, but the crew could decide to replace the nozzle orinspect the combustion chamber to prevent the possibility of a fire.Making Your Connections   A Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) network connects theaircraft's maintenance systems with MAT (see the figure ``Airborne LAN'').The architecture could have used Ethernet rather than FDDI in the finalimplementation. However, the original system design called for largepackets that would have required the bandwidth of FDDI, according toRockwell technical director Tom Mepham. The company later jettisoned thatplan because it was too expensive and it would have been harder to receiveFAA certification. But systems designers stuck with FDDI to learn how toadapt the fiber-optic wiring to an aircraft environment for futuredesigns.   Rockwell designed the optical data link to operate in the extremetemperature fluctuations of the aircraft--from -40 degrees C to 70 degreesC. Rockwell also built the LAN cards and device drivers. The Open SystemsInterconnection (OSI) protocol stack came from the French company Alcatel.   Rockwell adapted commodity hardware to work under the unusual conditionsof an aircraft. It selected chips partly for their ability to weathertemperature changes, while boards had to withstand electromagneticinterference (EMI), the gravity load, the vibrations of takeoff andlanding, and temperature changes, among other considerations. At the sametime, all the components had to be as small and lightweight as possible.   ``We spent a lot of engineering time optimizing the mechanical design,''Mepham says. To protect the system's hard drive from vibrations, thecompany put it on shock mounting and isolated it from other parts of thesystem. A housing with closed joints surrounds the system's boards to makesure they don't emit radio waves that might interfere with planecommunications. Rockwell connects some of the peripherals using a modifiedSCSI controller built from an NCR controller chip that met requirements forlow power consumption.   To reduce power consumption, bulk, and weight, Rockwell built the MATdisplay with an LCD screen rather than a CRT. The display offers a 25percent savings in power over a CRT screen, and it weighs 30 percent less.The box is only 8 inches deep, compared to the 14-inch depth of the CRT.The LCD automatically brightens or dims in response to cabin light, butRockwell had to work hard to get the LCD screen to function reliably. Thescreen's fluorescent backlight was particularly troublesome, accounting for70 percent of the display's predicted failure. Rockwell optimized the gasfilm pressures and mixtures inside the lamp to minimize the chances of itbreaking.   Rockwell built special subsystems to ensure that MAT functionscorrectly. The hardware subsystem uses an Intel 80186, and it monitors eachhardware subassembly and peripheral, including the PC's 486. Engineers alsohad to modify much of the network management code so it could switch offand disconnect from the network any monitoring systems that weren'tworking, to avoid giving the crew inaccurate information. If any systemsmalfunction, MAT will shut itself down. Designers believe it's better togive flight crews no information from MAT rather than incorrectinformation.Unix: Top Gun   Designers chose Unix for its reliability and settled on Venix because itis modular, has real-time extensions, and supports database managementapplications that run on The Santa Cruz Operation's UnixWare (see thefigure ``Unix Sandwich''). Venix also runs on MAT's 25-MHz 486, which wasthe fastest Intel chip that was available at the time the project beganfive years ago. Rockwell wrote about 30 percent of the system softwareitself using C and small amounts of assembly language, much of it fordrivers for the hardware components.   The rest of the software consists primarily of standard Venix modules,which Boeing could pick and choose as needed. The MAT system software lackstypical Unix features such as the vi editor, whose presence might be asecurity risk because unauthorized users might be able to disable thesystem. MAT software runs in only 16 MB of memory, a requirement on thespace- and power-constrained aircraft. For the GUI, Boeing chose X WindowSystem and Motif libraries from AGE Software, which run on a TexasInstruments 34020 graphics processor.   Boeing needed to control MAT so it wouldn't interfere with theflight-critical systems attached to the LAN. The system had to be able towait for a few milliseconds while the LAN sent critical traffic that tookpriority over the maintenance system. Originally, Unix was unbounded andhad no mechanism for preempting the kernel. Recent versions allow responsesin the 20-ms range, but developers can't precisely control the responserate. Venix's real-time extensions allow a predictable response within tensof milliseconds, which was enough to meet Boeing's requirements.Preflight Checks   Even though the maintenance system was not certified asflight-essential, it needed to be more reliable than typical desktopsoftware. In addition, Boeing and Rockwell wanted to analyze this system'sreliability to see if it would one day be possible to use commercialsoftware in flight-essential systems. As a result, the testing processbecame a crucial and lengthy part of the software-development effort.   The FAA requires a review of every line of code in the systems itcertifies. On flight-critical systems, developers must write each line soit can be tested to prove it does what it's designed to do. The testingrequired for MAT wasn't this stringent. In some cases, Rockwell was able touse standard Unix tests.   But to improve the reliability and testability of the code, Rockwellwrote custom code so the software could be tested line-by-line like anyflight-system software. The company also developed rigorous test softwarefor Venix. ``To be certified as a [flight-essential] system, you must do anadditional level of testing, where you ensure that the test suite covers100 percent of the statements in the code,'' says Steve Fuemmeler, Rockwellsoftware manager. ``Industry-standard tests for commercial software did nothit this mark.''   Rockwell had assumed that off-the-shelf tests would execute about 80percent of the code statements. They planned to write the remaining teststhemselves.   In fact, existing tests executed only 27 percent of the code, andRockwell, VenturCom, and AGE Software spent far more time writing their owntests than they had anticipated. ``On Venix, we wrote additionalsupplemental tests that got us much closer, that did more structuraltesting and coverage of the software,'' Fuemmeler says.   In addition to the fact that tests with 100 percent code coverage aren'tavailable for Unix, the amount of code in systems such as X and Motif makethorough testing impractical--another surprise to the avionics industry,says Bob Geers, 777 electronic data management system program manager forRockwell. For instance, Motif has about 300,000 lines of code, and 100,000test procedures covered less than half the code and took days to execute ona 66-MHz 486.   The testing showed whether the software worked as it was designed to,weeded out any failures, and gauged how well code ran during power surgesand in high-temperature conditions. Stress testing showed memory leaks thatRockwell was able to fix early on. The company doesn't claim to have foundevery bug or problem, but Rockwell says it is confident the software runsreliably.   Rockwell's software designers have several recommendations fordevelopers who want to make their code more reliable. First, at least a fewpeople on the design team should have a good understanding of both softwarearchitecture and hardware and how the two interact. Second, spend the bulkof your time up front understanding your requirements and designing thesoftware to meet them. A good peer review of software design is better thanfinding problems after you've written the system. Third, if you findproblems in actual operation that your testing didn't catch, go back andsee why the tests didn't catch them. If you keep track of this process, itwill improve your chances of catching these problems in the future,Rockwell believes.   For example, Rockwell might find problems in the software caused bypower fluctuations on the aircraft that QA didn't identify because itdidn't test for such real-world conditions in the first place, Fuemmelersays. Rockwell wrote custom software that would allow MAT to handle powerfailures of a few tenths of a second, which are common on aircraft whenthey switch from auxiliary power to engine power at takeoff and landing.The hardware flags the software during power interruptions so the softwarecan initialize the appropriate module.   Usually, data loss isn't a problem because RAM will hold up for shortperiods without power. Rockwell then tested the software's ability tofunction during power loss with test equipment that injects a powerinterrupt of the required duration. Another Rockwell test exercised all thesystem calls and X library calls that the current set of applications onthe aircraft will use. The test suite ran for 10 days to check for adverseeffects on performance or loss of available memory. In the real world,aircraft systems often run for this long. ``They'll roll the aircraft up tothe gate, keep it on, and then fly again,'' Fuemmeler says.Bringing It In   Despite the amount of test software Rockwell wrote, using off-the-shelfsoftware halved the amount of time spent in development since so much ofthe code was already written. Now that it has written tests to make up forUnix test shortfalls, Rockwell hopes to one day use Unix in more-criticalsystems.   However, the company believes it's difficult to use the X or Motiflayers in any system that has to be thoroughly tested. ``The size of XWindow and Motif, the lack of a disciplined development process with the XConsortium, and the approach they took to develop X Window and Motif do notlend themselves to essential levels of certification,'' Geers says. If itwere not for those layers, MAT might have qualified for flight-essentialstatus, he adds.   Even with the long test cycles, Geers estimates the company still saved10 percent or 20 percent of the time it would have spent in testing aproprietary-code system--but it's a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison,because the tests were not as comprehensive as would have been required ina flight-critical system. MAT also has far more features and functions thanwould a maintenance system created with proprietary code, he says.   Other areas where Rockwell might be able to use off-the-shelf softwarein the future include workstations that are used by flight attendants andentertainment systems that are located in seat backs and arms. ``Because weblazed a trail on the development process with commercial, off-the-shelfsoftware, the development savings was marginal, but in terms of the future,it could represent significant cost savings,'' Geers believes.Product InformationVenix EDS $14,000VenturCom.

Suddenly, the page comes to life. Animated figures tumble fromthe margins. Graphs slink sideways through time. A beveled data-entry panelappears, complete with running totals.   This is HotJava, Sun Microsystems' Web browser. It can download its ownprograms, called applets, and run them embedded on a Web page. In manyways, HotJava represents the holy grail of computer science--a universal,global OS.   HotJava retains the key advantage of a traditional Webbrowser--universality. But while standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)browsers sacrifice features so they can display information on many kindsof computers, HotJava enables you to extend an HTML browser. Any client,regardless of its CPU or OS, can access the same applications as long asit's using a Java-enabled browser (see the figure ``The UniversalInterface'' on page 80).   This means client/server developers that use HotJava as a front endmight never need to install any customized client software. And if adeveloper uses the Java programming language, an application might neverneed to be ported to another system.Not Just Another Browser   While Java and Hot Java have great potential for revolutionizing theWeb, they actually predate the Web frenzy. James Gosling, a Sun engineerand creator of the NeWS windowing system, started work on Java in 1991.   Originally called Oak, Java was designed for programming consumerelectronics, where it would be used to create a heterogeneous network ofhome appliances. This environment defined Java's characteristics as asmall, reliable, real-time interpreter that was, above all, portable andable to leap across the wire. Searching for a useful application, the Sunteam made a foray into the set-top-box market. Then in mid-1994, accordingto Gosling, ``we realized we could build a really cool browser.''   The HotJava browser runs applets written in the Java language. Java isan interpreted language that's based on C++ but is designed for dynamicloading. HTML pages that are designed for HotJava have special tags of theform . When HotJava sees the app=tag, it goes back to the Web server that the HTML page originally came fromand asks for the file appname.class. HotJava then creates a window on theWeb page with the dimensions xx,yy and runs the applet in the window.   While Java has a syntax similar to that of C++, it's designed to workaround C++'s more problematic features, especially linking, objectinstantiation, and memory management. For example, instead of includingclass definitions and then linking the code, Java programmers just importthe code and definitions dynamically in a single statement. Additionally,instead of using Delete and then chasing memory leaks, Java programmers canjust continue and let a garbage collector clean up memory.   The complete Java kit, which is available (in most cases for free) fromthe Sun server at http://java.sun.com, includes a HotJava browser, a Javacompiler (called javac), documentation, and libraries. The javac compilerturns Java source code (java files) into class files containing bytecode, alow-level pseudo-machine language. A virtual machine on the target platformthen interprets the bytecode.   As an interpreted language, Java sacrifices speed--programs interpretedon the Java virtual machine run about 10 to 15 times slower than compiledprograms do. Sun is aware of this problem and plans to address it in afuture release, which might be available by the time you read this article.Java interpreters use just-in-time compilation to load the bytecode andthen translate it to local machine code. Thus equipped, Java should be fastenough for any application, including real-time graphics.   To deploy a Java applet (see the figure ``How Java Works'' below), youjust put the class files on any Web server. Regular HTTP servers work finefor serving HotJava applications, since HotJava uses a standard HTTP GETcommand to retrieve its code.   Though easy to get and deploy, Java requires a higher skill level forcontent developers than HTML. Java is a real programming language thatrequires a real programmer. Programmers have to learn their way around thestandard Java library, which contains objects and methods for openingsockets, implementing the HTTP protocol, creating threads, writing to thedisplay, and building a user interface within an applet.Tackling Security   As a user, you are probably nervous about surfing into a uniformresource locator (URL) and splashing down into an unknown program. Youdon't want the program to write viruses onto your disk, read your mail, orbroadcast nasty messages to users on your LAN. Because of the potential forvandalism or errors, the creators of HotJava included a number of specialsecurity measures.   For example, a load-time check ensures reliable execution. Java is astrongly typed, stacked language. Because of this architecture, a parsercan read the bytecode as it loads and ensure that all operations act onobjects of the correct type and that all operations parse correctly.   Also, at run time, applets don't get access to the printer, and they canaccess only a single directory on your disk. They allocate memory from aspecial Java heap, and the parser checks memory access for validity.   In addition, domain-address checks constrain network access. A settingin the HotJava browser enables you to prevent a Java applet fromcommunicating with any domain except the one from which it originated.   Is clever technology enough to prevent vandalism or security leaks fromattractive Trojan horse applets? Only time will tell. However, Java appletsare safer than ordinary Internet freeware, and Java's attention to securitysets it apart from other types of downloadable code.Competition Looms   Java faces its first real competition in the on-demand software categoryfrom Microsoft's Blackbird, a system for authoring and distributing on-linecontent, due to appear in early 1996. Sun and Microsoft have alreadystarted sparring about which environment is better.   Like Java, Blackbird dynamically loads code from a network, in the formof OLE Controls (OCXes) inserted into a document. After that, however, thetwo products cease to be similar. Java is a programming tool. It's small,portable, and secure. A Java system is likely to be easy to maintain,because its local installation is minimal and it loads most of its code ondemand over the network.   By contrast, Microsoft's Blackbird is a complete authoring andpublishing environment. It harnesses all the features of Windows 95 and OLE2.0. Blackbird documents are pages that have embed-ded OCXes. A clientdownloads a document through a requester called the caching object store.   Every object on the page receives its own global universal ID (GUID),which enables a sophisticated caching and notification scheme--one thatcould spawn, for example, a variety of accounting mechanisms forsubscription and controlled-access business models. A Blackbird client canalso manipulate local OLE servers, such as Microsoft Excel. At the serverend, Microsoft promises drag-and-drop layout tools for constructing contentfrom Office source materials, as well as one-button publishing of theresulting compound documents.   All of Blackbird's wonders come at a cost: There's no security in theBlackbird client. A developer can send you an application that scans yourdisk for sensitive information (as the original Microsoft Network clientwas rumored to do) or that even vandalizes your machine. As the sayinggoes, let the buyer beware.   Blackbird was still unavailable at this writing, but it will clearlydeliver a lot more than current Web servers and browsers do. Microsoft haspromised a Blackbird client for the Macintosh; however, portability forembedded controls is unlikely. Developers' willingness to invest inBlackbird applications will depend on how sensitive they are to securityand whether they believe Windows is the only OS they will ever need.The Future of Java   In spite of Microsoft's efforts with Blackbird, Sun is committed toestablishing Java as a standard, according to chief technology officer EricSchmidt. Sun is building HotJava browsers for Mac OS 7.5+, Solaris, Windows95, and Windows NT. At this writing, Spry and Netscape had announced theirintention to include Java in a next-generation browser.   The Sun Java team has released the source code for porting to Unixsystems other than Solaris. The documentation warns that this is anontrivial port because of the use of graphics and thread primitives.However, porting projects for Linux and other platforms have sprung up inthe energetic Internet freeware community. Most important, Sun has offeredattractive licensing agreements to other commercial Web browser developersthat want to bundle a Java interpreter.   Sometime in the near future when we jack in to the Internet, whensoftware is delivered on demand, distributed systems are stripped down intosingle servers, and our desktop computers are multimedia laptops with asingle implementation of the universal client software, we will be able tosee the technology of 1995 for what it is: huge, unstable OSes, dustystacks of CDs, constant upgrades and maintenance installations, phone callsfor help or for overnight delivery, server closets located on every floor,complex and tenuous replication and distribution of data, and incompatibleapplications. It's messy, it's expensive, and, thanks in part to Java, it'ssoon to be obsolete.Where to FindSun Microsystems, Inc.Mountain View, CA(415) 960-1300fax: (415) 969-9131http://java.sun.comIllustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: A Sample AppletWhen this sample applet is run using a Java-enabled browser, it randomlycycles the colors of the text associated with it.// Call with // this applet paints  in a random color every milliseconds   import browser.Applet;   import awt.Graphics;   import awt.Color;   import java.lang.Math;   class DifferentColor extends Applet implements Runnable {   // a ``Runnable'' class has a run method (an ``interface'') to set up a``Thread''    Thread painter = null;    String text = null; // text to paint    int delay = 2000; // repaint delay in milliseconds  public void init() {    text=getAttribute(``text''); // retrieve from thecaller    delay = Integer.parseInt(getAttribute(``delay''));    resize(60, 25); // change this to fit thetext  }  public void paint(Graphics g) {    // Repaint the text in a different random color each time    g.SetColor(new Color((int) (255*Math.random()),    (int) (255*Math.random()),    (int) (255*Math.random())));    g.drawString(text, 10, 25);  }    public void start() {    if (painter==null);    {    painter=new Thread(this); // start athread to run this applet    painter.start();    }    }    public void run() {    while (painter!=null)    { // repaint every delaymilliseconds    painter.sleep(delay);    repaint();    }    }}Illustration: Figure: The Universal InterfaceA Java-enabled browser acts as a universal interface that gives usersuniform access to applications written in the Java programming language,regardless of the CPU or OS of the client.Illustration: Figure: How Java WorksDevelopers follow a number of steps to make animated and interactive Webpages available over the Internet.Illustration: Illustration: Anyone interested in checking out thecapabilities of Java can download a HotJava browser from Sun's home page(http://java.sun.com).About the Author(s):Andrew Singleton is president of Money.Com (Cambridge, MA), a provider offinancial information services on the Internet.

And an aluminum companyfound that it could increase the life span of its metal castings withsimulations on a Convex. And a telecommunications company figured out howto send its customer bills faster with an IBM.   While a number of well-regarded supercomputer companies have gonetoes-up--Cray Computer (a spin-off of Cray Research), Kendall SquareResearch, and Thinking Machines--this shakeout is not the death knell ofthe supercomputer industry. Supercomputer companies, from old stalwart CrayResearch to new kids like Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), are alive andwell.   But today you might well mistake a next-generation supercomputer for afiling cabinet tucked into an office corner or even--shock hazard--beside adesk. There's still some some custom parts inside these systems, butthey're mostly off-the-shelf workstation components. Nevertheless, such abox packs more processing might than its ancestors did, and it sports adouble-take price tag that a mid- to large-size business can afford: around$100,000 and up. As a business and its computing demands grow, thesupercomputer can grow along with it, by the addition of extra processorsand hard drives.A Fast History of Speed   In the sixties and seventies, supercomputer companies like Cray Researchgot their start building systems that could handle formidable scientificand engineering problems that used floating-point calculations extensively.The intense computational demands of this type of work--much of itinvolving nuclear research or aerospace design, motivated by the armsrace--combined with the necessity of quick results, meant that cost was noobject in obtaining the fastest hardware possible. For example, the firstCray-1, like the one shipped to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976,had a peak speed of 167 MFLOPS and cost anywhere from $4 million to $11.2million, depending on the hardware configuration.   These systems used a vector-processing design that reflected typicalengineering problems. Vectors are data arrays representing specificquantities. For example, you might model a jet engine with one vectorrepresenting the engine's structural elements, another specifying thermalcharacteristics within the engine, and a third detailing the fluid flowthrough the engine. A program that simulates engine operationmathematically combines the vectors according to physical models, iteratingfrom time-step to time-step. Properly done, the simulation allows you tostudy the behavior of engine parts as the engine runs, which enables you tospot flaws in a new design or evaluate the strength of a different enginematerial without ever building a real prototype.   To boost performance, supercomputer designers oriented the systemarchitecture around these vector operations, adding extra hardware to theprocessor to manipulate data vectors efficiently. Pipelined logic unitsallowed operations such as multiple memory accesses and the rapidcombination of data vectors to overlap. To run at a high clock rate, thesespecial-purpose processors employed bipolar logic circuits--fast, but sohot that they needed liquid cooling systems. High-performance--andhigh-price-tag--peripherals handled the supercomputer's I/O demands.   Compounding the system price even further was the cost of software. Somesupercomputers used proprietary OSes, and researchers often had to writethe modeling software from scratch. Nevertheless, because these researchproblems required tremendous processing power, and government fundinghelped foot the bill, supercomputers sold. Supercomputer companies may havesold only a few dozen systems a year, but they charged high margins todefray the expenses of research and building a limited run of parts.   Because producing faster custom processors pushed the limits offabrication technology, new supercomputer designs became more difficult andmore expensive. Cray Research begat Cray Computer in 1989 to develop customprocessors out of gallium arsenide, a material with faster switching timesthan silicon. That company eventually foundered last year due to delays infabricating such parts.   Ironically, Cray Research itself kept ahead of the competition by takinga different tack entirely. Rather than using faster processors, its 1983Cray X-MP had up to four custom vector processors to divide and conquercomputing jobs. This system, which could deliver a peak of 941 MFLOPS, costanywhere from $2.5 million to $16 million.Many Brains Make Light Work   Then came RISC. While perhaps not as powerful as a custom processor, aRISC processor had a significant price advantage. Manufactured by thehundreds of thousands rather than by the dozen, their enormous economies ofscale made RISC processors much less expensive by comparison. With multipleprocessors working together, a complex problem could fall by sheer numbersrather than by raw speed.   Another speed boost: The competitive nature of the workstation markethad RISC vendors striving to one-up the competition by boosting chipperformance. According to Jack J. Dongarra of the mathematical sciencessection at Oak Ridge Laboratory, who keeps track of the supercomputingindustry, ``RISC processors got faster quicker than anyone expected.Although RISC first appeared in a commercial system about a decade afterthe first supercomputer, their floating-point performance lags [behind thatof] traditional supercomputers by only an order of magnitude. We see thecurrent generation of RISC processors matching the performance of lastgeneration's traditional supercomputers on a per-processor basis.''   Employing gangs of processors in parallel affects how you writeprograms. You divvy up the data array, assigning different portions todifferent processors. Every processor runs its portion of the program inparallel (i.e., simultaneously) with the other processors. As the programprogresses, every processor exchanges data with its neighbors, as shown inthe figure ``Processing Schemes'' on page 50. This scheme is known asparallel processing. A parallel-processor architecture can be scalable;that is, to get more computing power, you can add more processors to theexisting system.   But don't abandon vector processing just yet. In certain situations, avector-processing system delivers better performance than aparal-lel-processing system, especially when dealing with complexsimulations involving huge data arrays. That's because the averagememory-access times can be shorter with vector processing, even with alarge memory space. In contrast, a parallel-processing system with lots ofmemory might have to wait quite a while for data to move from one part ofthe system to another (because, as on a network of PCs, a packet mightrattle around through dozens of nodes before reaching its target).   Current vector-processing supercomputers are also scalable (up to apoint), in that you add more processors to boost performance. The CrayX-MP, though a vector-processor machine, had a scalable architecture. Craystill sells scalable vector-processing supercomputers, such as the T90 andJ90. Over the long haul, however, the price point of RISC processors willallow the construction of ever-larger, more powerful parallel-processingsystems.Supershakeout and Recovery   During this decade, recession and the Cold War's end have shrunkresearch funds drastically. The savvier supercomputer companies beganexploring other market possibilities before the money dried up. Businesseswere keen on using the processing power of a supercomputer, but theyweren't in a hurry to buy: The huge price tag was hard to justify,especially if a business's work load outgrew the system's capabilities injust a few years. Also, a proprietary supercomputer OS would restrict anycustom in-house applications to running on that type of system and noother. And you still couldn't buy supercomputer software at Egghead.   Supercomputer companies responded to these issues. To address pricesensitivity, supercomputer designs started to feature merchant or``commodity'' workstation parts, such as IBM's Power2, Hewlett-Packard'sPA-RISC 7200, and SGI's Mips R8000. Common peripherals, such as SCSI-2drives, 100-Mbps Ethernet, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), and FiberDistributed Data Interface (FDDI) network connections, also became part ofthe mix and kept costs low.   Commodity parts plus a scalable architecture also solved the growthissue: As a business expanded, you could add more (less expensive)processors and hard drives to meet computing demands. Prices for a basicscalable supercomputer today, which can start at around $100,000, reflectthe new market reality.   Finally, and perhaps most important, supercomputer companies adoptedwidely accepted workstation OSes, such as IBM's AIX, Sun's Solaris, andSGI's Irix 6. This drove a stake into the heart of proprietary softwareconcerns. Supercomputers can now tap into the existing base of workstationapplications and customers. When an office's work load overwhelms itsworkstations, the company can reasonably migrate upstream to asupercomputer. It can then use the workstations as terminals to submit jobsto the supercomputer or to handle smaller jobs.Superpower at Work   Different markets have accepted supercomputers because of their lowprice and scalable processing power. Oil companies can improve theiraccuracy in finding future oil and gas reserves by processing seismic dataand simulating reservoir flow, reducing their typically astronomicaldrilling costs. Car manufacturers can simulate crashes of prototypes,speeding new--yet reliable--models into the showroom six months ahead ofthe competition.   You don't have to be in the Fortune 100 to profit from supercomputersmarts, either. Banks use supercomputers to handle thousands of on-linetransactions and to call up credit histories within seconds. Retailbusinesses sift through gigabytes of point-of-sale receipts to data-mineimportant trends.   While the supercomputers of yesterday might have generated results ofinterest only to a handful of physicists, today's supercomputers offersomething for everyone. Whether it's marketing a new product, speedingcatalog-order turnaround, or manufacturing car parts, most jobs can nowbenefit--economically--from the power of supercomputers.   Alcoa Aluminum's adoption of a new-generation Convex supercomputer is aclassic example. Simulating the casting of large aluminum parts--possiblyfor use in cars--is easier than actually produc-ing them. Walt Wahnsiedler,a technical specialist for Alcoa's process design and smelting, uses aConvex Exemplar SPP1000/CD with eight processors to model aluminum-castingoperations. These models help find ways to reduce the stress on the steeldies used in casting, so the dies last longer than the usual 20,000castings, thus saving costs. They also can reduce defects in the aluminumparts themselves caused by shrinkage during cooling or by pores introduceddue to gas.   Alcoa formerly used a Convex C1, and then HP workstations, to runcommercial simulation software. Because the Convex Exemplar's SPP-UX OS isbinary-compatible with HP-UX applications, Wahnsiedler moved the company'scommercial software to the Exemplar with few problems. ``It has improvedproductivity by letting me run more simulations or run simulations that wecouldn't do otherwise,'' he says.   For example, car companies would prefer to make parts out of largeone-piece assemblies that are more solid structurally than those made ofseveral pieces welded together; plus, fewer parts speeds building avehicle. ``With the Convex,'' reports Wahnsiedler, ``I can now simulatethese larger parts, whose models can have up to 1.5 million cells, whilereducing defects.''Multiprocessing Architectures   While parallel processing offers a definite cost advantage, its mainbenefit--scalability--can still be difficult to achieve. That's because asyou add processors, the contention for shared system resources intensifies.Several different parallel-processing designs address this fundamentalproblem, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.   The first, symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), has a simple yet effectivedesign, as shown in the figure ``Parallel-Processing Architectures'' onpage 46. (The SGI Power Challenge and the Cray CS6400 Enterprise Server areexamples of SMP designs.) In SMP, multiple processors share RAM and thesystem bus. This design is also known as tightly coupled, or ``sharedeverything.''   Because SMP shares RAM globally, it has only one memory space, whichsimplifies both system and applications programming. This single memoryspace lets a threaded OS distribute its tasks among various processors orlets an application obtain the memory it needs for a complex simulation.The globally shared memory also makes data synchronization easy. SMP is oneof the most mature parallel-processing designs. It appeared in the CrayX-MP and similar systems over a decade ago.   However, this global memory also contributes to SMP's biggest problem:As you add more processors, memory-bus traffic increases until you reach apoint where the bus gets saturated. Adding local cache memory to everyprocessor can reduce some bus traffic, but the bus generally becomes abottleneck at about eight processors or more.   Massively parallel processing (MPP) is another parallel-processingdesign. To avoid memory-bus bottlenecks, MPP does not use shared memory.Instead, it distributes the RAM among the processors so that the hardwareresembles a network. Because of the loose distribution of RAM resources,this architecture is also known as loosely coupled, or ``shared nothing.''   To access the memory outside its own RAM, a processor must use amessage-passing scheme analogous to network packets. This system reducesbus traffic, because each section of memory sees only those accesses thatare bound for it, rather than every memory access, as in an SMP system.This enables large-size MPP systems with hundreds or even thousands ofprocessors. IBM's RS/6000 Scalable Powerparallel System (SP2 for short) isan example of an MPP system.   The downside to MPP is that it makes programming difficult, because itbreaks memory into small separate spaces. Without any globally sharedmemory space, running (and writing) an application that requires a largeamount of RAM (in comparison to local memory) can be difficult. Datasynchronization among widely distributed tasks also becomes difficult,particularly if a message must make many hops to the target processor'smemory.   Writing an MPP application also requires that you be aware of aprogram's memory organization. Wherever it's necessary, you have to insertmessage-passing commands into the program code. Besides complicating theprogram design, such commands can create hardware dependencies in yourapplications. However, most supercomputer vendors have safeguardedapplications portability by adopting either a public-domain message-passingmechanism, known as Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM), or a developingstandard, called Message Passing Interface (MPI), to implement themessage-passing mechanism.   How to overcome the difficulties of SMP and MPP? The last parallelarchitecture, scalable parallel processing (SPP), is a hybrid of both,using a two-tier memory hierarchy to achieve scalability. The first memorytier consists of a node that is essentially an SMP system, complete withmultiple processors and their globally shared memory.   You build larger SPP systems by interconnecting two or more nodes viathe second memory tier so that this tier appears logically as one globalshared-memory space to the nodes. The two-tier memory reduces bus traffic,since only updates to keep memory coherent among the nodes occur. SPP thusoffers the easy-to-program SMP programming model while providingscalability similar to that of an MPP design. The Convex Exemplar is anexample of an SPP machine.Superapps   Because they use workstation OSes and common RISC processors, the newbreed of supercomputers inherits a stable of ready-made workstationapplications. The SMP architecture that's typical in most systems confersan advantage as well. The globally shared memory lets appropriatelymodified applications work with larger data arrays or distribute the workload in threads across multiple processors.   However, some software vendors don't want to modify their existingcommercial applications for fear of introducing bugs with the rewrite.Also, fully supporting multiprocessor hardware using threads, or writingmessage-passing code for an MPP system, is a daunting task.   Fortunately, you can find ways around these issues, depending on theapplication type. Many supercomputer OSes can partition the machine so thatsome or all of the processors function as stand-alone systems. A companycan then fold its existing traditional work flow into the computer.   Some partitions function in a mainframe batch-mode operation, lettingusers submit jobs from terminals or workstations, while other partitionsuse multiple processors to tackle compute-intensive jobs. Each stand-alonepartition can run its own copy of a mission-critical application, so thesystem can handle multiple users. This arrangement also lets companiesconsolidate all their computing services into one box.   Lotus Notes is an application in point, since large companies use it asa collaboration mechanism. A typical enterprise-level installation mighthave thousands of users, managed by dozens of servers linked across thecountry or around the world. A setup such as this gives a system managernightmares because of the software upgrades and maintenance problemsinvolved in dealing with these widely scattered computers. Furthermore,data synchronization among the separate Notes databases is problematic.   However, a properly configured IBM SP2 supercomputer can come to therescue. First, you configure the SP2 so that each processor operatesindependently. Next, you run native copies of the Notes server, one perprocessor, thus creating an array of virtual servers.   This arrangement consolidates all the servers into a single system andeliminates maintenance and upgrade hassles. While Notes currently limitsdatabase access to only one server at a time (because all the servers drawfrom the same database file), synchronization issues disappear. This setupalso offers mission-critical redundancy: Some virtual servers in the systemcan operate as backup units, taking charge when a failure disables anactive server.   Another existing job that supercomputers can tackle is handling largevolumes of information, either for on-line transaction processing (OLTP) orfor data mining (on-line analytical processing, or OLAP). Companies canaccumulate gigabytes of sales data daily, and supercomputers warehouse theinformation for evaluation. How large can these data warehouses grow? CrayResearch has shown a 48-processor CS6400 managing a 1.6-TB (a terabyteequals 1 million MB) Oracle7 database.   Fortunately, such a setup does not require modification of the front-endapplication. Instead, the database managing the back end routes the queriesto individual processors. Complex queries that generate multiple datatables can go out to several processors, as long as the results of eachtable do not depend on another table's data. Key to this sort of operationis parallel-processing-savvy database software, such as Oracle's Oracle7Parallel Server, Informix's PDQ Dynamic Server Architecture, and Sybase'sSystem 10 Navigation Server.   Rob Geller, director of marketing and sales systems at MCI, uses an IBMSP2 system to consolidate the company's demographic and billing data, whichused to be stored in several mainframes located around the U.S. The SP2 has104 nodes and operates on a 3-TB Informix relational database. Geller usesoff-the-shelf desktop and workstation software, including Brio's BrioQuery,to mine the data. The results help MCI refine behavioral models that directmarketing and sales efforts. ``The SP2 has boosted the rate of our analysisby an order of magnitude,'' Geller says. ``Queries that once took over 2hours now take only a minute. This also lets us ask questions that weren'tpossible before.''   A supercomputer's capacity lets a company combine the data-processingneeds of diverse departments, often with synergistic results. For example,Macklanburg-Duncan, a manufacturer of building-improvement products, uses aCray CS6400 Enterprise Server to integrate its customer orders andmanufacturing and financial information. The system keeps track ofinventory for 4000 different products and helps coordinate shipments to17,000 customers nationwide.   Previously, this data was on separate mainframes. According to MichaelMack, Macklanburg-Duncan's manager of technical services, consolidating allthese operations on the Cray gives the company a fast response time onorders. ``An order goes through a series of processes, and if this processreleases the order, the shipping form gets printed immediately. The entireoperation takes only 30 minutes if an order is transmittedelectronically,'' he says.   Phone orders take a little longer: A customer-service consultant entersan order on-line and has the option of immediately processing it orallowing a periodic batch job to perform this task. The company warehousesorders so that geographic and purchase-activity information can help directthe company's decision-making. ``Because of the Cray's scalability,'' Mackcontinues, ``we'll be able to add other divisions or acquisitions withouthaving to purchase additional machines. There will be incremental costs toadd resources, but the CS6400 gives us the ability to expand as ourbusiness grows.''Tall Buildings to Leap   While supercomputer vendors such as Cray Research and SGI have usedingenious techniques to extend SMP's performance, this architecture willeventually reach a performance limit. In the long term, like it or not,future application designs will have to grapple with MPP systems andmessage-passing schemes.   Unfortunately, as the description of the MPP architecture suggests,writing such parallel code is not easy. A dearth of development tools--notsurprising, given the relative newness of MPP designs--aggravates thesituation. Debugging is especially complex, since it's difficult to isolatea problem connected to a thread that has crashed on a single processor.   In a scene that's similar to desktop computing, supercomputing hardwarehas outpaced the software. While writing such software will take time, thesituation is not that grim: There's plenty of work for supercomputers to dowith the software that's currently available.   Supercomputing's transition has required the parallel processes ofdesign simplification and standardization, the use of multiple inexpensivecomponents, and proper marketing--all similar paths to the computerindustry as a whole. Supercomputers have escaped their ivory-tower prisonsto help businesses with such mundane-but-crucial tasks as rapid orderturnaround and strategic decisions made with the help of data mining.   There seems little doubt that the lessons learned in the stratosphere ofcomputing will eventually appear in desktop machines that routinely usesimilar multiple-processor architectures. Thus, the final triumph ofsupercomputing may be its assimilation into desktop computers everywhere.Where to FindConvex Computer Corp.Richardson, TX(214) 497-4000fax: (214) 497-4848http://www.convex.comCray ResearchBusiness Systems DivisionBeaverton, OR(800) 289-2729(503) 641-3151fax: (503) 520-7724CS6400@cray.comhttp://www.cray.comIBM Corp.Somers, NY(800) 426-3333http://lscftp.kgn.ibm.com/pps/Silicon Graphics, Inc.Mountain View, CA(800) 800-7441(415) 960-1980fax: (415) 961-0595http://www.sgi.comIllustration(s):Illustration: Figure: Parallel-Processing ArchitecturesSMP offers programming simplicity, while MPP provides better expandability.SPP is a hybrid that's expandable yet easy to program.Illustration: Figure: Processing SchemesVector and parallel processing compared.

Butthe merger evolved out of a tight alliance that started in 1992. Convex hadplenty to offer HP: It had succeeded in fabricating high-speed galliumarsenide CPUs--the same technology that had done in Cray Computer--and putthem in its proprietary C line of supercomputers.   The Exemplar line of supercomputers takes the commodity-parts route anduses HP's own PA-RISC 7200 processor, clocked at 120 MHz. The ExemplarSPP1200/CD, a compact model, starts with two processors and is expandableto a maximum of 16. The SPP1200/XA starts with eight processors and expandsto a maximum of 128. RAM configurations range from 128 MB to 32 GB. I/Osupport includes fast-and-wide SCSI-2 and FDDI.   The basic building block of the Exemplar is a hypernode that holds amaximum of eight processors. Each hypernode is essentially an SMP systemwhere the processors and memory connect through a special four-by-five,high-speed, nonblocking crossbar bus. Gallium arsenide gate arraysimplement the crossbar logic. When a processor accesses RAM, bus logiccalled an agent (see the figure ``The Convex Hypernode'') looks for an idlebus to memory and makes the connection. The fifth part of the crossbar isfor I/O only.   Convex achieves scalable parallel processing by tying hypernodestogether. Four one-way toroidal rings connect the hypernodes. CalledCoherent Toroidal Interconnect (CTI) by Convex, it's based on the IEEEstandard 1596-1992 Scalable Coherency Interface (SCI). The crossbar logicmonitors memory accesses, and local (i.e., on-board) access remains on thehypernode. Remote (i.e., off-board) accesses get passed to the rings.Through CTI, the memories on all the hypernodes appear as one globallyshared memory space (see the figure ``Toroidal Interconnect'').   Because the rings are actually cables, you can tie several Convexsystems together to obtain more processing power. Furthermore, you stillhave one unified memory space, even though the RAM is physically located indifferent machines.   The Exemplar uses a multiprocessor verion of Unix called SPP-UX. SPP-UXis binary-compatible with HP-UX, so the Exemplar can draw on thousands ofHP workstation applications.   A basic Exemplar 1200/CD 2 with two processors and 128 MB of RAM costs$128,320. A basic Exemplar 1200/XA 8 has eight processors and 256 MB of RAMand costs $349,500. Each four-processor upgrade will set you back$107,800.Illustration(s):Illustration: Figure: The Convex HypernodeTop: A crossbar minimizes bus contention for RAM.Illustration: Figure: Toroidal InterconnectLeft: The CTI organizes distributed memory into one shared space.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. CRAY: FASTER THAN A BOTTLENECK BULLETCray Research started its Business Systems Division about four years ago tobuild supercomputer systems that would serve business needs. The company'sCray CS6400 Enterprise Server uses an SMP architecture to support up to 64SuperSparcs, each clocked at 60 or 85 MHz.   Since bus traffic normally degrades an SMP design that's built aroundeight processors, the CS6400 seems to defy logic. The system dodges thislimit by using four buses instead of one to reduce memory contention. Eachbus has its own private bank of RAM, while the processors connect to everybus, as shown in the figure below.   Physical memory is interleaved among all four memory banks to create ashared memory space. You can add up to 64 memory modules to the system, fora maximum of 16 GB of RAM. To reduce bus traffic further, every processormodule (which consists of four processors) has a 2-MB static RAM (SRAM)cache. Bus-watcher logic snoops all memory accesses and updates the cachesto maintain memory coherency.   To ensure optimum I/O throughput, up to 16 buses support up to 64 I/Ocontrollers. The I/O subsystem can manage up to 5 TB of on-line storage.Larger storage capacity is possible via the use of either disk arrays or anoff-line archival medium, such as tape. The CS6400 supports communicationsvia Ethernet, 100-Mbps Ethernet, FDDI/CDDI, Token Ring, and ATM.   To host mission-critical applications, a System Service Processor(SSP)--which is actually a built-in Sun workstation--monitors the system'shealth. In the event of a major failure, the SSP restarts the system andlogically removes the problematic hardware. The system design allows you tohot-swap faulty hardware without interrupting service.   The computer runs Solaris 2.4, which is a Unix S5R4 derivative from SunMicrosystems. It can host Sun workstation applications and provide accessto database applications, such as Oracle's Oracle7 and Informix Software'sInformix Online Dynamic Server. The alliance with Sun also fits into astrategy of offering workstation solutions (via Sun), with connectivity tothe CS6400 to tackle the huge jobs.   A basic Cray CS6400 has one processor module and 512 MB of RAM (but nodisk) and costs $400,000. The basic system is rated at 3.8 GFLOPS, althoughfloating-point calculations don't normally figure into the type of workthis system does. The big box, with up to 64 processors and 16 GB of RAM,costs about $4 million.Illustration(s):Illustration: Figure: Four independent buses in the CS6400 reducecontention for system resources.Photograph(s):Photograph: Photograph: The CS6400 can be expanded with additionalprocessors and storage.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. IBM: THE BLUE FLASHDespite the difficulties involved in implementing MPP systems, IBM took upthe challenge and built one. Called the RS/6000 Scalable PowerparallelSystem (SP2 for short), it consists mainly of parts found in RS/6000workstations.   The SP2 starts with two nodes, expandable to 512. A node consists of aPower2 processor, an optional level-2 cache, some RAM (ranging from 64 MBto 2 GB), several Micro Channel slots, an Ethernet connection, and harddisk storage. In August 1995, IBM boosted the processor clock speed from 66MHz to 77 MHz.   Total system RAM starts at 128 MB and is expandable to 1 TB, whileon-line disk storage starts at 2 GB and is expandable to a hefty 9 TB. ForI/O, the SP2 supports a variety of high-speed connections, includingfast-and-wide SCSI-2, 10-Mbps Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ATM, and HighPerformance Parallel Interface (HIPPI).   One problem plaguing MPP designs is the time delays that result whendata migrates from one processor to a distant one. This makes synchronizingdata or tasks difficult.   IBM has minimized this problem by the use of a unique switch that actslike a smart network switch. It routes data packets onto a network leg withthe target system rather than broadcasting the packets over the entirenetwork. The SP2 switch uses a data packet's routing information to locatethe target node's port and sends it immediately if the port is idle. If theport is busy, the packet stays blocked until the port is ready. This schemereduces traffic on the system network.   An SP2 system network consists of two types of components: nodes andswitchboards. On the switchboard are 16 switch chips and correspondingshadow-switch chips for fault recovery, for a total of 32 chips. Each chiphas eight input and eight output ports, a data queue, and an unbufferedcrossbar. Pairs of chips (one handling input, one handling output) arewired to construct a four-way to four-way crossbar, which implements a16-port bidirectional multistage interconnection network, as shown in thefigure ``The SP2 Frame.''   Nodes connect to one side of the switchboard, while the opposite sideconnects to other switchboards. This setup achieves linear scalability,because properly connected switchboards reduce the number of hops betweenwidely scattered nodes. Systems with more than 80 nodes requireintermediate switchboards to handle the interconnection among the nodes, asshown in the figure ``A 128-Node SP2 System.''   Nevertheless, in such large systems, this multistage interconnectionarrangement means that a data write to another processor takes about fourhops. This consistent hop count, whatever the system's size, reducessynchronization problems and simplifies programming. It also providesmultiple pathways between any two nodes, which reduces packet traffic andensures a level of fault recovery.   The SP2 runs AIX with MPP extensions, so applications written forRS/6000 workstations run on the SP2. This provides a convenient migrationpath from workstation to supercomputer as processing demands grow. IBM alsohas ways to tie in AS/400 superminicomputers and 370 mainframes, so the SP2supports a company's existing installation while consolidatinginformation.   A basic SP2 system, with two nodes, 128 MB of RAM, and 2 GB of diskstorage, will cost you $138,000. Additional 77-MHZ nodes cost $51,300 apop.Illustration(s):Illustration: Figure: The SP2 FrameIllustration: Figure: A 128-Node SP2 SystemA 128-node IBM SP2 supercomputer system has eight frames and fourintermediate switchboards.

Arrays of its own 90-MHz Mips R8000 RISCprocessors provide ample processing power for its Power Challengesupercomputer.   The Power Challenge has an SMP design. The basic system contains twoprocessors and is expandable to a maximum of six or 18 processors,depending on the size of the chassis you purchase. Each processor can have4 MB of cache memory, which reduces competition for the system bus. The bushardware performs its own bus snooping to maintain cache coherency.   The RAM bus is 576 bits wide, enough to support one-, two-, four-, oreight-way memory interleaving. The wide bus and memory interleaving providefull bus bandwidth for fast page-mode accesses. System RAM starts at 64 MBand is expandable to 16 GB.   I/O support includes the VME64 bus with five or more slots, fast andwide SCSI-2, and Ethernet. FDDI, Ethernet, and High Performance ParallelInterface (HIPPI) are available via expansion cards. On-line storagecapacities range from a minimum of 2 GB up to 3 TB.   You can boost the processing power by joining several Power Challengesystems together via network links. The downside? The SMP model breaks downfor this arrangement. Instead, you must use the MPP distributed memorymodel for programming, using message-passing to relay memory accesses tothe other systems.   The Power Challenge runs the company's own workstation OS, Irix 6, andcan draw on its horde of visualization software. The Power Challenge systemcomes in a broad array of configurations. A basic Power Challenge L systemcomes with two processors (upgradable to six), 64 MB of RAM, and a 2-GBhard drive and costs $102,800.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: SGI Power ChallengeLarge caches, bus snooping, and interleaved RAM reduce bus traffic in theSGI Power Challenge.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. THE WORLD'S FASTEST SUPERCOMPUTER (NOW)In September 1995, the U.S. Department of Energy's Accelerated StrategicComputing Initiative (ASCI) awarded a $45 million contract for thedevelopment of a supercomputer capable of sustained 1-TFLOPS processing.The TFLOPS system will model the effects of aging on nuclear warheads,which are physically complex mechanisms.   What company won the contract? Intel, the world's largest maker ofcommodity parts for desktop computers.   Because 1 TFLOPS equals 1000 GFLOPS, you can expect any such systemusing current technology to be physically 1000 times larger than any of theGFLOPS systems that are mentioned in this article. And the TFLOPS system isbig: It occupies 1500 square feet, uses more than 9000 processors, andconsumes an estimated 400 kW of power.   The system uses Intel's Pentium Pro processor. The TFLOPS machine has anMPP architecture whose basic element is a node, each consisting of twoPentium Pros. Nodes mount on boards that resemble desktop motherboardsbecause of the commodity parts used in their construction, such as theDRAM, PCI interface, and 82450 chip set. The only nonstandard part on theboard is the network interface (see below).   Boards consist of two types: Compute boards and I/O boards. Each computeboard has two nodes--for a total of four processors--and 128 MB of RAM.Additional RAM, up to a maximum of 512 MB, can be added later. Each I/Oboard has only one node, but richer I/O functions. It manages several PCIbuses (and their expansion cards), the network traffic, and any diskarrays. Each board also has 1 GB of RAM, most of which serves as a filecache for any hard drives.   The system has 74 compute cabinets, each housing 64 nodes (i.e., 32boards). The present setup has 4536 compute nodes (9072 processors) and 283GB of RAM.   The system's two I/O subsystem cabinets each contain about 25 nodes. Onenode monitors the system's health; four manage the Ethernet, FDDI, ATM, andboot-network connections; and 16 to 20 handle the RAID arrays. Each cabinethas more than 32 PCI slots for adding new peripherals. Each I/O subsystemcabinet manages its own 1-TB RAID array. All the cabinets are arranged tominimize the signal length in the InterConnection Fabric (ICF), the networkthat ties the nodes together.   The TFLOPS system arranges the processors in what's known as a 2 1/2Dmesh, as shown in the figure ``The TFLOPS Topology.'' Nodes connect to oneof two 2-D planes that build the packet-switching mesh. Each plane consistsof Message Routing Components (MRCs), six-ported devices that route signalsto adjacent neighbors. Neighbors can be on either plane, since additionalMRC connections bind the two planes together. This arrangement providesalternate data paths so that you can replace a faulty network segmentwithout switching the system off.   Each board's Network Interface Component (NIC) multiplexes all networktraffic at a low level. The combination of NICs and MRCs make up the ICF.The ICF does not maintain memory coherency: That job is up to the OS.   Different portions of the TFLOPS machine run different OSes. The computenodes run a Light-Weight Kernel (LWK) based on SunMOS and the Puma OS.Since each compute node runs a copy of the kernel, a small memory footprintis essential. The I/O nodes run a System V-compatible version of Unix.Illustration(s):Illustration: Figure: The TFLOPS TopologyThe ICF in Intel's TFLOPS machine provides alternate signal paths forreliability.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. SUPER VISIONThe new breed of supercomputers can pay for themselves in many ways. Dr.Dwight Sukup, of Texaco's Exploration and Production Technology Division,uses an SGI Power Challenge in his work. The system processes seismic datato generate 3-D images of how subsurface formations look. These imagesimprove the accuracy of locating new oil and gas reserves.   Accuracy is the name of the game in oil exploration, where an offshorewell in the Gulf of Mexico can cost up to $20 million to drill. Moreimportant, since only one out of six wells ever finds hydrocarbons,``anything that improves the odds so that we save $20 million at a time isworth it,'' says Sukup.   The imaging job begins with the collection of seismic information over a50-square-mile area. Such a survey costs millions of dollars and takesmonths to complete. The data consists of roughly 50 million seismic traces,each made up of 2000 samples. Based on an estimated earth model (i.e., amap of the formations), the data is imaged into a 300- by 400- by1000-point grid. The imaging information provides data to improve the earthmodel, and then the process is repeated. It might take several iterationsto obtain acceptable results.   Any formation data available from wells in the area can improve thephysics of the model. ``Often we're doing exploration work, where therearen't any wells. For that, we might estimate formation material using datataken from wells over 50 miles away,'' explains Sukup. The Power Challengeworks on the seismic data, and the results are fed to aseismic-interpretation workstation for visualization.   By rotating and viewing slices of the 3-D formation map on theworkstations, a geoscientist can spot potential ``traps,'' or imperviouslayers of strata where hydrocarbons might accumulate. This imaging work isespecially valuable in evaluating complex geologic regions around saltstructures. In these areas, the formations are a jumble of different layersof material displaced by the upwelling mass of salt. They make suitabletraps for hydrocarbons moving through the porous strata. Geoscientists canlook inside these complicated formations to locate a trap and to predictwhether it contains sufficient hydrocarbons to warrant drilling a well.   The SGI Power Challenge that Sukup uses has 14 processors and 4 GB ofRAM. It takes the system weeks or months to process one of his models.However, in an industry where it takes months to get a drilling rig intoposition, accuracy is critical. Plus, the SGI system costs less to operatethan a vintage supercomputer.   Says Sukup: ``We used to have a Cray Y-MP (a 1988-era supercomputer) inhere that cost several million a year, because it required its ownmaintenance staff to operate. The Power Challenge just sits there, and wehave our Unix person check it out occasionally.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. OPENDOC AND OLEBy:Alan JochCOMPANYProdigy Services Co.DEVELOPERMichael Twisdale, senior architectDEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTC++, Java, and Telescript. Some Delphi; investigating Smalltalk.THE PROBLEMExpand the on-line service's distributed-processing capabilities. Find waysto distribute applications without divulging source-code secrets.BACKGROUNDProdigy is building experimental OpenDoc and OLE container applicationsthat speak directly to the on-line service. One example is an applicationthat gives users a live stock-market feed with continuous pricing updates.Any traditional business application such as Microsoft Word can act as acontainer and automatically receive stock prices.   OpenDoc works for this application because it supports in-placeactivation. Stock prices can continue to feed into the application evenwhen it's not in the active window. OLE doesn't support this: When youclick off the application, the feed stops. ``This is a big difference, fromour point of view,'' Twisdale says. ``The coolest applications in thefuture will be those that are alive.''   ``In addition,'' he adds, ``distributed processing is simpler withOpenDoc thanks to the System Object Model (SOM) and the Distributed SystemObject Model (DSOM). You just plug in DSOM libraries. OLE is still asingle-desktop strategy. With SOM, we have automatic propagation. Thisguarantees that protocols are consistent. Without this, consistency restswith the programmers.''   OpenDoc's inheritance is important to Twisdale: ``This lets usdistribute source code without giving away any of our trade secrets.''STATUSCI Labs' slow commitment to a 32-bit version of OpenDoc concerned Twisdale.Without that support, he would have to use OLE for NT or Win 95, even if hebelieved OpenDoc to be superior.   There's also concern about OpenDoc's backers. ``When Novell creates asmuch uncertainty as it did at Unix Expo, it's easier for Microsoft to sellOLE,'' Twisdale says. ``Is Novell committed to OpenDoc? Will Apple bearound to support it? Will IBM stand behind SOM? Microsoft is launching ahuge effort to push OLE, but I don't see that happening from Novell and IBMwith OpenDoc.''   ``If we've just developed a whole suite of applications, we're sunk ifOpenDoc support wavers. So we develop in both OpenDoc and OLE. But withOLE, we do so screaming. OLE imposes a lot more work on developers. OLEdoesn't hide things the way more object-oriented environments do. With OLEyou have to remember how what you create will affect this operating systemor that operating system. Microsoft wanted to get to market, so the levelof abstraction in OLE is not that hot.''Photograph(s):Photograph: Photograph: ``Is Novell committed to OpenDoc? Will Apple bearound to support it?

Today, asinformation needs change, users create a new form. ``That's an easy way todevelop, but it's a bad application,'' Dunbar says. ``So now we're lookingat OpenDoc to address this.''STATUSOpenDoc could help reduce interoperability problems that arise from havingindependent development staffs. ``OpenDoc brings to the table objects thatinteroperate without needing direct collaboration between developers,``Dunbar says. ``OLE is a collaborative API: It requires that two developerswork together to agree on specifications.''   OLE's advantage? ``It's already out there.''   To change users familiar only with monolithic applications, Dunbar isrolling out a new interface with a document shell that introduces end usersto the document-centric approach. Within the developer staff, Dunbar willcapitalize on their experience.   ``I have a couple of experts on staff who can focus on thedomain-specific aspects of OpenDoc,'' he says. ``This lets the applicationprogrammers become either just OpenDoc parts builders or parts users.''Gradually, he will introduce the programmers to new ideas like in-placeediting with OpenDoc's parts handler.   ``The developers are ready,'' he says. ``We're experimenting with thealpha version now. I'm banking on OpenDoc being released in beta within thenext six months.''Photograph(s):Photograph: Photograph: ``OpenDoc brings to the table objects thatinteroperate without needing direct collaboration between developers.''--Tony Dunbar, MCICopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBYTE via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   Vol. 21, No. VBXESBy:Alan JochCOMPANYAdemco, a Pittway Inc. subsidiaryDEVELOPERScott Bernstein, database applications engineerDEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTVisual Basic 3.0THE PROBLEMBuild a high-volume imaging system that doesn't rely on the performancevagaries and expense of proprietary turnkey imaging systems.BACKGROUNDOver the course of a year, the company built its own imaging system usingVisual Basic and Diamond Head Software's ImageBasic, a suite of VBXes, OLEControls, and imaging engines. The VBXes they used included Metafile'sViewTool, which displays black-and-white images. They also used VideoSoft'sVS Elastic, a control that changes the size of all child controls in formswhenever you resize a window.STATUSThe imaging system uses standard Adaptec 1542C SCSI adapters, which meansAdemco can choose almost any scanner for the best price and performance.   The new system now contains 150,000 scanned images, which representsabout three-quarters of the images the company amasses in a typical year.Ademco is also importing a half-million images that reside on the previoussystem.   ``The population of controls is so vast, it's not difficult to find aVBX that does what you want to do,'' Bernstein says. ``There's no questionVBXes make things more productive because you don't have to reinvent codethat someone has already written.''   But VBXes are not without problems. Bugs that exist in component-basedapplications often surface only as general protection faults (GPFs), andtracking down the problems at such a high level can be difficult, Bernsteinsays.   Ademco is switching its PC development over to Visual Basic Enterpriseand hopes that GPFs will be less prevalent in the world of OLE Controls.Also, Bernstein hopes to avoid the memory leaks that occur with VBXesbecause some tools don't deallocate memory when they're done.   Does Bernstein lose sleep over whether OLE or alternatives like OpenDocwill prevail? ``Just ask: Which technology does Microsoft support?Companies that fight Microsoft tend to get bought.''Photograph(s):Photograph: Photograph: ``The population of controls is so vast, it's notdifficult to find a VBX that does what you want to do.

Second, find ways to make sureeach department or region interprets data using the same business rules.Third, maintain data integrity in an environment where data may bereplicated in different areas.BACKGROUNDThe division committed to object-oriented technology two-and-a-half yearsago when it built its mission-critical customer-care system on OO conceptsusing NextStep. ``Now, we're transferring that knowledge beyond NextStep,''Horiuchi says.   The Wireless Services division supports two client environments:Windows, with more than 3000 seats, and NextStep, which Horiuchi expectswill reach 4000 to 5000 seats in the next couple years. These clientsconnect to mainframe or Unix servers for operational and decision supportdata. ``Our assumption is that the amount of data we have is good enough,''he says. ``But data many times doesn't turn into information.''STATUSThe company is investigating CORBA and Sun's implementation of it in NEO(Networked Objects) as middleware that can bridge the client and serverenvironments consistently. ``It's CORBA's concept of objects and theconsistent transport between heterogeneous systems that is of interest tous,'' Horiuchi says. ``CORBA has the interface definition language forcommunicating with multiple systems.''   Horiuchi's group chose to beta-test NEO because of the product's closeties to OpenStep. ``Sun has realized the value of OpenStep and coupled thattechnology within the NEO family,'' Horiuchi says. ``The bonus for us isthe relationship between Sun and Iona, which makes a CORBA component forplatforms beyond just Sun's. This gives us some consistency when we have togo beyond the network boundary.''   Next's Portable Distributed Objects (PDO) does a ``pretty good job'' ofdistributing objects within the NextStep environment. ``But as we becomemore experienced, we're finding that PDO and CORBA each have their ownstrengths and weaknesses. For performance, there are times when we use PDO,other times we use CORBA.''   ``From a development perspective, NEO is better than other CORBAimplementations,'' according to Horiuchi. ``It has more tools to help youcode faster, including the ability to graphically link two objects and givethem an association.''   ``OLE has a steep learning curve and not enough tools. It's a difficultproduct to use,'' he says. ``We have to pay close attention to Network OLEbecause of the number of Windows clients we have. OLE is not quiteobject-oriented, but there's enough commonality there that we hope toovercome the differences.''   How does AT&T Wireless cope with evolving standards? ``If history holdstrue, there won't be one standard,'' says Horiuchi. ``There will bedifferent object models to use for different purposes. I'm a strongproponent of standards. Standards are what really helps you protect yourinvestment. They may slow down the evolution of a technology, but theyprovide a better guarantee of your investment than if one company tries toram a specification down your throat.''Photograph(s):Photograph: Photograph: ``As we become more experienced, we're finding thatPDO and CORBA each have their own strengths and weaknesses.

Thoughevery sector of an organization will feel a downsizing squeeze,it is perhaps the department least understood by seniormanagement that gets cut the fastest: information technology(IT).     While most IT managers are struggling to maintain existingsystems, experts are saying a long-term plan to migrate to opensystems will provide businesses with the strategic informationtools they need to meet the competitive challenges of the comingdecade.     "The [open systems] market is going to explode in myestimation because you are going to be able to put [systems] infaster and easier and better and less expensively, and you won'thave to maintain them as much," said Mike Kaminski,communications/MAP program manager for General Motors.     Unfortunately, most businesses continue to take a short-term, bottom-line approach to information technology, especiallyin today's economic climate.     "The economy is tight.  Everybody is trying to downsizelayers of management," said Rick Barron, principal computerspecialist for McDonnell Douglas Corp.  "And one of our barriers[to open systems] is short-term vs. long-term focus, which isgetting worse instead of better--exactly the opposite of what themanagement book tells us is the right way to act."     Barron likens building an open systems environment tobuilding a new road:  "We all know that modifying an existinghighway is a lot more painful than building a new one."     "When you build a new one you don't think about it whileit's being built and all of the sudden, it's there.  When you'remaking the change to an existing highway, it really disrupts whatyou're doing," Barron explains.  "Right now, the businesscommunity cannot afford any disruption to try to get to somethingthat's going to solve their problems 5 years from now."     Even if companies don't see the need for open systems, theyneed to think strategically for the future.  As Barron explains,"You could be driving down the highway and not have traffic jamsso you say the road's not broke.  Well if you think strategicallyand say, here's where the new housing developments are, here'swhere the new shopping centers are...[etc.], 3 years from now,there's going to be 3 times as much traffic.  This road is brokestrategically."Market growth to necessitate move to open systems     The demand for computers in business today is growing asfast as the need for new highways.  And just as local politiciansare running their campaigns on growth strategy platforms, so arevendors taking a stand on open systems.     "The number of computers is doubling every year, the priceis declining every year, and the power is doubling every 2years," says Steve Kelly, Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)marketing manager for Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC).  "If youlook at the magnitude and the growth, the only thing that cansupport this long-term network infrastructure without abottleneck is OSI."     Though vendors and users may agree that open systems is agood solution, some vendors have been wary of going hog wild onOSI product offerings because users have been slow to buy."'There's no open systems,' that's what the customers are saying.And the vendors are saying, 'I got 'em...but nobody's buying 'em.And they're both right," says GM's Kaminski.     It seems that neither vendors nor users want to take theinitial risks.  "Would you buy the first telephone?" asks RickBarron.  "Would you buy the second telephone?  You've got to getto a [point] where there's a critical enough mass [and] youbecome a follower."     How do you stop the chicken-and-egg cycle?  "We've got towork to make sure we purchase things we ask for," says GM'sKaminski.  "This is a partnership.  No longer can we afford tohave...users dictating in great detail saying this is what wewant and not buy it."     But even when an IT manager decides to go the open systemsroute, the burden of convincing upper management still rests onhim.  "I think what we'll see is people recognizing the businessopportunities of putting a standard network in place," says PhilWimpenny, program development manager for Unisys OSI products."If there isn't that recognition at the senior level...that thisis a benefit, then it becomes just a cost.  Those that don't backit are going to find things are much tougher when all theircompetitors can deliver faster."Birth of an IT salesman:  How not to become the Willie Loman ofopen systems     So, how do you sell senior management on open systems?  "Yousell problems, you don't sell solutions," says Barron.  "Firstoff, the IT folks have to get the chip off their shoulder inthinking they are the most important people in the world.Everybody's going for the CEO's ear and everybody's got their ownperspective about what their contribution to the bottom line is.     "So you can't go in and tell him you've got this great newsolution.  He doesn't care.  What you've got to do is point outto him the problem:  'wouldn't you like to reduce this time from5 days to 1 day?'  And you don't tell him you're doing it throughopen systems.  What you say is, hey, I need $100,000 and what Iwill do with that $100,000 is give you a scheduling system thatdoes this, a manufacturing control system that does this, allowyou to talk internationally to so and so, etc."     Barron also suggests the Barbie doll strategy."Manufacturers can give away Barbie dolls because they make moneyon all the accessories," Barron explains.  The idea behind thismarketing technique is to give a customer something he may notwant, but once he has it, he's hooked.     "Electronic mail is a great example," says Barron.  "Most ofour users did not want to go to E-mail and didn't understand howit could change the way they do business.  You give it to them,and now you can't take that stuff away."     Finally, a good technique is to find a highly visible areaof the company that has increased productivity or cut coststhrough IT, and have the head of that department tell seniormanagement what IT did for him.  Then it's up to the CEO to go toIT and ask how they can help the rest of the company.     "We've got to deliver results," says Barron.  "Find yourfocus and go in with small pockets and pilots to get there, andforce the pressure down from the top rather than take it to thetop."Back to Headline List CopyrightOPEN SYSTEMS REPORT via NewsNetOctober 5, 1990OSI PRODUCTS:  SUPPLY IS GROWING, BUT IS DEMAND KEEPING PACE?     The experts tell us that open systems is the next major wavein computing, but when industry veterans hear this, a wry smileseems to naturally form on their faces.  They will lean back intheir chairs, scratch their heads and chuckle to themselves."I've been talking about Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) sincethe '70s," they will say.  And often, it's true.     "It's a lack of products," they will postulate, as anexplanation of why the rest of the world has taken so long tojump on the OSI bandwagon.  But judging by the proliferation ofvendors expected to display their wares at next week's Interopconference and exhibition in San Jose, Calif.--over 175 at lastcount--product availability is not the only problem.     Virtually all major computer vendors have at least one OSIproduct on the market today, or at the very least, an OSIstrategy.  It appears that the recent Aug. 15 deadline forgovernment procurement specifications to include Government OSIProfile (GOSIP)-compliance as a requirement has had a distinctimpact on the speed with which vendors have brought OSI productsto market.     In fact, most vendors' OSI strategies seem to almost mirrorthe federal government's movement to GOSIP.  For example, GOSIPVersion 1 specifies X.400 electronic messaging and File TransferAccess Management (FTAM) at the application layer.  Ten out ofthe 10 vendors surveyed by OPEN SYSTEMS REPORT (see chart, pp. 4-5) have X.400 products; 8 out of 10 have FTAM products.     Other application layer products are few and far between,with Virtual Terminal (VT), which is included in GOSIP Version 2,heading the list.Driving OSI home     While GOSIP is clearly a driving force for vendors todevelop products, many users are still wary of vendors'commitment to OSI.  They wonder what the real strategy is whenvendors declare a strong commitment to OSI, yet invest moreresources in developing their own proprietary systems.  Clearly,users have some reason to be concerned: only 3 vendors in theOPEN SYSTEMS REPORT survey were willing to disclose whatpercentage of their R&D budget is dedicated to OSI productdevelopment.     Vendors, on the other hand, have to wrestle with a market ofusers claiming it wants OSI, but, in reality, may be too short-term minded to make the leap.  "There's a marketplace that'sopening up, but we're still in the earlier stages," observes PhilWimpenny, program development manager for Unisys OSI products.     According to Wimpenny, senior management recognition of theadvantages of using information technology as a competitiveadvantage rather than an overhead expense will drive useracceptance of OSI.A buyer's guide to OSI products     Once you have made the commitment to migrate to OSI, thereare a few important things to keep in mind.  First, so-called"OSI applications" are a myth.  X.400, for example, is notelectronic mail.  OSI products at the application layer, likeother OSI products, are really just protocols for transportinginformation in a certain way.     This is why, for example, Hewlett-Packard sells its HP OpenMail application that uses X.400 separately from HP X.400.  HPOpen Mail provides the user interface for writing the letter, soto speak.  It sits on HP X.400, which delivers the mail.     Other vendors, such as Data General, will bundle theirproprietary electronic mail application (as the user interface)with their X.400 product.  It is the user interface--the actualapplication--that provides a means for vendors to differentiatetheir products.     It's also important to note that OSI is fairly difficult toinstall.  When asked what was the average installation time fortheir products, vendors responses varied widely--from 1 hour to 1week.  It is probably fair to assume that the only way an OSIproduct could be installed in 1 hour is if it is not connected toa network.  Because OSI requires configuring all other productson the network, and because most systems managers lack OSIexpertise, expect installation to be difficult.  Sometimesvendors can help.  Wang, for example, offers an installationservice for core products free of charge in some cases.     In general, it's a good idea to develop an overall OSIstrategy before buying.  While in theory it is possible to mixand match different protocols from different vendors, today itisn't practical.  Some vendors, in particular, are notorious forhooking each layer together so tightly, that so much tweaking isrequired to achieve true plug-and-play computing it isn't worthit.Back to Headline List CopyrightOPEN SYSTEMS REPORT via NewsNetOctober 5, 1990SHOPPING FOR OSI PRODUCTS:  FIVE WAYS TO ENSURE YOU GET WHAT YOUPAID FOR     True or false?  Interoperability testing tells you if aproduct is going to work with other vendors' products in yourenvironment.  Conformance testing tells you a product complieswith international standards.  Interoperability testing is betterthan conformance testing because it's more like a "real world"situation.  If you said true to any of the above, read on.     None of the above statements are 100% true.  They can betrue, but more often than many users realize, they are not.What testing can do for you     Buying an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) product is likebuying a VCR.  You want it to do what it's supposed to do (playand record videotapes), to fit in with what you already have(your TV set) and to work with other products that conform to thestandard (VHS tapes).     Testing is supposed to guarantee those 3 things.  And itdoes--if properly understood.  But when interpreted improperly,testing is no more valuable than a lifetime warranty on a betaVCR in a town that only sells VHS videos.     Below are 5 guidelines for interpreting testing to make surethat the hot product you thought you bought doesn't cool offbefore you get it installed:1) Understand fully what conformance testing is and what it cando for you.     Conformance testing is more than a rubber stamp of approvalthat a product meets international standards.  Conformancetesting also shows how a product handles errors and performsunder unexpected situations:  what a product does when it is fedbad data or how it recovers after a power surge.     "When you build an implementation, you're crazy if you buildit so it knowingly produces errors.  You want to build it so itworks correctly," explains Howard Berkowitz, principal consultingengineer for the Corporation for Open Systems (COS).  "Now, youtake that thing out and you want to run it against somebodyelse's implementation that works correctly.  For the correctbehavior, everything's fine.  [But what happens when] someonewalks in between the 2 and cuts the cable connecting them?"     In some ways, it can be said that conformance testingsimulates more of a "real world" situation than interoperabilitytesting because it tests 3 kinds of behavior:  the valid, theinvalid and the inopportune, all of which occur in the realworld.     "The invalid says what I just sent you is garbage,"Berkowitz explains.  "And the inopportune is where I sentsomething that's a reasonable message, but it's out of context."Because the majority of code in most OSI products is dedicated toerror handling, Berkowitz notes, interoperability testing alonewill not exercise 60-90% of what those products can do.2) Keep vendors accountable.     Lots of vendors will say they have conducted some kind oftesting, but it's unclear what that really means.  Sometimesvendors may say their product has undergone conformance testing,but it was not done at an accredited test center, or the productdid not complete testing successfully.     Says Nancy Pierce, manager of the COS Test Center, "Havingundergone conformance testing and having completed conformancetesting are 2 very different things.  You can undergo conformancetesting and come up with a lot of failures."     Difficult as it may be to believe, some vendors willadvertise having undergone conformance testing, even though theirproducts failed.     In addition, vendors may buy conformance test software andrun it in their own labs.  But their labs may not be accredited,either through the National Institute of Science and Technology's(NIST) National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program(NVLAP) or as a COS Test Center.  While the products may stillprove conformant even if they aren't tested in an accredited lab,accredited labs will guarantee conformance if the products passthe tests.3) Get proof.     The proof is in the certification in the OSI market.  Whatthat means today is a COS Mark.  In the near future, it will alsomean Government OSI Profile (GOSIP) registration, as soon as labsbegin to receive NVLAP accreditation and products can be testedfor GOSIP conformance and interoperability.     The COS Mark currently requires only conformance testing,and according to Pierce, the COS Strategy Forum rejected the ideaof making interoperability testing part of the COS Markrequirements at its last meeting in September.     However, the COS Mark does include an InteroperabilityAnalysis Service (IAS) which guarantees that if a "Marked"product cannot interoperate with another "Marked" product, andthe vendors cannot resolve the problem, COS will intervene onbehalf of the user.4) Find out exactly the environment the interoperability test wasconducted in.     "Interoperability testing is important, but users need to beaware that interoperability testing varies depending on theenvironment in which the testing occurred," Pierce cautions."[For example,] they could be testing interoperability over anX.25 network, and the user has an 802.3 network.  It could beversion A of a product and the user has version B."     Users need to understand their own operating environmentfully, and then compare it to the environment in which theinteroperability test was conducted.5) Safeguard yourself.     Finally, write into your procurement specifications that thevendor has to guarantee to resolve any interoperability orconformance problems, suggests Chris Moore, product marketingmanager for Touch Communications.     Even if a product is certified, registered and stamped withevery seal of approval known to man, problems are bound to arise.     According to Pierce, "It's really hard to generalize aboutwhether or not there will be interoperability problems, but thelikelihood is pretty good that there will be some problems.  Theymay be very minor.  And those problems may be very easy to fix,but the chances that there will be some interoperability problemswhen you're initially bringing a network up are pretty high."     In the open systems marketplace, with its promise of greaterfreedom of choice, users are in the driver's seat.  Vendorsshould be more willing than ever to offer some sort of guarantee.Back to Headline List WT03-B31-19IA059-000323-B010-111http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec59.html 205.156.212.5 19970114214250 text/html 195621HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:40:16 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:58 GMTContent-length: 195433Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec59.html Sample Issue Copyright COMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNet January 01, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FLAWED VISION (4884 words) CROWDED SKIES (2870 words) DISARRAY IN THE DISK DRIVE BUSINESS (4237 words) SUN SETS OUT TO BURN WORKSTATION RIVALS (1909 words) REQUIRED READING (3310 words) EMULATION WINDOW IS STILL AJAR FOR INSIGNIA (996 words) PC PROCESSOR MARKET FALLS INTO DISORDER (1115 words) SNI BENEFITS FROM CULTURAL REVOLUTION (1364 words) HP CATCHING UP WITH IBM ON SYSTEM SALES (635 words) TALIGENT NEEDS TO DEFINE FUTURE ROLE (943 words) CMG MAKES CAUTIOUS STOCK MARKET ENTRY (716 words) KEY MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN NOVEMBER (2817 words) COMPUTER MARKETS (260 words) INTERNET USAGE (128 words) SEMICONDUCTORS (172 words) PERSONAL COMPUTERS (451 words) OUTSOURCING IN EUROPE (122 words) NEWS REEL (634 words) LETTERS (856 words) BOTTOM LINE (936 words) CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996                         FLAWED VISIONWill Bob Frankenberg's attempts to abandon the legacy of hispredecessor and refocus Novell on its core competencies work?For Sale By Owner, read the sign hung outside Building E atNovell's Provo, Utah headquarters last month. It was a prank, ofcourse, and was quickly torn down by security guards. But itaccurately reflected the mood of uncertainty at the 7,000-strongnetworking software market leader, where a firesale is underwayof many of the 20 businesses Novell acquired over the past fiveyears and where rumours persist that IBM and AT&T are eyeing thecompany for acquisition.In the 18 months since Bob Frankenberg took over the chiefexecutive's role from company founder Ray Noorda, he has beenforced to make a series of screeching U-turns. Initially anenthusiastic supporter of Noorda's vision for the company,Frankenberg has had to face the harsh reality that many of theindustry-shaking strategies set in motion by Noorda in his finalyears at Novell, now seem misguided and in need of dismantling.The Noorda dream was multi-dimensional, but it had one underlyingtheme - to build Novell into a company with a breadth of productsthat could stand up to the 'Redmond bully', Microsoft's BillGates. Through its June 1994 acquisition of WordPerfect andBorland's Quattro Pro division, Novell would be able to competeas the number two vendor in the office applications softwaremarket. Success there would come from creating a new breed of'network applications' that resulted from the combination of theapplications with Novell's flagship product, the NetWare networkoperating system. Another combination, of NetWare and Unix, madepossible by Novell's takeover of AT&T's Unix Systems Labs, wouldmake Novell the primary force in networked operating systemtechnology.But the dream has turned sour. WordPerfect sales have atrophied,flattening Novell's revenues and undermining the compelling logicof building network versions of the products. Revenue growth hasfluctuated between -1% and 10% in recent quarters. At the sametime, NetWare 4, the two-year-old upgrade to the world's best-selling network operating system, has been breaking records asone of the industry's slowest selling software upgrades ever. Andrather than stand up to Microsoft, Novell has been forced intoretreat as NetWare has come under intense competitive pressurefrom Microsoft Windows NT, which by many accounts is maturing tomatch much of the unique networking functionality that previouslydistinguished the Novell product.                           THE REALITYThe upshot is that Frankenberg has been clicking the undo buttonon almost all Noorda's major acquisitions in a desperate effortto re-focus Novell on its core competencies in networkingsoftware. Many of the very products that a year ago were going tounderpin the company's future, have now been sold off or are upfor grabs. The company has already divested itself of - or is inthe process of selling - businesses that when purchased costNovell close to $1.5 billion in shares and cash. Most notably,WordPerfect and the Borland Quattro Pro assets, which it boughtfor a combined sum of $965 million in mid-1994, are on the marketfor an estimated $300 million; the rights to the Unix operatingsystems, which came with its purchase of AT&T's Unix SystemsLabs, have been passed to Hewlett-Packard; and Novell's UnixwareUnix-on-Intel implementation has been sold to Novell's chiefcompetitor in the segment, Santa Cruz Operation.James Tolonen, chief financial officer at Novell, claims that thedecision to sell WordPerfect was carefully considered and was nota reaction to stock market sentiments: "When Frankenberg came onboard, he instituted his own strategy and decided to move awayfrom Ray's strategy of broadening our focus. Although heinitially supported Unix and WordPerfect, it became clear thatfocusing on our core business was the best strategy."Industry sources also point out that Novell is not quite finishedwith shedding businesses and that its Appware division, whichproduces software application development tools, is likely to bedropped too. Tolonen said that several third parties had inquiredabout purchasing the Appware business.Novell has also backed out of several technology collaborations.Most importantly it has quit its long-term involvement inOpenDoc, an effort with IBM and Apple to build an objectcommunication architecture. As Gartner Group market analyst DavidCappuccio says, "Ray [Noorda] never saw a technology he didn'tlike," and Frankenberg is having to live with the consequences.                        POOR TRACK RECORDThat the WordPerfect and Unix acquisitions didn't work out is nota surprise to some Novell observers who point out that Novell'strack record shows little success with takeovers. In his earlydays at Novell, Noorda masterminded the acquisition of SantaClara Systems and Excelan - both of which came to little. Thenthere was the acquisition of SoftCraft which failed to goanywhere and was later resold to its previous owners. DigitalResearch and its DOS clone DR-DOS was to have offered analternative to MS-DOS, another venture that failed to deliver onits promise; then Unix Systems Laboratories from AT&T was to haveunited the Unix world on a single standard to fight MicrosoftWindows and Windows NT.But just how bad have things become at Novell? And how rock solidis the networking base from which Frankenberg is trying to launcha comeback? The answer to these questions is bound up withNovell's competitive relationship with Microsoft.                           THE LEGACYBack in May 1994, when the former Hewlett-Packard veteran waslined up as Noorda's successor, he stated that one of the primaryreasons for his interest in the position was the potential ofNovell's pending acquisition of WordPerfect. This was to havebeen the final piece in Noorda's strategy to make Novell intoMicrosoft's most formidable competitor.Noorda did not see himself as someone obsessed with checkingMicrosoft's expansion; rather he wanted to be seen as the man whotook action on behalf of an industry-wide resentment among bothvendors and customers against Microsoft's dominant position.Noorda's public statements criticising Microsoft, and his effortsto involve the Justice Department in an anti-trust investigationof Microsoft, were all part of the crusade. It was to be hislegacy to the entire PC industry: Noorda would be hailed byfuture generations as the man who stood up to Bill Gates.Noorda's anti-Microsoft strategy has become an expensive failure,primarily because "it is difficult to be anti-anything becauseyou're not selling anything", Dataquest analyst Paul Cubbagepoints out.According to Cubbage, Unix could have been the company's best betin taking on Microsoft. However, calling Unix the "Yugoslavia ofsoftware", Cubbage says the different Unix backers could neverget their act together to challenge Microsoft on the desktop."Novell also threw away the Unix brand name, something it couldhave used to great advantage in marketing," Cubbage adds.Noorda is receiving much of the blame for Novell's wrong turn inits business strategy, but his greatest weakness was, as oneindustry insider says, that "he had a huge ego and wanted to beas big as Bill Gates". Noorda's decisions were also emotionallybased. He not only disliked Bill Gates but harboured long-standing resentments against other industry figures such as LotusDevelopment chief Jim Manzi. Manzi earned a place on Noorda'senemies list after the failure of efforts to merge Novell withLotus in 1990.When Novell was discussing the acquisition of WordPerfect, Manziwas also in the bidding for the $600 million word processinggiant, so Noorda saw an excellent opportunity to hit back at bothGates and Manzi with one blow - albeit a questionably expensiveone.Delaying his retirement until he could hand-pick a successor,Noorda finally left Novell, confident that Frankenberg wouldexecute the grand plan. Yet within two weeks of Noorda'sdeparture, Frankenberg was sitting down with Bill Gates inSeattle, trying to arrange a cease-fire and to end a stream ofcustomer complaints about how the lack of co-operation betweenthe two companies was affecting product compatibility andcreating technical support problems. Perhaps it is not surprisingthat Frankenberg did this, he was at one time HP's Microsoftliaison and the HP philosophy was that working with Microsoft hasalways been good for business. Even Frankenberg, in variousinterviews, stated that he thought Noorda had "gone too far [withhis] overfocus on Microsoft".Part of Novell's grand plan with its acquisitions was to produce"Super NOS". This was to be a close integration of NetWareintegrated with Unix to provide an application server - alongsidethe NetWare PC LAN file and print server - that would competedirectly with Windows NT. Alongside that, the WordPerfect and theBorland applications would provide a tightly integrated andnetwork-capable suite of powerful office applications,PerfectOffice, that would compete with Microsoft's Office suite.Add the OpenDoc software development technology being developedwith Apple Computer and IBM, and that would result in a broadsoftware portfolio capable of competing head-to-head withMicrosoft in operating systems, networking, applications andapplications development tools. The trouble was that it placedthe company in the path of the Microsoft steamroller and itcouldn't move quickly enough into a competitive position."It was a reasonable strategy but Novell just couldn't bring itall together," says Stan Schatt, LAN research director at marketresearch company Computer Intelligence Infocorp (CII). "There wasnever a strong Unix voice inside the company. And it was all 18months too late. I still think that it was a wrong move to getrid of Unix."And although Novell's shareholders did not like the WordPerfectacquisition, Karl Wong, software industry analyst at Dataquest,says the company should have decided to hang on to WordPerfect."Novell capitulated to Microsoft too readily. It still had theprospect of doing reasonably well with Windows 95 versions of itssoftware suite," he says.But the advent of Windows 95 was the last straw. The legacy ofnot co-operating with Microsoft meant that WordPerfect developersmade slow progress in readying a Windows 95 version of theirsoftware. Even now it is not due to ship until early next year.As a result, the launch of Windows 95 in August prompted anosedive in WordPerfect software sales as customers turned firstto the Microsoft Office suite, knowing it would work well in theWindows 95 environment. WordPerfect revenues have dwindled eversince. During the third quarter, applications software sales fell35% to $86.1 million, representing only 16% of Novell's totalrevenues. In the fourth quarter that was closer to $60 million,or 13% of revenues, compared with $134 million, or 28% ofrevenues, a year earlier.That raised the 'For Sale' sign on all WordPerfect applications,with one exception, GroupWise. This is the groupware package thatNovell still sees as a strategic component in its future networkfocus.But industry observers point out that there may be few keenbuyers of a business that is competing against Microsoft's 90%market share of the $720 million office suite market. Accordingto Dataquest, Novell's PerfectOffice suite and IBM's LotusSmartsuite split the remaining 10% almost equally. Only a fewmonths ago, Frankenberg was talking of aiming for a 20% share ofthe office suite market - inspired by an integration of theapplications with networking and groupware.Unable to let go of his dream, Noorda, now in his earlyseventies, is bidding again for WordPerfect through hisinvestment firm Canopy Technologies. Other potential buyersinclude IBM, which might want to strengthen its SmartSuite set ofoffice software with a word-processing package that has a hugeinstalled base compared with the less than pervasiveAmiPro/WordPro. There is also a possibility of a managementbuyout by WordPerfect executives.Although shareholders applauded the news of the WordPerfect saleby boosting Novell's share price, the move does not heartenindustry observers who question whether it is part of Novell'scarefully thought out business strategy or if it is a knee-jerkreaction designed to revive the company's flagging share price.The question is: was Novell pushed by the stock market to dumpWordPerfect or did it move of its own accord? Until fairlyrecently, Frankenberg and Sheldon Laube, Novell's chief technicalofficer, maintained their commitment to WordPerfect in interviewsand public speeches."You would have thought that if Novell had planned to sellWordPerfect, it would have prepared it a bit better and notchased away some of the top WordPerfect people," says DavidCoursey, editor of PC Letter. "It diluted the WordPerfectfranchise which will make it harder to sell."The other part of Noorda's anti-Microsoft strategy, OpenDoc, hasalso faltered. Novell has passed the development of the Windowsversion of OpenDoc to IBM - a move that worries some analysts."We know how quickly IBM can get products to market," saysCubbage of Dataquest. "OpenDoc seems pretty much brain dead rightnow."                          THE NT THREATBut dropping Unix, WordPerfect and OpenDoc still does not removeNovell from the path of Microsoft. Windows NT, Microsoft's serveroperating system, is rapidly gaining momentum, according to JesseBerst, editor of Windows Watcher newsletter: "NT is gettingbetter with improved file and print services." With Microsoftpitching NT as a superset of NetWare functionality, Novell has anincreasingly difficult task in showing where it adds value."NetWare is still a better product in what it does, but companiesinstalling NT get the file and print services thrown in free ofcharge," points out Berst."Windows NT is a serious threat to Novell," says Dataquest'sWong.Dataquest estimates that Microsoft will ship 1.9 million WindowsNT licences in 1995, compared with Novell's 1.3 million or solicence sales of NetWare. What is not clear, however, is thepercentage of new NT sites that would have previously becomeNetWare users or what percentage of NT sales are actually NetWareknock-outs.Computer Intelligence's Stan Schatt, for one, doesn't see adramatic move to NT within NetWare's installed base. "We conductmore than 30,000 user phone calls each month and there is nothingthere that shows a big trend from NetWare to NT. NetWare hasabout 66% of the [network operating system] market but prospectsfor significant growth [beyond that] are doubtful. It will losemarket share slowly, just as any vendor with such a dominantshare can expect to."Dataquest's Cubbage sees NT helping to grow the entire networkmarket which will mean that Novell's core business should growwith the market even if its total market share declines. "NetWareis a very good product and, as our analysis of the costs ofrunning networks shows, NetWare does pretty well, mainly becauseNovell has ensured that support personnel are well trained,"Cubbage says.Dataquest reckons that about 20% of the NetWare user base will goto NT rather than NetWare 4. In fact, where NT is displacing acurrent system, in 80% of cases it is knocking out IBM's OS/2,says the analyst group. Others agree: "Novell will remain thedominant provider of network operating systems," says ForresterResearch, "while NT will become a critical applicationsplatform.""With NT's growing popularity, companies are wondering if theycan't just install NT, eliminate Novell, and move forward.Forrester believes the answer is no. NetWare is a networkoperating system while NT is a server operating system. These arevery different animals.In contrast to its previously aggressive tone regarding Microsoftproducts, Novell has adopted a more realistic outlook on themarket regarding NT. "NT is a good product and we believe it willbe very successful for Microsoft," states Novell chief financialofficer Tolonen.But it is not an either/or decision for customers - NT is more ofa data and applications server; NetWare is a network server. "Wesee a world in which there are heterogeneous networks withdifferent operating systems and different hardware platforms,with NetWare providing the 'glue' that binds them."The strategy is to co-exist in the market with Microsoft - andanybody else who emerges - and concentrate on Novell's focus onits core network business. To that effect, Novell is working on aversion of NetWare for Windows NT, due early next year.But what is the potential for that core networking business inthe years to come. Over the past two years, Novell hasencountered some difficulties in getting customers to switchtheir networks to its latest technology, NetWare 4. Even now, itsmost recent figures show sales of NetWare 3.1 outweighing thoseof NetWare 4 , with 3.1 sales accounting for about 55% of NetWarerevenues compared with 45% for 4.1.One reason is that NetWare 3.1 provides an adequate level offunctionality for a large number of its customers, and another isthat the initial upgrade, NetWare 4.0, had some technicalproblems. These have been fixed and the product is now describedby analysts as robust.To encourage a drift towards NetWare 4.1, Novell has cut itsprice by 25% and now says that sales are exceeding those ofNetWare 3.1. That helped its networking software revenues grow by17% during the first nine months of fiscal 1995.Novell is also focusing on expanding the reach of NetWare throughNetWare Directory Services (NDS), although this key component hasfar from fulfilled its promise yet. NDS is at the heart ofNovell's 'smart network' concept. It keeps track of NetWare users- where they are, what they need - and automatically links usersto requested information and services no matter where thesereside on the network. In addition, extensions to NDS could beused to manage licensing and use of applications.Another important direction for Novell is to create virtualnetworking with NetWare, to allow 'pervasive computing'. ThroughNetWare Connect Services (NCS) it seeks to allow the linking ofmore than 2.5 million NetWare networks into a single globalnetwork. Novell has teamed up with AT&T to enable separateNetWare networks to be connected through AT&T network servicesand to allow NetWare users access to the Internet. Novell claimsthat 15 telecommunications companies around the world havecommitted to offering NCS services over the coming year. Thelong-term goal is also to extend networking services into thehome through NetWare-enabled cable TV boxes and telephoneconnections that could control and monitor appliances within thehome.Key to this strategy is the development of an embedded, small-footprint (50 kilobyte) version of NetWare which can be containedin an inexpensive chip and can control office machines as well asbeing used to network and control home-based electronicappliances and for applications such as car monitoring systems.Called NetWare Embedded Systems Technology (NEST), this is howNovell hopes to achieve its stated goal of having a billionNetWare nodes by the year 2000 - up from 50 million today.Part of NEST is a technology that enables data to be sent overdomestic electricity lines. This may open niche markets such asremote monitoring of electrical power use in homes. NEST-enabledcars, another proposed application, would be able to diagnoseproblems and call up and schedule maintenance automatically."We don't see this as a niche market," says Glenn Ricart, seniorvice president of corporate research and development at Novell."We see this all as networking which is our number one business.With our technology that can use power lines to transmit data, itopens up a world of possibilities in the home so that householdappliances can be controlled through NetWare."Xerox and Lexmark are a couple of major names cited by Novell asOEM device manufacturers that intend to connect office andconsumer products to the NetWare networks. Currently, NESTcontributes about $1 million a quarter to the company's revenues.Ricart also reveals that Novell has had talks with Sun regardingSun's Java computer language which could also offer a moresignificant challenge to Microsoft because Java is platformindependent. "The trouble with Java is that it doesn't make useof the network as much as it could. We are very interested in anetwork-enabled type Java technology," Ricart says.In addition, to help develop applications for its smart globalnetwork, Novell plans to offer its Net2000 set of applicationprogramming interfaces supporting C, C++ and Object Linking andEmbedding components plus popular software development tools suchas Visual Basic, Delphi and PowerBuilder.There is also call for software that allows users on the networkto share work, which explains why, in shedding WordPerfect,Novell hung on to the GroupWise groupware package. Groupwise hasan installed base of some five million users and is showingrevenue growth of 100% a year, according to Novell. The softwarehas twice the number of users of IBM's high profile groupwarepackage Lotus Notes. But GroupWise is also tightly integratedwith WordPerfect applications, and one without the other mightnot be as attractive to customers."We will continue to work with whoever purchases the productivityapplications but the two products are sold separately anyway,"points out Tolonen.Novell's future directions are interesting but they are mostlyvaporware for now and the prospects of the new businessesgenerating significant revenues could be two to three years away.In the meantime, Novell is saddled with trying to raise revenuesfrom a customer base that is considering Windows NT, that is notupgrading as quickly as it wants it to, and that will be lessthan impressed by the company's ditching of so many of itspreviously strategic products.The medicine that Frankenberg has dished out may be bitter, butanalysts say it was very necessary. Frankenberg has changed theperception of the company from one with a floundering strategy toone that "now seems to have a definite direction," says Courseyof PC Letter.Frankenberg is still purging the Noorda legacy and rooting outthe remaining Noorda loyalists among the management. In doing so,he has brought Novell almost full circle, back to where it was in1993, and focused on its core NetWare business.Despite the bad news on the application sales, Novell is a highlyprofitable company with net income of about $300 million on flatrevenues of $2 billion. Tolonen sees better times ahead: "Ourcore business grew in fiscal 1995 and we expect continuingimprovements, especially since we will not have the same drain onresources with the sale of WordPerfect." He says NEST is alreadyshowing small revenues and NetWare Connect Services will start tobring in revenues in 1996.While Novell analysts are generally supportive of the company'srenewed focus on its core business, the short-term prospects forgrowing revenues are not encouraging."It will take time for Novell to develop its new businesses andto produce revenues. NetWare 4 is selling well, although Novellhad to discount the price. But there will be substantial numbersof customers that won't upgrade because what they have is allthey need right now," points out Schatt at Computer IntelligenceInfocorp.But has Frankenberg's paring to the core of Novell's activitiesmade the company, wittingly or unwittingly, an attractivetakeover target. Industry rumours are linking Novell with IBM andAT&T, or even network systems vendors such as Cisco Systems.Bill Gates, for one, thinks a deal is pending: "Novell issplitting itself in two. You have to ask why they splitthemselves if they're not for sale," he told a Forrester Researchconference in November.Certainly, any purchase of Novell would amount to the largestever software deal - by a factor of two. Even the waning ofNovell's shares in recent weeks still puts its marketcapitalisation at about $6 billion. That is a hefty startingprice for any acquirer, but it can be weighed against the 60%market share it would be buying, the $2 billion in revenues andthe $1.2 billion in cash that Novell has stashed in the bank.Novell's challenge now is to rebuild its NetWare franchise andtake it into a network-enabled future where corporate networkslink with each other and virtually any electrical appliance couldbe a NetWare node. But no one knows for sure how far away thisfuture is and if Novell has what it takes to get there. Its trackrecord on vision has not been the best. r Tom Foremskicbred@power.globalnews.com            NETWARE VERSUS NT - THE NOVELL CHALLENGENovell's decision to pare back its business to a core of productscentred around its networking software prompts a criticalquestion: What are the competitive differences and how muchoverlap is there between the Novell NetWare network operatingsystem and its aggressively-pitched rival, Microsoft'sserver/applications operating system Windows NT? The fortunes ofNovell over the next half decade will rise or fall on the answerto this question. If it can convince corporate customers thatNetWare adds compelling value to their networks - even if theseare NT networks - it will prosper. If NT becomes a superset ofNetWare - or is even perceived as such - Novell will struggled toprosper.For many analysts, it all boils down to the design foundation ofthe two technologies. Network operating software is optimised forcertain functions; a server or applications operating system suchas NT is trying to address a different set of criteria. Theprimary function of network operating systems - such as NetWareand Banyan Vines - is to allow PC LAN workgroups to share filesand printers. But distributed environments have become morecomplex. Such products have been evolving to offer additionalnetwork services. Forrester Research identifies three importantareas:* Global directory. Directories provide consistent naming ofusers and resources across the network and thus the ability tofind and use servers, printers, applications and files no matterwhere they are.* Security. Network security handles authentication of the userand manages user privileges across the various network resources.* Management and administration. The ability to oversee theentire network - and implement changes, additions and deletions -from any point.With the launch of NetWare 4, Novell added NetWare DirectoryServices - "The brains behind NetWare that allow it to self-discover and configure large-scale, distributed environments,"says Forrester. In addition, Novell ManageWise provided aseamless view of the network, desktop and user environment and"superior management", adds Forrester. In comparison, NT hasbasic file and print services, naming services and NT-to-NTsecurity. According to Forrester, Microsoft's focus on making NTa competitor to major Unix servers from IBM and HP results in alack of focus on improving NT's networking capabilities acrossmultiple platforms. Other observations are that:* The NT microkernel is tuned for running applications; NetWareis designed for network services.* NT has NetWare 3.x-like file and print services "withdiminishing performance", while NetWare offers fast distributedfile and print with native support for DOS/Win, Mac, OS/2, Unix.* NT's current naming scheme is limited and relies on futuretechnology due with Microsoft's Cairo object environment,scheduled for 1997/8; NetWare Directory Services are scalable androbust, but difficult to extend.* Microsoft's Systems Management Services product is designed tomanage Windows and NT desktops - not the NT environment, SNMP-instrumented network devices or MS Exchange; NetWare integratesmanagement across network product protocols - SNMP, RMON and DMI.For large corporate buyers "NetWare or NT?" is the wrongquestion, says Forrester. Rather it recommends co-existence: "TheGlobal2000 need both." It suggests current NetWare 3.x sitesshould use 4.1 for new LANs, and when 40% of sites are runningthis newer environment, there is a clear business case in termsof reduced administration and value-added services for upgradingthe remaining 3.1 LANs to 4.1. For those fixed on an NT strategy,Forrester suggests users should pressurise Novell to port NDS toNT - or hope that Microsoft buys Banyan and integrates itsStreettalk directory services with NT.

Putting themthere will cost at least $20 billion - a massive figure but onelikely to be dwarfed by the tens of billions it will cost tomaintain and run them, and to build a related terrestrialinfrastructure.The purpose of this new fleet of spacecraft, which because oftheir low altitude will keep burning up in the atmosphere, is toprovide portable voice, data and 'multi-media' telecommunicationsto people anywhere on the planet. If it all works, a user of aportable telephone or a personal digital assistant (PDA) will beable to make or take international phone calls, exchange urgentdata files or roam the Internet, even if they are travellingthrough the remotest parts of China or trekking acrossAntarctica.The technological challenges - viewed by many scientists ashighly ambitious - are being tackled almost entirely by privatecompanies, with little governmental involvement (some governmentsare hostile to the idea). The companies involved, includingMotorola, McCaw Cellular, Loral Space Systems, Orbital Sciencesand Bill Gates (of Microsoft), foresee huge revenues fromsatellite-based mobile telecommunications - as much as $150billion a year according to some estimates. The difficulty andcost of putting the infrastructure in place, along with therelative freedom from national telecommunications regulations,makes the prize even greater. Any company that establishes aclear lead may see its revenues rocket into orbit along with itssatellites.                    TAPPING THE PHONE MARKETThe market does not require the widespread adoption of newtechnologies such as PDAs or cheap, portable Internet terminals -although they will drive demand for anywhere-to-anywherecommunications. The suppliers have judged that the currentaddiction to mobile telephones will create massive demand forworldwide bandwidth. The use of mobile telephones is acceleratingrapidly across the world; this year the number of phones in usewill grow by 58%. Analysts predict that by the year 2000 therewill be at least a billion mobile phones, compared with 50million today.But all of these users will be crammed into the big commercialcentres. At least 70% of the world's surface is beyond the reachof today's mobile phones. The satellite consortia calculate thatif they can cover the whole planet, large numbers of businesspeople will pay dearly to remain in constant contact with theircolleagues as they roam the telecommunications desert.This desert is not confined to the outback. Large areas ofadvanced countries such as the US are beyond the reach ofconventional cellular communications; and it may never befeasible to build terrestrial networks in many such places.Currently the only way of bringing instant communications tothese regions is via satellites. And the only way of ensuring nosquare metre is left out is by using dozens of satellites.But the technical challenge is immense. Unlike the majority ofexisting commercial communications and broadcasting satellites,the new telecommunications satellites will not be put ingeostationary orbits (which make them appear to be fixed over asingle point on the surface of the planet). Instead, they will becontinuously circling the Earth from pole to pole at high speedand at altitudes of between 400 km and 1,000 km. This is low:conventional geostationary satellites are usually set at about36,000 km. For this reason, these new satellites are said to below Earth orbit (LEO) or medium Earth orbit (MEO) systems.The reason for flying so low is that the mobiletelecommunications companies need to reduce the time required forthe round trip of a radio message from ground to satellite. Witha geostationary satellite, it can take a few seconds; with an LEOor MEO system, it can be reduced to a few milliseconds. That willallow them to be used for real-time conversations which, thenetwork operators hope, will be indistinguishable from a normalterrestrial or local cellular telephone call.                         DOWN TO EARTH?The low altitude brings a major disadvantage - the satellites arenot completely clear of the Earth's atmosphere which willgradually slow them down and eventually cause them to crash toEarth. Each satellite in the new constellations will thereforehave a finite life and will need to be replaced. Rocket andsatellite makers and owners of launch sites around the world arelooking forward to their first mass market and expect to earn atleast $31 billion from the business over the next five years.This means satellite mobile telecommunications will never becheap.The networks will also require complex switching. Eachconstellation of satellites is analogous to a conventionalcellular telephone system except that the infrastructure of radiotransceivers is moving rather than fixed to the ground. In aterrestrial network, the user moves past the transceivers whichpass a call from one to the other. With the satellite networks,effectively the user is stationary while the transceivers orbitabove him, and hand over the conversation from one to the otheras each passes overhead and then moves out of range.While a terrestrial cellular network may need several thousandbase stations to provide unbroken coverage over an areaequivalent to, for example, the UK, the number of satellitesneeded to cover Earth ranges from a dozen to several hundred(depending on the type and quality of service they provide andthe altitude of their orbits).At least six LEO/MEO projects are underway. Between them theywill put more than 1,000 satellites in orbit, which will need tobe replaced continually. But these figures could change. Moreconsortia may enter the market, and some analysts believe thatsome of the existing groups will be forced to merge theirprojects to keep costs down. There are no plans for the satellitenetworks to interoperate directly.In 1994, Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, made worldheadlines when he announced his intention to develop a satellitenetwork with McCaw Cellular (CBR, April 1994). But the idea ofsuch a system is widely credited to the US company that hasalready provided a large proportion of the world's terrestrialcellular telephone networks and user terminals - Motorola.                       MOTOROLA'S IRIDIUMMotorola announced its intention to set up a universal mobilecommunications network using a large number of low Earth orbitsatellites in 1990. It named its system Iridium. The name derivedfrom its original plan to use 77 satellites - the number ofelectrons which orbit the nucleus in an Iridium molecule.Subsequently Motorola found it could manage with 66 satellites.Motorola's model is complicated. The Iridium satellites willcommunicate with terrestrial subscribers through highlydirectional antennas on the satellite that break each satellite's2,000-mile wide 'footprint' into 48 overlapping zones or cells. Apacket switch aboard the spacecraft allows any cell to support upto 256 simultaneous conversations. This means each satellite canin theory support more than 12,000 conversations.As an Iridium craft passes overhead, a caller on the groundappears to move between the cells, taking about 9 minutes totraverse the entire 2,000 mile coverage zone. An onboard digitalswitch ensures any connections in progress pass to the next cellwithin the antenna coverage pattern. As the edge of the coveragezone approaches the subscriber's handset, it establishes contactwith the next spacecraft coming over the horizon. Linking to theterrestrial network is also complex. Each satellite has switchingsystems on board to bundle all their digital traffic and downlinkit to one of about a dozen terrestrial 'gateways'. These willprovide access to the wired public switched telephone network(PSTN) using conventional telephony switching gear.When a spacecraft cannot access a gateway directly (if it is outof range), it can use side-looking antenna to pass the traffic toadjacent satellites. In this way traffic can be relayed acrossseveral satellites until it can be downlinked to a gateway.Iridium has not faced only technical hurdles. When it wasannounced, it made enemies of terrestrial cellular operators -many of them major customers of Motorola - which saw Iridium as amajor competitor. Motorola has now opted for a 'one world, onephone' policy. The idea is that a dual standard phone or portablecomputing device will always search out the nearest terrestrialdigital cellular network first, and make a connection throughthat. It will only talk directly to a satellite if no othernetwork is available. The same applies when trying to contact asubscriber.This policy shift could cost Motorola a significant slice of itsIridium revenues - but gives it a clear, long-term advantage.Many cellular operators have now signed up as Iridium partners.Teledesic is also taking a similar line.                         GATES AND MCCAWIf Iridium is ambitious, the plan hatched by two former schoolclassmates in Seattle, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Craig McCaw ofMcCaw Cellular, must rate as one of the potential wonders of theworld. In fact, analysts have compared their Teledesic projectwith the building of the Pyramids.Gates is said to have approached Craig McCaw, founder of the US'slargest cellular telephone operating company, with the idea ofthe Teledesic system in 1992/3. He was attracted by the Iridiumidea, but wanted to focus more on high-bandwidth datacommunications. This means more satellites.In fact, Teledesic will require no less than 840 satellites toprovide instant multimedia communications for users of personalbroadband terminals. Senior Teledesic executives say people whowant to use this type of personal communicator should be able todo so on a whim wherever they are.Teledesic seems to be an attempt to build a global equivalent ofexisting public telecommunications networks in the sky. The planis to operate the satellites in flocks of about 40, in 21 polarorbits ranging from 695 to 705 kilometres above the Earth. Eachsatellite will cover a circular footprint about 700 kilometresacross, each overlapping the next by about 30%. The US, forexample, will be covered by 18 satellites at any time.The network will require special terminals, because Teledesicwill initially use a microwave band to provide digitalconnections of between 16 kilobits per second (kbps) and 2megabits per second (Mbps). Even by landline standards this ishigh bandwidth, but it can go higher. Teledesic aims to provide a'space gateway' for corporate and other users with a minimumbandwidth equivalent to today's T-1 lines (1.54 Mbps), rising to1.2 gigabits per second, says Connie Kantor, Teledesic's directorof finance and administration. This could simultaneously supportmixtures of voice, video, image and data. Each satellite will bedesigned to support up to 100,000 16 kbps channels at a giventime. The channels can be aggregated in 16 kbps increments tosupport higher data rates.The proposed Teledesic infrastructure would use the asynchronoustransfer mode (ATM) technology now widely implemented formultimedia networking. Individual users with fixed or mobileterminals will access the constellation directly; large, fixedsubscribers with heavy traffic will use landlines to access largelocal uplink facilities.Teledesic's business model, partners and funding are less clearthan Motorola's. According to Kantor, Teledesic will not sell ordirectly support user terminals, hand-held or otherwise. It willsell small Earth gateway terminals that feed a terrestrial signalto the satellite network. The goal is not to market servicesdirectly to subscribers, but to provide an open network whichlocal organisations, such as telephone companies, can offer totheir subscribers.Teledesic is not due to start until 2001, so its managers arerelaxed about the development of its technology and businessmodel. Kantor says: 'I get a dozen calls a week offeringfinance.' It is in talks with telecommunications suppliers acrossthe world.                           FOUR OTHERSFour other proposed networks have a lower profile than Iridiumand Teledesic, are less ambitious, but may have a more immediateimpact. These are proposed by Globalstar, Odyssey, Orbcomm, andI-CO. Technically, they are more like Iridium than Teledesic.Globalstar, devised by Loral Space Systems Inc, will use 56satellites orbiting above Iridium at 1,400 kilometres. These willuse a simple radio transmission technique known as code divisionmultiple access (CDMA) to deliver low-cost, cellular-equivalentglobal telephone services. CDMA allows several users to occupythe same radio channels without interference. Each satellite canhandle 1,000 calls at a time.Globalstar's operators expect to earn a large portion of theirinitial revenues by providing essential telephone services inremote areas and developing countries that have notelecommunications infrastructure. They calculate that half theworld's population lives more than two hours away from atelephone.A significant part of Globalstar's plan is to develop free-standing solar powered public telephone booths in remote places.Initial services will include cellular-grade voice, fax, and9600-baud data transport services. This will clearly not besufficient for more advanced data networking needs.Of all the networks, the simplest service, and the one closest tobeing operational, is Orbcomm. This is aimed at a gap in existingmarkets. Developed by Orbital Sciences Corp of Dulles, Virginia,and Teleglobe Inc of Montreal, it is a micro-satellite-based two-way messaging system. The system is relatively inexpensive todeploy because it uses Pegasus, a low-cost launch vehicledeveloped by Orbital. This can be carried to a high altitude by aconventional aircraft, then launched. It can place a 1,000 lbpayload into orbit for about $10 million.The Orbcomm satellites are small, light and cheap. Each Pegasusvehicle can carry eight into orbit at a time. That means threelaunches will place a fully operational constellation of 24satellites in space. Most populated portions of the Earth will bein sight of one or two spacecraft. Orbital has eschewedsophisticated microwave radio links in favour of VHF radio.Within its 3,000 mile diameter footprint, six uplink channelswill carry digital data at 2,400 bits per second; a single 4,800bits per second channel will handle downlink traffic.The relatively low-rate bit streams will be used to carry shortpacket messages to and from small, inexpensive mobile terminaldevices. These self-contained, hand-held units will have smallLCD screens, and keyboards for reading and writing messages. Byusing inexpensive VHF radio technology and a low bit rate, thecost of a terminal can be kept low. For machine-to-machinecommunications, the terminals can be fitted with serial ports tointerface with computers. Orbcomm is behind schedule, but shouldbegin operating in mid 1996.Fewer details are known about two other proposed satellitenetworks. One of these is proposed by I-CO, a consortiumsupported by several telecommunications companies and Inmarsat,the UK-based organisation that supplies satellite-basednavigation and communication services to shipping. The I-COnetwork aims to provide services to airlines and ships. Thisnetwork will be based on medium Earth orbit satellites, whichwill slow response times but increase coverage and reduce costs.Another network was recently announced by TRW in conjunction withTeleglobe. Details are sketchy, but it will be an MEO system,using 12 satellites. Because of delays, this will reduce itsappeal to voice subscribers. TRW, the US electronics giant, hasbeen awarded a $2.28 billion contract to build hand-heldterminals.                       WILL THEY TAKE OFF?On paper, each of the proposed networks is technologicallyplausible. But politics come into play. Each of these latter-daymerchant adventurers sets out to transcend jealously guardednational government prerogatives and controls. Details such asthe granting of licences to operate, the approval of equipmentand the allocation and administration of radio frequencies mustbe ironed out. Delays are seen as inevitable.The liberalisation of telecommunications operations is proceedingat some pace in North America and parts of Western Europe, butstate monopolies still prevail in the greater portion ofterritories that the 'LEOsat' operators say need their services.Most of the consortia have tried to get the support of publictelephone companies, but these partnerships may prove fragile.At the same time terrestrial telecommunications technology isdeveloping rapidly. Terrestrial radio systems that can bringservices to remote rural areas quickly and for a relatively lowone-time investment are available. And in the developed world,developments in optical and broadband radio networks are ready tobe deployed widely, which could undermine Teledesic.The companies and consortia involved say they have well-thought-out commercial plans. It remains to be seen if these aretechnically feasible. Next they must find customers, despiteimproving and increasingly cheap terrestrial systems.

ForMaeser, a 30-year stint in the industry which even other computerexecutives view as 'excessively turbulent', had taken its toll onhis health.But it is not only individuals that are dropping off the pace.According to figures from Disk/Trend Inc, storage industryanalysts, at the beginning of the decade there were 57manufacturers of rigid disk drives worldwide. Today, there are 24and falling.Even among the top tier suppliers, the pressures are immense.During the past weeks, Seagate Technology, the number twosupplier, has announced the acquisition of Conner Peripherals,and Maxtor, the number five supplier, has announced its takeoverby the Korean electronics group, Hyundai. All are re-evaluatingtheir business models in the pursuit of greater operatingefficiencies.                         BOOMING DEMANDDemand for disk drives has never been greater. According toDisk/Trend, 87 million disk drives will ship this year, up from70 million in 1994, an increase of 25%. Total shipments for 1996will be over 100 million.Driving that demand is the boom in the PC industry andparticularly in consumer PCs. "The single most important trend[in the disk drive industry today] is the rapid growth of theconsumer PC market. Consumer systems are 40% of US PC sales andtoday and 30% of worldwide sales but they are growing twice asfast as the rest," says Marlin Miller, marketing director ofQuantum. Consumer sales are so important because home PC usersput heavy demands on storage. While the average corporate storageentry point is 400 Mb (megabytes of storage per PC), says ClaudeBarathon, president and managing director of Quantum Europe, theaverage consumer entry point is 1 Gb (gigabyte). "Games and CD-ROMS are incredibly storage intensive," he says.But even in the corporate market, the storage opportunities areimmense. "There are 180 million PCs installed. Half of those are386 processor-based machines or older and have less than 120 Mbof storage. What a market," says Barathon. In addition, midrangeand high-end systems, such as IBM mainframes, are increasinglyusing arrays of commodity disk drives, rather than specialisthigh capacity drives.Chuck Haggerty, CEO of Western Digital, is equally enthusiastic.The desktop PC and mobile system market amounts to 81 milliondrives today but will be up to 180 million by 1999, he says. "By1999, we will ship two disk drives to every PC."                       FINANCIAL PRESSUREBut few suppliers are managing to turn this escalating demandinto growing profit. The problem is that even though diskcapacities are being pushed up at rates of 60% per year asmanufacturers struggle to keep up with user demands, drive pricesare falling fast. The value of the worldwide disk industry interms of revenue rose by just over 10% to $25.7 billion in 1995,according to Disk/Trend, but will fall to $25.3 billion in 1996."Over the past year and a half, the industry has seen a 50% pricedecline, slicing 20% a quarter [off prices]," says Bob Patent, astorage analyst with IDC and former operations manager forQuantum.This fall in profitability is a direct result of the collapse indisk drive prices. As competition has intensified, margins onsingle platter disk drive products have been declining year onyear and, according to some, are down to an unsustainable 10%from the high-teens back in 1994.The pursuit of capacity is pushing all suppliers towards thedelivery of 'multiplatter' drives. Few suppliers are stillinvesting in one-platter technology - most are concentrating ontwo-platter and three-platter drives where the margins are closerto 18% and 30% respectively. But even here, the overall trend isdownwards.To add to supplier problems, the rate of technology change in thedisk drive industry, and hence the demands on research anddevelopment, are increasing. "The world used to run on 18-monthtechnology cycles," says Patent. "We are still near that at thehigh-end but in the massive desktop PC sector we are down to sixto nine months between upgrades. The PC vendors would like it tobe six months."This shortening of product lifecycles has led to severe inventoryproblems, with suppliers repeatedly getting caught with the wrongcapacity disk drives at the wrong time. The pressure to dumpobsolescent stock has contributed to the overall margin erosion.Now, a fresh round of industry consolidation has many predictinga levelling off period for the industry. "Over the last 10 to 15years we have seen lots of high peaks and low valleys but," saysHaggerty, "market forces are stabilising. Five years ago therewere 13 to 14 players. Now there are four or five - that bringsstability."Others are less optimistic. With the rate of technology changeincreasing and prices still falling, "1996 will be a difficultyear," says Marlin Miller of Quantum. Success for the remainingmarket contenders is far from guaranteed and furtherconsolidation looks likely.                             SEAGATEWith 1995 revenues of $4.5 billion, Seagate is the number onedisk drive supplier in terms of revenue and the most profitable.Its pending acquisition of the ailing Conner Peripherals for justover $1 billion is set to completely alter the landscape of thestorage market, putting the company way out ahead with combinedrevenues of over $7 billion and a 38% market share by units."Seagate is now the unchallenged market leader," says Patent.Key to Seagate's future strategy is a move away from completedependence on disk drives, although the majority of revenues($4.3 billion) are still derived from this sector. In 1993, AlSchugart, founder of Seagate and an industry stalwart, hiredSteve Luczo, a high-flying investment banker, to spearheadSeagate's diversification programme. Schugart's target was to add$1 billion to revenues in new storage hardware, $1 billion incomponents and $1 billion in software.According to Luczo, initial discussions with Finis Conner,founder of Conner and joint founder of Seagate with Schugart,centred on Conner's software business but, says Luczo, "Overthree or four weeks conversations expanded to incorporate thewhole company. The more we talked about it, the more it fitted."Conner was a company in desperate need of a lifeline. Despitebeing the industry leader back in 1992, before a particularlydeep 'valley' period, by the beginning of 1995 Conner's marketshare had been whittled down to 13% by volume. For the ninemonths to October, Conner's net income, already low, fell from$65.5 million to $36.4 million, despite a rise in revenues from$1.77 billion to $1.94 billion."The company was resource constrained and had been losing moneyfor several quarters," says Jim Porter of Disk/Trend. "It [thebuyout] is a good deal for Conner shareholders. The opportunityfor growth at Conner had come to a halt. The executive managementhas been a revolving door for the last two years."The two companies appear well matched. Seagate has focused on thehigh-performance enterprise end of the market while Connerspecialises in low cost drives and also brings a portfolio oftape products. Seagate shipped eight to nine million disk drivesat the high-end last year, while Conner shipped 11 million on thedesktop. In components, Seagate is a major supplier of headswhile Conner is strong in media. Together, they have a strongmanufacturing base which will help both in the struggle to keepup with product demand.Competitors have been publicly supportive of the deal, saying itwill help to stabilise pricing across the industry. Conner hasbeen very aggressive on pricing over the last year, forcing othervendors to cut prices accordingly. Under Seagate ownership,prices are expected to float up, reducing the margin pressure onall suppliers.Haggerty of Western Digital also thinks that Seagate's 38% marketshare will be quickly eroded as customers re-evaluate theirsupplier relationships. "I believe the Seagate/Conner deal willcreate an opportunity rather than a problem," says Haggerty."There are a lot of customers out there which do business witheither Seagate, Conner or both and a number of them have come tous looking for an alternative supplier."Luczo dismisses these arguments, saying the acquisition of Connerwill give Seagate unparalleled strengths. "Drives are gettingharder to make, so a strong financial base, broad product lineand ownership of technology and manufacturing processes isincreasingly important. We are the only company to have allthat."But even with the advantage of size, Luczo doesn't expect marketconditions in the disk drive industry to get much easier. "WithOEM [supplying to manufacturers], you are not sitting next tofinal demand so there is an inventory risk and, where there is aninventory risk, there will always be tough pricing. Businesswon't get easier."He is confident, however, that Seagate will be able to continueposting good results. "Our operating model shows good profit on a20% to 22% margin and that is sustainable." For the first quarterof 1996, Seagate announced record revenues up 55% to $1.45billion, with net income up from $22.5 million to $108 million.                             QUANTUMThe company most directly affected by the Seagate/Conner tie upis Quantum, the clear leader in desktop PC drives. Quantumshipped 16 million drives in 1994 and expects to ship astaggering 20 million this year, but its financial performancehas been patchy. While revenues in its latest quarter were upfrom $726 m to $1 billion, falling margins and problems at thehigh-end, along with a $32 million 'faulty goods' rebate to anunnamed PC maker, meant net income slipped from $48.6 million to$22 million.One of Quantum's weaknesses has been its dependence on thefiercely competitive low-margin desktop drive business and, forthis reason, the company's focus over the past year and a halfhas been to extend its business in the more lucrative high-endsector. To this end, Quantum bought Digital Equipment's Avastorstorage business back in 1994 and has been working to integrateit ever since. The pressure of doing so is believed to have beenone of the key factors behind the resignation of chief executive,Bill Miller.Miller's replacement, 37-year old Michael Brown, former head ofthe desktop part of Quantum's business and an 11-year companyveteran, is clear about the importance of the high-end. "Althoughmaintaining our leadership position in the desktop market isimportant, our future growth and success depends more on on ourability to grow and strengthen other areas of our business," hesays.Quantum now claims a 22% share of the high-end storage market, upfrom 7% before the Avastor acquisition. But, according toanalysts, the impact on the bottom line has not yet beenpositive. "Quantum had lots of problems with Avastor and is stilllosing money on the disk side," says Porter. "It will be a yearbefore it is all straightened out."In a bid to address the problem, Quantum has embarked on arestructuring of its high-capacity business, including closingthe company's inherited manufacturing facility in ColoradoSprings. The vast majority of Quantum's manufacturing is carriedout by a third-party, the company's Japanese manufacturingpartner Matsushita-Kotobuki Electronics (MKE). Barathon claimsthis gives Quantum greater flexibility and more efficiency thancan be achieved with an internal manufacturing set-up. "Diskdrive makers have always been dependent on merchant suppliers,"he says.Barathon believes the blip in Quantum's business performance willbe short-lived, blaming it on the product shortages affecting allsuppliers and a product transition back in May. The company'sgoal going forward is to "get back to the number one spot". "Weare growing faster than the industry and prices are stabilising.All the elements are in place," says Barathon.Others believe the company has more hurdles to overcome.Quantum's margins have gone from 18% to 13%, says Chris Brown,director of distribution and retail channels at Maxtor.But Marlin Miller of Quantum is confident that the company canturn it around. "One of the key factors is to have a low expenseto sales ratio. Our desktop business operates at around 10%," hesays. With Michael Brown's continued focus on operatingefficiencies, says Porter, "They'll get it right in the end."                               IBMWith Quantum struggling, the number two market spot behindSeagate is potentially attainable and the man eager to fill thegap is Dave Ernsberger, head of worldwide OEM sales for IBM'sstorage systems division (SSD).IBM only got into the OEM disk drive industry four years ago butsays it has already built up annual revenues of $2 billion,growing at 50% a year, twice the pace of the rest of theindustry. "What other company could have done that?," saysErnsberger. "Our technology is terrific. There is a huge demandfor our products. The only question is, how quickly can weexpand?"IBM claims to have built four million drives in 1993, eightmillion in 1994 and expects to do 10 to 11 million this year.Next year, says Ernsberger, will see another significant jump."We started off doing $1 OEM business to $7 internal. Today, wedo $6 OEM for every $4 internal. Next year, 75% of output will goto OEM customers."However, some analysts suggest that the focus of Jim Vanderslice,newly appointed head of SSD, is shifting away from the OEMbusiness. "Vanderslice is more interested in getting themainframe business back from EMC," said one, referring to IBM'sattempts to recover market share in high-end, integratedmainframe disk systems. Ernsberger disagrees, "The OEM businessis not at all on a back burner. My aspiration is to be the numberone player".To do that, however, IBM will need to pitch in to the fiercelycompetitive desktop drive business. Today, IBM operates only inthe mobile and high-end markets, commanding a healthy share inboth. In the mobile sector, its 1995 market share is expected tobe close to 40%. "In the near-term, you will not see us at thelow capacity points on the desktop, it is not where our strengthsare. We do want to be big in that area but, today, rather thantry and compete across all segments, we have chosen to build atthe high-end sweet spot."Despite the narrow focus of its products, Luczo rates IBM asSeagate's "most important competitor". "They are verticallyintegrated - the owners of technology. To date, we have been justa little leaner and a little faster."One problem for IBM is what Luczo of Seagate calls the "I won'tOEM from IBM" attitude from PC makers. But while he thinks itwill always be a factor, "If they are the only ones supplyingtechnology, people will buy it."                         WESTERN DIGITALFour years ago, Western Digital was a company that many analystswere predicting would go out of business. But, over the last twoyears, it has grown revenues to $2.1 billion and has increasedits market share in the desktop segment from 12% to 22.5%. "From1993 to 1995 we saw a significant turnaround. Of all the diskdrive companies out there, we now have the strongest balancesheet," says Haggerty. Part of that, however, is due to the saleof Western Digital's multimedia products unit to Philips.Like Quantum, Western Digital is doing much to try and decreaseits dependence on the desktop disk drive segment. It is workingon a 2.5 inch disk for the mobile market and has snapped up anumber of ex-IBMers to develop a high-end product line withdrives of 2 Gb, 4 Gb and 8 Gb, a segment in which it believes itcan do well. "Some of the firmware of our competitors is veryaged. Ours is based on completely new code," says Haggerty.But Western Digital is in a unique position. It is the onlycompany left in the industry that doesn't own its technology orhave an affiliation to a larger partner, a position which somesuggest is unsustainable. But Haggerty says the company is farfrom vulnerable. "Our plan is to be the asset management leader.We did $2.1 billion with 7,200 employees, Seagate did $4.6billion with 65,000 employees. Over 70% of our disk drivecomponents are common which means we can turn assets very fast."Certainly, Western Digital has garnered a reputation as a marketmaker, being the first to ship at new capacity points.Western Digital logged its highest ever quarter shipment in thesummer when it shipped 2.8 million drives and, like many others,Haggerty believes the Seagate /Conner deal will createopportunity for even bigger growth. He is also expecting a let-upon margins. "The pricing pressure was created by Conner andMaxtor so that will now stabilise," he says.But despite his buoyant mood, Western Digital's recent resultswere below expectation. The company reported revenues of $558million, up from $464.5 million in 1994 but net income fellmarkedly from $34.7 million to $8.3 million, a factor Haggertyputs down to the slow take-off of its new 1.6 Gb drive and"greater than anticipated competitive pricing".Despite Haggerty's insistence, Western Digital may yet end up aspart of a larger concern. "There is room for the industry toconsolidate a little further, " says Brown of Maxtor. We could gofrom five players to four and the only company without aconnection to a bigger one left is Western Digital." IBM, Quantumand Samsung have all been rumoured as potential buyers.                         MAXTOR/HYUNDAIThe most recent consolidation in the disk drive industry is thatof Maxtor and Hyundai. In November, Hyundai announced that it isto buy the remaining 60% of Maxtor and turn it into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hyundai America.According to Chris Brown of Maxtor, the effect on the managementand culture of the company will be negligible. "Hyundai took astake in the company in 1994 and has taken an active role sincethen. The fact they now own 100% of the company wont be foreignto us."Maxtor is by far the weakest of the top tier storage players."The company has been losing money every quarter and would havebeen out of business one and a half year's ago were it not forHyundai's cash injection of $150 million. The acquisition wasnecessary to keep the company going," says Porter. Over the pastfive years Maxtor has lost $326 million on sales of $5.5 billion.In its most recent quarter, Maxtor announced a net loss of $44.5million on revenues of $281 million.Now, however, Maxtor is talking as though it is about to bereborn. "Western Digital has had the best time to market and hasbeen the market maker but this quarter, we are shipping more 1.6Gbs than they are," says Brown. "Next quarter we will be theleader in 2 Gb drives." Importantly, the company has also justwon a new OEM contract to supply Hewlett-Packard with drives.But Hyundai's aspirations for Maxtor are much greater. In astatement, Hyundai said, "We have a plan to become the world'ssecond biggest hard disk drive producer by the year 2000 and thelargest by the year 2005." The company plans to invest up to $1billion in Maxtor over the next few years in order to grow salesto $5 billion by the year 2000.It is a sizeable goal and some industry observers are worriedthat Hyundai will adopt tactical pricing strategies to try andsteal market share in the short-term. Haggerty disagrees."Hyundai will not tolerate loss of money for a sustained period.They will execute changes to stabilise pricing" he says.Luczo says attempts to buy market share would be pointless. "Youcan't buy market share in this industry, it is too expensive. Orif you do take losses to buy market share, you only get it for acouple of years. You win market share in the long-term by havingthe best products."Hyundai has a reasonable chance of turning the company around,says Porter, "but they need to equip the company with an up todate product line to do so."                            OUTSIDERS"The ongoing consolidation of the disk drive industry is going tomake it increasingly hard for new players to come in," saysMiller of Quantum. But many of the Eastern electronicsconglomerates have other ideas. Companies such as Toshiba,Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC are all active in the market and all arekeen to extend their market share. But only Fujitsu is trying,once again, to take on the US disk drive suppliers head on."The Japanese players pulled out of the OEM disk drive industrythree to four years ago because they didn't want to play down atthe 40 Mb range," says Adam Harris, director and general managerof Fujitsu Europe. As are result, companies headquartered in theUS now control 85% of the OEM disk drive revenues.Now, following a $100 million investment in magneto-resistivehead technology and 16 months of concerted effort getting itstechnology and manufacturing right, Fujitsu says it is ready toget back into the mainstream with products aimed at both thedesktop and the high-end. The company has production facilitiesin Japan, Thailand and, next year, a factory is planned for thePhilippines.Despite all this, even Harris is aware that Fujitsu will struggleto make it as a top tier supplier. "Sure, we are not going tohave 20% of the market next year but we plan to be producing 1million drives a month by the end of 1996 and 1.6 million by June97." Harris says Fujitsu is currently in 10th position with a 3to 4% share and is already taking business from Quantum andSeagate.While Fujitsu looks unlikely to seriously trouble the disk driveindustry leaders for many years, if ever, the Korean electronicsgroup Samsung has joined with its compatriot Hyundai in makingsome bold statements about its chances in the market. It has saidthat it wants to be in the top five OEM disk drive companies bythe end of the decade.Samsung has set about its task by ramping up a research anddevelopment facility in San Jose and it is now shipping aroundtwo to three million disk drives a year. But realistically, sayanalysts, Samsung's only chance of gaining a secure foothold inthe disk drive industry would be to team up with a US company.Despite rumours that Samsung was in the bidding for Conner beforeSeagate stepped in, and that it has also showed an interest inWestern Digital, the most likely target, say pundits, is theCalifornia-based Micropolis.As the Hyundai/Maxtor deal demonstrates, the preferred strategyof Korean industrialists is to buy companies cheap when they areweak and invest heavily to bring them back to health. Micropolis,which has just announced third quarter net losses of $17.5million on turnover down 26% at $58.8 million, is certainly weak.It is also exploring alternatives for separating the operationand management of its drive and value-added systems businesses, amove which, analysts say, could suggest that it is ready to sell.It is doubtful,however, that the combined force of Micropolis andSamsung could actually have much of an impact on the top tierdisk drive suppliers, but Luczo of Seagate will not write theKoreans off."The Koreans will be tough competitors," says Luczo. "If youthink back to the DRAM (memory chip) days, lots of people said'no way'. Here we are, ten years later, and they are the dominantsuppliers. My guess is the Korean competitors will be significant- Hyundai for sure and Samsung maybe.                         CLOSING WINDOW?But there may not be much of a long-term. Many vendors andanalysts believe the life of magnetic disk drive technology isalready into the twilight years. By the year 2000, they say, newtypes of technology will start to emerge as magnetic disks reachtheir physical limits."The life of magnetic disk drive technologies only has another 15years," says IBM's Ernsberger. Like many others, IBM is alreadyworking on a number of successor technologies, includingholographic storage.Until then, day-to-day life in the disk drive industry is likelyto remain a roller-coaster ride, only for those with a strongconstitution. "We will definitely keep seeing those peaks andtroughs," says Porter of Disk/Trend. But the heavy financial andtechnology players will certainly find it easier to flatten someof the bumps.Joanna ManceyEmail: jmancey@power.globalnews.comBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996            SUN SETS OUT TO BURN WORKSTATION RIVALSSun put on a good show to launch UltraSparc. But should thetechnology behind the aggressive marketing message alarm itsworkstation rivals?When Sun Microsystems launched its new UltraSparc workstationslast month, it did so with all the razzmatazz of a Hollywoodspectacular. While thousands looked on via satellite link-ups,hundreds of influential guests from around the world crammed intothe "Ultradome" big-top tent in the grounds of Sun's Menlo Parkfacility in California. They were treated to fireworks, films,live music, dry ice and "shoot-outs" between Sun's new systemsand rivals from Hewlett-Packard (HP), Digital Equipment andSilicon Graphics.Sun's desire to put on a show was understandable. In the $18billion a year Unix workstation business, new productannouncements, usually featuring a significant advance incomputing power, are almost weekly events. But Sun needed theUltraSparc message to stand out: Sun executives can now openlyconfess that for several years its technology has been graduallyslipping behind rivals. But now, they say, the new UltraSparcmodels, based on Sun's "revolutionary" 64-bit processor design,are not just an incremental improvement over previous models andthose of rivals, but a major and ground-breaking advance thatwill have a significant impact on the Unix server and workstationmarket.Apart from increasing the raw processing power of its systems,Sun has introduced what it says are two groundbreakingtechnologies: new on-chip graphics capabilities, which reduce thecost of computer manufacturing and increase graphics processingpower; and Ultra Port Architecture (UPA), a cross-bar switchingmethod, adapted from supercomputer design, which increases theinternal bandwidth of a computer. This is important because itcuts down latency - the time that components spend waiting forinstructions."This is truly a great day for Sun. This announcement is morethan about hot-boxes or leapfrogging ... this is a new paradigm,"said Ed Zander, president of Sun Microsystems Computer Company(SMCC).Bill Joy, one of Sun's co-founders, concurred: "This is thebiggest announcement since the first Sparc [processor] five yearsago, and possibly even since the founding of Sun 15 years ago."The technology, they add, will initially benefit all thosecompanies, such as HAL, ICL, Cray and Amdahl, that build systemsaround Sparc processors.Sun's executives were naturally circumspect about what theUltraSparc processors and workstations might do for the company'salready impressive financial results and share price. But Sunclearly expects to recapture some of the workstation market shareit has lost in recent years. Last year, according to marketanalyst company Dataquest, Sun's share of the Unix workstationbusiness fell by 2% to 36%.Sun now says it will inflict serious damage on its workstationrivals. Zander said users of Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphicsand IBM workstations will now consider switching to Sun machines.And marketing director Anil Gadre claimed that Sun's improvedhigh-end graphics and floating point performance will take Suninto the visualisation, high-end mechanical computer aided designand "infotainment" markets for the first time.Sun's claims were endorsed by more than 50 application vendors,pages of testimonials from customers who had taken part in itsbeta-testing programme and a glowing appraisal of its prospectsin Business Week magazine.                            UPHEAVAL?All of this points to a major upheaval in the workstation marketand problems ahead for rivals such as Silicon Graphics, Digitaland Hewlett-Packard. Moreover, Sun hopes that it has finally putan end to analyst speculation that the Sparc processor familywill not ultimately survive the high-volume assault from rivalprocessor manufacturers such as Intel and Hewlett-Packard(working together on a new design), and IBM and Motorola(PowerPC).Certainly, financial analysts like what they are hearing. Buoyedby recent results (first quarter revenues up 17% to $1.49billion, net income up from $38 million to $85 million), thedelivery of the UltraSparc technology and Sun's invention of theJava programming language, which could become an Internetstandard, Sun's share price has doubled since July.But is all the optimism for Sun justified? Assessing the claimsof rival processor and workstation suppliers, even with the aidof sophisticated benchmarks, is always difficult. While someanalysts believe Sun has made some major technical advances,others - especially its rivals - believe that Sun's achievementis one of having successfully caught-up, rather than havinginitiated a revolution. As one executive at Hewlett-Packard putsit: "Sun's technology is good, but it is nothing like as good asits public relations."                      TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTIf Sun is merely playing catch-up with its technology, it wouldstill be important for the company and its major customers. Ayear ago, analysts such as the Forrester Group were predictingthat, of the major processor families, the Sparc was the leastlikely to survive.But Sun is claiming that it has taken a leadership position inthree core areas: raw power; on-chip graphics; and UPA. If thereis to be a real change in the workstation market, it will bebecause Sun's advances in this area are substantial and not justincremental.Unfortunately, the impact of the innovations is difficult toassess. In terms of power, the 32-bit SuperSparc processor, whichSun has been using for the past two years, clearly lagged behindrival designs from Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics and Digital.The new UltraSparc processors and workstations are, according tothe Specmark benchmark figures provided by Sun, marginally aheadof rivals, are cheaper, and will be superseded next year byfaster models. And in the "shoot-outs" demonstrated by Sun, theUltraSparc system outperformed rivals dramatically.But Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics and Digital are cryingfoul: they say that Sun is comparing its systems with older ornon-equivalent models from rivals; that Sun is using out-of-dateSpec92 benchmarks, rather than the Spec95 benchmarks introducedthis summer (Sun says the Spec95 benchmarks are not ready yet);and, in any case, some of Sun's new models will not be availableuntil next year, by which time HP and Silicon Graphics will haveannounced their new PA8000 and R10000 processors (respectively).Even so, there is some grudging recognition that Sun is back inthe technology race. "I concede they are good products. But whatthey have done is caught-up," says John Saw, a technologymarketing manager with Hewlett-Packard. And Andrew Cresci, amarketing director with Silicon Graphics, says: "They are goodbut not good enough."What of Sun's other advances? A crucial part of its announcementis the on-chip graphics - known as visual instruction set (VIS) -which "greatly improves 2D and 3D graphics, image processing,video handling and animation". According to Mark Tremblay,computer architect for Sparc Technology Business, it is bothcheaper and more efficient to put the graphics processing intothe main processor. He says that performance for graphicsapplications can be boosted dramatically - and disproportionatelyto the Specmark rating of the system: "We see more and moregraphics going onto the CPU." Other chip makers will follow Sun'slead, he says.Although other processor makers such as Intel (with NSP) andIBM/Motorola (on the PowerPC) are moving in this direction, theindustry leader in graphics - Silicon Graphics - is notimpressed. "In general, if you want to increase performance, youdo the graphics separately. If you want to reduce the cost, youput it on the chip," says Cresci of Silicon Graphics. Hisargument is that Sun's innovation has been well understood formany years but that the leaders in graphics processing haveforsaken the cost advantages of on-chip graphics because ofperformance trade-offs.Jack Gold, an analyst with the Meta Group, agrees: "It's not thesame as having an accelerator card. I still think SiliconGraphics will take the top spot at the high-end." But Sun claimsdramatic improvements in the price and performance of graphicsapplications and analysts expect it to have some impact onSilicon Graphics at the lower end of its product ranges.Sun's third major innovation - UPA - falls more squarely in linewith developments in modern computer design. Most designers nowrecognise that increasing the internal bandwidth of a system isprobably more important than raw processing power. Sun'sswitching technology means that one bus, such as Intel's M-Bus,is replaced by several.An important advantage of the UPA is that several processors canbe linked far more effectively - making it easier to reapperformance advantages from multiprocessor systems. For thisreason, powerful new Sun servers, aimed at commercialapplications, can be expected next year.Although rivals have expressed doubts about UPA - SiliconGraphics in particular claims its multiple bus design is moreefficient - it seems likely that Sun's approach will be widelyfollowed, especially as it can lead to substantially improvedinput/output and network performance.                             VERDICTTwo years ago, Sun Microsystems was widely perceived to be inlong-term decline, especially because it had fallen behind oncore chip technology (CBR, October 1994). In fact, chiefexecutive Scott McNealy says people have always been negative onthe company. "It has been 13 years of people thinking we'retoast," he said recently.In this context, Sun has made a dramatic recovery. "There hasbeen a good deal of speculation that Sparc is dead. Sun hasfinally said, 'Yes, we'll be there at the 64-bit level'," saysGold of the Meta Group.Market analysts at IDC also believe Sun has regained credibility."The new Ultra workstations put Sun back in the high performancegame ... Sun is well positioned to maintain its number one placefor the next several years," says analyst Tom Copeland.Few question that Sun should now maintain its leadership and thatthe stated goal of HP's general manager Bernard Guidon, toovertake Sun in workstation sales next year, now looks far harderto achieve. But Sun's wider claims - that it has redrawn the mapof Unix computing - are more suspect. By the middle of next year,all the leading processor/workstation suppliers, with theexception of IBM, will have leapfrogged Sun in pure processingpower at least once. Although Sun may regain the lead again, itwill not necessarily hold it.Gold of Meta says Sun's announcement has not completely killedoff long-term doubts over the future of Sparc, because itsvolumes will always be smaller than those of the Intel/HP and theIBM/Motorola combinations. But, he says, it will "give people anice, cosy feeling and keep them interested in the platform."Sparc still accounts for 36% of the Unix workstation market, amarket share which Sun held in spite of a long period when itlagged behind rivals in performance. While this is unlikely todramatically change in the short term, suppliers that do notcompete effectively with Sun's aggressive pricing and itsperformance improvement are likely to fall behind. IBM, which hasno 64-bit processor, may be a more obvious victim than SiliconGraphics.Sun's high share price today probably owes more to itspositioning as the number one supplier of Internet systems, andits emerging Java language, than the competitiveness of itshardware. But the real significance of Sun's UltraSparctechnology may not be seen until late next year, when, alongsideits workstations, it starts pushing powerful new commercialmachines. In workstations, Sun is defending its lead; incommercial systems, it has everything to gain.Andrew Lawrencecbred@power.globalnews.comBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996                       REQUIRED READINGCBR casts a critical eye over the latest books on informationtechnology.                       INSIDE THE TORNADOFor the past four years, Geoffrey Moore has been the unseen handguiding the strategies of many major computer companies.Executives don't often like to boast that they are drawingheavily on his consultancy or on his 1991 bestseller, Crossingthe Chasm, as they plot their companies' courses. But the leadersat Sybase, PeopleSoft, Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), Unisys, Sun,Lawson Software, Tektronix, Bay Networks, Tivoli, Cincom andDocumentum, and the two hundred others Moore has worked with,have all incorporated his IT industry models into their thinking.In Crossing the Chasm, Moore distilled the essence of why some ITstart-ups develop into major suppliers and others - many, manymore - crash and burn before they even have a shot at themainstream market. Putting the classic technology adoptionlifecycle bell shaped curve under the microscope, Moore notedthat there are distinct waves of purchasing in a technologymarket: buying starts with 'innovators' who will try anytechnology that gives them an edge, then the technology is pickedup by 'early adopters'. This is followed by a phase of early thenlate mass market take-up that represents the hump of the bellbefore conservative 'laggards' come round to buying and the cycletails off.That picture fell short in its sophistication, in Moore'sopinion, because it implied a continuous progression. Hisexperience indicates that there are, in fact, distinct gapsbetween the various stages of the technology lifecycle thatvendors have got to leap if they are to successfully ride thetechnology curve.Most importantly, the gap between early adoption and the earlymass market is so large that it warrants being seen as a 'chasm'.Into that pit have dropped many promising technologies - CASE(computer aided software engineering), artificial intelligence,and pen-based computing, for example. Explaining the forces thatpush some companies into the abyss and propel others on to themass market is what his first book was all about.Influential as Chasm was, the analysis stopped at the far side,leaving a yearning for a more complete picture of the marketbeyond. What dynamics do companies encounter once they havecrossed the chasm? How do they cultivate and exploit a massmarket for their products? And how should their strategies andstructures change as their products climb up one side of thelifecycle curve and slide down the other?With the publication in October of Inside the Tornado - MarketingStrategies from Silicon Valley's Cutting Edge, Moore completesall the pieces of the picture, focusing on the mainstream marketstages "where all high-tech wealth is created".Three phases of a technology's life exist in the mainstream: thebuilding up of market momentum, the 'Bowling Alley' in Mooreterminology; a hypergrowth phase, the 'Tornado'; and finally, aphase of consolidation, Main Street, when the market shakes outand the remaining players reap all the benefits of a strong,stable market.One of the most interesting sections in the book deals with thebuild up to the Tornado. Moore is adamant that, in order forcompanies to attain the momentum of sales that precedes theTornado, they have to adopt a Bowling Alley approach. Flying inthe face of many vendors' desire to scatter bomb the wholemarket, Moore insists that the approach that is most likely tolead to a product entering the Tornado involves companiesembracing a niche market focus in advance of the generalmarketplace. Getting into vertical industry sectors, where theirproducts satisfy a compelling customer need, is a crucial buildup to Tornado sales, he believes. As one niche topples like askittle, its momentum makes knocking over adjacent ones easier.That may all sound dry and theoretical. But each of Moore'spoints, each high-level idea, is backed by multiple examples ofcompanies which have got it right and others that have faltered.One illustration: PeopleSoft, the client/server business softwarecompany, entered the market initially by attacking the wide-openniche of human resources. The management team knew that the bigspend on client/server packages would come not from HR but frommore mainstream business applications like financial managementand manufacturing, but they saw that it would take time for themarket to feel comfortable entrusting such 'mission-critical'systems to the new paradigm of client/server. An HR application,on the other hand, represented a much less risky starting pointfor customers. PeopleSoft staked out its turf in HR in the early1990s and has been growing at 80%-150% ever since. True toMoore's model, the company is now using that base as aspringboard to launch into financials and manufacturingapplications. Despite the formidable competition in client/serverapplications from larger vendors such as SAP and Oracle,Peoplesoft is strongly established in the market and well-poisedto go forward.Applying the same Bowling Alley approach, Lotus did not initiallyoffer its Notes groupware software package to the broadmarketplace. Rather, it targetted niche markets - firstpositioning the product as a global account management tool forBig Six management consultancies, then as a customer servicesaid, before eventually taking the product horizontal. The Notessuccess story "is all traceable back to the cascade of nichemarkets developing one on top of another," says Moore.That process, certainly in Lotus' case with Notes, leads to theTornado. This is when a product switches from niche acceptance towide market take-up, as the mass of pragmatists follows the earlyadopters. German software vendor SAP has been in that phase forthe past 18 months; inkjet printer makers had their Tornado in1991 to 1993. But the rush of growth can sometimes de-stabilise acompany. Oracle in 1991 came close to bankruptcy, even though itsrevenues had grown by 100% a year for over five years.For companies that survive that period in the Tornado, there isMain Street - a period when the sales of a given product reachtheir peak, the shape of market settles down, a market leader isclearly established and huge profits are made.But these are just the dynamics: what Moore's book is all aboutis how to survive and prosper in each phase. His thesis is thatthe forces, the management style, the sales model all have tochange as companies enter the different stages of the market'sevolution. The forces that operate in the Bowling Alley argue fora niche-based strategy that is highly customer-centric; those inthe Tornado push in the opposite direction towards a mass-marketstrategy; then on Main Street market forces push back againtoward a customer-centric approach."The winning strategy does not just change as we move from stageto stage of the lifecycle," says Moore, "it actually reverses theprior strategy. The very behaviours that make a companysuccessful at the outset of the mainstream market cause failureinside the Tornado and must be abandoned. And, similarly, whatmakes companies successful in the Tornado cause failure and mustbe abandoned once that phase of hypergrowth is past."Notwithstanding its unmatched insightfulness, Moore's book is notwithout its flaws. Its layers of mixed metaphor can be tedious,and at times childish. Aside from the lifecycle categories ofChasm, Tornado and Main Street, the book characterises competingcompanies in a sector as gorillas, chimps and monkeys, whileillustrating their positions in the market as imperialists andnatives, explorers or 49ers, barbarians or citizens.Four years on from its publication, Chasm continues to double itssales every six months, with 3,000 new copies selling each week.Tornado is a better book - more clearly written and morecomprehensively illustrated with real world examples. Tornado'stitle is certainly a little crass, and for many shelf browsers itmay be taken for yet another vapid management pep talk. But, evenso, this is an important book which is likely to be in and out ofthe desk drawer of technology company managers for the next halfdecade.Inside the Tornado - Marketing Strategies from Silicon Valley'sCutting Edgeby Geoffrey A MooreHarperBusiness 1995ISBN 0-88730-765-5$25.00Crossing the Chasm - Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products toMainstream Customers (Paperback edition)by Geoffrey A MooreHarperBusiness 1995 (First published 1991)ISBN 0-88730-519-9$13.00 (Paperback)                           THE HP WAYLast month, Hewlett-Packard moved comfortably into third positionin the world systems vendor top 50. At current growth rates itshould overtake Fujitsu within two years and be chasing IBM forthe number one position around the turn of the decade.Here is a company that has the midas touch in many of its chosenmarkets - most notably in Unix servers and printers - and whosegrowth is more akin to that of start-up. During fiscal 1995, HPadded $6 billion in product sales, bringing revenues to $31.5billion.This success is no accident. HP was the first mainstream systemsvendor to wholeheartedly embrace RISC and open systems, withoutkilling sales of its proprietary midrange server platform. Itbuilt the laser and inkjet printer markets virtuallysinglehandedly and, through clever production and pricemanagement, has turned printers into its primary engine ofprofitability. In doing so, it became one of the few Americancompanies to take on, and beat, the Japanese in a commoditytechnology market.Yet, while two or three books a year are published about IBM,Microsoft, and Apple, and there is at least one text eachdetailing the life and times of Wang, Data General, and Sun,there is remarkably little inside information on life at HP. Thegarage in Palo Alto, CA where the company was founded back in1938, has been designated a California Historical Landmark andlabelled 'the birthplace of Silicon Valley', yet the day-to-dayevents, characters, chance meetings and carefully manoeuvredstrategies that helped Bill Hewlett and David Packard build HPare largely uncharted. Unfortunately, the memoirs of DavidPackard, do little to change that.The HP Way, rather than giving a detailed insight into themomentous events that turned a small test and measurementinstrument company into a computing giant, reads like a gushing afairy tale. A young, fit, talented Stanford scholar, DavidPackard, in love with technology and nature, meets a like-mindedspirit in the shape of Bill Hewlett. Encouraged by a benevolentprofessor, the happy twosome unite to create a new technologycompany with the goal to "make an important technicalcontribution to the advancement of science, industry and humanwelfare". Through hard work and endeavour, coupled with enduringrespect for employees and business partners, the company grows tobe one of the most successful in North America.The end result is a worthy corporate bible for HP employees andperfect inspirational reading for budding high schoolentrepreneurs. But those who might hope to finally get an insightinto what makes HP tick will find Packard's book a disappointingand frustrating read.Many key events in HP history are only mentioned in passing andthe book offers tantalising facts without any discussion orexplanation. For example, Packard notes how, in the 1960s, HPentered negotiations to buy Digital Equipment for around $25million, but decided against it. There is no further explanationand no comment on why the deal was rejected. Neither does Packarddiscuss the repercussions of Steve Wozniak leaving HP afterWozniak's blueprint for a personal computer was rejected. WithSteve Jobs, that blueprint built Apple Computer.What Packard does major on is his philosophy of workforcemanagement. There is a detailed discussion of 'the HP Way', aseven point mission statement drawn up by Hewlett and Packardcovering all aspects of company operation from profit andcustomers to employees and citizenship. Packard explains whypolicies such as 'management by walking around' and 'managementby objective - the antithesis of management by control' evolvedand how they are executed. "Success depends in large part ongiving responsibility to the level where it can be exercisedeffectively, usually on the lowest possible level of theorganisation, the level nearest to the customer. Each person inour company is important and every job is important."What also comes across is the clear attempt to stifle managementegos, a factor that has certainly contributed to a corporatepersonality marked by its humility and low profile. In a typicalanecdote, Packard recounts how he travelled with his financialentourage to a meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on the dayof HP's initial public offering. Despite the momentous occasion,Packard and his colleagues took the subway from their hotel,ending up late for the stock launch due to a missed trainconnection. "It never occurred to me to take a taxi," he saysproudly.For sure, these company codes have been instrumental in shapingHP's success. But where is the discussion of the brilliantproduct breakthroughs and of the key management decisions andfigures that propelled the company into market leadershippositions?This book is less of a company history and more an investigationof the moral and social beliefs of Packard. While there are manycorporate guidelines in The HP Way that managers today may wishto emulate, others are now thoroughly outmoded and simplistic.Packard concludes by saying, "Everywhere I look I see potentialfor growth, for discovery far greater than anything we have seenin the twentieth century." This book does not really throw anylight on how the HP corporate machine will work to exploit thoseopportunities.The HP Way - How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Companyby David PackardHarperBusiness 1995ISBN 0-88730-747-7$17.00/#11.99                   I SING THE BODY ELECTRONICWhen Tracy Kidder's The Soul of the New Machine appeared in 1982,it established a blueprint for a certain type of technology book.A writer, usually a journalist and almost always non-technical,would spend a year or so in the company of a team of people whowere developing a technology product. The books are the writtenequivalent of a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary, recording thetrials, emotions and turmoil of a group of people working againsttime to develop an innovative product.Kidder's was a Pulitzer prize winning account of the epic effortto design and build Data General's first 32-bit computer. In ISing the Body Electronic - A Year with Microsoft on theMultimedia Frontier, Fred Moody comes close to Kidder'sachievement. While Moody does not aspire to the almost poeticstyle of Kidder's original, his book is a rigorously honest andfascinating account of a year in the life of a Microsoftdevelopment team.Moody had almost unchallenged access to the team that worked onMicrosoft's Explorapedia, and he faithfully chronicles thethoughts, emotions, struggles and doubts that guided thedevelopment of the juvenile follow-up to the hugely successfulEncarta.On his journey, Moody throws some fascinating insights into lifewithin Microsoft and the hopes, fears and doubts of the company'semployees and its founder and chief executive, Bill Gates.It is to Microsoft's credit that Moody was given open access tothe team and the surrounding management, including Gates. But theresult is no PR exercise.True to the portraits in other books of software builders, themainly young Explorapedia team work extremely hard - sleepingunder their desks, living off pizza, eschewing normal socialcontact.But the real insight begins with Moody's discovery that with 20years experience writing about Microsoft - he works for SeattleWeekly - and some 15 years covering the software industry, he isa Gulliver among the Lilliputians. The people he mixes with mayknow how to design and build software, but they don't know how tomanage people or a project. They have no idea how to hold ameeting that achieves anything, they know little about life,their interpersonal skills are non-existent, their observationsare frequently selfish and childish and they live in awe of thatgreat God, Bill.Moody's take on all of this confirms some of Douglas Coupland'sfictional observations in Microserfs.In his 1995 novel, Coupland raked over the soul of Microsoft andfound a bleak, cold heart. While Coupland has been more defensivein recent interviews - pointing out that the average Microsoftemployee has a much better than average chance of becoming amillionaire - the picture he created was of a corporation thatwould be an unpalatable workplace for anyone with a personallife.While Microserfs is not as satisfying as the real thing portrayedin I Sing the Body Electronic - in this case truth is stranger,or at least more interesting, than fiction - Coupland has thebetter cover title (Moody, inexplicably, derives his title fromthe 1971 album 'I Sing the Body Electric' by the jazz groupWeather Report). These Microsoft programmers are truly serfs.They may become very rich serfs, but they are serfs nonetheless,serving an all powerful Lord as feudal in his people managementand distribution of largesse as any from the Middle Ages.The prospect of serfdom still attracts 150,000 resumes a year fromkeen young students and graduates. Given Microsoft's reputationand commercial success this is understandable, but the appallingtreatment meted out to those 'lucky' enough to be granted aninterview gives pause for thought.When the unsympathetic chief programmer on Explorapedia, KevinGammill, takes relish in intimidating and humiliating would-beprogrammers, the book hits a genuinely sombre note.Given the pool of enthusiastic applicants, it is surprising tolearn that much of the development work is, in fact, carried outby on-site contractors, who do not see anything of the Microsoftshare options, health benefits, free soda or even the possibilityof a plastic 'Ship It' award. The contractors usually joinMicrosoft in the hope of getting offered a full-time job at theend, despite the existence of an edict that bars them from beingrecruited as permanent staff. As Gates puts it: "Where's theadded value?"While Moody provides a fascinating insight into life on theMicrosoft campus, he also exposes some of the deepest worries ofthe top management. Gates knows that the multimedia market isgoing to be very large and that Microsoft should be heavilyinvolved. The problem for Gates is that while his company has theexpertise to build the delivery vehicle for multimedia, it doesnot (yet) have the catalogue of material, the 'content', requiredto ensure that Microsoft will be a major player. The book showsGates as paranoid about Microsoft's lack of 'content'.The original material for Explorapedia came from Dorling-Kindersley, the London-based publisher, famous for itssumptuously illustrated children's books and travel guides. Gatesis portrayed as worrying that, through their involvement withMicrosoft, Dorling-Kindersley will learn how to producemultimedia products and then deliver their own titles based on anextensive back catalogue. He was right to worry, because Dorling-Kindersley have since done exactly that.The book gives the impression that Gates is kept awake at nightby the thought that the megamedia content owners, such as Time-Warner, Sony, Disney and News Corporation, will make a fortune athis company's expense. After all, while many companies can learnhow to develop multimedia software platforms, the copyrightedmaterial that actually sells multimedia products is may notnecessarily be available to Gates at any price.I Sing the Body Electronic - A Year with Microsoft on theMultimedia Frontierby Fred MoodyPenguin Books (US)/Hodder & Stoughton (UK) 1995ISBN (US) 0-67084-875-1(UK) 0-340-58652-4$23.95/#17.99Microserfsby Douglas CouplandHarperCollins (Fiction) 1995ISBN (US) 0-06-039148-0/ISBN(UK) 0-00-225311-9$21.00/#9.99Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996          EMULATION WINDOW IS STILL AJAR FOR INSIGNIAInitial public offering succeeds, but how long before thecompany's core business fizzles out?As suppliers, investors and analysts scour the globe for hot newtechnologies and companies, the niche business of software'emulation' tools is unlikely to attract much attention. Yetemulation is the business of Insignia Solutions, the Britishcompany headquartered in Mountain View, California. In spite ofpessimism about its niche, and a fall in technology stocks, lastmonth Insignia successfully placed its first public offering ofshares on Nasdaq. The issue raised $42 million in the form ofAmerican Depository Receipts, about $16 million of which isavailable to the company.Insignia, now ten years old, is well known in the Unix and PCmarkets, partly because its emulation tools have at times assumedgreat significance in the battle between the key operating systemenvironments. Insignia's main product, SoftWindows, enables usersto run Microsoft Windows applications on Unix and Apple Macintoshcomputers. This appeals to users that mix Macs or Unix machineswith swathes of PCs, but want them all to run particular Windows-based 'personal productivity' software such as Microsoft Office.Perhaps more importantly, the availability of SoftWindows hasenabled suppliers such as Apple to boast that their computerswill run Windows applications. Until recently, this was socrucial to Apple that it bundled SoftWindows with itsPowerMacintosh computers. Unix workstation vendors such as IBMand Digital Equipment also resell SoftWindows.But Apple's decision in March 1995 to cease bundling SoftWindowsmay indicate how tight a niche the Windows emulation market isbecoming. Apple's decision was partly strategic - it did not wantto endorse Windows - and partly because it saw little demand.Products such as Microsoft Office come in nearly identicalversions for both platforms.More worrying for Insignia, as the PC and Windows standardbecomes increasingly dominant and as the market for hardware-based PC emulators for the Macintosh matures, the role ofsoftware emulators may be further marginalised. If Microsoft's NToperating system - which includes 16-bit Windows emulation -continues to break ground in the server and workstation market,there may be even less demand. Analysts say the emulation marketwill grow only slightly over the next few years.                        BEYOND EMULATIONInsignia executives are aware of the difficulties they could face- although they say the end of the emulation market is many yearsaway. Brian Fawkes, Insignia's vice president of marketing,hinted at acquisitions and new development projects, admittingthat one reason for the public offering was to raise money to'look at other technologies and compliment what we are doingtoday'.But this does not mean the emulation business will be run as a'cash cow'. Operating system emulation will be a "function thatwe will always be following," says Fawkes. SoftWindows, he adds,will be developed as a "very different product in three years,able to support whatever products are out there". This couldinvolve adding value to the Intel processor instruction setemulation which is likely to be built into RISC processors.The emulation niche is not necessarily as small or as static assome think. David Sidwell, Insignia's vice president of Europeansales and support, agrees that Insignia is operating in a niche,but insists it is a good one. He says the expected homogenisingof the desktop has not happened. The continued strength of theMacintosh has meant solid but unspectacular revenues fromInsignia's Mac product, which makes up 60% of its sales and isconsidered to have no competition.Fawkes points to several new products to show its growingdiversity. One is NTrigue, developed with Network ComputingDevices, which will give users access to Windows NT-basedprograms from their Unix X-terminals and low-end Macs and PCsfrom early next year. A new version of SoftWindows for Unix thatprovides full 486 emulation is due any moment.The Unix market still has potential. Unix workstations areselling in huge numbers, and SoftWindows, developed with theapproval of Microsoft, supports more applications than rival toolWabi from SunSoft. "Corporate buyers are looking at our Unixproduct and many are looking at standardising on NT in thefuture, which will make our NTrigue product very successful,"Fawkes says.Insignia's recent revenue history has been impressive, but not asdramatic as some other young software companies. Revenues of $7.8million in 1991 grew to $39.4 million in 1994 with profits of$4.8 million. In the first nine months of 1995, Insigniagenerated revenues of $41 million with profits of $4.6 million.Setting aside a loss of $6 million in 1993, the year it worked onits PowerMac version of SoftWindows, its performance has beenconsistent, a sign that the well-connected company is also wellmanaged.But how long before the emulation market slows or fizzles out?Deborah Hess, senior analyst at Datapro in the US, says themarket will see steady but undramatic growth for a few years."This market has a definite two to three years. Beyond that it isuncertain."To secure a long-term future, Insignia must put the money raisedby the IPO to good use. Armed with $20 million and strong sales,it is likely to make at least one acquisition - perhaps several -and to intensify investment in research and development. Itsproduct and corporate announcements over the next two years willprovide more of an indicator.

Competingmanufacturers struggle to innovate.Until recently, the Intel compatible processor market wasreasonably well ordered. Custom- ers could tell which processorwas which and knew that upgrading to a newer microprocessor meantmore power. And as Intel sought to manage its growth, its volumesand margins, it was also possible to chart roughly how much powerwould be delivered by a new processor, and when. But all this looks set to change. As the competing vendorsstruggle to innovate, and as the iapx86 design begins to near itslimits, the steady flow of Intel processors - from 286 up to thePentium '586', looks set to give way to a confusing mishmash ofcompeting products. By Intel's own admission, its new Pentium Pro(or 'P6') processor does not run most PC software at all well.Tests show that there is no significant performance gain fromrunning Windows or DOS applications on a 150 MHz (megahertz) P6compared with a 133 MHz Pentium processor. Intel is now advisingPC makers to stick with the Pentium - a move that could laterimpact its market share and profitability.Meanwhile Intel's most formidable rival, Advanced Micro Devices(AMD), is to take over rival NexGen, and is reviewing its productline to accommodate NexGen's technology with its own. It willdrop its future K6 development in favour of NexGen'sarchitecture.AMD, like Cyrix, another major competitor, is also changing thenumbering of its microprocessors in what many see as an attemptto dress up older technology as new.AMD is renaming its high-end 486 microprocessor the X5, in a bidto grab some cachet from being associated as a fifth generationpart (ie, equivalent to the Pentium). Cyrix is playing the samegame, calling its delayed M1 microprocessor, originally a fifthgeneration product, the 686 to make it seem like a sixthgeneration product.                            UNWELCOMEIf the Intel-compatible processor market is to become lessordered, it is not at the bidding of Intel or its rivals.The first year of Pentium sales went according to the usual plan.Intel then withdrew from the 486 market and took most customerswith it to the Pentium processor. US market research firmComputer Intelligence Infocorp (CII) says that 486microprocessors had about 55% of the market early in 1995 - thisis now just 25%.It is not only user demand for more power that has led to therapid upgrade. "Intel's pricing strategy has made it financiallyunwise for vendors to continue manufacturing and marketing 486-based products," says Stella Kelly, analyst at CII. The threat ofthe rival IBM/Motorola PowerPC RISC processor - a threat whichhas since proved to be less immediate than Intel feared -encouraged Intel to make the switch to the Pentium faster than ithad planned.Initially, the strategy did no harm to the Intel-compatiblevendors but Intel, helped by the push to the Pentium, hasgradually got stronger. With prices now low, Cyrix has concludedit cannot manufacture its 486 parts cost effectively and haspulled out of the market. It is now concentrating on getting its686 microprocessor out on time, to avoid a revenue blip. Analysts think highly of the 686 design - although itscompetitive positioning would have been a lot worse if thePentium Pro was more powerful. "Cyrix's timing is a lot betterwith the M1[686] and it should have few software compatibilityissues," said Mike Griffith industry analyst with US marketresearch firm In-Stat.AMD's K5 Pentium competitor has suffered repeated delays due totechnical problems and will not now be delivered until the secondhalf of 1996. It is partly for this reason that AMD is takingover NexGen. NexGen has been selling its Nx586 for a year butsales have been hampered by the fact that it does not have aPentium 'pin compatible' part.AMD is still confident of selling five million K5 units in itsfirst year and says it is talking with several major PCmanufacturers looking for an alternative to Intel. But it stillfaces big problems: Linley Gwennap of The Micro- processor Reportpoints out that Intel's continuing price cuts on the Pentium meanthat AMD will be forced to sell the K5 for about $100, about thesame price as its high-end 486 part. Yet AMD will have spenthundreds of millions of dollars getting the K5 part out andramping up production. "It will have trouble keeping its headabove water," says Gwennap.                           WINDOW OPENIf Intel had been able to deliver a powerful upgrade to thePentium next year, it would probably have crippled AMD. But whileIntel has managed to dominate the fifth generation market so far,it will now be forced to leave the market window open wider thanit would have liked.The reason can be traced back to its big software partner,Microsoft. Four years ago, when Intel began designing the PentiumPro, Microsoft promised that its main desktop operating systemwould be largely a 32-bit system - as are Windows NT and Unix. Infact, the dominant operating systems are Windows 3.1 andWindows'95 - both 16 bit systems. The Pentium Pro is onlysignificantly faster running 32- bit applications.Intel points to faster versions of the Pentium Pro, running inexcess of 200 MHz, that will be out next year. It also says thatthere will be increasing amounts of 32-bit software in futureversions of Windows 95. But, sources say, Intel realises there isa problem and is working on a new version of the Pentium Prooptimised for 16- bit software that will be out in early 1997."The Pentium Pro's poor performance in running Windows softwarewill give some extra breathing room for companies like AMD andCyrix," says Nathan Brook-wood, semiconductor analyst at USmarket research firm Dataquest. To plug the gaps, in mid-1996Intel will introduce the P55C, which is optimised for multimediaprocessing. But the introduction of the 55C, which may offerhigher performance than the new architecture Pentium Pro, willfurther confuse customersIf Intel's competitors want to benefit from any hiccup in itsbusiness strategy then they will have to move fast. In 1997,Intel will break with the iapx86 architecture and introduce theVLIW (very long instruction word) P7, developed with Hewlett-Packard. Even if the AMD, Cyrix and others are able to buildsimilar processors, competing against both Hewlett-Packard andIntel - and the PowerPC consortium - is not going to be easy.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996             SNI BENEFITS FROM CULTURAL REVOLUTIONGerman systems vendor back in profitSiemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI) chief executive GerhardSchulmeyer spent 14 years of his business career in the US, firstas a senior executive at Motorola and latterly as head of theengineering company Asea Brown Boveri. Those influences have beenall to obvious in his 18 months at the top of Europe's largestindigenous systems vendor. His preferred working language isEnglish and he repeatedly looks to the entrepreneurial culture ofSilicon Valley for inspiration.Last month, he was able to deliver evidence that his formula isworking. For the first time since it was formed in 1990 throughthe combination of Germany's two biggest computer makers, SiemensData and Information systems division and Nixdorf Computer, therewas no red ink on the headline financial statement. Although muchaided by a revived German economy, SNI has managed an astonishingturnaround. Losses that totalled DM350 million ($248 million) in1994, swung to a slim profit of DM23 million ($16 million) forthe latest financial year ending 30 Sept-ember. Equallyimpressive, revenues, which had been flat or shrinking for all ofits five years, jumped 10% in fiscal 1995 to DM12.8 billion ($9.0billion).How Schulmeyer has achieved the transformation is a lesson inbusiness re-engineering practice. But it also raises the questionof how SNI can sustain its elevation from its financial sickbed.Over the 18 months, Schulmeyer has split SNI into 10 lines ofautonomous business, each of which "has to hold its own in itsown field". He has sent scores of managers to the US on'entrepreneur' courses and tried to instill a culture ofinnovation and openness, quickly dismantling SNI's historicallycivil service-like clubbiness. "You no longer have to have yourear to the wall to find out what is going on," says Schulmeyer."We have become a learning organisation." One manifestation ofthis is the series of 'Friday Forums', where all of SNI's 37,200employees get together to pick over issues ranging from workingpractices to company strategy.Schulmeyer says the reorganisation is now "more or lesscomplete". It has included a massive board level re-organisation.Only three of SNI's top board of nine insiders and nine outsidedirectors have been with the company for more than three years.Schulmeyer is now bullish about SNI's prospects. "There is now noquestion of whether we have a chance of survival," he says. Heclaims that SNI has moved into leading positions in many ofEurope's hottest computer markets. From nowhere, it has becomeEurope's number four PC vendor - it is even turning a profit inthat market of wafer thin margins, despite the high cost burdenof building all of its PCs in Germany. In Unix mid-range systems,it holds the number three spot. It also dominates the region'smarket for high-speed bulk printers and is the second largestvendor of point-of-sale equipment. In Germany, Europe' largestmarket, it controls the number one position in all of theseproducts.However, as the small overall profit indicates, not all businessunits have made it as successfully into the black. Four, atpresent, are still making losses, says Schulmeyer. Two can bemoved into profit this fiscal year, he says, and the other twowill be out of the tunnel in 1996/97. "Our agenda assumes that by1996/97, all business units will be in the black." While hedeclines to identify the loss-makers, he does point out thatSNI's mainframe division continues to show declining revenues.The picture is the same in related computer maintenance.In those areas and elsewhere, SNI has been making staffreductions, though at a slightly slower pace than in previousyears. During fiscal 1995, headcount fell 5% to 37,200. Another1,000 redundancies are expected this year.Meanwhile, SNI's strongest engines of growth have been in Unixservers and in point-of-sale systems. But perhaps the greatestsuccess story has been at its PC division, where revenues grew byover 40% last year to DM2.8 billion ($2.0 billion) and unitssoared from 390,000 to 636,000. Since October 1992, all decisionmaking for the PC business has been devolved to the unit managersat the SNI PC factory in Ausburg near Munich. They havedrastically reduced the variety of models while investing heavilyin automation that allows PC to be snapped, rather than screwed,together. To pare costs further, SNI took a 10% stake in Europe'ssecond largest PC retailer Escom, earlier this year. Buyingcomponents together, the companies can benefit from volumediscounts and preferential supply. But most importantly, theautonomy of the unit allowed the PC division to become highly-responsive to market swings, allowing it to switch to newspecifications within weeks rather than many months. Back in1992, when the factory was producing 190,000 PCs a year, itcalculated the break even point would be 500,000 units. Ausburgis now running at 80% capacity and plans to produce 800,000 PCsthis year. But Schulmeyer believes that, to be a lasting success,it has to get closer to 2 million units. That has encouraged thethinking that SNI may be looking for less expensive manufacturingsites outside of Germany, where 60% of its PCs are sold.The location of the bulk of its PC customers points to SNI'sAchilles heel - the company's dependency on its home market.Despite concerted efforts, Schulmeyer has been unable to raisethe proportion of business that SNI derives from outside markets.For the past five years, 65% of revenues have come from Germany,and he admits that the company is still searching for a formulathat will make it more successful elsewhere."Our market share often drops by a factor of 10 when we cross theGerman border," says Schulmeyer. "International growth is our toppriority."The goal is for revenues to be split one third from Germany, athird from the rest of Europe and a third from the rest of theworld. But Schulmeyer admits "We don't have a solution to thisyet but somehow we will figure it out." He does not even expressoptimism that SNI can attain its ideal of a three way split bythe end of the decade.Nevertheless, that momentum in Germany has made the company theworld's 11th largest IT systems supplier, ahead of AT&T GIS, Bulland Olivetti. In Europe, only IBM and Hewlett-Packard generatemore IT revenue.In the US, the picture is very different. Revenues are barely$500 million, although its acquisition of loss-making Unix servermaker Pyramid Technology in mid-1995 has come good. With Pyramidno longer under threat of terminal decline, orders have pickedup, and it is now back in the black. Profits of over $10 millionwere accompanied by revenues that grew by over 30% to around $300million in 1995. That international expansion could be spurred byfurther acquisitions - in the area of business services ratherthan systems or software, says Schulmeyer, but Europe is thepriority.SNI has not managed the turnaround without considerable help -and a lot of patience - from Siemens AG, its $63 billionengineering parent. Siemens has bankrolled the company throughits worst losses, and lent it capital to restructure. How much ofSNI's business flows from contracts placed by Siemens is notpublic knowledge, but Siemens described as SNI's "preferencepartner" by Schulmeyer.In fact, SNI's revenues are due for a boost over the coming yearas Siemens begins transfering all of its computer centreactivities to SNI's outsourcing arm. Schulmeyer identifies theseactivities as turning over DM 1 billion ($707 million).That captive contract should help raise profits above 1995'snegligible amount. And Schulmeyer is under no illusion that hehas to get the company more solidly in the black. "We have got toget away from the zero line, and show double digit growth toavoid restructuring in the future."However, if the German economy which has shown signs of declinein recent quarters should falter, Schulmeyer will need everyounce of his entrepreneurial flair to keep SNI bouncing back.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996            HP CATCHING UP WITH IBM ON SYSTEM SALES'Printer company' jibe rings hollowJealous rivals in the computer industry used to dismiss Hewlett-Packard as 'a great printer company'. The description was meantto imply that the computer, electronics, and peripherals giantdeliberately over-stated its importance in the computer industryand played down the vital contribution of its printer business toits phenomenal revenue and profits growth of recent years.It is doubtful whether the jibe ever lost HP a single sale but,even if it did, it is unlikely to be heard again after fiscal1995. By any standards, HP has had a sensational year,outstripping all its main rivals in just about every sector inwhich it operates. Although HP does not break down its sources ofrevenues, its total computer business, which it includesworkstations, servers, PCs and printers, grew nearly 30% to $7billion during the quarter.If HP can sustain this rate of growth for another 12 months, thenits executives can expect some banner headlines in November 1996.Then, for one quarter at least, HP will be able to announce thatit has achieved what many must have thought impossible: in itsquarter ending in October 1996, it will have sold more hardwarethan IBM did in its quarter ending September 1996. In fact, HPnearly overtook IBM in the equivalent periods this year, with its$7 billion worth of equipment nudging up against IBM's $7.75billion.True, these comparisons are a little unfair - IBM's much largerfourth quarter ending in December is a fairer comparison withHP's fourth quarter. Even so, they are an indication of just howfast HP is growing. HP has a real chance of being the world'snumber one computer maker early next century.A few years ago, that crown once looked to be within the grasp ofDigital Equipment and, in order to put the heat on IBM, Digital'ssalesmen wore badges bearing 2007, the year when they wouldovertake IBM. HP is never likely to fall victim to such hubris.With its fourth quarter revenue up a staggering 29% from $7billion to $9 billion, and net income up from $476 million to$678 million, its chief executive Lew Platt merely commented thathe "is encouraged by many aspects of its fourth quarter results".Both financial and computer industry analysts were a little moreenthusiastic. "Phenomen- nally good", said a Merrill Lynchanalyst. HP is "extremely well positioned in almost every growthmarket", said a Gruntal & Co analyst. HP reported big increasesin every one of its divisions, including its test and measurementbusiness.Perhaps the most impressive performance by HP is in personalcomputers, where it has come from almost nowhere to take a topfive position, with about 5.4% of the world market, in less inthan two years. Dataquest praised HP's performance in the PCmarket, as did IDC, which described its growth as"extraordinary". Analysts attribute HP's success to its strongbrand name, its manufacturing excellence, and its ability toexploit its existing laser and inkjet printer distributionchannels. The downside of this success, however, is that itsoverall gross margins have fallen by 3% because of the low-margins of home PCs.There is no immediate sign of a let up in HP's growth. Along withits results, HP announced that its order book is healthier thanever. It has $7 billion worth of orders for its computer systems,it says, up nearly a third from a year ago. Against thisbackground, analysts dismissed speculation that HP will buyApple, circulating at the Comdex show in November, as fanciful.Why. they ask, would HP, already growing so fast, want to take ona company that is clearly troubled by major organisational andstrategic problems?Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996             TALIGENT NEEDS TO DEFINE FUTURE ROLEKaleida closure puts pressure onWhen IBM and Apple formed their historic, three-part alliance in1991, their goals could not have been more grand. First, theywanted to create a new standard in microprocessors to challengeIntel; next, they wanted to introduce a powerful new operatingsystem which would oust Microsoft from its position as theleading supplier of desktop software. And third, they wanted tolead in the supply of what was then viewed as the most excitingtechnology of the day, multimedia tools.Four years on, IBM and Apple still retain some slim hopes ofachieving some of their goals, but the grand vision lies intatters. Last month, IBM and Apple killed of their multi-mediasoftware joint venture Kaleida, ending the company's long agony(company insiders have been predicting its demise since earlythis year). The move means a $75 million write off for eachcompany.Down the road in Silicon Valley, some 400 employees at Taligent,the object-oriented software tools company in which Hewlett-Packard also owns a stake, are anxiously awaiting news. They havebeen told it is business as usual, but persistent rumours suggestthat the company may be folded into IBM. This is because thesuccess of Microsoft in the past two years, along with other newdevelopments such as the World Wide Web, has almost killed demandfor a revolutionary new software environment."Employee morale is low. The ball is up in the air and no-oneknows where it will land," said one. Like many at Taligent, hewas recruited from Apple and says he does not want to work forIBM.As if this were not bad enough, the most successful part of thealliance is also beset by difficulties. A top end 64-bit versionof the PowerPC reduced instruction set (RISC) microprocessorfamily, jointly designed by IBM, Apple and Motorola, has beenindefinitely delayed (CBR November 1995). And IBM's failure todeliver a viable PowerPC desktop system, along with Apple'smanufacturing and supply problems, have dimmed the long-termprospects of the microprocessor.Are the problems with each initiative related? In theory, each ofthese projects is entirely separate, and involves other partnersand different ways of working. Yet Michael Braun, who headedKaleida Labs, can see at least one common factor: they are alljoint ventures. "Companies should have a counselling session withme if they are thinking of doing one," he told reporters. "You'restupid if you try."Braun's complaint is that IBM and Apple could not stop bickering,that they held a right of veto over Kaleida's decisions, and thatthey prevented the company from developing software tools whichmight compete with their own independent efforts. Although themain authoring tool, ScriptX, is considered to be a technicalsuccess, these problems meant it entered the market too late,says Braun.The two parents have now agreed that Apple will take over most ofthe development work, although both will use some of the softwarein future products. But does the failure of Kaleida bode ill forTaligent? As one rival software supplier pointed out, "If themodel did not work at Kaleida, you have to wonder aboutTaligent."The comments of Joe Guglielmi, the former chief executive ofTaligent, are ominous. When he left in Septem- ber to head theMotorola Computer Group, he said the company had completed itsfirst phase of software development and was on a "home run". Now,he says, IBM and Apple are "re-evaluating everything".The problems at Taligent are similar to those of Kaleida. Bothcompanies had grand ambitions and developed powerful technologyover a long period. But in each case, the fast-changing demandsof the market forced them to continually change their goals. Inthe case of Kaleida, it missed development deadlines and itsScriptX product was beaten to the market by Macromedia, which nowdominates (CBR November 1995).Taligent has not missed any development deadlines, its defendersnote. But its original plan, to develop a completely new object-oriented operating system, was abandoned because it became clearthere was no demand. Its lesser goal, of delivering powerfulobject oriented tools and object "frameworks" for users andsoftware suppliers, has not fallen behind schedule, but it is amuch smaller market. Although the Commonpoint toolset is to bedelivered this quarter, making it unlikely that IBM and Applewill pull the plug just yet, a scaling down of development effortis likely.That, in effect, puts the future of Taligent in the hands of themarket. If there is sufficient interest and take-up of thedevelopment kits in the first half of 1996, then it is likely toremain independent. But if there is insufficient demand, it willbe integrated back into IBM. As Guglielmi points out, "It fitswell into IBM's strategy." HP has so far remained silent, but hasnever made the kind of commitment to Taligent that IBM and Applehave.Although almost every developer who has seen Taligent is highlyimpressed, one commonly cited concern is that it was developedbefore the Internet and the World Wide Web had caught on.Companies such as NeXT Computer, which has a rival objectdevelopment tool, and Sun, which has the Java language, have re-oriented their object oriented development environments in thisdirection. In comparison, Commonpoint may be seen as a worthy,but less immediately attractive development. If Taligent is tomake an impact, IBM and Apple will have to restate theircommitment and the company itself will have to demonstrate how itis responding to market demands.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996             CMG MAKES CAUTIOUS STOCK MARKET ENTRYIT services group seeks 'fame' not cashFrom its outset in 1964, CMG Plc, the Anglo/Dutch IT servicesgroup, has always fostered a culture of employee ownership. Withshare options built into every staff contract, around 1,850employees, ex-employees and their relatives, along with theirpension and trust funds, own equity amounting to 90% of thecompany whose headcount stands at 2,650.But the fact that CMG has been privately held all these years hasmeant that there was no way of cashing in that stock, apart fromtrading on the internal spot market that grew up within thecompany. All that changed in early December as CMG launched adual flotation on the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges,establishing its market capitalisation at around $180 million.That valuation is a modest one times the company's projectedannual revenues for 1995 of #200 million ($310 million), a figurethat betrays an underlying nervousness about the listing.In fact, the company says its principal reason for the flotationis in order to raise its profile in the eyes of its corporateclients and within the pan-European services market. "We did itfor name and fame," says Cor Stutterheim, CMG chairman. CMG hascertainly has not gone public in order to raise large amounts ofcapital. The share offering only netted CMG $6.1 million ($9.5million).For a company growing at 36% and which has been profitable foreach of its 31 years, that caution borders on the paranoid. Itsjumpiness has been picked up from the London stock market whichis justifiably bearish about high-tech issues. Over most of thisyear, the market for IT stock has been poisoned after a number ofnewly-floated companies missed their earnings forecasts by amile. That meant that CMG's initial run up to a listing, back inthe Spring of this year, had to be cancelled at a cost of half amillion pounds.Companies like MDIS, a rival to CMG in certain markets, are stilltrying to right their financial reputations. Judging from itsprospectus, CMG has grounds to be more bullish. Revenues grew by14% in 1994 and CMG indicates that the strong performance thatresult-ed in 36% revenue growth during the first half of 1995 hascontinued in the second half of the year. This paves the way fora #200 million year end.Profitability is also solid - at least in Holland. After a firsthalf when its net profit was #5.3 million ($8.2 million), thecompany is projecting a second half net of #12.1 million ($18.8million) before flotation costs and #10.4 million ($16.2 million)after. That is 44% up on last year's figure.About 90% of the company's profits come from the Netherlands,which has now become the UK-founded company's principle operatingregion. Two third of revenues are derived from Holland, 26% comefrom the UK and the other 10% from Germany, where CMGstrengthened its position in February with the DM18 million ($7.9million) acquisition of system development/services providerPecom.Operating profit margins at 15% are strong in Holland and weak inthe UK at 4%. The German operation is just moving out of the red.In all three markets, CMG is still very much focused on softwaredevelopment. Around 72% of revenues still come from projects andapplications software, while 21% is sourced from payrollprocessing and facilities management contracts and the remaining7% comes from management consultancy.Despite its financial track record and the strong employeeloyalty that comes from collective ownership, CMG still has someissues to resolve.The death earlier this year of founder Douglas Gorman, coupledwith the fact that the company's principal financial centre hasshifted to Holland, raises some questions of whether the UKshould have such a strong role in the company as it expandsthroughout Europe.Secondly, despite the flotation, the company is not cash rich. Infact, during the first quarter, when it paid out for Pecom, itsreserves dwindled to #5.1 million, forcing it to sell an 8%tranche of equity to ABN Amro Bank. Even after the flotation, itsbalance will only stand at #16 million, which is low given the30% plus growth rate CMG is experiencing.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996           KEY MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN NOVEMBERBUYER                        SELLER                        VALUEACT Networks Inc             Presticom Inc                 $8.7mAdaptec Inc                  Power I/O Corp                    *Alpharel Inc                 Trimco group Plc             $14.7mApplix Inc                   Target Systems Corp             $6mArchitext Software Inc       City.Net                          *Aspect Telecomms Corp        Next Plc (TCS Mgmt Grp)           *BMC Software Inc             Hawknet Inc                       *BMC Software Inc             Peer Networks Inc                 *Cheyenne Software Inc        Chilli Pepper Software Inc        *Comdisco Inc                 NetforceMTI Inc                   *Compaq Computer Corp         NetWorth Inc                  $372mCompuCom Systems Inc         Network Compatibility Grp       $9mConferTech Int'l             LINK-VTC Inc                   $15mConcurrent Computer          Harris Computer Sys Corp          *Conner Peripherals Inc       Furukawa (Stormex div)         $24mDelphi Group Plc             DBI Associates                #0.5mDolphin Interconnect Solns   Kendall Square Research           *Eagle Point Software Corp    Ecom Associates Inc               *EIS International Inc        Surefind Information IncExide Electronics Group      Deltec Power Systems Inc      $195mFranklin Telecom             Alpha-Link                        *Fiserv Inc                   SRS Inc                           *GartnerGroup Inc             Dataquest Inc                  $75mGeneral Signal Corp          Data Switch Corp                  *Global Village Comms Inc     KNX Ltd                           *GRC International            Quintessential Solns Inc        $4mGreenlight Comms Inc         InMedia Software Inc              *Groupe Bull SA               RAK Computer Services             *Hyperion Software Corp       Hyperion S/w Nordic               *Hyundai Electronics Inc      Maxtor Corp                   $220mIntegrated Systems Inc       TakeFive Software Gmbh            *Intuit Inc                   Galt Technologies Inc           $9mLegacy Storage Systems Inc   Rexon Inc                    $20.2mMadge Networks NV            Lannet Data Comm Ltd              *MBO                          ITnet (Cadbury's IT div)     #32.5mMBO                          Time Line Solutions Corp          *McAfee Associates Inc        Assurdata SA                      *McAfee Associates Inc        IPE Ltd                           *McAfee Associates Inc        Kirschbaum Software               *Microsoft Corp               NetWise Inc                       *NetManage Inc                AGE Logic IncNetwork Express Inc          Fivemere Ltd                   $10mOak Technology Inc           Pixel Magic Inc              $10.5mPalm Technology Plc          Radan Business Sys            #2.4mParity Plc                   Software 92 Plc                   *Parity Plc                   Eurosoft Solutions Gmbh           *Parity Plc                   Eurosoft Solutions Sarl           *Platinum Technology Inc      Protosoft                      $40mPolicy Management Sys        Virtual Insurance (Link)          *Racotek Inc                  Business Partner Solns Inc        *Sage Group Plc               Sybel Informatique SA        Fr125mSCS/Compute Inc              RAM Software Inc                  *Sequent Computer Systems     Open Tool International           *Sierra On-Line Inc           SubLogic Inc                      *Softbank Corp                Ziff-Davis Publishing Co     $1.8bnSoftkey International Inc    Minnesota Educ'al Comp        $370mSterling Software Inc        Syncsort Inc (VM prods)           *SunRiver Data Systems        DEC Text Terminal ops             *TMS Inc                      Sequoia Data Corp                 *Unidata Inc                  System Builder Corp               *Xyratex Ltd                  Peer Protocols Inc                *Zenith Data Systems          IPC Corp (France) SA              *MBO = Management buy outPERFORMANCE MONITORThis month's results in the information technology sectorcontinue the trend that has been seen all year, with businessgood across the board. Although certain companies may bestruggling, even companies in the less fashionable sectors arefaring well.This month, one set of figures stands out - computer systemsbuilder Hewlett- Packard announced its fourth quarter and annualrevenues and, once again, enjoyed dramatic growth (see page 47).It is now almost half the size of IBM and is close on the heelsof Fujitsu, the second largest largest supplier of IT equipmentand computers.In personal computers, even the weaker competitors have beenreporting acceptable results this year, as the boom continues.But there are exceptions. AST Research, a long-term survivor inthe PC market, has been having a difficult time for the past 18months, and is beset by manufacturing problems and productdelays. In its latest quarter, AST announced losses of $96million, compared with $39 million for the same quarter lastyear. Revenues fell 19%, as price cuts, a shortage of new modelsand the closure of some divisions took their toll. AST's weaknessenabled the Korean giant Samsung to take a 40% stake in thecompany early this year, for $378 million. To protect itsinvestment, Samsung has now agreed a a $50 million line loan toAST, backing up another $100 million line of credit that AST hasnegotiated with BankAmerica. None of the cash is going into thehands of the management that got the company into this trouble.Three top executives resigned in September, including thepresident, and a fourth, the chief financial officer, has nowdecided to go.Advanced Logic Research, a long-standing rival in the second tierof PC makers, tends to concentrate at the higher end of the PCmarket, but it too is suffering from increasing competition. Forits fourth quarter, revenues increased 12% to $53.4 million, withnet profits of just $2 million. ALR's financial performance isimproving - but its market share is falling and it isunderperforming compared to the market.One PC maker that is most definitely back on track is DellComputer, which announced revenues up 60%, to $1,415 million, andnet profits up 80%, to $75.4 million for its third quarter. Dell,which suffered two years of problems between 1992 and 1994, nowhas a slick product line and is concentrating on itstraditionally successful direct sales channel. Dell said 82% ofits sales are from its higher value Intel Pentium-based machines.One sector that most definitely is booming is Online Services andInternet Tools. As the Internet began to take off, some analystspredicted that suppliers of 'proprietary' online services, suchas America Online (AOL) would suffer; AOL's Steve Case, its chiefexecutive, always argued that AOL, the world's most popularonline service, would thrive as it would be used as a gateway tothe Internet. So far, he is right. AOL is thriving, with firstquarter revenues up 248% to $57 million for the first quarter.However, it made a loss of $10 million because of a $17 millioncharge related to the acquisition of Ubique Inc. AOL, which hasrecently launched in Europe, signed up 700,000 subscribers in thelast quarter, compared with 525,000 who signed up for theMicrosoft Network, a service which many believed would fatallydamage AOL.Another Internet related supplier is Spyglass Inc, the supplierof the original Mosaic browser software. Given the enormouspopularity of Netscape, Spyglass is considered by many to beunderrated. But it is still a small company and, in spite ofalliances with the likes of Oracle, it may never gain thecritical mass needed to make a global impact. Fourth quarterrevenues rose 61% to $3.3 million, bringing the 1995 total to$10.4. Fourth quarter net profits were $1.2 million.Quarterdeck Software, once known for its PC utility software, isin the process of re-engineering itself as a supplier of Internetutility software. For its fourth quarter, revenues increased142%, to $20.3 million, while losses fell from $15.4 million to$0.6 million. Quarterdeck CEO, Gaston Bastiaens, described theimprovement as "a remarkable turnaround". So far, the companyderives 10% of revenues from Internet products, but this islikely to rise fast.One company which has analysts worried is General Magic, one ofthe more glamourous IPOs of 1993. The company, which makesoperating systems and agent-oriented software, is considered tobe vulnerable to the success of Sun's Internet language, Java. Inthe third quarter, sales fell 28% to $3.2 million and losses roseto $5.1 million.COMPANY                                    PERIOD PERIOD REVENUES

Total US ITindustry revenues rose 10.3% to $183.8 billion in 1994, comparedwith world IT growth of 7.5%.US growth has been powered by the PC market, but analysts predicta sharp slowdown in PC sales over the next five years. IDCestimates that 22.6 million PCs will ship in 1995, a rise of20.9% on last year, pushing revenues up 20.0% to $46.4 billion.But in 1999 the market will be worth $67.9 billion, indicatingrevenue growth of only 6.6%, with 36.5 million units shippingthat year, up only 10.3% on 1998.The US software market will rise from $35.2 billion in 1994 to$71.1 billion in 1999 - a growth rate in the "low-to-mid teens".The US LAN hardware and software market will grow by 11% a year,to $15.4 billion by 1998, from $9.1 billion in 1993. US spendingon outsourcing was up 9.4% in 1994 to $63 billion. The overall USservices market is expected to grow to $102 billion by 1998, saysIDC.* The worldwide market for all types of electronics products -computers, mobile phones, video consumer goods, appliances, andso on - will grow by 11.7% this year to $791 billion, predictsmarket analyst Dataquest.

The survey of 189 corporate Internet sites showsthat only 14% of installations use the Internet for producttransactions. IDC says that will rise to 34% next year and to 44%over the next three to five years.The survey of Internet usage shows that, most commonly, corporatesites use the Internet for emailing suppliers and partners (62%),job advertising or seeking (60%), document publishing (56%) andcompetitor research (56%). In five years time, these will stillbe high priority, but they will be joined by the use of theInternet for customer service/technical support (73%).Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996                        SEMICONDUCTORSThe North American book-to-bill ratio, the primary gauge of thehealth of the semiconductor industry, showed a steep rise to 1.18in October, as PC and other electronics product vendors ramped uporders in preparation for the Christmas selling season. TheOctober figure, up from an amended 1.15 in September, took theindex to its highest point since August, according to theSemiconductor Industry Association (SIA).A ratio of 1.18 shows there were $118 of orders (bookings) inOctober for every $100 of products shipped (billings). A book-to-bill ratio of more than 1.0 indicates a positive market trend,because orders are higher than sales. The figures are calculatedusing a three-month moving average and are seasonally adjusted.October bookings rose to $4.9 billion, up 4.4% on September, andwere up 55.7% on the same period last year. Billings increased toan all time high of $4.15 billion, up 37% on October last year.The SIA's forecast for 1995 is that the market will grow 40.2% to$47.1 billion.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996                      PERSONAL COMPUTERSThe PC market worldwide grew by 21% during the third quarter of1995 to reach $11.7 billion with 14.2 million units shipped overthe period, according to market research group Dataquest.The analyst group predicts that the fourth quarter will be thehottest in the history of the personal computer industry as year-long supercharged growth is capped by a Christmas buying frenzy.About 17 million units should be sold in the three months to theend of December, spurred by Europe's continued economic recoveryand strong growth in Japan and the US.During the third quarter, Compaq continued its reign at the topof the industry by shipping 1.5 million units, 265,000 or 21.6%more machines than during the same period last year. This marksits seventh consecutive quarter in the leadership position.However, Compaq found Apple snapping at its heals. During thethree months, Apple's shipments were up 20.5% to 1.3 millionunits, allowing the Macintosh PC supplier to regain the number 2ranking from IBM. Aided by strong seasonal sales into theeducational sector, Apple ended the quarter with an improvedmarket share of 9.0%, up from 7.4% in the second quarter. With agrowth rate of 13.2%, IBM exhibited the slowest pace of the topfive vendors, although it still sells over a third more PCs thanits fast growing nearest challengers, Packard Bell and NEC, whichgrew at 30.5% and 47.9% respectively.* In Europe, Compaq, IBM, Apple, Vobis and Olivetti all sufferedmarket share erosion as relative newcomers to the market Escom,Hewlett-Packard and Siemens-Nixdorf accelerated during the thirdquarter.Compaq's market share at 13.1% was down from 14.1% a yearearlier, and IBM saw a dip in its market share from 9.9% to 9.1%.Germany's Escom pushed Apple into fourth place as its share ofthe market grew from 3.9% to 5.4%. Over the year, Apple lost 1.3%of the market, leaving it with a 5.2% share, while a newly-aggressive Siemens-Nixdorf added 1.3% to reach 5.1% of theEurope-wide market as it rose to take the number one position inthe German personal computer market.Overall, European growth in the third quarter, at 24%, was againmuch stronger than the 10% reported in the equivalent period lastyear.

As you noted, the number ofplayers rushing to deliver client/server applications developmenttools is growing at a rapid rate. As this market develops, Ibelieve the critical factors will be twofold: one, thedevelopment tool's ability to deliver an enterprise-levelsolution to companies with high-end mission criticalrequirements; and two, the ability to deliver real businessbenefits.When organisations are selecting a client/server applicationdevelopment tool, they should look for one that combines the easeof use of a first generation tool with the power and robustnessof a second generation tool. This tool should enable developersto build quickly and easily even the most complex enterprise-level applications with sophisticated logic and datarequirements.Experience is critical in this market, and it is a key reason whyI believe the market landscape is still to be determined. Indiscussion with our customers, we have found that organisationsrequire certain key technologies in order to build enterprise-level second generation applications, including object oriented,team development and configuration management capabilities, aswell as a strong, widely known 4GL-based environment.A second generation tool is clearly more sophisticated and shouldoffer developers not only the ability to quickly build enterpriseclass client/server applications without the need to use a 3GL,but also give the developers the choice of deployment platformswithout changing any code. The key differentiator that usersshould look for is the flexibility to decide the deploymentplatform at develop- ment or deployment.The first generation and second generation applicationdevelopment tools on the market today each meet specific userneeds. It is up to the user to determine their applicationrequirements and to choose a tool that best fits theirenvironment. The players in each generation are battling to bethe biggest and the best and, in most cases, claiming they canoffer an effective solution for both generations. At ProgressSoftware, we are delivering solutions now for enterprise-widesecond generation client/server development with all theessential technologies.Jim BushProgress Software                         Building blocksI read your article on client/server application developmentsoftware, 'Second Generation Tools' (CBR November 1995), withinterest. While we see client/server as the driving force behindcomputer technology in the future, 'second generation' is amisleading term. I think the idea of 'componentware' is moreappropriate.Componentware allows you to build applications by pluggingelements together. Thus, if I want to integrate 'Help' into anapplication, I don't write the code, I just use what is alreadyavailable in Word or Excel. I don't commission 20 programmers towrite me a graphics engine over two years; Microsoft has alreadydone it. I just plug and go. Componentware is revolutionising theway software is delivered.What componentware means is very simple. Applications will bedelivered more quickly, more robustly, more flexibly and withmore functionality. It's simply about plugging discreet modulestogether to create a system. If you get it right, you will beable to plug in new technology as it arrives and unplug oldtechnology with minimum fuss.For example, a recent experience [of ours] showed the power ofcomponentware. A customer wanted to plug into a database theyhadn't used before and it took less than one day. It also meansthe user can drive the delivery of solutions far more than everbefore. [A supplier] cannot seriously consider asking users towait a year or two years for an all-important system. It's notworth worrying about; they probably won't be around if you haveto wait two years anyway. Componentware is the smart way to buildsystems for people who need systems to give them businessadvantage.Tony O'ShaughnessyAlternative Business Solutions                          Hard lessons?I thought your article on Xerox (CBR November 1995) was athorough analysis of where the company has come from and where itstands today. The portrait you paint is of a organisation that isclearly highly successful but which has been complacent aboutexploiting many of its technological innovations. What worries meis that it is possibly about to repeat that mistake again.Xerox's newly-launched all-digital photocopier, the DocumentCentre, may make conventional photocopiers look crude, but whereis the real value for customers in knowing that the copyingprocess has involved digitising the resulting document. UnlessXerox is also selling a complete digital office softwareinfrastructure that can exploit the digitisation of documents,then there will be little perceived value in simply turning thedocument into bits.The document image processing industry knows this scenario onlytoo well. Its initial offerings could scan, OCR and store hugequantities of documents. But it was only when the digitisingprocess of these document was encompassed in a workflow softwareinfrastructure that customers began to perceive that documentimaging was an enabling technology that could make theirbusinesses more efficient. Xerox needs to do a lot more than makethe copier a computer.Cameron WyattIndependent consultantBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996                          BOTTOM LINE                    CLARIFICATIONS & UPDATESIn the article "Second Generation Tools" (CBR November 1995) GeneBedell, chief executive of Seer Technologies, was quoted severaltimes. Unfortunately, we misspelt his name as Bidell.                       NETWORK THE DOGGEDSun Microsystem's new corporate mascot, Network the Dog, agreater Swiss mountain dog, has caused the company some culturaldifficulties. The idea of representing Sun's sometimescomplicated sales message in the form of a friendly dog wasdreamed up by an outside agency. Scott McNealey, Sun's chiefexecutive, overcame his misgivings and followed their advice.But although Network the Dog's appeal to North Americans andEuropeans is obvious, he has not gone down well in China, wheredogs are considered dirty and low. And in the UK, the term "dog"is often used to mean a "dud" or a poor performer (for example,"This network runs like a dog").There are further difficulties: Network the Dog has a crowdedschedule, appearing at exhibitions and the like. But somecountries have strict quarantine regulations, makingintercontinental visits difficult. To overcome this, Sun has beenusing lookalike dogs. This means that if you are offered a photo-opportunity with Network (a big part of Sun's campaign) outsidethe western side of the US, the chances are that you will bephotographed with a Network emulator.                           AGED JOKESThe old East Coast high-tech industries, typified by companiessuch as IBM and Digital Equipment, are starting to become thebutt of some self-deprecating humour. First, there was Digital'smove out of its old headquarters, the Boston Mill. The buildingwas sold to an old people's home, it was said, so that they didnot have to move too many people out. Meanwhile, at Xerox's hightech offices in Stamford, Connecticut, the environmentallyconscious company has installed lights that turn themselves offwhen there is no movement. In the offices of certain seniormanagers, it is said, the rooms frequently darken during theafternoon.                            HOMELESSDigital Equipment has downsized so fast in some countries thatstaff formed "DEC ex-employee" groups, partly to provide mutualsupport and partly to reminisce about the days when Digitalexpected to overtake IBM as the world's largest and mostprofitable computer company. In France, Digital's ex-employeegroup has a reported 1,700 members. Of these, two are nowofficially homeless.                         VIOLENT PIRATESSoftware piracy is viewed as a harmless and relatively victimlessoffence, in spite of the efforts of the Software PublishersAssociation and the Business Software Alliance to portray it as apractice that is crippling the industry. In fact, some analystseven think that some suppliers approve of a certain level ofpiracy because it draws in new users. But all this, it seems, maybe about to change.According to recent reports, criminal gangs are moving intosoftware copying - perhaps encouraged by their success instealing and re-selling processor and memory chips. When policerecently raided the Los Angeles address of alleged pirate ThomasAlefantes, they found $1 million of copied software, computers,high speed disk copiers, label printers, shredders, a pair ofhandcuffs (?) and two guns. Earlier this year police raidedanother gang's premises, where they found 40,000 softwareprograms ready to ship, along with explosives and guns.Discoveries of this kind are said to be delighting the SPA, whichis now able to publicise software piracy as a real crime.                         SUPER-SURVIVORSShortly after our article on supercomputers (CBR, November 1995),which outlined the recent success of IBM's RS/6000 SPsupercomputer and the problems being suffered by smallersuppliers, market analysts IDC published a report outliningEuropean sales of the leading vendors. IDC echoes the view thatsome of the smaller vendors will not survive, and pinpointed theBritish owned company Meiko as particularly vulnerable.Meiko's 1995 European sales, IDC notes, were about the same asnCube's, the company owned by Oracle founder Larry Ellison's, atjust $8 million. NCube, as reported in CBR (August 1995), is alsothought to be suffering from a slowdown in sales. RS/6000 SPsales are expected to be $75 million.There was good news for one minor vendor last month: ThinkingMachines, which went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protectionearlier this year, has put together a rescue plan which involvesreselling software and designing systems based on the UltraSparc.Sun Microsystems will recommend the systems to its customers, butwill not directly resell them. The plan brings into questionSun's relationship with another troubled vendor, Cray Research,whose system it currently resells.                         EDUCATION BOOSTBritish educational software company SIR intends to float on thenew AIM (Alternative Investment Market) in the UK early in 1996,say insiders at the company, rather than list on Nasdaq in theUS.Although SIR is 30% held by the San Jose-based venture capitalcompany Berg & Berg, the UK market is favoured partly forpolitical reasons - both the Conservative and Labour parties wantto be seen to boost education in the run-up to a 1996/7 election,and both are expected to announce grants or tax breaks for moreIT spending in schools. Both parties have been looking for co-operative agreements like the recently announced BT/Labour partyplan. Under this agreement, BT has agreed to put publicorganisations "onto the information superhighway" if it isallowed to offer services. SIR, which is barely into profit, saysthis is boosting the value of educational IT suppliers. ResearchMachines, a leading supplier of computers to British schools, hasa remarkably healthy share price, in spite of poor results.Back to Headline List WT03-B31-20IA059-000323-B010-164http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec101.html 205.156.212.5 19970114214422 text/html 104701HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:41:41 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:29 GMTContent-length: 104513Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec101.html Sample Issue Copyright COMPUTER FINANCE via NewsNet January 01, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES UNDERSTANDING MIDDLEWARE ECONOMICS (3809 words) IBM MAINFRAME VALUES CONTINUE DECLINE (2479 words) DESKTOP COMPUTING: ASSET OR OVERHEAD? (3902 words) DATA WAREHOUSE PROJECT ECONOMICS: I (4807 words) NEWS ANALYSIS (791 words) CopyrightCOMPUTER FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996              UNDERSTANDING MIDDLEWARE ECONOMICSIn trying to understand the economics of client-server systems,we can break them down into the client, the server, andeverything in between. This is the domain of 'middleware',described as the dividing line in client-server, perhaps the mostdifficult aspect to assess - both technically and financially.Middleware is the software that no-one notices and nobody wantsto pay for. After all, middleware is not the client-serversoftware that end-users interact with every day on their desktopscreens.It is unobtrusive, operating quietly behind the scenes. Ifmiddleware is noticed at any time, it is usually because it hasfailed in some way.In a way, it is software infrastructure and, like the socialinfrastructure of roads, bridges, water pipes, sewers and railwaytracks, it is unglamorous and too often neglected. Yet expertsfrom the likes of IBM and the Gartner Group insist that thesecret to client-server success is to plan ahead and build anenterprise middleware infrastructure before launching intoindividual projects.If this is true, it should be possible to find some way ofarticulating the benefits of middleware in conventionalaccounting terms.                  ACTIVITY-BASED COSTS ANALYSISA recent White Paper from specialists at the Chicago-basedmiddleware software firm of Covia Technologies links theacquisition of middleware with the novel accounting techniqueknown as Activity-Based Costing, or ABC (see Computer FinanceApril 1995).Covia's argument starts with something so simple that everyonecan agree on it:                    Revenue - Costs = ProfitsWhich can be broken down a little further, to arrive at:  (Quantity of Sales x Market Price) - (Variable Costs + Fixed                        Costs) = ProfitsCovia contends that this provides a framework within which thecost-benefit impact of a middleware solution could be determined.It is an approach that is conceptually simple, but very difficultto implement. The goal is to account for middleware investmentsat a detailed business level and to leave no items unaccountedfor as 'unallocated overhead' or 'unallocated revenue'. Thismeans it is necessary to ask such questions as:* Quantity of sales - how will the middleware solution affect thecompany's ability to increase sales turnover?* Market price - will the middleware solution cause customers toincrease their perception of the value of the company's products?* Variable costs - is the net effect an overall decrease inbusiness operation costs?* Fixed costs - does the middleware solution contribute toreducing fixed costs (perhaps in the form of obsolete assets)?Traditional cost accounting methods are prone to miss some of theless tangible cost-reduction effects of distributed softwaretechnology, while accurately identifying the upfront costs.According to Covia, a full analysis must transcend the obviousand extend the cost-benefit analysis as follows:* Staff. A distributed computer system affects how people dotheir work, the ways in which they cooperate, and the skills andexpertise they require. The best analysis of this impact viewspeople as company assets and capitalises the investment in them.Amortising this investment over time recognises that investmentin staff has a finite lifetime.* Resources. The client-server infrastructure, which includesmiddleware, determines how easy or difficult it is to provideapplications and make them work together. These applications,when properly utilised, can have significant impact on resourcessuch as capital, raw materials - and above all, intellectualproperty.* Methods and technology. Distributed systems can contribute toimproving the methods and technology used to create products, andsell and deliver them to customers.* Systems, processes, and policies. Distributed computing has thepotential to transform a company's communications, workflow andmanagement style. Appropriate middleware can automate the processof carrying a document to all who must deal with it, promptingthose that handle it to do so within a specified time frame. Thisis why BPR almost always employs IT (notably workflow andgroupware products) as a tool.* Structure and organisation. Even the physical layout of anorganisation can be radically improved through the introductionof distributed computing. There is no longer a pressing need forstaff to congregate in or around meeting rooms, filing cabinetsand managers' offices. Taken to the limit, this logic embracesthe possibility of teleworking or mobile computing.* Facilities. The distributed computing infrastructure becomespart of the facilities, i.e. the physical assets required tohouse and support business operations.* Product. All the ways in which the distributed system affectsproduct (and service) definition, costs and saleability need tobe examined.* Marketplace. Distributed computing has obvious potential fordirectly supporting innovative marketing techniques such asdatabase marketing and telesales.But how can the finances of middleware be charted when thebeneficial effects of distributed computing is proving sodifficult to measure? Analysts cannot even agree whether client-server computing is cheaper, or more expensive, than moretraditional computing approaches.The trick is to find a way of accounting for all the costs andall the benefits, not just the obvious ones. Covia suggests thatan Activity-Based Costing analysis of the acquisition of amiddleware infrastructure should help tease out the many costs,benefits and savings hidden in client-server implementation.                       ADDING UP THE BILLA first step is to develop what is referred to as a 'bill ofmaterials', which leads on to a 'bill of activities'. The bill ofmaterials lists all the components needed for a finished product,the quantity required and the cost of each component. By analogy,the bill of activities is defined as a listing of all theactivities associated with some business task, and their cost.In theory the total cost of any business process can be found byadding up the total costs of the BoMs and BoAs of all itsconstituent activities: simple examples of a BoM and a BoA aregiven in Tables 1 and 2 - the specific currency is academic.A similar listing to the one shown in Table 1 would need to bebuilt up in favour of middleware implementation. The influence ofdeveloping a client-server architecture with - and without -middleware could then be explored, constructing BoAs to determinethe extent of that influence on the cost of key businessoperations.This all sound fine. In practice, however, ABC involves a greatdeal of spade work to extract the necessary financial andbusiness information. In particular, the source of much of thedetail need to raise BoAs may not be immediately apparent, thoughCovia identifies numerous activities where the use of middlewaremight be expected to contribute to improved business operations:* Staff. People become more productive. Developers produce newapplications sooner, with fewer defects. End-users have betteraccess to data and enjoy better communications with remote co-workers. Under the right circumstances, they can feel empowered,which motivates them to take more responsibility and initiative.* Methods and technology. Middleware decouples IT from directdependence on specific networking technology. It becomes quickerand easier to take advantage of new technology.For instance, an organisation employing DCE or MOM (more on thislater) would find it much easier to migrate from TCP/IP to ATMthan if TCP/IP dependencies were written into the code of all itsapplications. In a typical case, the savings might amount to twoprogrammer-years of effort, which could add up to as much as#100,000. However, the delay itself might cost the business farmore.Good middleware helps to avoid pathological delays in processingwork items. Different parts of the organisation are enabled towork together and share ideas - although this may meet withdetermined resistance from those with a vested interest in thetraditional scheme of things.Middleware can also lower the barriers which currently frustratethe attempt to cut IT budgets by replacing older proprietarycomputers with modern PCs and servers which are much cheaper interms of raw processing power. Many so-called downsizing attemptshave backfired badly for a number of reasons, including:* Shortage of skilled programmers and operators.* Lack of systems management software.* The sheer difficulty of reliably connecting the heterogeneous'open systems' machines together.* Inability to make the 'open systems' machines communicate withmainframes, AS/400s and VAXes.Middleware addresses all four of these problem areas. Italleviates the shortage of skilled networking programmers, andits relevance to the last three areas is obvious.* Systems, processes and policies. BPR usually requires the rapidinstallation of distributed IT systems to support new processes.Middleware cuts the cost of creating these new systems, as wellas reducing the time to delivery.This cost reduction should be reflected in the ABC Bill ofActivities for the business process. As noted earlier, staff areempowered to get things done rapidly, without waiting forinformation or approval. Islands of automation can be united,resulting in better information sharing. As a result, 'slack'time can be cut out of business processes. (Anyone familiar withproject management methods will probably see a parallel with themanipulation of task schedules in order to find the shortestcritical path.)As an example of how a technical refinement can result indistinct business benefits, consider the choice betweensynchronous and asynchronous middleware. With the synchronousmodel, a client computer invokes a server, and waits until itgets a reply. Suppose the server, in turn, has to seek assistancefrom another server. Serious delays may ensue, while a customerservice representative or the managing director's secretarystares at a locked screen.Asynchronous middleware, in contrast, sets the client machinefree to get on with other tasks while it waits for a reply. Areduction in time to process each call of just 10% can make allthe difference between a customer service centre that is busy buton top of its work, and one where phones ring endlessly, queuesget longer, and disgruntled customers hang up to seek a moreresponsive supplier.* Structure and organisation. There is a marked trend forbusinesses to reorganise frequently, in order to remain flexibleand responsive to market conditions. This is often accompanied bya reduction in staff numbers with each having to accomplish more.Distributed IT systems are one of several prerequisites forsuccessful reorganisation.To take an example from the banking industry, more and morecustomers are enjoying the benefits of telephone banking. Thesepeople perceive that they are getting a far higher level ofservice than that delivered by the traditional bank branch. Thecustomer can ring up at any time - 24 hours a day, 365 days ayear - and is immediately able to query account and transactiondetails, transfer funds, or to arrange to pay bills.The contrast with a traditional branch office is overwhelming -the customer must travel to a fixed place, within fairly limitedworking hours, and must then queue for an audience with a busyclerk who usually does not have access to all the necessaryinformation. Modern middleware is essential for building the ITsupport that allows service representatives to handle customersby doing whatever they want without delay.Improvements in wide area network (WAN) technology are such thatwithin a few years geographically separated teams will be able towork together as conveniently as colleagues using Windows forWorkgroups in the same office today. This will bring substantialsavings, in reduced travel costs and will allow the bestavailable people to be assigned to a project regardless ofphysical location, which will often mean that the projects canstart sooner.                      MAKING MIDDLEWARE PAYHoliday Inns Worldwide recently used middleware from a small USsupplier, Mitem, to put together a new distributed worldwidereservation system in six months. This application has alreadydelivered measurable business benefits. For instance:* Confirmation rates up 5-10%.* Revenue per agent hour up 15-20%.* Average call handling time reduced by 10-20 seconds.* Training time reduced by 60%.* Lower operating costs.* Greater flexibility and ease of modification.Holiday Inns Worldwide, which is owned by Bass, operates morethan 1,800 hotels with 340,000 rooms in over 50 countries. Its 14central reservation offices provide 30-40% of a franchisedhotel's occupancy, and handle over 23 million calls a year -twice the call volume of any other reservation service. Herman(Holiday Inn Expert Reservation Manager) supports 1,800reservation sale agents worldwide, who use 765 Apple PowerMacintosh clients to log over 60,000 calls each day.Annual cost savings are estimated to be in the tens of millionsof dollars, based on a 10-15% productivity improvement in abusiness which turns over more than $1.3 billion a year.Holiday Inns already had a very efficient reservations systemknown as Holidex, which ran under IBM's Transaction ProcessingFacility (TPF). Since the user interface was complex and non-intuitive, it was decided to keep the mainframe and add a GUIfront end. However, a client and a server do not add up to aclient-server system: middleware was needed to bridge the gapbetween the very different worlds of Macintosh and mainframe.To write the connectivity layer in C++ would have required toomuch programming. MitemView gave Holiday Inns the GUI to screenmapping it needed through a message-passing approach and appearedto have a much shorter time to implement.In April 1994 Herman was tested with 100 clients at Holiday Inn'sCentral Reservation Office in Amsterdam. Production use startedin June 1994. Power Macintosh clients retrieve data throughMitemView, both locally from Sybase database servers and remotelyfrom the Holidex mainframe. Effectively, Herman takes theprocessing away from the mainframe and distributes both theprocessing and the database locally.This is distributed computing fully taking advantage of eachplatform - the mainframe doing what it does best, and the desktopcomputer taking full advantage of its capabilities. The aim is toreduce the communications costs for the reservations application,because the agent can be 40 seconds into a call before the firstentry goes back to the mainframe for inventory.The productivity gains arise from the more intuitive nature ofthe GUI, together with the system's ability to gather informationfrom different sources without end-user intervention. Forinstance, agents no longer have to memorise the 12,000-plusindustry-standard command codes used to sell a room; instead,they simply click on an icon and the required information appearson screen.                     LIFE WITHOUT MIDDLEWAREIn sharp contrast to the experiences of Holiday Inns, developingdistributed applications without middleware can be slow,difficult and expensive. Most notably, it requires the servicesof specialised network programmers. They have to work at a lowlevel of abstraction, coding to native protocol stack functionsor even at the 'wire' level. This is quite expensive. In Table 3,a comparison is made between the cost of client-serverdevelopment with and without middleware. Figure 1 on page 6 showsthis graphically, as a summation of the annual costs over time.The reason for the difference in staff expenses is quite simple.In general, the greater the degree of skill, the fewer the peoplewho possess it. There are millions of 4GL and visual programmers,competent to build standalone PC applications. There are hundredsof thousands of capable 3GL programmers. However, there are veryfew who are highly skilled in network programming, and theynaturally command high salaries. Some estimates indicate thatthis group is less than 1% of the total pool of programmers.Worse, any reasonably large and complicated system is likely toundergo frequent changes, as computers are added and removed,departments come and go, new applications are added, and so on.Each of these changes will require modifications to the networkhandling routines. Yet the more they are changed, the less likelythey are to work reliably and consistently. Writing networksoftware is a very complicated and specialised job, and only asmall minority of programmers have the training to do it.Middleware automatically handles this, the hardest and mosterror-prone part of building a client-server system.In doing so middleware, which essentially consists of pre-writtenand tested networking routines, makes the applicationprogrammers' task much simpler, and allows them to concentrate onsolving business problems.There are several different classes of middleware optionsavailable:* Remote procedure calls allow a routine running on one computerto call a routine on another computer, exactly as if they wereboth part of the same program.* Remote data access software is a specialised form of middlewarewhich passes commands to remote databases. The commands usuallytake the form of SQL, the relational database query language.* OSF DCE, the Open Software Foundation's Distributed ComputingEnvironment is a middleware suite which includes RPC, and addsdirectory, time, and security services. It also includes a'threads' package which allows applications to do severaldifferent things at once - so that a server can handle more thanone request at a time, for instance.* Message oriented middleware (MOM) makes it easy for anapplication to cooperate with applications on remote computers,even if it does not know where they are or even whether they arerunning. If RPC and remote data access are like a telephone call,MOM is like a fax or letter - the sender can 'fire and forget'.* Object request brokers (ORBs) work at a still more abstractlevel. Conceptually, an ORB is simply a means for one object tosend messages to other objects, without caring where they are. Sofar, it sounds like MOM. The main practical difference is thatmessages sent using MOM must be retrieved from a queue by therecipient, whereas an ORB finds and activates appropriate objectsto carry out whatever tasks a client demands. This is a far moreflexible way of working.* Distributed transaction processing monitors help to make surethat the end-user gets good service, by delivering fast responsetimes to large numbers of users, and making sure that eachtransaction is either completed or rolled back.There are products which automatically generate some or all ofthe middleware required for a given client-server system. Thesetools, which include Template Software's SNAP, Open EnvironmentCorporation's Entera, Hitachi's Distributed Object IQ andIntellicorp's Kappa, are relatively expensive, however. Thatsaid, the cost of acquiring them is outweighed by the savings ondevelopment and testing time. The resulting systems are usuallymore efficient and reliable, too.                      THE MIDDLEWARE APPEALSo middleware is a way of reusing software, with all the benefitsreuse can bring if it is practised sensibly. But middleware is arelatively new idea, and innovation - no matter how beneficial -always encounters spirited resistance from those who areuncomfortable with change. Consequently, it can be quitedifficult to sell the idea of middleware product acquisition.Technically of course, middleware has several practicaladvantages over native network programming:* It takes care of all the network control internally, leavingthe application programmer to cope with relatively simpleinterfaces. Message oriented middleware (MOM) is best in thisregard. One application 'posts' a message to a given mailboxaddress, and another application collects it on arrival. Themiddleware functions as a 'post office' in between; theapplication programmer need not care whether the message wastransmitted over copper wire, microwave or wet string.* It provides many extra services, such as guaranteed deliveryeven if the receiving computer or part of the network shouldfail. Some products offer sophisticated options such as 'deliveronce and once only', which is invaluable for transactions likedebiting a bank account, where it is essential that it be done,but equally important that it should not be repeated.* The middleware supplier takes responsibility for support andmaintenance, leaving the applications programmer free toconcentrate on solving the company's business problems. Some MOMusers have indicated that the use of middleware much increasesdevelopment productivity - it has been known to double. Testingcosts are also significantly less. Finally, fewer staff areneeded to complete a given project.* Consequently the need for specialised networking programmers ismuch reduced, or even completely eliminated. The salary bill andtraining costs can be much reduced, and there is less need totrack developments in networking technology closely - thatbecomes the job of the middleware vendor.* Some forms of middleware are standardised, making it possibleto switch suppliers should the incumbent fail, or proveunsatisfactory.It is normal for vendors to claim that their products can deliverhuge benefits, often given spurious authenticity by citingsimplistic calculations, resulting in large cost savings. Thisbehaviour is part of the background noise of the marketplace, andbuyers usually tune it out without thinking. With middleware, theadmittedly increased IT costs are sometimes more than offset bydecreasing costs elsewhere. If this 'elsewhere' is at thecustomer front line, where the company makes its profits, thenthe incremental IT investment may well be justified.Table 1.

It is predicted that the future residual values ofall new and used machines will take quite a battering in thecoming two quarters.Mainframe values continued to decline rapidly over the last sixmonths of 1995, both for new machines and for used ones. This ismainly because of the effect of IBM's new 9672 CMOS mainframes,which have been priced by IBM to give better price-performancethan the 9021s, and are at the same time cheaper to run.The 9672s offer two principal economic benefits over theirbipolar predecessors that are helping to drive down the values ofthe older machines.The much improved environmentals of CMOS (lower cooling and lessheat dissipation) mean lower running costs, but also improvedreliability which leads to very much lower maintenance costs.In addition, these systems attract lower software licensing costsbecause of their ability to participate in PSLC (Parallel SysplexLicence Charging).Together, these cost benefits have allowed IBM to claim thatusers replacing their 3090s with a new 9672 can recoup thepurchase price within two years on the savings they make.                     CHEAPER PROCESSOR POWERThe first generation 9672s, announced in September 1994, werebuilt from System 390 microprocessors, with the R11 uniprocessorhaving a performance rating of around 14 MIPS. The maximum R61system has six processors and is rated at around 60 MIPS.IBM has not, of course, published a price list for these systems,either here or in the US.Reports from the field suggest that these Rx1 systems wereoriginally priced at a little under #14,000 per MIPS - say around#13,750 - for a base configuration. One has to treat this figurewith caution, however, as very few systems are sold with thebasic configuration (which is just 128Mb of main memory and threechannels). So this may be an over-estimate.However, that #13,750 figure was about 25% below the typicalselling price for an H5 bipolar mainframe at the time, which wasaround #18,500 per MIPS.Historically, this is the first time that IBM has priced a newgeneration of mainframes at a lower price-performance than itspredecessor. Typically the pricing has been greater than on thepredecessor range, to allow the company to build up productionwithout being swamped by the demand.The second generation 9672s were announced in June, with firstdeliveries in the third quarter. They employ developedmicroprocessors that are about 60% more powerful. The R21 entry-level model is rated at around 21 MIPS, while the top Rx3 model,with 10 processors, is at around 160 MIPS.Market research company Xephon published its estimated prices forthese models in the August 1995 issue of its Insight IS magazine.Its pricing suggests a range from $18,000 per MIPS at the bottomend to $16,000 at the top, with an average across all models of$16,800. Using a conversion rate of #1 to $1.40, this translatesto around #12,000 per MIPS.If we accept the #13,750 figure as a typical initial sellingprice for an Rx1, and the corresponding #12,000 figure for thesecond generation models, then prices fell over the currentlifetime of the 9672-Rx1s at a rate of around 20% per yearcompound.This is significantly less than the general rate of improvementin the price-performance of the technology, which most analystsput at around 30%.                   LOWER PRICING DRIVES COSTSSurprisingly, IBM's pricing of H5 mainframes fell by a greateramount over the same period, in fact by around that 30% rate.This is surprising because the rate of improvement in the cost ofthe basic bipolar technology is only supposed to be around 15% -it is because it is so much less than CMOS that IBM (and everyother mainframe vendor other than Hitachi) has bet its mainframefuture on CMOS.Another surprise is that the fall is even across the range - evenup to the most powerful models, which have as yet no CMOSequivalent.As a result, a typical H5 selling price in June 1995 had comedown to a little over #14,000 per MIPS. This reduced thedifferential between the price-performance of new bipolar and newCMOS mainframes to 15%.Over the past six months, the differential has continued to fall,though at a slightly slower rate: it now stands at around 13%.Prices for new bipolar mainframes are still falling at around thesame 30% annual rate, and are currently only just over #12,000per MIPS. CMOS prices have also fallen over this period, andbrokers at Econocom estimate that the current price is around#10,000 per MIPS.The inference is that H5 prices will continue to fall at agreater rate than 9672 prices until the two are in line.These falls in the new prices have naturally had their effect onused prices. Reliable data on the going rates for used 9672s isnot yet available: few have come onto the market, and those thathave are configured with different memory and channel options.According to Econocom, software and maintenance charges are oftenbundled into the prices as well, which makes it difficult to tellexactly what the pure hardware cost is.This is likely to become increasingly the case with mainframes:now that the hardware is so cheap, software necessarily accountsfor an increasingly large part of the running costs.                   SOFTWARE LICENCE ECONOMIESWe have already seen this in the PC world, where licence costsoften come to more than the price of the hardware. The same wastrue with used 3090s during the height of the recession.An implication here is that software pricing should continue tocome down. IBM has already come under great pressure from itscustomers to reduce software prices to the level of Unix-basedsoftware, which means a reduction of around a half from the pre-usage-based pricing level.IBM executives have been consistently claiming since then thatits pricing is fair, while at the same time steadily reducing it.Usage-based pricing, announced in April 1994, has been estimatedto cut a typical customer's bill by 5% to 10%.That was a small step: the next one was much larger. Parallelsysplex charging (PSLC-E) was introduced with the 9672-Rx1 inSeptember of that year, and IBM claims it can cut bills by asmuch as 25%.The latest development has been the announcement of the newOS/390 operating system in October. OS/390 will not be delivereduntil later in the current quarter, and the price list for thenew software had not at the time of writing been finalised, so nodefinite information about the savings to be made here is yetavailable. IBM has only promised officially that the price willbe less than the sum of the component parts.It seems possible that it will be quite a bit less. The AnnexBulletin has estimated that OS/390 will cost about 10% to 15%less than the sum of the individual components. Senior IBMexecutives are privately being even more bullish, quoting figuresin the 30% to 40% range. (For most users, who will not be runningall the 30 utilities included as standard in OS/390, the actualsaving will be less, but for the vast majority it is still goingto be significant.)Whatever the saving is, customers can add it to the savings thatcan be made by adopting MULC (usage-based pricing) and PSLC/E.IBM has in fact delivered substantial software savings to itsmainframe users over the past couple of years, to the point whereUnix software no longer seems ridiculously cheap.                      USED MARKET DYNAMICSReverting to the used market, H5s are now freely available threeyears after the first deliveries (though they have been availablein reasonable quantity on the used market for less than a year).Prices have fallen to around 20% of their original selling price,and are now in the range #6,500 to #8,000 per MIPS (apart fromthe 9x2, which is considerably more expensive).For example, an entry-level 61 MIPS 9021-711 currently fetchesaround #450,000, or #7,300 per MIPS. The three processor 169 MIPSmodel 831 commands around #1.25 million, or #6,500 per MIPS.These prices are considerably lower than they were in the summer.At that time Econocom priced a 711 at #850,000 and an 831 at #2million (see Table 1). So the 711 has lost half its residualvalue in six months, the 831 40% of its value.We noted in our last report (Computer Finance, August 1995 page7) that used H5s then looked overpriced. H5s came onto the marketat the beginning of 1995 at a price of around #13,000 per MIPS -not far below IBM's typical average selling price at the time.They more or less held that value through into the summer, whichmeant that lifetime depreciation was running at less than 40% ayear, compared to over 50% depreciation in new mainframe pricesgenerally over that period.It also meant that they were priced at virtually the same as thecost of a new model from IBM.The current pricing is much more reasonable, at around 35% to 45%off the pricing of new systems from IBM. This is about the samediscount as the second generation of the previous range, the3090Es, offered at the same stage of their life cycle.The top-of-the-range 9021-9X2 is substantially more expensivethan all the other models. As Table 2 shows, Econocom is quotinga price of around #4.5 million, which works out at around #9,400per MIPS, and is down by 35% since the summer.                   CUT PRICE MAINFRAME MODELSUsed models of the predecessor H2 range (the first generationSummit machines) are now down to below 10% of their initialselling prices. Typical pricing is around #5,000 per MIPS,offering a discount of well over half on the price of a new H5.For example, the 47 MIPS entry-level 9021-520 now fetches around#250,000, or #5,200 per MIPS. The top-of-the-range 248 MIPS model900 has very similar price-performance at its current used priceof #1.3 million.These prices too have fallen dramatically since the summer, evenmore so than the H5s. At that point Econocom valued the 520 at#550,000 and the 900 at #2.35 million. So the depreciation inresidual value has been 55% for the 520 and 45% for the 900.The H0s (340-based) 9021s have now fallen well below #1,000 perMIPS, and essentially have no value other than their frames andenvironmentals. These systems can be upgraded to later 9021s, buttheir 3090J-type logic circuitry is now worthless.The only residual value left in the 3090Js themselves is in thememory and channels, which can be used to upgrade other users'machines.If we assume that IBM reduces prices of large H5s by thetraditional 15% or so per year from now on (rather than the 30%we have actually been seeing over the past six months), and alsothat it passes on the 30% pricing improvement in its CMOS modelsthat the technology allows, then residual values of H2s and H5sshould develop in the manner shown in Tables 3 to 5.                     RESIDUAL SLUMP FORECASTThe immediate conclusion to be drawn from these projections arethat prices will continue to fall at a much steeper rate than inthe past, both on traditional bipolar mainframes and even more soon the CMOS systems.Indeed, the tables may well over-estimate future residuals.Sievers Consulting is forecasting that the H2 market 'is expectedto collapse' around now.The consultancy argues that IBM could decide to clear its stocksof H2s that it has accumulated as a result of H2 to H5 upgrades,just as it did with 3090Js towards the end of 1994.Prices are certainly falling rapidly, as we have noted, but thereis no sign of total collapse as yet. H2s are better placed than3090Js, as they can be upgraded to H5s.As far as the newer systems are concerned, the 30% annual fall inthe price per MIPS of CMOS systems should mean that today's 9672pricing of #10,000 per MIPS should decline to #8,500 by themiddle of next year (roughly when we should expect the nextgeneration), to under #6,000 by mid-1997 and to around #4,000 bymid-1998.The effect on the residual values of used models is shown in thetables.The adoption of commodity technology in mainframes means PC-typepricing considerations now apply to mainframes: lower initialpricing, but faster depreciation and faster obsolescence. *Table 1.

The optimal way to gainthis support is by demonstrating productivity improvements, costand risk reductions, and generally making life easier for IS andend-users.Although there would appear to be a slow realisation that movesare needed to improve control over distributed computing assets,there seems to be a general sense of uncertainty about where tostart and how to proceed with desktop asset management.There is a clear need to curb runaway desktop spending. Evenduring recession capital investment on IT remained at 1% to 2% ofturnover, depending on sector. And nowadays, the value of desktopassets is slowly nudging ahead of the installed base ofcentralised assets, with up to 70% of all investments going ondistributed technology. Yet the very sites that have spent time,effort and money putting together tight and sophisticatedmainframe asset management practices would be hard pressed toshow anything comparable for their PC-LAN and internetworkinginvestments.                   ASSET MANAGEMENT HESITATIONIn their defence, such organisations would claim that one of theproblems is that there is no single solution for enterprise-wideasset management.This starts to explain the general level of hesitancy towardsimplementation of an asset management policy. The market isactually very fragmented and offers a multitude of point-solutionproducts that address many different aspects of asset control.In some senses there is a genuine need for point solutions: thereis said to be as many as 80,000 different desktop assets whichcan be applied in different combinations across the enterprise ondepartmental servers, across local area networks or standalonedesktops, so tracking them is going to be difficult withspecialist tools. In this light, there is perhaps no choice butto adopt a broad spread of highly specific toolsets, taking in:* Desktop utilities.* PC audit packages.* Licence management suites.* Software metering software.* Configuration management, software release and version controlroutines.* Network monitoring consoles and remote LAN management systems.* Helpdesk suites.* Chargeback schemes.Asset management involves a whole lot more than counting PCs. Aphysical inventory check and software asset audit is only thebeginning, and is viewed as just a small first step toestablishing best practice for hardware and software orderfulfilment, asset administration, licence tracking, technologyrefresh and a range of other functions such as reconciliation ofbook values, accounts consolidation and the like, that stretchwell into mainstream corporate financial management.It also means tracing asset histories across highly distributedsystems, across disparate departments and end-user groups - oftenwith devolved budgets. The time-costs alone, can be quiteconsiderable. In fact, asset checks can lead to other, unexpectedcosts, as well.Some IT managers admit to having so far dodged the development ofan asset management strategy chiefly because of concerns aboutjust what they are likely to find once they start scrutinisingthe composition of their desktop assets. It is an aspect whichcould be described as the 'desktop legacy'. According to researchcarried out by consultants KPMG, the vast proportion of corporatePCs are incapable of running modern desktop applications: 50%having less than 4Mb memory. This makes for a considerable latentdemand for capital expenditure before full advantage could bemade of memory-hungry 32-bit applications and latest operatingsystems. Moreover, it is estimated that 40% of the corporate PCsin the UK are still not connected to the central network.To add to the anxiety, there are mounting concerns about theescalating cost of ownership of desktop assets, particularly overthe 'hidden' or so-called 'soft costs' of PC operation and end-user support. According to Gartner, PC administrative costsnearly quadrupled in the five years between 1987 and 1993.                     AN AUDIT STARTING POINTIn many ways there is a need to rationalise the existing assetbase before it is possible to begin to actively manage thedesktop computing complement.There is a need to kick off with an audit. As Table 1 indicates,that in itself does not run to a great expense. At around #30 perPC it is no great cost, but this is only an initial down-payment.Although it is a good starting point, put in to properperspective, an asset audit has to be thought of as a first movein a logical progression towards a point where softwaredistribution is automated, software licences are actively managedand asset use accurately charted. A full-blown asset managementstrategy could set an organisation back as much as #100,000 justin setting up a dedicated asset management database.In this context, it starts to become necessary to map out andquantify the benefits as well as the costs associated with assetmanagement. These centre on three principal areas:* Reduced risk of software violations through improved licencecompliance.* Reduced software licence costs by moving to metered softwareuse and the purchase of concurrent licences.* Reduced cost of ownership through better management of theasset base.There is a history of poor licence management on two fronts.Yorkshire & Humberside Training Services, GEC Alsthom Low VoltageEquipment, London Borough of Tower Hamlets and Cow & GateNutricia are just a few of the corporations to have been pursuedby FAST, the Federation Against Software Theft over improper useof desktop software licences.All the cases were settled out of court, though each firm musthave incurred at least some costs re-licensing all the illegalversions that were found to be running.An indication of the actual cost of licence violations comes fromthe US Software Publishers Association, which reports that itrecords roughly 250 cases a year of licence infringements leadingto costs of $100,000 on average, per violation.In some cases, there is a history also, of overlicensing. Whenone organisation upgraded 100 PCs with new desktop software itnegotiated for $200,000 worth of networked applications forconcurrent access by its 100 end-users.However, when later it moved to meter the use of its newapplications it found that at peak use, one of the new programswas used by only 65 end-users and another by no more than 30 orso end-users at any one time.In overlicensing, it had overspent by as much as $115,000.                     ASSET MANAGEMENT APPEALIn a White Paper being circulated by Canadian asset managementspecialist Asset Software International on The Case for AssetManagement, the point is made that, as self-evident as thissounds, the trick to developing an effective asset managementpolicy lies in achieving two goals: maximising the use of assetsto produce revenue while minimising overall costs.It goes on to demonstrate ten ways to improve ROI with assetmanagement. Its suggestions include:1. Server/licence consolidation and rationalisation.ASI confirms that the biggest immediate return from IT assetmanagement is an analysis of software licensing in order torationalise on-going licence fees and software maintenance. Thisis occurring on two levels: network operating systems andapplication licensing.Two major changes in the NOS environment have lead toopportunities for significant cost reduction. First, the hardwareon which these servers operate have become increasingly powerful,allowing fewer boxes to support more users. Secondly, thelicensing model has changed from fixed increment purchase (50user, 100 user, 250 user and so on) to exact per-user pricing.Both changes allow significant cost reductions, both in newprocurement and in ongoing maintenance and support costs.Some of the issues are similar for application programs(consolidating many licences onto fewer boxes) but applicationshave some additional twists. Many programs (especially thoserunning on a large server environment) are still priced accordingto a platform tiered model.ASI cites one case where use of its AssetPRO asset managementdatabase led to its client achieving a six-figure saving on RDBMSlicence maintenance fees by short-circuiting a common sellingtactic used by these vendors - that of negotiating a site licencewith the organisation and then aggressively promoting its usewith end users (after all it is free), thereby locking the clientinto higher maintenance fees as instances of the database werepromulgated throughout the organisation.By accurately identifying the number, type and use ofapplications based on the RDBMS (many quite small and deployed oninefficient workgroup servers) the supplier says it was able toreduce the overall licences in use (and thereby maintenance fees)by consolidating applications databases onto cost-efficientservers with no effect on user operations. The maintenancesavings in the first year more than paid for the cost of adding afew larger servers and the cost of moving the applications to theconsolidated servers. After nine months, net savings on licencemaintenance could be identified even before considering thereduced indirect support costs of having fewer applicationservers.2. Lease termination.One of the first problems that can arise in leasing is correctlyidentifying which assets are owned outright and which are leased.An ad hoc study done with one ASI client indicated that theaverage PC on lease had a 28% cost base increase during itslifecycle. Situations can arise where assets on leases that areterminating are returned to the lessor with additional equipment(such as network interface cards and other additionalperipherals), extra memory, software installed and so on. Thiscan be especially expensive with servers that have workgrouplicences installed and have had their performance augmentedthrough additional disk drives and memory.3. The cost-effectiveness of training.One of the largest components of total cost of ownership isongoing support and end-user costs and an intuitive answer is toinvest resources in training of end-users in order to attempt todrive down both formal (helpdesk) support and informal (peersupport) costs.While it would appear to be self-evident that support costs aresomehow correlated to training investment, it is difficult todetermine the exact correlation and thereby answer the questionsof: is training cost-effective, will training reduce supportcosts, how efficient are various methods of training, and is alack of training a primary cause of ballooning support costs?ASI says that AssetPRO assists in this analysis by trackingsupport calls and costs and linking them to specific assets,groups of assets (cost centres) and the end-users and theirfunction in the organisation, and then correlating this cost andincident data against the level and specifics of training forthose users, groups of users and systems, thereby establishingthe crucial link between the two activities.4. Software upgrade analysis.The appearance of Windows 95 has focused the ongoing debate aboutsoftware upgrade cost-benefits, software licensing terms andconditions and the overall productivity metrics of desktopsoftware.By tracking the actual time spent using an application (not justlaunched on the desktop and sitting in the background, butactually in use) and then correlating this information to theasset structures, it becomes possible with some asset tools todetermine what percentage of the installed base is beingproductively used and therefore should be upgraded. This goesbeyond a software metering capability (that varies in capabilityfrom simply detecting launches of software off a network serverto logging time used) because that metering information is viewedin a vacuum if it is not correlated to the assets, groups, usersand organisational structures.5. Improvements in procurement records.Probably the single greatest oversight with enterprise assetmanagement is the exclusion of procurement activities and tools.Many of the terms and conditions of procurement will have life-long effects on the overall cost of an asset. This can be assimple as continuing to buy makes and models with a proven recordof high support costs and unreliability, to locking in multi-yearmaintenance costs based on list price and the vendors'assumptions about continued price increases throughout thelifetime of the software.6. Loss prevention.A very simple aspect is that asset management is a process forloss prevention of assets, particularly where they are moremobile, of higher value, more generally desirable and havesignificant opportunities for component theft (memory,peripherals and software).7. Warranty cover improvements.Almost every IT asset a corporation purchases falls under awarranty of one type or another. The cost of supporting thiswarranty is not wholly absorbed by the manufacturer but isaveraged into the cost of the product which, of course, is paidby the corporate buyer.Why is so much money being spent on third-party support whenwarranties already exist? The answer lies mainly in the inabilityto discover which assets are still covered under warranty andwhich are not. A central asset management database can veryquickly ascertain which assets are covered by a warranty andwhich are not.8. Effective technology cascade.Technology cascade involves taking a particular asset which nolonger serves a particular user effectively and transferring itdown to a user whose requirements are less intense. A nice theorybut in practice there are many issues that need to be addressedbefore the technology cascade can be effective and not cost moremoney than it saves.9. Support and maintenance minimisation.One of the biggest and most immediate benefits generated byimplementing enterprise-wide asset management is the savings fromreduced support and maintenance corporate-wide. A central assetmanagement repository can provide all sorts of useful feeds fromprocurement, helpdesk, data collection, software usage meteringand leasing.So when sourcing the cost of a new printer, say, procurementtraditionally would purchase the printer with the lowest price-tag.But by factoring in the cost to support various printers withinthe corporation, it might be determined that the printer with thelowest price-tag is actually 60% more expensive to run comparedwith a printer with a higher purchase price.10. Corporate standards.Standardising on various technologies and software will reducethe amount of support required enterprise-wide and ease theprocess of software deployment.So if the benefits of asset management extend from being able tobetter orchestrate PC purchase across the enterprise, to slowingdown the escalating cost of end-user support, improving the speedof deployment of new applications or reducing equipment loss, italso sets the scene for outsourcing: first audit the asset base,then optimise, rationalise or consolidate it to improve themanagement of desktop assets, and finally look to get shot of thewhole problem by contracting out the job.Whether such a move is financial astute or strategically naive isanother matter all together.                      OUTSOURCNG IT ASSETSIn a White Paper on Gaining Control Over Distributed Assets,Comdisco probes this very point. Organisations have had fewoptions when it comes to asset management, it contends. They cantry to address the problem using internal resources, but few ifany companies have the staff, expertise, or time to do this.Alternatively, they can simply outsource the entire process,typically for a fixed cost per desktop. But the distributedcomputing environment is fraught with change. Turning over thiscritical and dynamic function, sacrificing internal control andflexibility, can be a very costly mistake.It points to a survey carried out by consultants Deloitte &Touche in which managers at 104 companies were surveyed on theiranticipated benefits of implementing an outsourced assetmanagement program, and then surveyed again in 1994 a year afterimplementation to compare actual benefits to expected benefits.The findings were interesting, as Table 2 shows.On the back of such findings, Comdisco maintains that theultimate approach to effective IT asset management lies somewherebetween outsourcing and 'insourcing,' an alternative it callsSelectSourcing .Comdisco's SelectSourcing approach addresses the completelifecycle management of assets - from planning and procurement toinstallation, inventory tracking, network design and management,operational support, recovery and replacement.Companies can select individual services, or leave it thesupplier to manage the complete fulfilment and administration ofall their desktop requirements.The aim is to identify specific ways in which to reduce costs,improve processes, gain control, reduce risks and increaseproductivity across the enterprise. To do this, it breaks assetmanagement into four functional areas:* Asset Management Planning Services: Key components of buildinga plan include benchmarking current processes and costs;analysing work flow; developing a functional and technicaldesign; developing a data repository of IT assets to facilitatebudgeting, forecasting, tracking, standards management, migrationmanagement and technology planning.The benchmark study consists of a complete inventory of allhardware and software assets. The study reviews the total cost ofownership, including acquisition, maintenance, and support costs.A market and book-value analysis of all installed equipment isalso a critical element.Undertaking a work-flow analysis is analogous to conducting abenchmark study of current working practices. Studying work flowis critical, as Comdisco reckons more than 80% of total assetcosts can result from non-hardware issues. There is a need toexamine current procedures used to order, track and managehardware and software, as well as identify potential areas forimprovements in productivity.Frequently, simply understanding work flow better enablescompanies to reduce costs by 5% to 10%.After completing the inventory and work-flow analysis, it becomespossible to create a functional and technical design that ensurescomputing assets are deployed in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.An important piece of developing the functional and technicaldesign is creating a data repository of all IT assets. Thisserves as a focal point for enterprise-wide asset information.The repository will enable appropriate planning for scheduledmaintenance, as well as greatly improve the speed with whichhelpdesks and on-site support can provide assistance and reduceexpense - both in terms of soft (lost productivity) and hardcosts (number of helpdesk or on-site support employees required).As a result of developing an asset management plan, Comdiscomaintains that organisations will be able to:* Redesign key business processes for greater efficiency.* Determine the optimal asset acquisition and disposal timingstrategies.* Develop budgeting and forecasting strategies.* Track software and hardware information.* Set and maintain technology standards.* Life-Cycle Management Services: The strategic management ofhardware and software from acquisition through disposal is key toreducing costs and improving efficiencies. Areas to assess inthis regard include technology evaluation; equipment leasing andtechnology refresh; EDI-based leasing and procurement; orderprocessing and fulfilment; configuration management andinstallation; integration of software management tools; assetidentification, tagging and tracking; financial managementreporting; equipment redeployment, trade-ins and disposalActual procurement is a frequently overlooked area forimprovement. Creating purchase orders, invoice handling,reconciliation and reporting procedures often are time-consumingand inefficient. The price of this inefficiency can be quitehigh. Standardisation of procurement can drastically reduce theprocurement time and cost.For example, one of Comdisco's customers purchases more than2,000 PCs a year, with equipment orders originating from multiplelocations.Prior to implementing an asset management program, the processfollowed a fairly tortuous route:1. Order is received.2. The purchasing department is contacted to determine the cost.3. A formal appropriation is requested.4. Multiple managers approve request.Each of these steps consumed 15 minutes to an hour. This companydetermined its cost to produce each appropriations request was$185. Multiply that figure by 2,000 requests, and the totalannual cost was $370,000 - just to process paperwork.Standardising the procurement process and implementing EDItechnology reduced the average cost to $10 per request.* Managing Technology with Leasing: not surprisingly Comdiscotakes the line that leasing is an important asset management toolthat can help improve the administration, tracking and lifecyclemanagement of distributed equipment. In addition, leasing'straditional benefits are equally important. It says leasing helpsprotect against obsolescence by structuring planned technologyupgrades. It aids in the planning for the future disposal ofoutdated desktop equipment at the time of acquisition, by takingadvantage of automatic planning for removal and disposal ofobsolete equipment. And it reduces the overall asset cost bytreating assets as operating, not capital, expenses.In addition, a strategic approach to asset disposal ensuresmaximum return on investment. Carefully planned timing, coupledwith a knowledge of the secondary equipment market, enablesorganisations to take a long-term view of asset disposal. This,it says, in conjunction with overall lifecycle management, helpscompanies to select the acquisition approach that best suitsshort and long-term financial management needs.It could also help ensure that assets are upgraded and deployedoptimally throughout the organisation.* Productivity Enhancement Services: Ongoing support andmaintenance are two of the largest hidden aspects of technologyuse. Complicating this is the haphazard nature with which assetsare often acquired and configured. Comdisco has identified sevencritical components that must be addressed as part of an assetmanagement program:* Managing the network planning and administration.* Providing essential maintenance.* Offering helpdesk support and on-site assistance.* Training users.* Developing applications.* Managing installs, moves, adds and changes.Two people that perform similar functions in proximity may havetotally different versions of PCs, operating systems andapplications. This diversity vastly complicates network planningand administration, helpdesk and on-site assistance.While standardisation is a necessary and obvious step, buildingan IT asset data repository is crucial to manage the maintenanceof thousands of disparate items and to provide quick andeffective helpdesk support.A data repository would allow managers instant access to assetportfolio data - database information inquiries by equipmenttype, location, serial numbers, stop dates, leasing history andmore. A company could then tell exactly where every hard drive,modem and printer is located, the cost of each item and if it wasleased or purchased.Training, frequently considered a luxury by many organisations,can radically reduce annual support costs. Comdisco says it hasfound that organisations with aggressive training programs cancut these costs to as little as $400 per annum per user.Those without education programs can suffer costs as high as$8,000 per user per year. In an organisation with 1,000 users,the difference in annual support costs between the twoorganisations can be as high as $7.6 million. *Table 1.

And giventhe investment size of a data warehouse, can we afford tocontinue with past estimating practices?Data warehouses are clearly perceived as providing tremendousvalue. Industry attention has focused on the technology to thepoint where the status of data warehouse projects hasdramatically changed from low-visibility, research experiments tomainstream, strategic corporate initiatives.A recent Meta Group survey of 450 companies has shown that asmany as 44% out of those surveyed either have a data warehouse inproduction or pilot status. The same number plan to begin a datawarehouse project within the next year. Survey responses alsoyielded the information that an average data warehouse projectwill cost $3 million - just in its implementation, not includingthe full lifecycle costs.                    A QUESTION OF INVESTMENTAs a result of this change of status, and of the growingawareness of the investment magnitude associated with datawarehousing, management is starting to demand much more carefuland well-substantiated answers to the question, 'What is thebusiness value of this investment?'Although informational and decision-support databases have beenfairly common for at least two decades, there is relativelylittle experience in the projection of the costs and benefitsthat will be associated with producing a data warehouse system.And these projects differ from other, more conventional ITprojects for several reasons:* They frequently utilise new and often (within any oneorganisation) untried technologies. Most data warehouse projectsare breaking new ground for the development team members,requiring significant training and often long learning curves.* Because of the relatively immature state of data warehousingtechnology, vendor offerings are scattered and poorly integrated.This usually necessitates utilising a number of heterogeneousproducts and attempting a custom integration of them. History hasshown that a great deal of the expense and the risk of softwareprojects is to be found in such integration.* By definition, data warehouses involve the integration of datafrom disparate sources, often supplied by many departments and/orprofessional disciplines. There is a likelihood that there willbe problems involving lack of consistent keys, conflicting dataelement definitions, and a considerable amount of confusion onthe part of all involved parties regarding the purpose,reliability and relevance of the data contributed by others.* A major goal of many warehouse projects is to make dataavailable in new and innovative ways to the end-user community.Yet this very availability is almost certain to reveal majorproblems in the cleanliness and usability of the data.Unfortunately, the lack of access to legacy databases - the verysources of the data used to populate the data warehouse - hasserved to conceal flaws in the initial concept of thosedatabases, as well as the nearly inevitable deviations from theirdesign and the 'standard' procedures used to load data into them.Because data warehouses are a relatively new phenomenon, ITdevelopers have had little practice in estimating the costs,benefits and the risk of these projects. Indeed, most pastestimates of IT developments appear to have been widelyinaccurate.A report released by the Standish Group in late 1994 reported theresults of an ambitious survey into the experiences of large andsmall companies in developing and delivering informationtechnology projects (see Figure 1). It showed that nearly all ITprojects are delivered late and significantly exceed theirbudgets. Nearly a third of the projects are cancelled before theyare completed at all. Moreover, despite the tardy, over-budgetperformance, projects were found typically to deliver less thanhalf of their originally promised functionality.                     DATA WAREHOUSING COSTSThis two-part article will illustrate a means for developing ameaningful cost-estimation model for a data warehouse project.Part I deals with the costs, benefits and risks inherent in adata warehouse project, drawing on lessons from past projects -including both data warehouses and other IT projects. Then nextmonth, the second part will include discussions of the costs,benefits, and risk involved in a 'typical' data warehouseproject, and go on to present a methodology for assessing datawarehouse projects, including an example analysis using a'typical' data warehouse case.In an earlier issue of Computer Finance (October 1995, pages 1-6:Cashing in on the Data Warehouse?), an analysis was made of datapresented at a Gartner-organised conference on Strategic DataManagement, showing that the average budget for a data warehouseimplementation breaks roughly into thirds between hardware,software and labour (including staff costs, systems integrationand external consultancy charges).These costs represent the initial development costs for a datawarehouse, not including the ongoing support and maintenance thatit will require over its useful life. Over the full lifecycle,these costs are likely to shift dramatically, discounting thesoftware and hardware costs in favour of labour and fee-based(i.e. maintenance contract) charges.Figure 2 illustrates this shift. It is important to realise that,similar to most IT projects, the development and implementationphases will only comprise about one-third of the total costs tobe incurred over the full life of the project. Thus, the right-hand pie chart is a much more realistic assessment of the coststo be expected in a typical data warehouse project.                   CHARTING A HISTORY OF COSTSDespite the characteristics that make data warehouse projectsriskier and more expensive than many other types of IT project,there is still a great deal to be learned from a review of pastproject performance, not just at the overall level, but at thedetailed level - examining good and bad estimates of individualcost and benefit factors.A chart of cost factors to be considered is presented opposite asTable 1, and some aspects of this listing are worth consideringin a little more detail.                        COMPUTER HARDWAREBecause of the large disk requirements and specialised databasetuning required, many companies choose to implement new hardwareto support the server requirements of their data warehouseprojects. Periodic upgrades to the hardware capacity can also beanticipated as the inventory of historical information grows.In the past, these costs have often subjected to a higher levelof management and purchasing scrutiny than other IT investments.In many cases, estimates for the initial (i.e. first year)hardware costs are based on firm quotations. Poor estimates forfuture year hardware costs have often been hidden bygeometrically improving price-performance ratios.                 NETWORK AND TELECOMMUNICATIONSMost data warehouse projects are undertaken utilising a client-server approach to supplying data to the end-user. These projectsare heavily dependent on a reliable, high-speed networkinfrastructure.In many companies, estimates for these costs have been fairlywell estimated in the past. In marked contrast to many other ITareas, an enterprise approach has often been taken, providing asingle unified network infrastructure with an integrated designviewpoint. As a result, costs for incremental capacity have beenfairly well understood. Similarly to computer hardware, poorestimates have often been overshadowed by rapidly decreasingcosts for commodity network bandwidth supply.                         VENDOR SOFTWAREMost data warehouse projects today are based on integration ofnumerous vendor software products. Although there often is acomponent of internal software development, vendor-providedsoftware usually will supply most of the overall functionality ofthe proposed system.Vendor software licensing costs comprise a significant part ofoverall data warehouse project budgets. Estimates of these costs,however, tend to focus on the two 'ends' of the system (i.e. thedatabase management system on the back end, and the end-userinterface tool at the front end) and discount the costs to beincurred in the 'middle' (i.e. metadata management tools, copyand replication tools, data scrubbing tools, etc).As a result of this oversight, overall licensing budgets canoften underestimate overall costs by 20% to 50%.It is important to include estimates of the small, inexpensivesoftware products (such as database connectivity software,communications protocol stacks, etc.) installed on each of theend-users' workstations.It is easy to overlook costs for software items that cost $50 to$150 per copy when estimating a large project. However, if thissoftware must be installed on each of, say, 1,000 end-userworkstations, it can become significant to the overall projecteconomics.Historically the costs involved in licensing a specific vendorsoftware product have been fairly well estimated, largely as aresult of their prominence in the minds of management.Terms and conditions of licensing agreements are typicallyscrutinised by both legal and management staffs. A huge exceptionto this assertion is in the area of vendor software maintenancecosts, which have traditionally been underestimated to a greatdegree.Since most data warehouse projects are highly dependent onvendor-supplied software, it is reasonable to assume that theywill incur vendor software maintenance charges throughout theirfull lifecycle. Yet these charges are among the worst estimatesthat have been made historically. Most software maintenancecontracts call for maintenance fees to be assessed as apercentage (usually between 12% and 18%) of current list pricefor the software product. So the project budgets that haveincluded maintenance costs (sadly, many have not even consideredmaintenance costs) generally have projected that percentage ofthe software costs for each year of the project life. However,this approach ignores three facts:* The maintenance fee is based on list price, rather thanpurchase price. Since many large companies purchase theirsoftware at a discounted price, the maintenance charge may be amuch higher percentage of the actual purchase price.* The maintenance is based on the current list price. If thevendor raises the list price of the software over the nextseveral years (a common practice, particularly when the marketfor a then-obsolete product becomes saturated, and maintenancebecomes the main revenue producer), the maintenance fees willlikewise increase.* New functionality is often offered by the vendor, not asupgrades to the base product, but as add-on products, with theirown list prices and maintenance commitments.For these reasons, historical estimates of software maintenancecosts have often been only 20 to 30% of what they should havebeen. Large budget overruns have often been incurred when sourcecode for a software product is acquired and then modified toadapt the product to specific company needs. Although there isnothing wrong with this approach, numerous problems can occur,mostly related to maintenance and upgrade of the software.The cost of training installers and administrators of the newsoftware products also needs to be accounted for. This can becounted in terms of both its monetary cost (e.g. tuition, traveland so on) and also in terms of time required (i.e. impact on theproject schedule) before the new products can be effectivelyused.Data warehouse projects generally require configuration ofvendor-supplied software. This process can be straightforward,involving only a few hours or days of work. However, significantcosts and delays can be incurred when the process does not go asplanned. Problems in this area often require that specialists(vendor technicians or consultants) visit the site, adding travelexpenses to the already high hourly or daily rates charged bythese experts. So it is reasonable to have worst case costs inthis category that are an order of magnitude higher than theplanned case.                  INTERNAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENTAlthough most of the functionality of the data warehouse willprobably be provided by vendor software products, the fragmentednature of most vendors' offerings requires a significant amountof custom software development and systems integration effort innearly all data warehouse implementations.Despite its low-visibility nature, the cost of developing,testing and implementing this software may prove to be a majorcomponent of the overall project economics.Despite the unenviable reputation of software developers forproviding late, over-budget results, an examination of manyprojects shows that those projects noted as the worst performersin this regard are usually those for which there were poorproject goals and specifications, or those for which thespecifications changed dramatically during the process ofdeveloping the product.The truth of the matter is that the project costs were oftenfairly well estimated, based on the scope and expectations set atthe time the project was started. However, by the time theproject had been subjected to massive scope change, architecturaladjustments, functionality modifications and target platformrevisions, it should have been no surprise that the originalbudget was exceeded - often by several hundred percent.The bottom line in the subject of internal software developmentestimates is really an issue of project and enterprisemanagement, rather than project economics. Without disciplinedchange control and scope management, no estimating methodologycan have a hope of 'guessing' what may happen to a project afterits approval.It is important to recognise that as problems occur in softwaredevelopment, they are seldom solved by adding staff. In nearlyall cases, software development problems result in scheduledelays with a fairly constant staffing level. Thus, worst-casescenarios should recognise that the effect of problems will be todelay the delivery date, and consequently the date that benefitswill begin to be received.Many studies have shown that full lifecycle costs of internallydeveloped software can be more than three times the developmentcosts. Yet many project economics evaluations have assumed thatthese costs will be minimal, or ignore them altogether.The previously-cited Standish Group survey noted that the'successful' projects (i.e. the 69% that were not cancelledbefore completion) provided only 42% of the originally-promisedfeatures and functions.Much of the work of 'completing' these systems will be passed onto the 'maintenance' staff. Many systems have been in productionfor years, before they provide all of their originally specifiedcapabilities. But the project budgets, and therefore economicscalculations include no provision for this 'maintenance', letalone the bug fixes and upgrades expected as part of normalmaintenance.Data warehouse projects can be fully expected to be asmaintenance intensive as the 'average' IT project. A realisticassessment of the cost of staffing this function will be criticalto economic assessment of the proposed project.                         ACCESS TO DATAThe whole purpose of many data warehouses is to provideenterprise-oriented access to data that has up until now beensecreted in departmental systems, defying any but the mostdetermined attempts to integrate these 'private' databases. Thereare many obstacles, many of them non-technical, that must beovercome to effect this integration.The first obstacle is a clear lack of management appreciation forthe difficulty and expense of surmounting the problem.Unfortunately, poor or non-existent documentation, changing datafield definitions, poorly defined editing rules, inconsistent'common' keys, poorly trained data entry staff, and so on, haveall combined to make data integration a difficult, time-consumingand very expensive undertaking.Data conversion, including standardisation of multiple codingschemes and joining of heterogeneous schemas from the existing'legacy' databases into the data warehouse shows similarcharacteristics. Conversion plans often assume that the data inthe old systems is well understood and documented, but experiencehas shown that even if the documentation is comprehensive, itoften does not reflect the reality of the data in the oldsystems. The worst-case estimate for data conversion can andoften should be several hundred percent (or more) of the plannedcase estimate.There are several software tools on the market using rule-basedand neural-net technologies that help automate the integrationand conversion processes. However, the tools themselves areexpensive, and they require a significant amount of effort toimplement. These tools may play a key role in the success of adata warehouse, however they will also comprise a substantialfraction of the overall project cost.Data warehouses require extensive data administration. AaronZornes of the Meta Group, has irreverently dubbed the datawarehouse the Database Administrators' Full Employment Act. Inmost cases, the source databases will remain in place, and theirdata collection processes will not undergo any dramatic changes.As a result, all of the problems noted for integration andconversion are likely to remain throughout the life of thewarehouse. Project budgets should reflect the likely high labourcost needed to maintain and administer the data contained in theproposed warehouse.                         ONGOING SUPPORTNew applications, whether data warehouses or any others, must besupported. Users must be trained, documentation prepared, updatedand distributed, and helpdesk services provided. This supportmust be provided not just at project startup, but over the lifeof the product.Many projects are undertaken with the assumption that support forthe new system will be handled by the existing end-user supportstaff. This can only be true if one of the following assumptionsis true:* The existing user support staff is overstaffed, and needs morework to keep them busy.* Supporting the new data warehouse, in addition to thepreviously existing software products, is no more work thansupporting the existing software alone.* Support for some of the existing software products will bedropped, thus allowing more time for the staff to support the newdata warehouse.In most cases, none of these assumptions are true. Projecteconomics assessments need to include the cost of providing thiscritical component of successful project delivery.                   THE BENEFITS OF WAREHOUSINGClearly, successful implementation of a data warehouse canprovide tremendous benefits and these can be segmented intotangible and intangible categories, based on the ability tomeasure and/or audit their results in a financial context.Benefit factors that should be considered are shown over the pagein Table 2. Once again, the fine detail of these issues is worthexploring.                       PERSONNEL REDUCTIONHistorically, personnel reduction has been one of the onlyquantitative benefits considered in justifying IT projects. Manyof the projects undertaken during the past three decades havebeen on-line transaction processing systems, which automated manyclerical tasks, and substantially reduced the staff required forthese functions.Unfortunately, many past claims of this sort have been made, yetaudits conducted a year or two after project completion showlittle or no reduction in staff. The only explanation for thisdiscrepancy is often a vague claim that staff have beendisplaced.In a data warehousing scenario, the number of people whose jobscould potentially be replaced by the new system is considerablylower. In fact, in most companies, the only group likely to beaffected in this way is the staff of the information centre,whose job it has been to prepare custom or semi-custom reports ofcompany information to satisfy requests from the end-usercommunity. If the data warehouse truly empowers end-users to findand process their own data, then the IT staff may be reduced.Even if the warehouse is only a limited success, the morepowerful tools in the hands of the IT staff may enhance theirproductivity to the point where the staff could well be reducedto some extent.No matter what assumptions are made regarding personnelreduction, with this and all other 'tangible' benefits, it isimportant at the outset to have a plan for measuring themagnitude of the benefit that was in fact derived from theimplementation of the data warehouse.                         COST AVOIDANCESince a strong case has been made for explicitly including allcosts associated with developing the data warehouse, includingall of the supporting infrastructure (computer hardware,networking, software maintenance and so on), it is legitimate toaccept credit for avoiding costs that would have been incurred ifthe project had not been undertaken.For example, if implementation of the data warehouse will movesignificant amounts of processing from a mainframe system to adedicated midrange computer, or result in the avoidance ofpurchasing additional disk storage in the data centre, it wouldbe acceptable to claim those incremental positive changes asbenefits.The important point is that the benefits claimed must truly beincremental, and attributable directly to the effects of theproject. Given that many data warehouse projects involvemigration of processing and reporting to lower- cost platforms,this may be an important component of the financial justificationof the project.                      END-USER PRODUCTIVITYNumerous studies have shown that professional employees spendabout 60% of their time looking for data, reformatting data, re-keying data, transferring data files, etc. In other words, theyspend three days of every five-day week doing clerical activities- all related to accessing data. They spend another 20% of theirtime on vacation, holidays, training, etc. This leaves a final20% - just one day per week to do the job that they are actuallyemployed to do.The obvious inference here is that if a data warehouse can trulyempower end-users' access to data, it should be possible todramatically change the time allocations for professionalemployees. If they can only spend two days per week, instead ofthree, looking for data, they can spend the extra day onprofessional work, effectively doubling the productivity of theentire professional staff. This is a powerful incentive.However, to assess data warehouse project economics based on thisbenefit, it would be necessary to audit staff productivity afterthe warehouse is delivered. Assuming an enterprise-wide doublingof professional staff productivity is virtually guaranteed toproduce spectacular predicted economics for almost any proposedproject. But to invoke this benefit, there is a need to back itup once the project is completed.                   ON THE INTANGIBLE BENEFITSMany of the benefits claimed for data warehouse projects areintangible. They can be characterised as benefits to theperformance of the enterprise as a whole, and as such are nearlyimpossible to measure. However, the following assertions can bemade and defended without too much trouble:* IT is an integral part of success in most enterprises today.* If an enterprise improves its performance, improved decision-making based on good information was probably a contributingfactor.* A data warehouse will provide better access to goodinformation.Given each of these assertions, it is clear that improvedfinancial performance after the implementation of a datawarehouse can be at least partly attributed to the presence anduse of the warehouse to support the better decisions that led tothat improved performance. But how much?No doubt, line management will dispute any claims of 100% of theimprovement being attributed to the data warehouse; after all, itwas the managers' decisions, not the presence of the data thatimproved the business performance. Yet the assertions showed thatit must be some amount. How much? It is right to claim 5% of theimprovement as a benefit of the data warehouse? Or 50%? How canit be estimated?This is an important issue which will usually overshadow all ofthe tangible benefits combined. In many cases, intangible as itmay be, benefits of this type are the reason the project wasbegun in the first place.Although it may not be possible to quantify them, it is stillimportant to be aware of several distinct categories ofintangible benefits that may apply to a particular data warehouseproject. (Two alternate methodologies for dealing with theireconomic impact will be presented and discussed next month.)                       REVENUE ENHANCEMENTData warehouses can contribute appreciably to the overallfinancial performance of an enterprise. Many recent publicationshave extolled the virtues of data warehouses in terms ofsupporting improved decision-making, more efficient purchasing,tighter inventory control, better targeted marketing, etc.It is important to understand the project goals before startingthe project, so that project decision-makers can consider theeconomic impact of the project proposal in the correctperspective.                    IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICEAccess to a data warehouse can greatly improve customer service,allowing employees to quickly check all of the companyinformation regarding a customer during the course of a singlecontact, either face-to-face or over the telephone. This mayinclude previous orders, catalogue mailings, prior paymenthistory, account balances, outstanding loans, householdcharacteristics, demographic information, and many otherindustry-specific data elements.                IMPROVED PRODUCT/SERVICE QUALITYIn the manufacturing sector, product quality has taken on muchincreased importance in the past two decades. Implementation ofquality information systems has produced enormous databases,particularly in the computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM)environment.These databases are usually closely integrated with (and tunedfor) their data collection systems. Data warehouses can create aviable access method for processing and statistically analysingthis data, without adversely impacting production line systemperformance. The economic impacts of providing manufacturingpersonnel with timely access to this data can have profoundimpact on overall product quality.                      COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGEWithin each industry, there are specific characteristics thatprovide companies with a competitive advantage over theircompetitors. Data warehouse projects are not generic. They canand should be targeted to provide functionality specific to aparticular company's needs.Whether this is managing product inventory in manufacturingplants, providing a rapid response to customer orders, developingsuperior retail store layouts, or a host of otherdifferentiators, the results of effective utilisation of the datawarehouse may lead to spectacular business success.                ENHANCED TECHNOLOGICAL REPUTATIONSome companies will be very interested in how a project or seriesof projects affects the price of their stock. A high stock priceis particularly valuable to a company that is consideringacquisitions, especially if the purchase is to be acquired forstock, rather than for cash.Stock prices may reflect a high price/earnings (PE) ratio when acompany is considered to have a technology infrastructure thatexceeds those in the rest of its industry sector. This higher PEis justified by the other intangibles mentioned earlier.                        A QUALIFIED RISK?The subject of risk is one which has been largely ignored inplanning IT projects in general. Because of their nature and theimmaturity of the concept, data warehouse projects areconsiderably riskier than most 'conventional' IT projects.The risks inherent in a data warehouse project can be categorisedinto factor risk and lifecycle risk.Factor risk is the risk associated with each of the cost andbenefit categories defined earlier. Costs may be greater thanestimated or less than estimated, as a result of either animperfect understanding of the problem or environmental changes(e.g. price-performance improvements, vender pricing behaviour,etc). Within reasonable limits, the individual factors are fairlyindependent of each other, although taken to extremes it isunlikely that massive cost overruns will result in greater thanexpected benefits, or vice versa.Lifecycle risks can be categorised into technical risk (e.g.technological, cost and project management uncertainties),management risk (e.g. staffing and budgeting) and client risk(e.g. client goals, funding and support).Put bluntly, technical risk is the risk that the project will benever be completed. Management risk is the risk that the budgetor staff will be cut and the new system cannot be supported inthe new environment. Client risk is the risk that the productworks well, but the clients' business goals change so much thatthe system is obsolete before its lifecycle is completed. As wewill see next month, each of these types of risk affects theproject as a whole - as well as the individual cost and benefitfactors. *Table 1.

TELEWORKER ECONOMIES FAIL TO ATTRACT FIRMSJust one in 20 UK firms are said to employ staff that'telecommute', or work remotely at home using modems and Internetgateways to link into corporate databases, networks andelectronic messaging systems.Despite reported cost savings and supposed productivityimprovements, the much expected breakthrough with teleworking issurprisingly long overdue.A study carried out by researchers at Warwick University for theEconomic and Social Research Council came to the conclusion thatthe average saving being made by corporates who use teleworkersruns at between #1,500 and #3,000 a year.This is about the same as the initial cost of #3,500 or so neededto set up each teleworker with all the necessary facilities. Soafter the first year, the arrangement would start to offer areturn - namely reduced office costs.On productivity, the suggestion has been made that teleworkerswork better and are more reliable than office-based staff. Theyalso save an average of 480 hours a year commuting.              A NEW LEASE OF LIFE FOR THE DESKTOP?Dubbed 'an IT finance scheme with built-in flexibility', LifeCycle from the #264 million leasing and support group of P&P is anew lease scheme aimed at arresting the escalating expense ofdesktop assets.The company maintains there is a desperate need for more flexibleapproaches to computer leasing. Leasing frees capital but canprove too restrictive where technology is changing fast, it says.What is missing is the flexibility to upgrade desktop equipmentwithout having to budget for a large capital outlay. Its newlease scheme offers flexibility on two counts, P&P claims.Where there is a need to preserve capital expenditure, Life Cyclecan be scheduled to operate as an operating lease, with residualinvestment so that payments are met from expenditure budgets.Alternatively, where there is a budget shortfall, it can bestructured as a step-lease to preserve cash flow during theinitial months of a contract term. There is also a built-inupgrade path to provide flexibility in the acquisition or newsystems or the upgrade of existing assets - there is, however, aneed to agree swap-outs in advance.Additionally, there is an option for built-in support, soallowing some of the on-going variable costs of installation,maintenance, software distribution or training to be converted toa fixed overhead.Equally, P&P says certain asset control routines can be includedinto the scheme, such as the production of desktop inventoryreports.            LACK OF CONFIDENCE REVEALED IN COST DATAA poll of US executives has shown as many as 26% do not haveconfidence in the accuracy of the cost data in their systems.According to the survey by Lawson, the financial software house,the quality of financial information is poor because there is toomuch reliance on systems that are based on ledger-basedaccounting methods.Back to Headline List WT03-B31-21IA059-000323-B010-200http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec38.html 205.156.212.5 19970114214443 text/html 35371HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:42:57 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:51 GMTContent-length: 35184Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec38.html Sample Issue Copyright COMPUTER INDUSTRY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNet January 4, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES BORLAND SAYS CONGRESS CHOSE TO PROTECT ONLY CODE, NOT FUNCTIONALITY (482 words) LAW PROFESSORS URGE AFFIRMANCE OF RULING (277 words) TWO MEN AGREE TO PAY $600,000 TO SETTLE INFRINGEMENT SUIT (209 words) 11TH CIR.

Lotus Development Corp. v. Borland International,No. 94-2003 (U.S.); see Computer Industry Litigation Reporter,Dec. 21, 1995.     If Lotus's position is adopted as law, Borland contends,there will be "potentially calamitous consequences for thesoftware industry in the United States" because the industrydepends on the ability of different programs to be compatible andwork "on top" of each other.     Oral argument is scheduled for Monday, Jan. 8, at 1 p.m.     Lotus Development Corp. sued Borland International overBorland's use of the menu command tree of the Lotus 1-2-3spreadsheet in its competing line of Quattro Pro spreadsheetsoftware.  Use of the menu tree was necessary for Lotus users toimport their data into Quattro Pro.  The district court in Bostonruled in favor of Lotus, but the First Circuit U.S. Court ofAppeals reversed, finding the command tree is an uncopyrightablemethod of operation.  The Supreme Court agreed to review thecase, the first time it will rule on copyright protection forsoftware.     Lotus's argument that the menu tree and the program areindistinguishable must be rejected, Borland argues.     "As a matter of economics," Borland says, "copyrightprotection for source and object code blocks only one of avirtually unlimited number of ways of achieving the same 'certainresults'; copyright protection for these 'certain results,' suchas a menu command hierarchy, potentially creates vast marketpower likely to chill further innovation."     When Congress decided that computer programs should becopyrightable, its main concern was stopping the illegalduplication of software on floppy disks, Borland argues.Congress clearly chose to exclude things like the Lotus menu treefrom protection, but even if congressional intent was ambiguous,protection of these "external features" would violate the chiefintent of the copyright law, which is to promote the public good,Borland argues.     "Lotus's menu command hierarchy may well constitutepatentable subject matter," Borland states.  "But Lotus bases itsclaim on the law of copyright, not patent.  Lotus's argumentignores the important policies and procedures of the patent law,reads important limiting language out of the copyright statute,and refuses even to acknowledge that its proposed extension ofthe scope of copyright must 'ultimately serve the public good,'as this Court has so often counseled."

In one filing, 34 professors reiterate Borland's contentionthat copyright law excludes protection for systems and methods ofoperation.     "Unlike conventional literary works, computer programscontain many components that are potentially patentable," theprofessors state.  "It is, thus, appropriate for courts to filterout not only abstractions, but also constituent elements ofuseful processes and methods of operation before making acomparison of two computer programs for the purpose ofdetermining whether infringement has occurred."     "If computer programs need more protection againstcompetitive imitation than copyright, supplemented by patent andtrade secrecy law, can provide, software developers should seekadditional legal protection for computer programs from Congress,"the professors said.     The professors' brief was filed by Pamela Samuelson ofCornell Law School in Ithaca, NY.     In a separate brief, copyright law professors Peter S.Menell of the University of California at Berkeley and Dennis S.Karjala of Arizona State University point out that the copyrightstatute distinguishes between computer program instructions andwhat results from the execution of the instructions.  Thecopyright in the instructions themselves " the code " does notextend to the program's output unless that output independentlyqualifies as a copyrightable work, the professors argue.     The menu command hierarchy does not qualify, the professorsstate, because it is a method of operation that is excluded underSection 102(b) of the Copyright Act.     "[T]o extend copyright by protecting functional workswithout explicit congressional authorization would undermine theintegrity of the entire intellectual property law system," theysaid.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER INDUSTRY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996TWO MEN AGREE TO PAY$600,000 TO SETTLEINFRINGEMENT SUIT     Two men who operated a computer bulletin board system agreedin early December to pay Sega of America $600,000 to settle alawsuit alleging that users of the BBS were able to obtainillegal copies of Sega video games.  Sega of America v. TheGhetto, No. 93-CV-4261 (ND CA).     Sega filed suit in December 1993 against The Ghetto, a BBSrun by two California men, Marqui Labatore and Kurtis Buckmaster.The suit alleged that the men obtained copies of Sega video gamesand then allowed BBS members to either pay a fee to download thegames, or provide copies of other games in exchange for downloadrights.     Among the games allegedly copied were Golden Axe, JurassicPark, Sonic Spinball and Shining Force.  The games wereoriginally produced for use with the Sega video game system andwere modified for use on personal computers.     Sega learned of the infringing activity after receiving ananonymous tip.  An investigator then logged onto The Ghetto andrecorded the activities taking place there.     Sega was represented by Neal A. Smith and Jane Quale Keeneof Limbach & Limbach in San Francisco.

FINDS JURYINSTRUCTIONS IMPROPER,REMANDS SOFTWARE CASE     A federal judge erred when he told a jury it should filterout only the copying of nonliteral elements of a computer programin determining whether infringement occurred, a panel of the 11thCircuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 22, remanding the suitfor a new trial.  Bateman et al. v. Mnemonics Inc. et al.,No. 93-3234 (11th Cir.).     The judge also failed to properly instruct the jury on thelaw as it relates to copying necessitated by compatibilityrequirements, the panel said.     Plaintiffs Brian E. Bateman and Charles H. Fricker createdthe single board computer operating system (SBCOS), hardwarelogic diagrams for their circuit board, and certain programmablearray logic software.  The lawsuit " alleging copyrightinfringement, unfair competition and theft of trade secrets "resulted from a complicated series of licensing agreementsentitling the defendants to use the software and diagrams.  Thedefendants are accused of developing similar software afterhaving access to the plaintiffs' technology.     A jury awarded the plaintiffs a total of $525,000 on theirclaims.  The defendants appealed the verdict, raising numerousalleged errors.  The plaintiffs appealed the trial judge'srefusal to award exemplary damages.     The panel first said the jury was improperly instructed tofilter out only the copying of nonliteral elements of theplaintiffs' software, which could have left the jury with theerroneous belief that any copying of literal elements wascopyright infringement as a matter of law.     Although Computer Associates v. Altai, the case the SecondCircuit U.S. Court of Appeals used to develop the "abstraction-filtration-comparison" test, involved alleged copying ofnonliteral elements of a computer program, the panel said, asimilar analysis must be performed on alleged copying of literalelements as well, in order to eliminate unprotectable expressionprior to comparison with an allegedly infringing work.  (ForComputer Associates, see Computer Industry Litigation Reporter,July 2, 1992, P. 15,135.)     The panel also found that the trial judge should have, butdid not, instruct the jury on the legal consequences of copyingthat is necessitated by the need for a program to be compatiblewith other programs, such as operating system software.  Theplaintiffs alleged copying of certain interface specificationsthat allowed their software to work with other programs.  Thedefendants countered that the copying was necessary in order toachieve compatibility.     The panel said that interface specifications could beprotectable under copyright law, but also said that externalconsiderations such as compatibility requirements could limit oreliminate such protection.  The panel did not decide whether thealleged copying constituted infringement, instead remanding thecase to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District ofFlorida for a new trial.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER INDUSTRY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996JUDGE APPROVES SETTLEMENTIN SUIT OVER SONGS COPIEDFROM COMPUSERVE DATABASE     U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan of the Southern Districtof New York on Dec. 19 approved the settlement in Frank MusicCorp.'s class action alleging online music copyright infringementby CompuServe Inc., due to subscribers' uploading and downloadingcopyrighted songs without paying royalties.  Frank Music Corp. v.CompuServe Inc., No. 93 Civ. 8153 JFK (SD NY); see ComputerIndustry Litigation Reporter, Nov. 16, 1995.     The Dec. 19 order calls for CompuServe to pay $568,000 tothe Harry Fox Agency (HFA) " most to be distributed to classplaintiffs who are HFA principals " and the creation of alicensing agreement for online "forum" managers to upload anddownload recordings of copyrighted songs.  HFA provides musiclicensing and royalty collection services to more than 12,000music publisher-principals.  The class action was filed by aclass of 384 music publishers, alleging infringement of 941musical compositions.     CompuServe, a wholly owned subsidiary of H&R Block Group,Inc., maintains a computer bulletin board system that includesliterary, graphic and musical databases.  CompuServe grantsaccess to its bulletin board to its paid subscribers, who use amodem and their own personal computers to upload (put into thebulletin board) literary, graphic and musical material chosen bysubscribers, and select and download these same materials.  Eachsubscriber pays a monthly fee plus a charge for the amount oftime he or she is connected to the bulletin board.     The complaint alleged that CompuServe allowed and encouragedsubscribers to upload copyrighted songs, stored the unauthorizedrecordings, and allowed subscribers to download copies of therecordings.  The complaint sought $100,000 for each of the morethan 690 alleged acts of infringement.     A settlement agreement was announced Nov. 7, and individualplaintiffs had until Dec. 12 to opt out.  Edward P. Murphy,president of the National Music Publishers' Association,financial supporter of the case, said the settlement would assurejust compensation for the use of musical works in newtechnologies.

Greenleaf Medical Systems Inc. v. American MedicalAssociation, No. C-95 20820 (ND CA).     Although Greenleaf used portions of the Guides, includingtables, charts and algorithms, in its software, the portions itcopied are not protectable by copyright, Greenleaf contends.     The Guides, whose use is mandated in at least 30 states,allow physicians to express patients' impairment ratings in astandard way.  Greenleaf developed a system in which its productscan send data directly to a computer, which will use Greenleaf'ssoftware to calculate an impairment rating.  Greenleaf used theformulas, methods and algorithms contained in the Guides, andGreenleaf expressly encourages customers to purchase copies ofthe Guides to use in conjunction with the software, the complaintstates.     According to the complaint, Greenleaf asked the AMA whethera license was required for Greenleaf to use the information inthe Guides in its software, and was told no license wasnecessary.  However, the complaint states, the AMA laterthreatened to sue Greenleaf unless the company entered into alicense agreement and paid back royalties.     Greenleaf contends that the AMA's copyright in the Guides isinvalid because the individual AMA members who authored thevarious sections own the copyrights to their work.  Greenleafalso asserts that the sections its used are uncopyrightablebecause the expression is inseparable from the underlying idea,and because the expression is standard in the medical community.Greenleaf also raises affirmative defenses of fair use, waiver,laches, estoppel and unclean hands.

Gass et al., No. 95 C 11560 (ND OK).     Motorola sells a variety of two-way radio communicationssystems, both "trunking" and "nontrunking" systems, which areused by law enforcement and emergency services organizations."Trunking" systems automatically set the radios in use to anavailable frequency and avoid the problem of "jamming," whichoccurs when radios that are too near each other attempt to usethe same frequency at the same time.  The radio systems arecontrolled by Motorola's proprietary software.     According to the complaint, defendants Larry Nathan Gass,John David Astacio, Tulsa Security Patrol and Action Helicoptershave illegally modified the Motorola software to allowindividuals other than legitimate Motorola customers to use theradio systems.     These third-party purchasers of the modified systems believethey are purchasing genuine Motorola products, Motorola alleges,resulting in damage to the company's reputation.  In addition,according to the complaint, charges accrued through use of themodified systems are wrongly billed to legitimate customers orare simply absorbed by Motorola, the company alleges.

AVI Systems Inc. v. Microsoft,No. 95-16577 (9th Cir.); see Computer Industry LitigationReporter, Dec. 21, 1995.               AVI Systems designs, develops and distributes computerhardware and software products.  According to the complaint,AVI's president and CEO, plaintiff Joseph Shamash, obtainedregistration with the Patent and Trademark Office of the mark"AVI" for use in connection with the company's products.  Thecomplaint alleges that Microsoft then contacted AVI and askedpermission to use the AVI mark for its Windows video software,known as "Audio Video Interleaved."  Despite AVI's denyingpermission, Microsoft proceeded to use the mark, the complaintstates.  AVI sought a preliminary injunction, which was denied bythe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.     AVI claims the district court erred in holding that theplaintiffs were not likely to establish likelihood of consumerconfusion and would therefore be unable to prevail, and thatMicrosoft was likely to establish a "fair use" defense.     "The essence of AVI Systems' argument is that it disagreeswith the weight that the district court gave to some of theevidence, it disagrees with the district court's evaluation ofthe credibility of its chief witness, and it disagrees with theinterpretation the district court gave the evidence it did findbelievable," Microsoft states.  "These are the very matters thatare left to a trial court's discretion.  The district court didnot commit clear error or abuse its considerable discretion."     Microsoft also contends the appeal is moot because Windows95 has already been released, and there are no related productsanticipated to be released before the case is resolved on themerits.

CT.     The use of extrinsic evidence in the interpretation ofpatent claims does not automatically transform the issue from oneof law to one of fact, Westview Instruments Inc. argued in itsDec. 10 response brief to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Markman et al.v. Westview Instruments Inc. et al., No. 95-26 (U.S.); seeComputer Industry Litigation Reporter, Oct. 19, 1995.     The court has set oral arguments in the case for Jan. 8.     Westview urged the Supreme Court to affirm the landmark enbanc ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit(CAFC) that the construction of patent claims in a jury trial ofpatent infringement litigation is a matter of law for judges todecide and not an issue of fact for juries to determine.     Herbert Markman, the inventor of a patented system forcontrolling the inventory in dry cleaning stores, sued Westviewfor patent infringement in U.S. District Court for the EasternDistrict of Pennsylvania.  At trial, the central issue waswhether the word "inventory," which was not defined in the patentclaims, covered only a system for tracking garments or whether itcould be construed to include the tracking of monetarytransactions as well.     The trial judge had instructed the jury to determine themeaning of the disputed claim language.  However, after the juryreturned a verdict of infringement on two claims, he ruled thatclaim construction is a matter of law for the court to decide andhe granted a j.m.o.l. of noninfringement.     In April, the Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed thelower court ruling that the trial court has the power todetermine claim language even when extrinsic evidence is requiredto clarify the meaning of a claim.  Markman sought review on thegrounds that the Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to havejuries determine the meaning of patent terms.Seventh Amendment     In its response brief, Westview contended that thehistorical record supports the proposition that judges, notjuries, construe claim language.  The Seventh Amendment, thepetition said, was intended to protect the right to a jury trialon issues of substance, not on matters of form and procedure.The drafters of the Bill of Rights included the Seventh Amendmentto preserve the institution of the jury, not to define the rolesof judge and jury in cases where the right to jury trial ispreserved, Westview asserted.     "Petitioners have confused the more common inquiry, whetherthe jury trial right attaches to a particular cause of action,with the less common inquiry involved here of whether aparticular issue in a jury trial is for the court or the jury,"the brief stated.     Westview also argued that the Supreme Court has consistentlyheld since 1825 that claim construction is a matter of law, evenwhen extrinsic evidence is used to aid in interpreting disputedclaims.  Citing Winans v. New York and Erie R.R. Co., 62 U.S.(21 How.) 88 (1859), Westview noted that the Supreme Court heldthen that a judge may seek information from expert witnesses toexplain terms of the art, but that the court itself is the finalauthority on the meaning of a patent claim.     Finally, Westview contended that the Federal Circuit'sruling advances patent law policies by promoting specific andclear claims and consistent interpretation while leaving to thejury the traditional and central role of determining theunderlying facts.     Westview's response brief was filed by Frank H. Griffin III,Peter A. Vogt and Polly M. Shaffer of Gollatz, Griffin & Ewing,Philadelphia.  Markman is represented by William B. Mallin,Timothy P.

Gilmore v. State Department et al., No. C-95-1098 FMS(ND CA); see Computer Industry Litigation Reporter, Aug. 3, 1995.     The motion also seeks dismissal of certain defendants whoargue they do not have any records responsive to the plaintiff'sFOIA requests.     Cryptography is a branch of mathematics used to scrambleelectronic communications so that they cannot be understood byanyone who does not have the correct "key" to decode them.Plaintiff John Gilmore, a member of the Electronic FrontierFoundation's board of directors, claims that numerous governmentagencies have unlawfully denied or delayed responding to hisrequests under the FOIA for information about export controls oncryptography.     Named as defendants are the State Department, the JusticeDepartment, the Commerce Department, the National SecurityCouncil, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, the Office of Legal Counsel, Office of Informationand Privacy, Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, Interpol,Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, Bureau of ExportAdministration and Office of Defense Trade Controls.     According to the defendants, the Office of Intelligence andPolicy Review, INTERPOL-U.S. National Central Bureau andExecutive Office of U.S. Attorneys all conducted "reasonablesearches" for documents in response to Gilmore's request, andfound none.  Therefore, according to the defendants, the courtlacks jurisdiction over these defendants and claims against themmust be dismissed.     "Other defendants " [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and[Office of Legal Counsel] " have completed the processing ofdocuments that they found responsive to plaintiff's FOIArequest," the defendants assert.  "State [Department] and[National Security Agency], however, have been faced withenormous and unforeseeable strains on their informationprocessing resources, and due to the increasing difficulty ofprocessing information requests, and the limited resourcesavailable to them, these defendants have not been able tocomplete the processing of plaintiff's requests within the 10-daystatutory time frame.  Because these defendants are faced with'extraordinary circumstances' and are 'exercising due diligence'in processing the requests, they seek a stay of proceedingspursuant to 5 U.S.C. Section 552(a)(6)(C) to complete theirprocessing of plaintiff's requests."     "Similarly, while the [National Security Council] is not anagency subject to the FOIA, it too is deluged with requests forinformation which likewise strain its ability to respond to thempursuant to its discretionary disclosure policy," the defendantscontend.

Ltd., because it is nondiscriminatoryand will have no effect on the success of Moore's pending proxycontest against the board, a federal judge in Wilmington heldDec. 4.  Moore Corp. Ltd. et al. v. Wallace Computer Services,Inc. et al., No. 95-472 (D DE).     Senior U.S. District Judge Murray Schwartz declined Moore'srequest to enjoin the use of the pill, but he also turned downWallace's counterclaim bid for a preliminary injunction based onthe assertion that an acquisition by Moore would violate federalantitrust laws.     The litigation arose from an attempt by Moore and its whollyowned subsidiary, FRDK, Inc., to launch a tender offer forWallace.  Moore, filing suit less than 24 hours after itannounced the offer, sought to prevent the application ofWallace's anti-takeover measures, such as a poison pill, theDelaware Business Combination Act (which impedes certain mergerswithout the affirmative vote of 80% of the outstanding shares),and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law (whichdelays the consummation of a merger that is not approved by theincumbent board).     Moore sought a preliminary injunction to prevent thedefendant directors from implementing their anti-takeover devices" mainly a poison pill that presented the most serious obstacleto the consummation of its tender offer.  Wallace counterclaimedthat Moore's offer, if consummated, would violate Section 7 ofthe Clayton Act.     Judge Schwartz noted that since the preliminary injunctionhearing during Nov. 7 to 9, he had been "carpet bombed" with a"salmagundi" of documents.               The court found first that although the board's adoption ofa golden parachute and the amendment of the company bylaws torequire a longer advance notice period for shareholder proposalswere not defensive measures, the failure to redeem the poisonpill must be judged under the enhanced scrutiny test of Unocal(Unocal v. Mesa Petroleum Co., DE Sup. Ct. 493 A.2d 946 [1985]).Even under that more demanding test, however, the use of the pillto fend off what the board in good faith believed to be aninadequate offer was reasonable and proportionate, the courtheld.     The use of the pill is not coercive or preclusive because,"[f]irst, retention of the pill will have no discriminatoryeffect on shareholders, as is generally the result in anysituation involving a coercive offer," the court wrote.  "Second,and more important, retention of the pill will have no effect onthe success of the proxy contest."

With fast, reliable andcost-effective communication being essential to maintaining acompetitive edge in today's global marketplace, the inabilityto communicate with clients, vendors, distributors, and otheremployees can hinder growth and stifle profits.With increasing frequency, companies are finding that theyhave a mix of E-mail programs that don't communicate with eachother installed on PCs, Macintoshes, UNIX workstations andlegacy mainframes. When E-mail systems can't communicate witheach other, savings gained by effective communications cannotbe realized.At some point, senior management wakes up to the fact that inthe "paperless office", corporate-wide E-mail is essential.The task of integration is usually assigned to the corporateInformation Systems (IS) group who are faced with thechallenge of integrating the various existing departmentalE-mail systems.This is a complicated task that involves making systemsinteroperate, share directory information and documents acrossdifferent platforms.This does not mean, however, that a standardized,corporate-wide E-mail system needs to be purchased. Mailintegration technology is widely used to connect disparatesystems. The numerous benefits of integrating existing systemsmake the concept a sensible alternative.First, businesses preserve their initial investment. Thisinvestment is not limited to the cost of the original E-mailsystem packages, but includes the cost of servers needed torun the system and the training of users.These users often have limited computer experience and arereluctant to give up their favorite E-mail system afterspending hours getting accustomed to its features andcapabilities. By switching E-mail systems in an effort tostandardize, users are taken out of their friendly computerenvironment and placed into an unknown one.Mail integration software solves this problem by allowingusers to seamlessly communicate with a variety of other mailsystems in a "friendly" manner. The address and message is"switched" to make it appear as if users are communicatingwith a computer on their very same E-mail system!Second, mail integration can buy a company time to implementan enterprise-wide migration strategy to wean users off olderlegacy based mainframe systems and prepare them for astandard-based information system. Additional benefits dependon the particular features offered by the mail integrationsoftware they select.The technological demands of integration are extensive.Choosing a mail integrator requires a careful examination offeatures, benefits and reputation. Integration vendorsapproach the issue differently and the results differ. AlisaSystems has long been an industry leader in mail systemsintegration. They have a reputation for being the best in thebusiness according to high tech computer publications andother independent sources whose job it was to compareintegration systems.Alisa offers a complete mail integration package calledAlisaMail. AlisaMail is a full-featured E-mail switch thatinterconnects the most popular LAN-based electronic mailsystems. It provides seamless and transparent exchange ofelectronic messages, fully editable documents and binary filesbetween WordPerfect GroupWise, Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail,CE Software QuickMail, X.400, SMTP and Digital VMSmail,ALL-IN-1 and Message Router. This includes spread sheets, wordprocessing documents, graphic and binary files. Mostimportantly, AlisaMail is built on a relational database,Sybase, that makes the system extremely flexible. "The reallystrong point of the system is it's easy to customize howinformation is presented." said Don Cole, president of AlisaSystems.The OpenDirectory, Automatic Directory Synchronization andMessage Switch are the strengths of the system and separateAlisaMail from the competition.The OpenDirectory is implemented using a Sybase SQL relationaldatabase and can be used as a corporate directory service.OpenDirectory, a unique AlisaMail feature, eliminatescomplicated addressing schemes by maintaining a common addressbook synchronized with each mail system.This "master" directory can include an address book ofcustomers, employees and vendors that contains informationsuch as their title, organization, department name, E-mail andpostal address, telephone and FAX number, as well as aphotograph. The OpenDirectory provides a centralized addressbook for all the E-mail users in their company. It is accessedby either the user's E-mail client or an Alisa client/serverapplication called PeopleFinder.PeopleFinder supports quick and easy on-line searching of theAlisaMail Open Directory. Users may search specific fields inthe database such as Name, Title, Organization and Location.Available for Windows, Macintosh and DEC VMS, PeopleFinderallows users to browse the OpenDirectory and its contents todisplay information not accessable in the user's address book.Existing desktop client/server development tools andapplications can also be used to access the OpenDirectory.With Sybases's openserver technology you can even connect toother corporate databases.Auto Directory Synchronization works hand in hand with theOpenDirectory and is the key to mail systems integration.Without Auto Directory Synchronization, the Open Directorywould be useless. Open Directory creates and maintains amaster directory of all E-mail users in by requestingdirectory updates from each separate mail system. When changesare made in one E-mail system such as adding, modifying ordeleting an E-mail address, the information is thentransferred to the master directory and then used to updateall the other directories.In medium to large companies where there can be many changes,AlisaMail allows the updating to be performed automatically.The superior performance of our Auto Directory Synchronizationis made possible by the flexibility of the SQL database. "Inessence, AlisaMail makes each mail system's directory anaggregate of all the users. It represents the entirepopulation and there is no distinction in where these peoplelive." said Cole.AlisaMail utilizes a multi-port gateway which connects thedifferent E-mail systems to the AlisaMail Message Switch.The gateway and Message Switch act as a store-and-forwardmessage hub and also handle the conversion of message formatsas required by the E-mail systems. The Message Switchpreserves the functionality of each mail system because itstores the message in its unaltered format. The format of themessage is then converted only if the recipient mail systemrequires conversion. If the receiving mail system does notsupport all the functionality of the sender's, the MessageSwitch will preserve as much functionality as possible.Alisa Systems takes full responsibility for the success ofyour E-mail integration. Alisa Systems will conduct on-sitesurveys to determine your specific mail integration needs andprovide a customized solution. They will even installAlisaMail on site for you, train you and help you fine-tunethe system to maximize performance in your environment."There's lots of bits and places for information to be storedin a corporation and people need access to it," says Cole,"There is a technology out there that can help you run yourbusiness and save money."For more information, call Alisa Systems at (800)628-3274.Back to Headline List WT03-B31-23IA059-000323-B010-323http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec07.html 205.156.212.5 19970114214639 text/html 214620HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:43:36 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:26 GMTContent-length: 214432Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec07.html Sample Issue Copyright COMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNet January 1, 1996 Issue 664 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NEWS The New Face Of Client/Server -- Vendors, integrators see intranets as key to short-term profits (705 words) The New Face Of Client/Server -- Channel conflict looms, but so does opportunity (708 words) Valuation in excess of $400M; Nynex to sell stake -- Vanstar IPO to chip away at $359M debt (747 words) Preferred allocation emerges as strategic weapon (505 words) In Development: InfoPad -- Natioanl Dives Into Nework Computing (309 words) Digital to unveil faster Newton chip to power network computers -- Vendor develops 100MHz, low-voltage processor for delivery in February (514 words) Pact Builds On Current Relationship -- Network Integrity, Entex to partner on LANtegrity sales (457 words) Between The Lines: Lotus Notes misses deadline (41 words) Between The Lines: Out with the old, in with the new (62 words) Between The Lines: Worth Mentioning (152 words) Initiatives: Improve reseller's communication and IT infrastructure -- GTSI Turns Back To Young To Lead Turnaround Charge (346 words) Ingram shows multivendor service menus -- TSS pact gets jump on distribution rivals (380 words) Sneak Preview: Clear Process Clears Way For Automated Work Flow Analysis (494 words) IBM seeks to raise up to $1.75B in cash (316 words) Quarterdeck leads industry stocks with 800% rise in '95 -- Spyglass, U.S. Robotics round out top three issues (473 words) Apple's Plan: Pippin information appliance -- Macworld To Focus On Riding Net Wave, Copland (417 words) Cable vs. Telecommunications Companies -- TCI to roll out flat rate, high-speed Net access (332 words) IBM, Ameritech service partnership could bolster vendor's channel ties (358 words) Proxy reveals former AST execs' compensation deals (518 words) FTC probes need for antitrust-enforcement changes (485 words) OPINION/EDITORIAL For The Record: The Books Are Finally Open (415 words) Plugged In: Wait, Lotus Notes Has A Competitor?

Systemsintegrators said intranets are one clear money maker, and databasevendors said those intranets present a major opportunity tosell their relational databases as back ends to World WideWeb home pages."The biggest market for all of this [Internet activity] is goingto be inside companies," said Phil White, chairman, presidentand chief executive of Informix Software Inc., Menlo Park,Calif. "That's going to drive a lot of business in '96 and'97."Informix sent a clear message about its view of the Internet'sstrategic importance shortly after the roundtable. The databaseprovider disclosed an agreement to acquire Illustra InformationTechnologies Inc., Oakland, Calif., in a stock transactionvalued at nearly $400 million, to strengthen its Web capabilities.Informix, which until recently has held a steadfast line againstgrowth through acquisition, will pay more than 10 times theestimated revenue of Illustra. Informix said the deal willenable it to integrate Illustra technology for managing complexdata, such as Web data, into its core database.Other roundtable participants, including channel executives,said intranets have emerged as a hot button among customers."We think that's going to be a pretty big extension to what'shappening in the Internet," said Jim Sims, president and chiefexecutive of Cambridge Technology Partners Inc., Cambridge,Mass.Several participants cited the Web's potential to loosen MicrosoftCorp.'s long-standing stranglehold on the desktop and the client,given the Web's ease of use and increasing presence. This isgood news for all software vendors, they said, because it meansa more open market."It is obviously an opportunity to change the industry paradigmwhich, at least at the client end, is quickly becoming a monopoly,"said Ray Lane, president of worldwide operations and a boardmember at Oracle Corp., Redwood Shores, Calif."Obviously, if you are a large software company you want tosee that remain open," Lane added.Mitchell Kertzman, executive vice president of Sybase Inc.,Emeryville, Calif., characterized the World Wide Web interfaceas "probably the best, easiest, most intuitive user interfacethat's been developed. I think the real breakthrough is theuser interface breakthrough."But another industry hot button, the low-cost computer withbuilt-in Internet access, dubbed the Internet computer or networkcomputer (NC), was given less upbeat assessments. Internetcomputers have been touted aggressively by Oracle Corp., SunMicrosystems Inc., IBM Corp. and others, though none have actuallyshipped."In my view, the NC stands for no chance," White said.Kertzman predicted such devices will find the greatest applicabilityin mobile and home devices, rather than in corporate America.With two exceptions, most participants found it difficult toidentify specific revenue and profit figures related to Internetofferings. They noted that since Internet functions are beingadded to so many products, it is becoming more difficult todistinguish between revenue from Internet and other offerings."I'd like anybody to be able to sit down and calculate Internetrevenue. Certainly I'd ask, along with that, about profit,"said Bob McDowell, vice president for enterprise customersat Microsoft, Redmond, Wash.Informix's White did offer a bullish forecast, saying Internetrelated revenue could increase from the single digits in 1995to as much as 30 percent to 50 percent of revenue in 1996.Mark Tebbe, president of Chicago-based Lante Corp., meanwhile,predicted his Internet-related business will increase from15 percent to 20 percent in 1995 to 33 percent in 1996.Greg Jacobsen, executive vice president of outsourcing servicesat Ottawa, Ontario-based SHL Systemhouse-which recently wasacquired by MCI Telecommunications Corp.-said his new parentcompany is reaping rich rewards from the Internet by virtueof its being a major provider of Internet access and bandwidth.However, he did not provide specifics.Although precise revenue data may be difficult to obtain, participantsagreed their customers will benefit handsomely from Internetuse.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664The New Face Of Client/Server -- Channel conflict looms, butso does opportunityBy:Craig ZarleyNew York-The accelerated pace of business process re-engineeringand the lack of qualified service people to meet the growingopportunity emerged as dominant issues for both vendor andchannel executives attending the CRN Client/Server Summit."There is a giant gap between the [opportunity] for buildingapplications that are going to be mission-critical and havingpeople who are truly capable of designing and implementingthese systems," said Bob McDowell, Microsoft Corp.'s vice presidentfor enterprise customers.Vendors and resellers are jockeying to find qualified servicepeople and form strategic alliances with each other to capitalizeon the burgeoning opportunity for services. So frenetic isthe pace of change, and so understaffed are both the channeland vendors, that plugging this service gap will be the toppriority in the client/server arena for the coming year."Last year we went from 500 to almost 1,200 [employees], andthis year we'll add another 700 to 800," said Jim Sims, presidentand chief executive of Cambridge Technology Partners Inc.,a Cambridge, Mass.-based systems integrator.For their part, vendors, too, are focusing on the widening servicesgap and are in the process of beefing up their own direct-serviceofferings while trying to avoid conflicts with their channelpartners.While the consensus among roundtable participants was that channelvendor conflicts over services have been kept at a minimum,all of that could change should client/server sales slow down."There is more demand than supply, so all ships rise with thetide," said Ray Lane, Oracle Corp.'s president of worldwideoperations. "No one minds conflict in a market that is growingas fast as this one is. If the market slows down, then you'llsee a much different attitude by vendors that want to builda services business working with the systems integrator channel."But of immediate concern to systems integrators is the potentialfor vendors to make incursions into the channel's service domain.Integrators maintain that conflicts will arise because vendorsadvocate selling their specific products while integratorssell complete solutions."You should choose how you're going to solve the problem, thenchoose the appropriate technology," said Cambridge Technology'sSims. "We come from the viewpoint that we're far more independentto do that than a product company. But I think where you getinto conflict is when product companies try to get into thatspace. There's conflict, and the more the product company getsinto that space, the less we want to work with that company."But Oracle's Lane countered that market conditions may wellforce resellers to more closely align themselves with specificvendors."I believe it's going to be extremely difficult for a consultingbusiness in this kind of . . . market to remain an independent,objective consultant," he said. Rather, Oracle's channel focusin the near term will be on smaller integrators willing todevote resources to the Oracle product line."I've got to take the conflict out, and I'd much prefer [towork with] the largest integrators, and we could subcontracta team to every one of them," Lane said. "But our consultingbusiness is big enough and they'd think twice about it, andthey want to control the customer. I prefer working with smallerintegrators that want to build a business out of Oracle."Greg Jacobsen, executive vice president of SHL Systemhouse Inc.,said the speed at which corporations are re-engineering theirbusiness processes is forcing integrators to deploy packaged,rather than customized, solutions. That phenomenon may, infact, force integrators to more closely align with specificvendors."While we recognize the need to be able to continue to providecustom solutions, we really think that the marketplace moreand more is getting away from that," he said. "They're goingto be very comfortable with a prepackaged model architecturebased on a selected set of partners where you can really addthe deepest value."Microsoft, like Oracle, is building a consulting business, whichis expected to grow to about 1,000 consultants this year.McDowell said Microsoft is aware it must move into service andconsulting to push products, while being careful not to createconflict with the channel.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Valuation in excess of $400M; Nynex to sell stake -- VanstarIPO to chip away at $359M debtBy:ERIC HAUSMANNew York-Vanstar Corp.'s recently filed prospectus reveals ahighly leveraged corporate reseller that is seeking a premiumon Wall Street, compared with its major competitors, with avaluation as high as $492 million.As part of the offering, Nynex Worldwide Services Group Inc.is selling off its 22 percent stake in the company-6.8 millionshares. The company is issuing 8 million shares to the publicwith the goal of attracting as much as $12.50 a share. Mostof the $84.6 million in net proceeds that Vanstar hopes toraise would be used to pay off debt.Vanstar Chairman and Chief Executive William Tauscher does notplan to sell any of his more than 2.2 million shares in thecompany, making him an instant multimillionaire. However, Tauscher's7.1 percent interest in the company will fall to 5.6 percentfollowing the offering. Warburg, Pincus Capital Co. L.P., Vanstar'slargest stockholder, plans to retain its nearly 14 millionshares and will remain the largest single shareholder, witha 35.3 percent stake following the public offering.After the IPO, Vanstar will have more than 39 million sharesoutstanding, resulting in a market capitalization of between$413 million and $492 million. That would be greater than themarket caps of CompuCom Systems Inc. ($349 million), InacomCorp. ($136 million) and MicroAge Inc. ($120 million), basedon last week's closing stock prices.Analysts said those numbers make Vanstar appear relatively expensive,especially given the company's balance sheet, which shows $10.7million in cash on July 31, up from $7.8 million on April 30.Inventories also rose over the same period to $325.4 millionfrom $298.7 million.Vanstar lists $359.4 million in long-term debt, most of whichconsists of $357.8 million in indebtedness to IBM Credit Corp.Vanstar has a $425 million line of credit under a financingagreement with ICC. Stockholders' equity is $25.7 million."The balance sheet is pretty weak. They are very leveraged,"said Benny Lorenzo, portfolio manager at PAW Partners L.P.,Greenwich, Conn. "They are pricing this towards the high endof the comparable companies, and they would have to show anypotential investors why we should pay such a high value fora new company when you can get an existing company for a cheapervaluation."Vanstar has spent much of the past several years in the red.After its 1993 fiscal year, Vanstar changed its fiscal calendarto end April 30 from ending Sept. 30. For the 1992 fiscal year,ended Sept. 30, the company lost nearly $52 million, and in1993, Vanstar lost an additional $4.2 million.For the seven months ended April 30, 1994, the company recordeda $45 million gain resulting in $44.5 million in net income,but it still reported an operating loss. But for its most recentfiscal year, ended April 30, Vanstar earned $1.3 million andreported operating income of $26.8 million.Sales during the past fiscal year reached $1.39 billion.Vanstar does appear to have turned the corner recently, reporting$427 million in sales and $3.5 million in net income for thequarter ended July 31.Lorenzo said one key message the company will have to get acrossduring its upcoming road show is future projections as servicesbecome an integral part of the business.In its July quarter, Vanstar's product sales accounted for 40percent of overall operating revenue, while support servicesrepresented nearly 38 percent. Networking sales accounted for12.1 percent, while other services accounted for the remaining9.8 percent.Still, Vanstar hopes to transform into a more service-orientedintegration company and is going to experience growing painsin that arena. Vanstar's support-services business posted a$900,000 operating loss for the period, while product salesresulted in an operating income of $8.3 million.In addition, the prospectus shows Tauscher earned $550,008 plusa $30,000 bonus for the 1995 fiscal year, ended April 30. JayAmato, Vanstar's president and chief operating officer, earned$256,254 plus a $25,000 bonus.The prospectus also provided insight into Vanstar's relationshipwith Merisel Inc.'s FAB division, formed in January 1994 afterVanstar sold ComputerLand Corp. to the distributor. The productdistribution agreement between the two companies, expiringthis month, called for Vanstar to keep one-half of its inventoryto maintain its obligations under the Merisel distributionservices agreement. Vanstar's assets include a $19.4 millionreceivable from Merisel that matures this month, the prospectusstates.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Preferred allocation emerges as strategic weaponBy:JACK SWEENEYLondon-Priority allocation is emerging as the weapon of choiceamong major PC vendors with IBM Corp. and Toshiba Corp. leadingthe charge in the battle to enlist channel allies as part oftheir aggressive global reselling programs.During the past year, virtually all major PC vendors have launchedglobal reselling strategies to address the needs of large accountsseeking a central point of PC procurement for their worldwideoperations. Missing from the equation, however, is preferredallocation, a perk long enjoyed by corporations participatingin vendors' national large-account programs.IBM and Toshiba are among the first to make preferred productallocation a bona fide component of their global strategies,and they are working with their resellers to reserve inventoryfor specific global customers. "We have been working with themanagement in each of our countries to help [accent] the needsof global customers," said Neils Rokkebal, IBM Europe's chiefoperating officer.Close behind, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp.now also are addressing customer allocation demands on a projectby-project basis. However, formalized global allocation programscurrently are under consideration by the two PC manufacturers,reseller executives said."Global customers have made it clear to the manufacturers thatthe failure of their subsidiaries to allocate needed producthas put the rollouts of global computer projects in jeopardy,"said Anne Renders, director of marketing for InternationalComputer Group, a consortium of international dealers thatwork together on global contracts."In the past, allocation had been fragmented for global customers,and we're now eradicating that by recognizing them as trulyglobal accounts and rolling out a type of allocation red-carpettreatment," said Chris Tripp, Toshiba's U.K. corporate accountssales manager and one of the architects of the vendor's newlyminted global allocation plan.Accelerating the move toward global allocation strategies isthe fact that the large global accounts already receive priorityallocation for their U.S. operations."It's important to global clients that what they get in theU.S. is similar to what they get outside the U.S.," said JeffreyFrankel, vice president of MicroAge Inc.'s international operations.Steve Caskey, director of international sales for Inacom Corp.,said priority supply has become a common request among Inacom'sglobal customers. "There is no question IBM and Toshiba, inparticular, are now responding to what our global customershave been asking for," Caskey said.By working closer with global customers and resellers, vendorsare hoping to curtail shortages through better product forecasting."When you get approached by a large customer with special needsin terms of product and delivery expectation, you've got tobe able to feel fairly confident that you can meet those needsto keep the customer happy," said David Howarth, internationalmarketing manager at Entex Information Services Inc., Rye Brook,N.Y."We don't look at customers on a country-by-country basis.

"You'll see National focusing on the total system'sarchitecture, at least so it will do a better job of respondingto the parts of the architecture [for which] it's responsible."Oracle Corp. and IBM Corp. have outlined plans to scale downthe PC's intelligence, memory and cost, as well as launch informationand software from the network. Both Oracle and IBM are workingon network computers priced in the $500 range.National's plan is to create flexibility in its hardware andsemiconductor lines. Hancock said she is keen on offering devicesthat come in different styles, levels of sophistication andprice points.In addition, National is looking into partnerships with companiesthat focus on storing and retrieving data from a network."We are getting more database-aware," Hancock said.

Oracle Corp. of Redwood Shores, Calif.,is considering the new Digital StrongARM processor as the basisfor its $500 Internet device, sources said.StrongARM, based on the Newton processor designed by AdvanceRISC Machines Ltd., Cambridge, England, initially will runas fast as 200MHz at 2 volts vs. the Newton chip, which currentlyruns at 33MHz at 5 volts."[The StrongARM] has good power management on a screaming chip,"said Tim Schmidt, a principal at Encore Consulting Group, Orlando,Fla.Digital, which licensed the Newton chip and is working withAdvance RISC Machines, also will introduce 100MHz and 160MHzversions of the chip, with prices starting at $30 for shipmentsof 10,000 per year for the 100MHz version.Samples of the new StrongARM processor, the SA-110, will beavailable in February, with volume shipments scheduled forthe spring.The processor, which Digital will manufacture in its Hudson,Mass., facility, could be key in making Internet devices areality and the Apple Computer Inc. Newton MessagePad-longthe target of criticism for poor performance-a success, analystssaid.Jim Turley, senior editor at the Microprocessor Report, predictedthat Apple will use Digital's chips in its MessagePads by theend of this year."The StrongARM will make the Newton a very useful item," Turleysaid. He estimates the StrongARM is eight to 10 times fasterthan the ARM 610 in current Newton models.The new processor could give the Newton voice-recognition capabilities,a source said. "People would be able to dictate a message thatthey want to fax out," said one source familiar with Digital'splans.Officials at Oracle and Apple could not be reached for comment.The source said the 100MHz version of the StrongARM will performat 115 million instructions per second at 1.5 volts. The 160MHzchip will run at 185 MIPS at 1.5 volts, and the 200MHz processorwill run at 230 MIPS at 2 volts.The chip also may prove attractive to the handheld and set-topbox market, analysts said.One major obstacle Digital faces in making the chip a staplein the Internet device market may be out of its control: thelack of low-price network bandwidth to speed up browsing onthe Internet.Other industry realities pose problems as well. "The handheldmarket has been stymied by the lack of synergy between thehandheld systems and the desktop systems," said Andy Seybold,editor-in-chief of Outlook on Communications and Computing.The lukewarm response to ARM technology also is troublesome,analysts said. Apple is the only major company that has boughtinto the ARM technology, Schmidt said.

Entex also will preconfigurecustomers' servers with the software to simplify the installationprocess for the reseller."Entex is one of the largest national resellers of network serviceswith good technical abilities and configuration abilities,"said John Butler, vice president of Network Integrity, basedin Marlborough.Butler said this agreement is the result of Network Integrity'ssatisfaction with its current relationship with Entex and adesire to expand that partnership."Entex gets a product that opens the door to large accounts,"Butler said, because LANtegrity is not intended for small businesses."It gives us sales and technical support in many cities," hesaid."This product is one which you put in if a customer has manyservers. If [a customer] has hundreds of employees, it attractsthose large employers that Entex likes to add to their customerbase," Butler said.With LANtegrity, Entex will be able to help customers reducenetwork downtime and lost productivity and eliminate the needfor multiple servers at a single site, all of which would decreasecosts for their customers.Brad Curtis, software business manager at Entex, said the resellerwill configure LANtegrity servers for customers at its ISO9000 certified Integration and Distribution Center in Kentucky.Curtis said that the partnership with Network Integrity allowsEntex to distribute the servers as turnkey solutions to itscustomers. "Computer crashes are a fact of life," Curtis said."We're working to create a seamless delivery to customers,"he said.Several Entex customers-including AT&T Corp., NordicTrack Inc.and Sherwin Williams Co.-now use LANtegrity.LANtegrity is suited for large corporations since one LANtegrityserver can back up multiple servers, unlike other backup solutionswhere a backup is necessary for each network server, Butlersaid. When LANtegrity is used for a server cluster, if anyof the servers in the group fail, LANtegrity instantaneouslysteps in, he said.A LANtegrity server can support up to 1,000 users on multipleNetWare servers and protects current and historical files within15 seconds of failure. Butler said other backup products usea "mirroring" method in which servers perform the same tasksat the same time and only protect against hardware failures.If the failure is in the software, the most current uncorruptedfiles are not protected.One LANtegrity server can back up from five to 10 servers, dependingon the number of supported users and activity level, Butlersaid.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Between The Lines: Lotus Notes misses deadlineLotus Development Corp.'s Notes Release 4.0 did not make itout the door in time for the promised year-end release.

Experts said Young is the best choice to turn arounda company which, despite being in the best position in thefederal market, has struggled in its most recent quarters.For its third quarter ended Sept. 30, 1995, the busiest buyingseason in the federal market, GTSI's sales dropped 22 percentto $175.7 million. Its net income plummeted over 70 percent,to $1.7 million, compared to the same quarter a year before."He is the best-qualified person to bail-out the current GTSIsituation," said Thomas Hewitt, president of Federal SourcesInc., McLean, Va. "It is fundamentally a good company, andI think Dendy will be able to achieve the full potential ofthat company. Everybody wins on this."For his part, Young cautioned that the turnaround may take sometime, saying it could be two years before all his initiativestake hold. The financial community, which has been hard onthe company of late, reacted well. GTSI's stock inched up 47cents, to $4.13 per share, the day of the news and reached$4.38 in the ensuing days.Young said the two major long-term areas of focus for GTSI willbe on communication and the IT infrastructure.On the communication side, Young said improvements must be madewith GTSI's customer base, the vendor community and the reseller'sown employees.As for using new technology, Young said, "This business demandswe be efficient. We will be on the leading edge of the technologycurve."In addition to hiring Young, GTSI also named Peter Janke executivevice president.

Merisel Inc.,El Segundo, Calif., and Tech Data Corp., Clearwater, Fla.,have been negotiating with third-party services providers toprovide similar offerings.Ingram, however, entered into an alliance with its primary serviceprovider, Technology Service Solutions, Wayne, Pa., a littleover a year ago.Since then, Ingram has worked with TSS and some of its PremierVARs on packaging multivendor services and bringing them intotwo-tiered distribution, said Franz Roosen, senior managerof field services for Ingram.Service sales have begun to ramp exponentially in past months,and now about 1,000 of the Premier VARs buy service throughIngram, Roosen said.Dan Wasser, vice president of marketing for National Guest SystemsCorp., Rockville, Md., which provides vertical solutions forhotels and restaurants, said, "We've been looking for thissolution for a long time. I need firm [seven-day, 24-hour]support because my clients are hotels. I need someone out thereto fix it if it breaks."Wasser said because many of the accounts are small, one- andtwo-site hotels, large providers do not contract directly forthe business.Corporate Micro Systems Inc., Rolling Meadows, Ill., increasedservice contracts from 15 to 50 since starting Ingram's programsix months ago.

Thisis accomplished by analyzing alternative workflow paths. Evensuch sophisticated processes as manufacturing can be tamedby Clear Process.Engineers from the CRN Test Center found that the program creates,with minimal effort, flow charts based on manual input or batchimport of text-based procedures. Once the work flow is built,which can sometimes be done in minutes through the selectionof a menu choice, all possible work-flow paths are followed.The critical paths and all others are identified, and correspondingdata are extracted and exported for analysis in a MicrosoftExcel spreadsheet.Resellers should like the product's automated features, whichinclude automatic geometry and arrow drawing for perfect alignment,and automatically corrected printer page breaks and connectors.These features assure that no process boxes are amputated bythe edge of a page.The opportunity for resellers is to sell to auditors, productionmanagers, project managers, company controllers, and profitand-loss analysts. Resellers with expertise in process automationshould have no difficulty becoming a consultant to issues inthat particular industrial-engineering discipline.Clear Process tightly integrates the previously released allClearIII product into a complete process analysis solution. ClearSoftware's allClear III offers the ability to create graphicalflowcharts from a company's existing set of ASCII text-basedprocedures, dBASE files, Lotus 1-2-3 or Excel spreadsheets,without having to rekey the data. It was a simple matter tofollow a simple set of punctuation rules; the charts flowedforth like water.Both text and chart are active and visible side by side; textediting can be done from either side, and chart additions madeby using drag-and-drop templates.Changes made to charts in the left-hand window are reflectedin the text in the right. Charts are automatically redrawn,re-routed and re-sized after each edit, and page connectorsare drawn automatically. This module also offers self-documentation,diagram rotation, support for multiple open diagrams, advancedediting features, a runtime viewer and network support; also,it is an OLE server.The Clear Process interface is based on a straightforward, fivestep procedure for the entire process. Standout analysis toolsinclude the abilities to identify the critical and optimalpaths of a process; to analyze alternatives easily; to assignprobabilities to workflow paths based on company statisticsor other probability data; and to perform and see animated"what-if" scenarios based on factors such as time and cost.The product also offers the ability to rapidly create workflowprototypes with instant feedback and presentation graphics.Examination of the product, done in the confines of the CRNTest Center on a Pentium-based PC, yielded snappy performance.Clear Process, however, is perfectly at home on a 486-basedunit.

MOLTZENNew York-AST Research Inc. made about $3 million in lump-sumpayments to executives to whom it showed the door last year,with its former president reaping the most, according to aproxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission.Jim Schraith, the company's former president, was paid a lumpsum of $1.5-million after leaving the company, in connectionwith his employment agreement, AST disclosed.Scott Smith, AST's vice president and general manager of desktopproducts, was paid $477,500. James Wittry, who left the companyas senior vice president of the Americas, was paid $461,600.And Richard Ottaviano, senior vice president of administration,was paid $720,100 to leave the company.The exodus of top executives at AST climaxed with the Nov. 2,1995, hiring of former Apple Computer Inc. executive Ian Dieryto be the Irvine, Calif.-based PC maker's chief executive.AST will pay Diery a base salary of $700,000 per year, plusstock options worth at least $10 million over the next sevenyears.Should AST's share price rise to $40 in the next nine monthsa long shot with the company's stock now trading at about $8.50per share-Diery would reap $40-million.From Diery's hiring to mid-December, AST's share price droppedfrom $9.38, even as South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Corp.continued on its track to take over majority ownership of thecompany and provide AST with much needed financing.Last month, Samsung signed another deal with AST to offer abank line or line of credit of up to $200 million through Dec.31, 1997, and a vendor line of credit from Samsung to AST of$100 million through Nov. 30, 1997, for purchases of components.In exchange, AST will give Samsung an option to buy 4.4 millionadditional shares of the company at an exercise price of 1cent per share, which can be exercised after June 30, 1996.The option expires on June 30, 2001.According to the company, a $100 investment in AST stock onJune 30, 1990, was worth $130 on July 1, 1995.In addition to the options, AST gave Diery a "relocation allowance"of $500,000 for moving expenses.Qureshey Stays OnThe company also revealed in its proxy statement that AST cofounder Safi Qureshey, who stepped aside as chief executiveto make room for Diery, is staying on as an employee and chairmanof the board at AST-but not without a personal cost.The company said Qureshey agreed to cut his $650,000 annualsalary to $325,000 "until the company returns to profitability."The company also said Qureshey "agreed not to currently enforcethe terms of the existing [employment] agreement with respectto termination for 'good reason.' "However, if new corporate leadership from Samsung decides tofire Qureshey without cause, Qureshey would be eligible fora "golden parachute" severance clause of approximately $2 million.The executive shuffling at AST came while the company continuedexperiencing losses. Analysts generally applauded the moves,especially the hiring of Diery.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664FTC probes need for antitrust-enforcement changesBy:DARRYL K. TAFTWashington-The Software Publishers Association is calling forstricter antitrust scrutiny in the computer software industry.In recent testimony before the Federal Trade Commission, theSPA called for greater antitrust enforcement for the kindsof practices that competitors have claimed against MicrosoftCorp.The SPA conducted a survey of its membership, which includescompanies such as Microsoft, Borland International Inc., NovellInc., Symantec Corp., IBM Corp., Netscape Communications Inc.,America Online Inc. and CompuServe Inc.The survey results "suggest our membership supports a continuedand indeed in some respects heightened-government antitrustenforcement presence in the software industry," said Ken Wasch,president of the SPA.The FTC held a series of hearings, which ended late last month,on competitiveness in the IT industry. Though the hearingshave ended, the record remains open until the end of Januaryfor additional comments.Also, though the FTC is not involved in the ongoing U.S. Departmentof Justice investigation of Microsoft, the agency is expectedto share its findings with the Justice Department, sourcessaid.Among the organizations that testified before the FTC were theSPA, Borland, Sun Microsystems Inc., IBM, the Computer andCommunications Industry Association and the Alliance to PromoteSoftware Innovation (APSI)The SPA hired Public Opinion Strategies, Alexandria, Va., todraft the 13 questions for the survey and send them to itsmembership. Sources said Microsoft, which sits on the SPA board,did not agree with some of the questions and that 11 of the13 questions were changed at least once to accommodate Microsoft.Microsoft could not be reached for comment.Most survey respondents said they see greater anticompetitivepractices in the industry compared to 10 years ago. Eight in10 respondents said "concerns about unlawful, anticompetitive,or monopolistic activity in the software industry are greaterthan they were 10 years ago." However, smaller firms-with revenueunder $10 million a year-said they see greater anticompetitiveactivity than do larger firms: 82 percent vs. 71 percent."Over-concentration of market power in the hands of one company"was the top item, mentioned by 56 percent of respondents. Insecond place was "control of a computing platform with dominantmarket share," with 29 percent of the mentions.Also, most respondents said they see the emergence of dominantplayers as increasing entry barriers for new companies; areconcerned that a company with dominance in computing platformsmay parlay that dominance to control other segments of themarket; and also believe the emergence of a dominant softwarecompany would make it more difficult to introduce new and innovativeproducts and to allow other companies to compete on a fairand even basis.Three quarters of the SPA members that responded to the surveysaid "the emergence of dominant players in key segments ofthe software industry increases barriers to entry for new softwarecompanies."Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664For The Record: The Books Are Finally OpenBy:Robert FaletraFor as long as I've been covering the channel, everyone hasbeen dying to see some real numbers on two companies, ChipLacy's Ingram Micro and Bill Tauscher's Vanstar.In the next few months, both of those wishes will come trueas the two companies make public offerings.Vanstar's filing with the SEC is on the street now showing someinteresting tidbits.While Ingram's filing is still a few weeks off, one thing thatthe Vanstar and Ingram offering once again will prove is thatthe channel's margins are razor thin. This is another reasonwhy I'm always shaking my head when manufacturers decide thatthe best way to get to market is via a direct approach whenthe channel is so efficient.But let's take a look at the Vanstar offering: Nynex, whichowns 6.7 million shares as a result of selling the Nynex BusinessCenters to Vanstar several years ago, is selling all of itsshares in the company. If the estimated $12.50 offering holds,the telephone company stands to walk away with $84.6 million.Tauscher, the sixth-largest shareholder, will hold nearly $28million in Vanstar stock (at least on paper) after the publicoffering if the $12.50 per share holds.Interestingly, Nynex is the only major stockholder cashing out.According to the initial public offering documents, the companyplans to use the proceeds from the offering for one purposereducing debt. That includes payment of a $2.4 million noteowed to Nynex .Vanstar holds a $425 million line of credit with IBM CreditCorp. Vanstar intends to use proceeds of the offering to repayamounts outstanding under the ICC financing program agreement.That agreement, according to the papers, is used to financeworking capital, approximately $358 million of which was outstandingas of July 31, 1995.The filing points out that Vanstar has a "Limited History ofProfitability," experiencing losses in fiscal years 1991, 1992and 1993, as well as during the seven months ending April 30,1994.The papers also show, however, that Vanstar recently increasedits business focus on network services and expects to increaseits percentage of operating income from its service business.That's where the potential investor gain lies and why Vanstarmight just be a good bet for the future despite its past problems.ROBERT FALETRA can be reached via telephone at (516) 733-8612;Internet: rfaletra@crn.cmp.com; or MCI: 585-5795.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Plugged In: Wait, Lotus Notes Has A Competitor?By:Mark CubanOK, it's time for Mark to put an end to some unbelievable stupidityin the marketplace.The Web is not a competitor to Lotus Notes. It may be at somepoint in the future, depending on what Netscape does with CollabraShare, but as of today, there is nothing about the Web thatcan compete with Notes.Before I explain, I would be remiss if I didn't mention thatthe Web owes its very existence to Lotus Notes. How? Very simple.If Jim Manzi had any marketing skills whatsoever, there wouldbe no Web. Instead, we would have a global Notes network. It'sa shame Manzi never worked for Microsoft or even for Netscape,had it existed. He would have learned about building marketsand pre-empting competitors. (The punchline is if Lotus hadbeen selling Windows, it would cost $795 per copy, until IBMbought it. . . . But I digress.)Why is the Web not a competitor to Notes? Take the test. WithNotes I can replicate to my PC any data I have access to. Nowtry this at home. Go to any Web page, try to download it, thenlook at it on your PC and use it. It's impossible without goingthrough each document and individually downloading the graphicsand redefining the links. Now just think, you want to downloadthe sales plan. . . . Yeah, right.Next, try creating a threaded discussion database on the Web.Sure, you could use IRC Chat, but without threads. Sure, youcould create a List Serv that could be threaded, but how doyou distribute it?Next try this: Distribute information among multiple Web serversand synchronize it. It isn't going to be pretty, if it happensat all.All of these people out there who say the Web is a competitorto Notes probably have not used either. Notes has been misunderstoodby the press. Exchange, Perfect Office and all these Noteswanna-be's never have amounted to anything more than giveawaymail clients that the press has declared Notes competitors.This is not to say that IBM doesn't have challenges with Notes.It definitely does. They have made a smart move in reducingthe price of the Notes client. They probably should do everythingpossible to have it bundled with every business computer sold,even if it means paying the Compaqs and HPs of the world toput it on their computers. They probably should do everythingpossible to create "Notes-Enabled" Web sites or "Powered-byNotes" Web sites that highlight the capabilities Notes hasto publish data on the Web, even if it means seeding leadingsites with free software.So IBM, contrary to what they think, you are still in the driver'sseat. And you are in a race-but at least it's a race you stillcan win.Tell me what you think.

While we lookto the market to determine applications, our commitment toAT&T Network Notes and its customers remains firm. AT&T hasnot announced any plans to offer GroupWise XTD on its collaborativemessaging platform or on AT&T NetWare Connect Service (ANCS)The article implies AT&T is setting up a rivalry between AT&TNetwork Notes and a planned competitive GroupWise XTD service.We are not planning a rivalry. That's not our role. The ANCSplatform will provide easy access to many applications in thefuture.AT&T has no plans to "fold both of the services (AT&T NetworkNotes and AT&T NetWare Connect Service) together into one infrastructure,"as your article stated. AT&T NetWare Connect Service will provideone type of access to AT&T Network Notes. The two will remainas separate services that leverage each other's technical advantages.The quote from Rose Klimovich, AT&T ANCS product line director,was taken out of context. The article quoted Rose stating that"Network Notes will 'partially share' the same infrastructureand that users could access Network Notes through ANCS." Again,ANCS will provide access to AT&T Network Notes.Gary Hickox, VP,AT&T Collaboration & Imaging ServicesErik Grimmelman, VP,AT&T NetWare Connect ServiceEditor's Note: CRN stands behind its story, which reported thatAT&T and Novell plan to offer an alternative to AT&T NetworkNotes in the form of a version of GroupWise XTD running onAT&T NetWare Connect Services.To The Editor:Your article in the Dec. 11 issue ("The Biggest Stories of 1995")is far-fetched, and too general. "NT's rampage caused Novell to regroup, . . . "What rampage? Novell, for fiscal year 1995, shipped more NetWarethan at any other time in our history. Our company revenuegrew based primarily on the strength of NetWare 4.1. We shippedmore than 700,000 NetWare server licenses in fiscal year '95,and NetWare 4.1 accounted for 40 [percent] of those shipments,driving a year-over-year increase in [NetWare] 4.1 server licensesales of more than 300 [percent] and sales of upgrades to [NetWare]4.1 from previous versions of NetWare grew nearly 400 [percent][Robert] Frankenberg's message since taking [the] helm has been,and continues to be, "Novell is the leading network softwareprovider. Novell software provides the infrastructure for anetworked world, enabling our customers to connect with otherpeople and the information they need, anytime and anyplace."Novell is a networking company. The Applications Division didnot make sense in this core strategy, though Novell will supportand have an interest in the new owners of the Apps Division.Remember, the purchase of [WordPerfect] happened before Frankenbergassumed control.As for our influence, we are king. We are open to standardsand to working with as many companies as we can so that wecan network the world. Do the companies Oracle, Apple, AT&T,IBM, SCO, Hewlett-Packard [and] Intel ring a bell? The noninfluencecomes from the press, [which insists] on following the cloudedand ever-diverse strategy of Microsoft.

(CRN, Nov. 27, 1995)I had one additional idea, but first I wanted to disclose thatI am tied to this industry that I thought had a better idea.Upstairs in the Sands, there was a group of vendors all providingvoice recognition systems all together in one area. I foundthat an excellent idea to provide head-to-head competitionbetween vendors. This allows the person attending to get aquick comparison of vendors of a particular technology.I would enjoy seeing more of this type of cooperation betweenopposing vendors in setting up their booths within the samearea to provide "comparison shopping."Again, I am a vendor for voice recognition products, so thisis in effect a slap on our own backs.This fits in with your own ideas/problems, where it is incrediblydifficult to find a particular booth, or to ensure that youhit all of the vendors you wish to see.Mark S.

DeMarzoThere is a certain air that only people in the client/servercommunity possess. An air of confidence. They walk with a certainattitude. They fly at a different altitude than the rest ofthe market, see through issues that most take for granted orcannot comprehend. Their adeptness at complex technical issuesand entrenchment in databases, Unix and enterprise networkshave always set this group apart.This year's annual CRN Client/Server Roundtable, bringing togetherthe best and brightest in the client/server world, once againgives our readers the inside edge on the hottest and most excitingmarket.Client/server computing has grown up more than any of us couldimagine. It has taken a quantum leap in only the last 12 months.Much of this has been driven by the Internet, the rise of serviceand support, shorter business process re-engineering cyclesand the promise of Windows NT. Supporting all this is the appearanceof shrink-wrap-like client/server applications, such as a salesforce automation package that runs on top of Oracle, Informixor Sybase databases. Any reseller out there that does not knowthose companies better get with the program.No longer is anyone consumed with finding some all-encompassingdefinition of client/server computing. It simply exists andhas manifested itself in just about every large corporationin the United States and growing numbers of small and mediumsize businesses, as well.The first part of the CRN Client/Server Roundtable appears inthis week's issue beginning on page 1 with the news storiesand a transcript of what the executives had to say about businessopportunities on the Internet. The client/server bunch is salivatingover the sudden rise of the Internet. They've got the powerfuldatabases, the tools, the services, the expertise and the abilityto get businesses up and running on the Net. But they believethe real money to be made today lies in the Intranet, corporatenetworks with gateways and access to the Net. Informix ChairmanPhil White states rather plainly, "The biggest market for allof this is going to be inside companies. They're spending themoney, they've got the need for sales-force automation, customerservice, customer support. That's going to drive a lot of businessbig time in '96 and '97."Resellers looking for business and service models to emulatewould be wise to listen to the players at this year's ClientServer Roundtable. This is where the rubber meets the road,where resellers are evaluating, quickly delivering businesssolutions and recommending products that bring competitiveadvantages.

"The company was foundedon OEM and channel relationships."To that end, the Westboro-based company recently restructuredits channel organization under Anderson and boosted resellersupport in several areas.Data General also is in the throes of a major product transition,pitching its new Intel-based servers to resellers.Last quarter, Data General expanded its AViiON family of Unixbased systems with Pentium-based models that run either theData General/UX enterprise operating system or Windows NT Server.They support 15,000 existing AViiON applications, accordingto the company.But the channel is at the core of its aim at the midrange market."We're putting a lot more resources and investment into partnerships,"Anderson said. "Clearly, we have a support problem. We're aggressivelytrying to educate our partners."The company is launching efforts to smooth things over withresellers, he said. For one, it added more account managersto enable the company to better understand the resellers' businessand how they integrate its products and services, he added.Each account manager oversees between two and four accounts,unlike previously, when they managed about 25 each, Andersonsaid. A dedicated technical support manager will oversee resellers'presales and technical support.Data General also placed people within its distributors-GatesFA Distributing Inc. and Western Micro Technology Inc.-to overseethe Data General line. The company expects to add a third distributorin the next six months.In other areas, Data General revamped its reseller contract,reducing the number of product categories and the dollar valuelevels resellers must commit to purchase. Other efforts includelead generation and consultation on the use of co-op dollars."We've allocated a pool of equipment and technical people tohelp move products over," he said. "All the major databaseproducts are running on our platform. That's key to gettingchannel partners to move over."Data General wants to focus on training more, as well, Andersonsaid. Free seminars will be offered to partners each quarter."If we bring the level of expertise up in the VAR community,it'll help alleviate the support problem," he said.And to make it easier for resellers to do business with DataGeneral, the company is beta-testing a configuration and orderentry software product called Trilogy that it expects to rollout to the channel by April.While the ratio of direct vs. channel sales fluctuates now between70-30 and 60-40, Data General hopes to move as much as 55 percentthrough the channel in the next year, Anderson said.Some Data General partners, while acknowledging that the companymay gain more support with its Intel-based line, said DataGeneral may lose what distinguishes it from the rest of thepack."I'm wondering whether it will cause a glitch for them," saidLeonard LaFrance, executive vice president of ISV Century AnalysisInc., Pacheco, Calif.

Wyle will not be providing fulfillmentfor Platinum software, however."What's great about Wyle is they're really making it a plugand play for our VARs, so even if our VARs haven't traditionallybeen involved in selling hardware, they're making it easy forthem to get involved with Alpha equipment," said Kevin Regelsberg,vice president of sales, Platinum.Regelsberg said Platinum is marketing its product to Wyle'sVARs, while Wyle expects to pick up customers among Platinum'sVARs. VARs that sign up with Wyle will get $1,500 in marketingfunds to jump-start their efforts, he said.Digital and Platinum plan to kick off a 20-city tour in Februaryto promote the Alpha NT and Platinum SQL NT solution to endusers and generate leads for VARs, said Lynn Annecston, businessmanager for Digital's Software Partners Group.Annecston said Digital has worked with Platinum since last springand has 18 to 20 North American reference sites.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Fore, Alantec to merge; may boost migration to ATMBy:Monica YoungPittsburgh -Fore Systems Inc. and Alantec Corp. said they intendto merge the two companies to accelerate migration from LANto asynchronous-transfer-mode (ATM) networks.Under terms of the deal, each of 12 million outstanding sharesof Alantec stock will be converted to one share of Fore stock,and Alantec will become a wholly owned LAN-switching subsidiaryof Fore.For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, Fore's revenue was$75.6 million. For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 1994, Alantec'srevenue was $25.8 million.Alantec, San Jose, Calif., granted Fore an option to purchaseup to 12 percent of its outstanding shares. George Archuleta,chairman and chief executive of Alantec, will become a memberof Fore's board of directors once the merger is completed.Eric Cooper will remain chairman and chief executive of Fore.Fore acquired Applied Network Technology Inc. in May, whichwas the first time Fore became involved in indirect-sales channels.According to a Fore spokesperson, the company's distributionmodels are complementary and no changes are expected in Alantec'sreseller channels."I would expect Fore to take advantage of Alantec's high-endresellers," said Steve Munroe, president of Triumph TechnologiesInc., a Burlington, Mass.-based Alantec integrator. He saidmost of Alantec's high-end channel partners have the skillset to sell Fore's ATM line, so Alantec's channels would bea good match for Fore.Munroe said the merger will not likely accelerate ATM migrationfor customers that are otherwise not ready to make that leap;however, it simplifies the process for resellers because theynow can work with a single vendor.In addition, he said Alantec's ATM migration strategy was basedon Fore's ATM products.

Instead, services are becoming the hub around whichcustomers are orbiting.By partnering with Ingram, Vanstar executives said they willsoon match the more uniform fulfillment strategies of servicesgiants such as EDS Corp. and distance itself from the lessseamless fulfillment schemes of its reseller rivals such asEntex Information Services Inc. and Inacom Corp., which nowsupport global customers through overseas affiliates."We have a list of about 25 different resellers right now thatare Europe- as well as U.S.-based; and of those, we expecta fair number to become [fulfillment] partners of ours in 1996,"said John Winkelhaus, senior vice president of Ingram MicroEurope. "We are helping them leapfrog certain U.S. competitorsbecause even though we are charging them for fulfillment, itwill be less costly than if they tried to do it themselvesand we already have it in place, allowing them to focus onsupplying IT services."Richard Simms, chairman and chief executive of Software SpectrumInc., a Dallas-based software reseller that today allows Ingramto supply product fulfillment services to its European customers,said, "It is almost inconceivable to me that Software Spectrumwould ever start operating distribution centers in Europe oranywhere else in the world."Christine Ferrusi Ross, an analyst with Dataquest Corp., Framingham,Mass., said growth in the number of offshore fulfillment pactsreflects a growing urgency among national resellers to provideglobal solutions. "I think you can either be a global playertoday or you can be a local regional player, but you can'treally compete on a national level anymore unless you're willingto compete globally," said Ferrusi Ross.Vanstar's rivals praised the reseller's initiative and the speedwith which it hoped to link up with Ingram, but said it wastoo early to determine the model's effectiveness.Peter Alexander, the former head of Vanstar's Global subsidiaryComputerLand International, said the model might resemble theone now being built by Ameridata Corp., which last June hiredAlexander to run its global operations."I think, generally, Vanstar's direction is the same one we'vebeen following and the question that has to be raised is whatexactly will the new Vanstar model entail? Will it be one organization'umbrella-ing' its franchisees, or is it a hybrid between theVanstar and its franchisees?" said Alexander.Last month, Vanstar Chairman William Tauscher said Vanstar'smodel would try to leverage the different skill sets of ComputerLandInternational's franchisees."The product supply network that we are putting together ona worldwide basis will be available to our franchisees forPan-European arrangements and, in addition to that, we willbe enlisting our franchisees as high-end providers in conjunctionwith our own high-end network operations that we are now openingup in multiple countries," said Tauscher.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Channel sets sights on a more prosperous 1996 -- Putting problemplagued 1995 behind the industryBy:ERIC HAUSMANEDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second part of a look at businessissues facing the industry.New York-If 1996 is any different than 1995 for the industry'sleading channel players, it has to be an improvement.After suffering through a year of slow systems conversions,open sourcing, intense pricing pressures and numerous quarterlylosses, channel companies are looking forward to putting 1995behind them in hopes of a better 1996.

And many channel observers feel thatmove, combined with the expected IPO of Ingram Micro Inc.,Santa Ana, Calif., in the coming months, will help the entiresector. Entex Information Services Inc., Rye Brook, N.Y., mayalso enter the public market this year.In addition, recent results from Tech Data Corp., Clearwater,Fla., indicate the company is back on track. CompuCom SystemsInc., Dallas, is projected to continue to benefit from itsemphasis on integration and services.

Broadview recorded 684 transactionsin the IT industry during the first half of 1995 alone, comparedwith 760 total transactions in all of 1994.The study predicts the highest rates of merger and acquisitionactivity will occur in the software products and services,and telecommunications sectors. In that area, nearly one-thirdof the companies reported they are "more likely" to pursuesuch a transaction during the upcoming year than in the previousyear.The media and content services sector, which includes print,digital and online media, is also expected to show a high rateof merger activity.The most popular reason cited for seeking a merger or acquisitionwas to "increase earnings"; to "increase revenue" also wasoften selected. Other reasons given included "attainment ofleadership in an existing market" and "presence in a convergingmarket."Broadview's study also found the largest IT companies are themost likely to pursue acquisitions, with 78 percent of thosecompanies with at least $500 million in annual sales sayingthey are "very likely" to pursue acquisitions this year.Stock appears to be an increasingly preferred method for transactions.One-quarter of the companies in the study said they will fundtheir deals solely with stock, up from just 11 percent thatsaid they completed transactions this way in the past.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Weekly Briefs: Western Micro dealWestern Micro Inc., Campbell, Calif., reached an agreement toacquire all the assets of R&D Hardware Systems Co., a distributorof IBM's RS/6000 and Unisys products, based in Colorado Springs,Colo.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Weekly Briefs: New board memberNovell Inc., Orem, Utah, named Hans-Werner Hector to the company'sboard, to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of KanwelRekhi in August.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Weekly Briefs: Wang buys AvailWang Laboratories Inc., Billerica, Mass., will acquire privatelyheld Avail Systems Corp, Boulder, Colo., in a stock deal valuedat about $32 million.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Weekly Briefs: Fulcrom, TRIP pactFulcrom Technologies Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, will acquire TRIPSystems International Inc., a former competitor with a stronginstalled base of customers in Germany, the Scandinavian countriesand the United Kingdom.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664BASED ON INTERNAL MODEL -- CTP creates tool for knowledge sharingon NetBy:KEVIN MERRILLCambridge, Mass.-Cambridge Technology Partners is bundling consultingand training on a new Internet application.The application is designed to let corporations harness internalknowledge, from software to human resource policies, and allowemployees access across the World Wide Web.The first customers started receiving five-day training on KnowledgeShare,as the Internet solution is called, within the past two weeks.CTP, a systems integrator, consultancy and custom applicationdeveloper, built the service based on its own similar internaltool."[KnowledgeShare] is a starting point for a strategic directionwe're taking to deploy Internet-based technology as a legitimateplatform for building business applications for our clients,"said Bob Gett, president of CTP North America.CTP has set fixed prices, but may bill for additional consultingtime, based on how much assistance the company needs in capturingand storing its data. The KnowledgeShare service prices rangefrom $150,000 to $200,000. The amounts do not include the hardwareto store the data, or the browsers that employees would needto access the system.The service, a combination of software, training and consulting,differs from a traditional corporate home page in three ways,Gett said: the consultancy work that is built around it; thefive-day training and reduced development time, compared withWeb pages; and the document-creating software engines.Gett said CTP has built firewalls and other security measuresto protect the data repository, adding KnowledgeShare can beused for limited or open internal access or as a public Website.The company plans to add enhanced document-search and imagingscanning capabilities in future versions. KnowledgeShare usesCTP's document-management software as the back-end data storageand search engine."What a KnowledgeShare user sees is not a static list of HTMLpages," said Bruce Rosen, a senior technical consultant forCTP and development manager for KnowledgeShare. "Running inthe back is a document-management engine. We've written aninterface between the Web and the back-end engine."Among the possible data storage uses are company practices andpolicies, sales presentations and reusable software components.The five-day training is structured as a hands-on seminar. CTPconsults with companies to help them through the process ofidentifying knowledge, processing it and then merging it intoKnowledgeShare."We're not teaching clients how to write HTML code," Rosen said."We're teaching them how to use knowledge within their company."The type of employees sent to training represent three categories someone from within the IS department who knows the corporateserver configuration and network aspects; a person who canidentify the resources within a company to assist in the knowledgegathering process; and a trainer who is expected to coordinatepost-training within the corporation.CTP also is developing a video for companies to use to trainother employees.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Memorex-Telex targets integrators with service -- Resourcesdiverted from network managementBy:KEVIN MERRILLIrving, Texas-A services reselling program from Memorex-TelexCorp. is allowing integrators and VARs to divert resourcesaway from routine network management and maintenance.Companies like Sun Data Inc., an Atlanta-based integrator, insteadare building internal expertise in systems consulting and projectmanagement and implementation, and outsourcing service piecesto Memorex-Telex, Irving."It doesn't make sense to fly our people all over the countryto do a LAN setup," said Robert Spessard Jr., vice president,marketing and professional services at Sun Data.Memorex-Telex launched its Gold Services Partner Program earlierthis year, after starting a beta cycle about a year ago andreceiving input from a group representing customers, includingresellers. The program is an offshoot of its 18-month-old AdvancedServices program, which was itself a push by Memorex-Telexinto services."When our resellers look at us, they don't say, 'Can you fixa computer in Bangor, Maine?' Instead, they're asking us tohelp design and monitor and keep systems up and running," saidPreston Lawhorne, director of channel sales and development.Resellers get 5 percent to 15 percent off list price when resellingservices, broken into four categories: strategic services,network integration, performance control and education."The deals that we're winning are ones we would not have wondirect," Lawhorne said.Sun Data's decision to use Memorex-Telex services is coupledwith its own internal strategy of strengthening its integratedsolution-selling business through building competencies inthe open systems world. To do that, they placed an emphasison recruiting and placing senior-level service personnel toprovide the higher-level consulting and project design workfor customers, as well as some limited service work."You have to have those people on board," Spessard said. "Youcan't outsource that." The company expects to double the sizeof its professional service staff this year.The decision to focus on building a senior-level service staffas opposed to a service army, when coupled with the move tooutsource some service engagements to Memorex-Telex, has allowedit to speed its consulting and project management.It also gave Sun Data broader geographic coverage and additionalsystem expertise. Those resources give its budding consultingand project management work greater appeal, Spessard said.The reasons to contract with Memorex-Telex are similar withother integrators."For me to hire [Certified Novell Engineers] and [EnterpriseCNEs] would have been a nightmare," said Robert Bova, directorof network integration at Oliver Allen Corp., Larkspur, Calif."Instead of reinventing the wheel, why bother?"Oliver Allen brings Memorex-Telex into the bidding process,and has it provide quotes on services before a final packageis submitted to the customer.Bova said Oliver Allen started its Memorex-Telex relationshipfirst by selling some of its products, and then transitionedinto reselling service packages. "By throwing services intothe mix, it makes us an even better customer," he said.Memorex-Telex, which established a service and support partnershipwith Novell Inc., expects to establish a similar relationshipwith Microsoft Corp. for Windows NT support, Lawhorne said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664SOFTWARE ARTISTRY PLANS CHANNEL PUSH -- Tool For Asset ManagementBy:Kevin MerrillSoftware Artistry Inc. is planning a channel push to coincidewith the release of its asset management tool, Expert FoundationManager.The Indianapolis-based developer of service and support solutionsis using its Expert Partners Program to identify and work withcompanies that provide complementary hardware, software orservice solutions.At its annual sales meeting this week, current and potentialExpert Partners will explain their products and services toSoftware Artistry's direct sales force.

CompuCom is expandingits SA relationship to include SA-Expert Foundation Manager."Anywhere they have a customer, we see a great fit," said BrianO'Connell, vice president of support center services.It was Software Artistry's relationship with companies likeCompuCom that helped to shape and give momentum to the creationof the Expert Partners Program."Asset management is definitely a concept that's here," O'Connellsaid."If I'm going to build a call center, I want to do it with aforward-looking view. But to get the benefit, companies willhave to establish a process by which they compile the information,"O'Connell added.The Expert Partners Program started forming in August.The certification categories include Certified Product Provider,Services Provider and Outsourcing Services Provider.Training covers technical and sales and marketing subjects,Cunningham said.

The basis of marketing has to be relationships.Anything that furthers a relationship, not just sells a product,is where they need to focus.The first thing you have to do is differentiate all your serviceand support offerings. And most organizations don't. They doa blanket marketing, whether it's a brochure, flier or poster.One of the first things to do is understand the industry andunderstand the industry benchmarks. You need to be competitiveand be able to present someone a case that you can not onlyprovide the expertise, because I think that's a given. Whenpeople start to look outside to outsource, they've alreadyagreed that you are the expert. In addition, you have to provethat you're cost-effective.If it's outsourcing just the help desk, then you want to marketto someone that's looking to outsource to you.You have to be able to identify how the help desk will providevalue to the other parts of the organization.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664DEAL ECHOES INTEL-CNN -- Realtime news spans InternetBy:CHARLOTTE DUNLAPRedmond, Wash.-Microsoft Corp. and NBC have a strategy to makePCs more interactive and informative with live and continuousnews, but they are not the first.Intel Corp. and Turner Broadecasting Inc.'s Cable News Networkfirst brought news to the PC about a year ago. CNN at Work,which was rolled out last June, brings CNN headline news, featuresand stock reports to corporate PCs across the local-area network.Corporate servers receive the broadcast feed through cableor a satellite hookup.Atlanta-based CNN then rolled out the project's newest feature,a new financial network called CNN FN (financial news). Thenew network was added to Intel's CNN at Work.And just last month, Intel enhanced the service with the abilityto conduct personal profiles so the software automaticallygrabs information of importance to a particular user for hisreview later. For example, if a user is interested in videoconferencing,the service will download every story with that key word includedin the text and save it for the individual.CNN at Work subscriptions are priced at an individual subscriptionrate of $12.50 per month. The Multimedia specialized gatewaythat transforms the analog signal to CNN at Work's digitalformat is priced at $4,995. But unlike Microsoft, Intel hasnot discussed plans to move across the Internet.Microsoft, based here, is looking to make significant stridesafter much industry criticism for being late to enter the Internetmarket. With broadcast giant NBC, the two will launch a 24hour news and information channel for the television, and anonline news service distributed on The Microsoft Network forPCs.The cable service, MS-NBC Cable, will roll out within six months,aiming for 35 million subscribers by the year 2000. Microsoftwill pay $220 million over five years with a 50 percent interestin MS-NBC Cable. NBC will invest $200 million over the nextfive years. NBC is in charge of the news content."We're bringing the interactive world into integration withbroadcast-by interactivity, we mean the Internet," said BillGates, chief executive of Microsoft.

But the Internet'sWorld Wide Web not only encourages slick graphics, interactionand sophisticated realtime applications, but it also distributescontent at affordable prices-if the data is compressed enough."Streaming audio hit the Net in '95, and '96 will be the yearfor streaming video," said Jeff Pulver, publisher of Netwatch,an online electronic newsletter on new technologies, basedin Great Neck, N.Y. "This is truly a step forward; such technologiesintroduced on the Net are leading-edge, providing increasingvalue to everyone from pure technologists to end users.""Streaming" means video is being downloaded and viewed simultaneously.To date, video is typically viewed over the Internet througha store-and-forward method, which takes a long time to transmitbefore it can be viewed. A three-minute video clip can takeabout a half-hour to download before it is seen.Video over the Internet will give VARs and systems integratorsthe ability to enhance clients' Web sites with very sophisticatednext-generation realtime applications.By running the technology over either the Internet or privateTCP/IP networks, radio stations can send live radio broadcasts,and news services can send full-motion video feeds of financialprograms to financial traders.Pioneers of the technology include entertainment companies,broadcasters and advertisers; however, experts anticipate morewidespread use of the technology beginning next year due tosome early products by vendors such as Xing Technology Corp.and VDOnet Corp.At the core of Santa Clara, Calif.-based VDOnet's desktop videobroadcasting flagship product, called VDOLive, is a scalablecompression algorithm that compresses video small enough torun over the small bandwidth portions of the Internet, as wellas increase the quality of video with expanded bandwidth.A communications protocol within the technology maintains theintegrity of the video as it weaves through the complex networkof the Internet, officials said.VDOLive video can run in realtime at 15 frames per second overanalog with a 28.8-Kbit-per-second modem, but this is whenthe Internet is not in its rush hour, noted Asaf Mohr, presidentand chief executive of VDOnet. The technology is currentlyin beta-testing, slated for availability in early 1996.Arroyo Grande, Calif.-based Xing is a leading supplier of MPEGplayer software to video board and video software companies.It unveiled a product called StreamWorks, which, like VDOLive,works with existing Web servers and browsers, and runs overanalog and ISDN or greater infrastructures.StreamWorks is based on software-based MPEG (Motion PictureExperts Group) video and audio compression.The cost of the technology is about $3,500 for the server software,and the client software is downloaded free by the user viaa company's home page.Recently, Netscape Communications Corp. allowed for plug-incapabilities to be built to its Netscape Navigator 2.0. BecauseVDOLive and StreamWorks support the popular browser, VARs canmore easily build the video features into clients' Web sites.Two-way video-not to be confused with one-way broadcast videois also slowly unfolding over the Net.Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif., decided the best wayto make its mark in the highly competitive videoconferencingarena is to make its product Internet-ready.Officials claim that since the availability of its QuickTimeConferencing kit last month, it has seen a rush of orders notonly from business interests, but consumers as well.Now the company plans to extend the technology into wider marketsand infrastructures.A source close to the company said creating a version of QTCfor regular analog is "squarely on the road map for 1996."Apple officials have also said they will likely offer a Windowsbased version of the product.CU-SeeMe is another desktop videoconferencing applications thatruns over the Internet.

And modular productsthat go into existing accounts, where the VAR has sold networkinginfrastructure or mail, can represent profitable incrementalrevenue.Hyperdesk Corp., Westborough, Mass., is now beta-testing a newversion of its GroupWorks project-management software withsupport for Windows 95 and NT and the ability to send OLE objects,sound bites and other attachments. GroupWorks 2.0 lets teamsschedule people and tasks, using existing E-mail as its backbone.The product can now utilize an address book complying withthe Vendor Independent Messaging (VIM) or Messaging ApplicationProgramming Interface (MAPI), said Tom Rose, director of productmarketing.Internet integration is also a new perk. Users can link WorldWide Web addresses with task assignments, contact pages ordiscussion topics. The recipient then clicks on the icon tolaunch the browser and open the linked Web page."With the ability to be customized, it can be implemented invertical markets. . . . [VARs could do] a custom accountingversion or a legal version with ticklers for the courts," saidBryan Quibell, president of MCC Electronic Publishing Group,a Spring Grove, Pa.-based VAR specializing in legal- and electronicpublishing verticals. "We weren't looking for a product toresell, more for an internal implementation, but I was so impressedwe will resell it," Quibell said.GroupWorks addresses a different niche than Collabra SoftwareInc.'s Collabra Share, which provides threaded discussions,said Jim Garden, an analyst with Workgroup Technologies Inc.,Hampton, N.H. "This is more a project orientation for teammanagement. Typically when you work with a team you need togather their status, find out where they are." GroupWorks providesdispersed teams with an asynchronous way to meet and shareinformation, he said.Of course, the definition of groupware is always an issue indiscussing such projects. No two definitions of the term seemthe same. Eric Brown, a senior analyst at Forrester ResearchInc., Cambridge, Mass., defines groupware as "a passive, infrastructuralactivity." Into that category, he would put phones, LANs andother pipelines that help people communicate across departments,time and geography. Applications like GroupWorks are "morestructured. These are nice project-management tools, and GroupWorksis unique in that it pulls together documents, people, andcalendaring and scheduling in one topic-oriented presentation,"he said.GroupWorks had gone mostly direct, but the company has linedup 16 reseller partners and is looking for more, Rose said.Future plans call for tighter integration with existing projectmanagement applications, such as Microsoft Project, analystssaid. In addition, more integration with the Internet willbe added, so teams connected only by the public network canlink up and share project data.New pricing for the product, due out this month, is $199 forthe first license and $99 for each additional license. Volumediscounts are available. VARs can download a trial copy fromthe Web for free at http://www.hyperdesk.com. That copy canbe used for 30 days.Also in groupware, Teamaker Corp., Beaverton, Ore., is offeringscheduling and time-tracking software for the office.

Unfortunately, no PC can go out thedoor without one.The worst-case scenario for a VAR is to try to get as closeto break-even on the monitor portion of the contract, or findsomething else to make up for the margin. Other VARs have foundbetter ways to prop up their monitor margins.One problem VARs have is unwanted retail competition. The VARruns the risk of seeing its monitor offering undercut by alower price at a nearby retail outlet, said H.B. Peters, ownerof Matrix Enterprises, Shelton, Wash. "It's hard to competelike that," he said.Even the gap between the reseller's price and the SRP is tooclose for comfort. It is not unusual to purchase a high-endmonitor for $675 and sell it at the SRP for $699, a gap of$24 that also has to cover shipping costs, Peters noted."It would be nice to make a couple of dollars on the side asthey [the monitors] go by instead of paying the freight," Peterssaid.At Entre Computer Center, Albuquerque, N.M., monitor marginsare just fine, thank you. But that is because Entre has a differentapproach to carrying monitors."Most monitors we are using are our own private label," saidPat Bachechi, manager. Entre gets its monitors from IntelligentElectronics Inc., Exton, Pa., which in turn OEMs the unitsfrom a manufacturer. The monitors come in without labels, allowingEntre to stamp its own name on them, Bachechi explained. Theunit even comes with a three-year warranty.Monitor margins are just fine for Mega Micro Computer, thoughbeing located in Great Falls, Mont., may have something todo with it. Owner David Rasmussen said he is enjoying marginsof 15 percent to 18 percent on 14-inch monitors, and 20 percentto 25 percent on 17-inch monitors and above.Exploiting demand is the key to this technique. Rasmussen carriesa very limited inventory of the larger monitors. "I only keepone on hand," he said, "usually something I know I can move."For larger monitors, Rasmussen said he handles either ViewsonicCorp. or NEC Technologies Inc. As for the smaller monitors,margin is maintained through "good salesmanship," he added.The Future Now, based in Cincinnati, is in the same boat asother VARs. Monitor margins are ranging only from three toseven points, said Linda Newsome, executive assistant to thedirector of sales. "We sell them based on what the market willcarry."Margins are above the seven-point mark when handling largermonitors "because it is a limited field," Newsome said. Afterthat, The Future Now, acquired by Intelligent Electronics,leans on its relationship with its new owner. "With IntelligentElectronics, the wheels are greased by its distribution system.The freight is passed on to the customer," she said.Among vendors, providing the VAR channel with an incentive tocarry a monitor can take on a number of different forms. Somevendors will rely on promotional features to send some dollarsback to the VAR. Still other vendors will find a way of craftingprice and availability to keep margins higher without relianceon promotional tools.Spiffs are one tool used by NEC, Wood Dale, Ill. A recent promotionfor the MultiSynch XV17 monitor offers the VAR $25 for everymonitor sold, said Pam Himmel, marketing manager.Still another technique NEC has used is to pick up the freightcharges for monitor shipment. This may sound modest, but Himmelpointed out that a 21-inch monitor can weigh around 80 pounds,so freight becomes a significant cost of handling.While spiffs and freight deals are some ways NEC can place orleave cash in a reseller's pocket, the monitor's sticker pricecan also play a role. By pitching a quality unit to the market,"we frequently charge a premium for our product," Himmel said.The higher price tag in turn translates into more margin dollarsfor the VAR.MAG InnoVision Inc. launched an improved version of its resellerprogram. Called the Ultimate Reseller Program, MAG will beproviding immediate phone assistance to its authorized resellerson a priority basis, and forwarding corporate and end-usercalls to authorized resellers. A corporate development programwill provide assistance to resellers in closing corporate sales.Samsung Electronics America Inc., Ridgefield, N.J., is runningtwo national promotions, said John Grundy, senior nationalmarketing manager. One uses the monitor invoice as a raffleticket for a free BMW, with one car a month being given awayover five months. The second promotion is "a trade-up programaimed at corporate accounts" to upgrade to a 17-inch monitor,Grundy said. Any color 14-inch or 15-inch monitor bearing theIBM, Compaq, Sony or NEC brand names can be traded in to qualifyfor a $75 or $100 check when purchasing a 17-inch monitor."It's a sales tool for the VAR" to stir the installed base,he added.Without promotions, Samsung costs about 10 percent to 15 percentless than its competitors, Grundy contended. "[But] it is notnecessary to pass on the cost savings to a corporate account,"he said. "Most VARs get double-digit margins with Samsung monitors."At ADI Systems Inc., Mountain View, Calif., resellers get abreak on demo units as a channel promotion. Up to two unitsper model per year can be purchased at a discount to be usedas demo models, said Michelle Maldonado, channel marketingmanager.Sony Electronics Inc., San Jose, Calif., has developed promotionsawarding redeemable points to resellers handling Sony monitorsthat can be exchanged for other Sony-brand consumer goods,said Chris Stocker, director of channel marketing.But the real purpose is to build up a list of individual resellers,rather than their companies, that Sony can contact directlyvia their home addresses, Stocker pointed out. With a listof 3,800 names, Sony can craft promotions for its monitorsthat will reach only the resellers it needs.At Sampo Technology Inc., Norcross, Ga., distribution is limitedto Ingram, Merisel, Tech Data and Gates-Arrow, according toNorman Dybowski, director of marketing. This leaves distributorsgetting by on a less margin, "opening up better opportunitiesat higher margins for the VAR," he said. VARs can expect monitormargins in the 10 to 12 percent range at the low end, whilehigh-end margins will run from 12 to 18 percent, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Smile adds to monitor line at high end, midrangeBy:WILLIAM TERDOSLAVICHCosta Mesa, Calif.-Smile International Inc. expanded its productline with the addition of 20-inch and 21-inch monitors forits high-end Rev 7 line, as well as new 15-inch and 17-inchmonitors for its more midrange Rev 5 line.Smile is reaching the monitor market with four product lines.In addition to Rev 7, with LCD status indicators, and Rev 5,which has on-screen display, Smile puts out its Rev 3 line,fully digital with LED, and its low-end Rev 1 analog monitors.Among the four lines there are 12 monitors coming to market,said Michael LaMar, marketing manager.In the Rev 7 line, the CA2111 is priced at $1,780, and the CA2011has a price tag of $1,345. Both monitors have .28mm dot pitchand refresh rates of 100 hertz; 1600-x-1200 resolution; andadapters for the Macintosh."We're putting these in the CAD and heavy graphics arena," LaMarsaid. The monitors also feature "convergence adjustment," whichallows focused adjustment of just one line of pixels. Thisfeature will allow the elimination of blue shadows at the corners,LaMar said.While Smile had produced 20-inch and 21-inch monitors for othervendors, this is the first time it has turned out the monitorsfor its own nameplate, LaMar said.Meanwhile, the CA1516SL and CA1716SL provide the foundationfor the Rev 5 line, which features OSD to distinguish it fromthe lower-end lines.

The monitor hasa 0.26mm dot pitch, a flat Diamondtron CRT, pushing 1280 x1024 resolution at 80 hertz. Maximum resolution is 1600 x1200.Sampo is looking to the VAR channel to push the new monitor."It is best-suited for really picky uses, like CAD graphics.It's the ultimate clean screen," Dybowski said.Sampo is deliberately following a limited distribution strategyto keep its monitor margins up. Using only four national distributorskeeps the product line from being overdistributed, which inturn can cut into prices and margins, Dybowski noted.The AlphaScan 760 brings to three the number of 17-inch monitorsSampo has in the market. The AlphaScan 17gx is similar, witha 0.26mm dot pitch, but lower refresh rates at higher resolutions.The 17mx offers a 0.28mm dot pitch, again lower refresh rates,and a maximum resolution of only 1280 x 1024.Other high-end monitor offerings include the AlphaScan GL, a20-inch monitor with a .31mm dot pitch and 1280 x 1024 resolution.Also part of the line is the AlphaScan GLX, a more richly-featured20-inch monitor with a .28mm dot pitch and a resolution of1600 x 1200.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Nanao brings B&W monitor to marketBy:William TerdoslavichTorrance, Calif.-To Nanao USA Corp., the world of 21-inch monitorsis one that is seen in black-and-white, not color.

TAFTWashington-Despite all the attention being given to modern programminglanguages like Java, C and C++, there remains plenty of opportunityfor VARs, integrators and consultants in older programminglanguages such as PL/1 and COBOL, particularly in migratingto newer environments, according to a recent study.A study released by Ernst & Young showed a majority of corporatesites using PL/1 intend to phase out their PL/1 applicationsthrough replacement or migration to COBOL or other languages.Many of the sites will begin their conversions within the nextyear, the study showed.Fifty-nine percent of the 1,700 companies surveyed said theyare looking to move away from their PL/1 applications. Mostrespondents said they viewed PL/1 as outdated and inappropriatefor today's computing environments, which are heavily gearedtoward client/server architectures. The study showed COBOLto be the language of choice for organizations moving awayfrom PL/1, with C and C++ coming in as second and third choices,respectively. A solid 31 percent of the respondents said theyintend to convert to or rewrite their applications in COBOL,with 10 percent planning to move to C and 7 percent movingto C++Ernst & Young conducted its study in August 1995 and includedcompanies in Europe and the United States. Results of the surveyreflect the purchasing plans of IT directors within some ofthe world's largest corporations including AT&T Corp., EastmanKodak Co., Raytheon, South Western Bell, State Farm Insuranceand the U.S. Department of Energy.Among some of the other factors against retaining PL/1-basedsystems, survey respondents said it is difficult to find programmersto work in the PL/1 language. In addition, they said PL/1 lacksthe multiplatform support of more modern and widely acceptedlanguages such as COBOL and C++Citing the potential for VARs and integrators in this environment,Hans-Peter Evers, managing director of Ernst & Young RE Productsin Utrecht, Netherlands, said: "This survey confirms the massiveflight from PL/1 and strong interest in COBOL, as well as acritical need for an easy and painless solution for PL/1 migration."Only 18 percent of the survey respondents said they had alreadymoved away from PL/1. Yet, 23 percent said they were satisfiedwith PL/1 and believe it is the only language suitable fortheir requirements. However, of those committed to migrating,27 percent said they would convert their applications to anotherenvironment, while 46 percent said they would totally rewriteor replace the applications.Moreover, 44 percent of the sites planning a migration fromPL/1 said they are changing platforms due to a move to clientserver and downsizing efforts. An additional 28 percent saidthey plan to move from PL/1 to standardize their environments."The year 2000 date change is also a compelling reason for companiesto migrate from PL/1 to COBOL," said Bill Ulrich, presidentof Tactical Strategy Group Inc., an Aptos, Calif., VAR/integratorthat specializes in legacy system transitions. "While excellenttool support exists for languages such as COBOL, the tool supportfor PL/1 tends to be inadequate."As many companies look to move to more modern development environments,software suppliers such as IBM Corp. are delivering tools tomeet their needs. IBM has modernized the COBOL language withobject-oriented extensions. IBM's Visual Age for COBOL forOS/2, COBOL Set for AIX and COBOL for MVS feature object-orientedextensions that enable programmers to use a popular, long-livedprogramming language to create advanced client/server applicationson the desktop and deploy objects across various platformsand applications.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664The Spin: Making Microsoft Blink ... Or, Who Were They Kidding?By:Jodi MardesichAfter Microsoft's big Internet strategy briefing in early December,I was talking to a Microserf. In typical Microserf fashion,he asked me what I thought about the day, so I told him I wasfloored that they had actually decided to license Java fromSun. "I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop," I told him."What do you mean?" he asked. I said, maybe you've signed aletter of intent, but it won't be finalized, or you'll licenseit, but won't really fully support it. . . . You get the drift.He replied, "I'm hurt. I've worked for Microsoft for yearsand we've always been open. I don't understand why people saythis about us. . . ."Until that day, not many people expected Microsoft to actuallylicense Java. I started reporting for the story days before.One IBM executive told me, "The Internet is all about standards.It's all about being open. That's what we're going to focuson, things that are open and cross platform. We're not goingto tell you if you want to take advantage of our interpretivelanguage, you have to use our browser, or if you want to useour object technology, you have to use our platform." Meaning,he thought Microsoft would tell us the opposite.Instead, Microsoft said it would license Java. Officials painteda lovely picture of an open landscape. You can use whatevertools you want. We'll make runtimes for VB Script free on theInternet. We'll support stuff across platforms. We'll giveaway our browser and server for free.Wait a minute. What happened? Six months ago, the story of theyear was Windows 95. Now everyone is focused on browsers andthe Web. Just months ago, Microsoft was the winner of the OSwars. Developers were fleeing from other platforms to Windowsin droves. Novell gave up on its Appware cross platform developmentand seemed to lose its focus, which was to deliver networkconnectivity to users of all kinds of computers running whateveroperating system. Suddenly, all significant client work wasbeing done for Windows. The game was over. Or was it?Why, if Windows is the development platform of choice, wouldMicrosoft start using the "cross-platform" word? A few yearsago when Microsoft was doing its dog-and-pony show with Windowsfor Workgroups, I asked whether they'd do some sort of modulethat would let Mac users share files and printers with Windowsusers. They looked at me like I was insane. Windows was theirmantra. Let's all say it in unison. Windows! Windows! Windows!Then Netscape came along. Who would have thought a small companydistributing free software on the Web would make Microsoftblink? Well, after achieving a billion-dollar market capitalization,Microsoft had to take notice. Not to mention the fact thatNetscape produces cool software that runs on other platformsbesides Windows 95 and updates it frequently. Say bye-bye tothree-year development cycles.Also, with Java, Sun came up with an exciting idea and new toolsthat change the way most people have thought about personalcomputing. Even so, how could Microsoft possibly admit someoneelse had done something cooler than they? And actually licenseit?It didn't take too long for the other shoe to drop. The nextweek, Microsoft execs were telling us how great Microsoft toolsare, and that they'll be available sooner than Java. Microsoftknows that he who controls the developers wins. Microsoft ishurriedly crafting a plan to leverage OLE so all the thousandsof OLE developers can stay on the Microsoft bandwagon.I can't wait to see how this progresses.

The company sold 53,000 notebooks in the United Statesin the quarter, a jump of more than 100 percent from the sameperiod last year, according to IDC."TI has ramped up [its] marketing efforts and [its] channelefforts, and it is starting to pay off," said Randy Giusto,an analyst for IDC. "They have expanded the number of distributors,resellers and retailers. TI always had innovative technology.But in the past they were known as a great engineering company.The problem was with marketing."Analysts said much of the credit for TI's rise up the chartsgoes to Steve Lair, who headed up marketing for mobile marketleader Toshiba before joining TI as vice president of personalproductivity products in April."TI has made some big jumps [in notebooks]," said Mike McGuire,analyst for Dataquest Inc., San Jose, Calif. "The marketingplans that Steve Lair has put in place are really kicking in."Lair completely restructured the marketing organization at TIand added more than 100 people in U.S. sales and marketing."We're making a big-time move to get mobile market share,"said Lair. And new technology coming out soon, such as on-boardtelephone capability, and additional multimedia and wirelessfunctionality, will further propel TI, according to Lair.The company is also poised to revamp its Extensa value notebookline in the first quarter. An aggressive push into Pentiumis also expected. Pentium accounted for about 58 percent ofmobile sales for TI in the fourth quarter, said Lair, but bymidyear it will be ubiquitous.

The inclinations todate have been far from conclusive, but several trends arebeginning to emerge.The CRN/Sanford Bernstein Survey suggests overall PC availabilityremains relatively good, with modest shortages at the highend of the product line. The levels of excess inventory haveedged up slightly. Roughly two-thirds of resellers expect PCunit growth during the next three months will be up at least5 percent when compared with the previous three months.The key issue here is the relative balance between supply anddemand. Our estimates suggest to clear channel inventory duringthe fourth quarter, PC unit growth would need to be in the20 percent to 22 percent range at the corporate level and 35percent to 37 percent at the retail level. Through November,these target levels were close to being met but at the expenseof margins because of promotions.But we expect U.S. PC growth in 1996 will moderate to the 17percent to 19 percent range, compared with 23 percent to 24percent this year. Expectations of slower growth are beingdriven primarily by high penetration rates among corporationsand high-income households. While Windows 95 has not been afailure, it is being sold mainly to high-income householdsand small businesses upgrading their PCs. As we look into 1996,there are few compelling new applications that would inducea new segment of the market to purchase a PC. Furthermore,the much touted $500 box that is needed to address the lowerend of the market is unlikely to generate significant volumesuntil late 1997 or 1998.VADIM ZLOTNIKOV is the technology analyst for Sanford C.

The program focuses on threeto five computer products per week; it is cosponsored by suchmanufacturers as IBM Corp., Apple Computer Inc., Hewlett-PackardCo. and U.S. Robotics Inc."We're in the process of evaluating what for us is a new mediumbefore committing to more than three programs. We chose CNBCbecause it gives us access to 80 million U.S. homes which includea lot of influential corporate employees, including [chiefinformation officers]," said Elek-Tek President Cameron Estes."Our objective is to stress the benefits and time saving valueof computers and more importantly to feature and sell products."To that end, viewers of Computer Wonderland during the courseof the program are encouraged to call for a free Elek-Tek catalogand coupon book or to place an order. The show itself has presentedvignettes on how the HP Deskjet helped a child find a lostdog and how a grandmother used a Macintosh Performa as a babysittingtool. The reseller's corporate thrust was underscored by aprofile of how an employee achieved higher productivity anda promotion through the use of an IBM ThinkPad.The 17-year-old, multimillion-dollar reseller, which in additionto its Skokie headquarters and four Chicago retail outletshas operations in Denver, Indianapolis and Kansas City, Mo.,retained Chicago-based KRT Productions Inc. to produce theseries. Once the initial three programs run their course, ElekTek will evaluate their success before deciding whether tocontinue the Computer Wonderland series, Estes said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664$10,000 Home Page CrackingBy:MICHAEL KANELLOSSeattle-ichael Koidahl, president of Seattle's Westwind ComputingInc., has enough faith in the 8150 Apple Internet server thathe will give $10,000 to anyone who can hack into his."What is Netscape [Communications Corp.] offering? A T-shirt?"he asked.The $10,000 Macintosh Security Challenge is co-sponsored withRedmond, Wash.-based integrator ComVista Inc., Bellevue, Wash.based Internet service provider Digital Forest, and four ISVs.The challenge has been the three companies' answer to customerquestions about security on the Internet since Oct. 15. Atthe same time, it has been a live advertisement for the threecompanies."In October and [early] November, we had about 4,000 to 5,000hits. We're probably getting 200 to 250 a day now," said JohnWiederspan, the director of technical services at ComVista."We have had four people write us and tell us how they couldbreak in. We told them, 'Fine,' [but] they haven't yet," headded.Koidahl said the idea for the Internet Challenge came aboutbecause customers wanted tangible proof of Internet security.The three companies also wanted a way to demonstrate their ownskills and products, which complement each other.Westwind is a high-end Apple reseller specializing in sales,testing and configuration of hardware and software. ComVista,on the other hand, acts as a consultant, providing white papersand hourly consulting to companies interested in mapping outcommunications strategies. Digital Forest designs and maintainshome-page sites for those wanting to outsource that function.Wiederspan added that as much as possible the three use thesame software vendors, including Maxum and StarNine TechnologiesInc.While working as a consortium divides revenue, it increaseseach company's individual flexibility and keeps each concentratedon its core competency, said Koidahl. Overall, "our philosophyis to get customers to provide information," he added. Theirjoint projects include Internet sites for Alaska Airlines andNorthwest Nickel, a local classified publication.Naturally, the challenge also has become a testimonial to theApple server line, which, Koidahl and Wiederspan pointed out,remains one of the dominant and most hearty Internet hardwareplatforms. Apple is not participating in the test or providingfinancial assistance, added Koidahl.The Macintosh challenge essentially mimics an actual home page,said Wiederspan. Users can examine on the home page everythingbut data contained on one line. Access to that area is permittedonly by password: Break it, and you win $10,000.So far, the test, which ran until the end of the year, has beensatisfactory on all counts. Sales of Apple Internet serversat Westwind have been increasing throughout the year, saidKoidahl. Also, 400 local businesspeople attended a recent Internetseminar sponsored by Westwind."For $2,500 you can get an Apple-based server with all the necessarysoftware," Koidahl said. Although slightly more costly thansome Windows-based servers, the Apple servers have anotherselling point: They only require two to three hours to install,while it might take "40 hours to set up an NT server," he added.Wiederspan believes the test has shown Apple's equipment canwithstand industrial use. The key, he said, lies in the factthat the Apple server refuses to accept commands outside theprotocol.He also hopes the challenge may contribute to the business world'sgeneral acclimation to Internet commerce. "The security aspectis more of a mind set," he said. "If you wanted 5,000 creditcard numbers, you could go outside of a department store ontrash day."Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Visionary forms new groupBy:TIM GRACESunnyvale, Calif.-Visionary Design Systems Inc. formed a separatesystems- and network-integration group to help its core CADengineer clientele work with a variety of platforms and applications.The new group will primarily design custom networks and buildnetwork-management solutions with Hewlett-Packard Co.'s OpenViewproduct suite, as well as provide system- and network-managementservices on an outsourcing basis, said Director Steven Kling.The $35 million, Sunnyvale-based CAD VAR opted to form a separateintegration group after implementing a successful product-orientedsideline business in the Bay area, Kling said. "CAD engineersat our client companies are largely isolated from MIS managersand departments. They also have a separate set of needs interms of network performance and throughput."They continually ask us for help because their area of expertiseis design, not network and computer management," he said.Kling, who joined Visionary Design after a stint as the headof HP's consulting delivery business in the Western UnitedStates, expects to increase his current seven-member integrationteam to between 25 and 30 members by the end of 1996. "Untilthen, the logical things for us will be to target our integrationservices at our existing mechanical-design environment beforepursuing opportunities in other industries," he said, addingthat the VAR also will leverage its Internet-based ConnectVDSengineering design transfer system to impart technical informationto users.Visionary Design launched ConnectVDS in November as a vehiclethrough which CAD engineers can exchange files and documents,conduct research on mechanical engineering and access the WorldWide Web to communicate with vendors and suppliers (CRN, Nov.6)"They've already begun communicating with us for informationon how their workstations are networked together and to obtainsuch information as how to pass drawing files at faster speeds,"Kling said.ConnectVDS, as well as the new systems- and network-integrationgroup, are key elements to the VAR's Vision 2000 philosophyof helping customers improve business processes and streamlineinformation."A common challenge for our customers is how to cope with amix of different platforms and applications," Kling said.

Disc's executive vice president,Carrie Pollare, is compiling data on the company's customersin an exhaustive research project that includes informationon birthdays and preferred pastimes.The company's penchant for the unorthodox permeates the wayit does business and the products it sells. Disc, based here,went into business 10 years ago to distribute computer suppliesand accessories, such as surge protectors, printer toners andink cartridges and disks, and has started to branch out intoother types of products."We have our niche here and that's supplies and accessories.I don't want to deal in commodity items. I don't want to make2 [percent] and 3 percent margins on expensive products," saidDan Hoffman, Disc founder and president.The strategy seems to have worked. Hoffman said the privatelyheld company has grown at rates of 45 percent to 65 percentyearly and has annual sales of more than $50 million.Disc employs 70 people and plans to open a second warehouseto serve the Midwest and East Coast. Sites in Louisville, Ky.,and Columbus, Ohio, are being considered.Despite Disc's focus on consumables, Hoffman has plans for thecompany to start carrying products it has not traditionallysold, such as peripherals. So far, the distributor has pickedup Panasonic Corp.'s Power Drive optical disk and CD-ROM driveas a pilot product for its line-card expansion."I don't want to sell hard drives; I want to sell more nicheoriented products," Hoffman said.Disc sells to resellers, retailers, office-products stores,mail-order companies and supermarkets; most of its businessgoes through the computer channel, Hoffman said.Pollare, who is Hoffman's sister, said collecting personal informationon customers should help Disc become more attentive to itsresellers. Possible outcomes may include sending customersbirthday cards or arranging a golf weekend, she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664GBC focuses on Novell's high endBy:JOHN LONGWELLBerlin, N.J.-Clarifying an earlier statement that GBC TechnologiesInc. was "easing out of the NetWare business," company PresidentNorman Some said the distributor is committed to Novell Inc.'sline.Some said Novell products will remain a critical line for thedistributor.

Liebert's mostrecent UPS is the SiteNet MultiPort, a multiplexor module designedto be integrated with the company's SiteNet family of controland monitoring software for networkable UPS devices."The MultiPort product provides an economical communicationsavenue of up to eight computer stations," said Edward K. Feeney,Liebert's president of North American operations. "This newlevel of flexibility gives network administrators that muchmore systemwide control through the UPS."The MultiPort allows multiple ports, represented by computers,servers or workstations, access to critical information pertinentto shutdown, including battery condition as well as utilitystatus. Company officials said any number of MultiPorts canbe daisy chained.The price of the MultiPort is $675.A new UPS from Antec Inc., Fremont, Calif., the N+1 line, includesthree series of reliable, redundant supplies that provide automatic,active fault-tolerant backup power.The N+1 RPT and RPP series feature hot-swappable capabilitiesfor multiple DC voltages including +/- 5-volt, 12-volt and3.3-volt outputs, as well as optional Power Factor Correction.The lines are intended to solve power-deficiency problems inmainframes, network and application servers, multiple-processorworkstations and telecom systems, Antec officials said.The RPT series includes the RPT-100, a standard AT-sized redundantpower supply, configures as a 300 + 300 watts that can be usedas a 600-watt output power supply, and fits directly into anyAT chassis.The RPP series has hot-swappable capabilities in its 3001 and3003 modules, which use the RPP-300 + 300 module in their designs.The 3002 includes a hot-pluggable housing and backplane.Prices average 20 cents to $1 per watt.DAX Systems Inc., Pine Brook, N.J., unveiled its first rackmounted UPS with N+1 redundancy and true load sharing. Withthe RSP-500, "the four hot-swappable [500-watt] power modulescan be configured to meet the most demanding integrated voiceresponse and telephony needs," said Anthony F. Shay, nationalsales manager at DAX.If a module fails, the system's alarms are initiated while thethree remaining modules support the entire electrical load.The unit also features an integral board that monitors thefans and data-flow and power-supply performance. It also hasoptions for auditory, visual and printout alarms.A fully populated RPS-500 system is priced at $6,135.Several new UPS models are available from Exide Electronics,Raleigh, N.C. The latest is the Powerware Prestige 3000VA (voltageamperes) UPS for medium-size computer networks running froma standard 120-volt input.Features include Exide's CellSaver technology which allows theUPS to accommodate a greater range of power fluctuation withouthaving to resort to battery-backup power, extending the unit'sbattery life significantly, according to officials."What this means for network managers, as well as MIS and telecomprofessionals, is that they can have all the benefits of trueonline technology for only slightly more than they would payfor lower-performance products," said Doug Milner, directorof product and partner marketing for Exide.The system is available in plug-and-play and hard-wired configurations.Its price is $2,299.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664MPC 486 slave board unveiledNew York -Technological Artisans Inc. is shipping its MPC 486,a low-cost, PC-compatible I/O slave board for debugging purposes.The board, which interfaces to the host motherboard processorthrough a large 128-Kbyte block of dual-ported bidirectionalshared memory, can be used with any tool that generates a PCexecutable file.

This is the first installment of excerpts.Next week: discussion on growth opportunities and vendor strategies.ONLINE OPPORTUNITIESLANE: We're very bullish on the Internet. One reason is no onecontrols it, and it seems that its growth, its popularity inwhat is a very arcane delivery vehicle today and a user interfacecould only be made better. It is obviously an opportunity tochange the industry paradigm, which, at least at the clientend, is quickly becoming a monopoly. Obviously, if you area large software company you want to see that remain open.Second, there are a lot of technicians and users coming intothe business now that are more Internet-skilled than anythingelse.MCDOWELL: An area that I think is very interesting is in theimpact this is going to have on small businesses. I think thissomewhat levels the playing field. I was talking to a smallbusiness person the other day who basically sells analyst reports.It's a very small operation, and they were flabbergasted atthe demand for their service they got by going out to the Internetand describing in some way what they're doing. Suddenly, thesize of the firm didn't matter; it was how they positionedit.KERTZMAN: The Web interface, or what we will eventually extendthe Web interface to be, is probably the best, easiest, mostintuitive user interface that's been developed, and that willdrive the inevitability of these technologies.WHITE: The biggest market for all of this is going to be insidecompanies. They're spending the money, they've got the needfor sales-force automation, customer service, customer support.That's going to drive a lot of business, big time, in '96 and'97.PAPERMASTER: The Internet has become, ultimately, an environment.It's not a tool. It's like air. Everybody breathes it. Theultimate winner, who is going to make money on the Internet,is the customer, because it completely changes the paradigmof offering new services and new ways to market companies.I think the real message for the whole technology industryand certainly for any of the channels or the intermediariesin the product marketplace-is that it turns the value chainon its end, and that can either be a tremendous opportunityor it can be dangerous.SIMS: We've found in the past few months an enormous [interestin] the whole area of intranet, so we think that's going tobe a pretty big extension to what's happening in the Internet.I would say 10 percent to 15 percent of our clients are alreadytalking about or looking at that.RAMSEY: If I were an unemployed entrepreneur looking for a newopportunity in the Internet area, I'd look at providing consultingservices. It's a great opportunity for the reselling communityto add value.REVENUE PROJECTIONSTEBBE: There's multiple dimensions: Internet and intranet. Thatcombination is probably 15 percent to 20 percent of our business.I think it'll grow another 50 percent next year, to 30 percentto 33 percent of our business.MCDOWELL: I'd like anybody to be able to sit down and calculateInternet revenue. Certainly I'd ask, along with that, aboutprofit.RAMSEY: We've probably spent more developing our Internet sitethan we made in profit in selling Internet products to date,but that's OK. I finally, in my own mind, concluded what theInternet means to us as a service provider and a seller ofproducts. Certainly it's a way to interface with our customers.As a supplier of product, we're principally selling servers.JACOBSEN: We certainly are making a lot of revenue and a lotof profit off it today by virtue of MCI being a major providerof backbone, as well as an access provider. We're making moneyon the Internet today hand over fist. The Internet gives uswhat we've all been looking for, data dial tone, but for usit's also an enabler. We look at IP as another transport optionwith a series of telecommunications products and services.WHITE: I think [our Internet revenue is in the] single digitstoday. Internet-related revenue will be pretty high next year30 percent to 50 percent. The three [relational database suppliers]are going to do a lot of database business.KERTZMAN: If somebody is using the client/server architectureon a TCP/IP network that's the core backbone network, thenyou can say that's an Internet platform. So I think it willbe hard to differentiate what's Internet-related revenue andwhat's not. And, in a sense, everything will have some componentsto that.SIMS: I would say it's nominal business for us today. It couldrepresent 4 [percent] or 5 percent of our business next yearin the intranet.LANE: Even though it's been reported that we are investing alot of money-relative to what we invest in R&D and databaseand applications-this is a relatively small investment. Butit can be tremendously leveraged, and so the opportunity ishuge.NETWORK COMPUTERSKERTZMAN: I don't think that in corporate desktopsyou will see a movement to these Internet computers or Internetterminals until every application that every user needs torun is runnable in that metaphor. And nobody wants two deviceson their desktops. I think the market, however, for mobileand home devices is probably where these very light Internetterminals will find a future.MCDOWELL: We don't see the PC as we know it today-that is, agood deal of horsepower and maybe more on the desktop-goingaway in the near term. While we believe that the debate overhow big or small the desktop will be is probably still a bitof an open debate, if there are smaller devices, Microsoftwill want to hopefully develop products that add value in thatarena. But we see a major opportunity to leverage the existingand continuing growth in PC-based systems today.LANE: We feel there will be a low-cost Internet or network-accessdevice that does not require all of the hardware and softwarethat a PC [has] today. There is a large gap between the telephoneand the PC in terms of economics. If Intel and Compaq are thefirst ones to build NCs, it probably is going to happen sooner.Oracle is not going to build NCs. But we do have an interestin seeing a lot of different client devices out there. We wanteverybody to have multiple client devices because that willgenerate server revenue.WHITE: [Regarding] the network computer, or the NC, as [OracleChairman] Larry [Ellison] called it, . . . in my view, the'NC' stands for 'no chance.' I think the real opportunity isgoing to be driven by the combination of a network computerand a phone and probably will be deployed by the telephonybased companies. It's driving a lot of new partners, a lotof business opportunities, a lot of hype like the NC, but Ithink it will cause a lot of anxious moments and sell noneon the business side.PAPERMASTER: The Internet computer violates a fundamental premiseof personal computing and even client/server computing, whichis having ownership, if you will, of the resources it takesto control your own destiny.SIMS: The discussion now is: How slim is the client going tobe? You know it's not going to go to nothing. I think we'vebeen saying that for 25 years. We all thought that if we couldcut $200 off the cost of a terminal, we were going to havethis big market. I think the client might potentially slimup a little bit, but I don't think that is permanent.MICROSOFT'S INTERNET ROLEPAPERMASTER: I think you can look at the hits Microsoft is takingin the marketplace, at least from a perception standpoint.That's because of time compression. The thought there is: Howcan they react fast enough? Now for that statement to be evenmade at this point is pretty phenomenal.LANE: The Internet opens up the issue of the client. And that'swhy I think there's so much focus on this debate. But someof these broad-sweeping statements [that] Microsoft has lostthis debate . . . are ridiculous. I don't believe it will beleaderless, though. There will be leaders that basically buildexecution ability, have good products, mass distribution, getthe application builders. Microsoft has the best chance towin that game.WHITE: I don't think Microsoft lost the lead. They didn't haveit. Nobody had the lead.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664Top 25 Executives -- Steve Ballmer: The Net is growing... How can a VAR benefit?EDITOR'S NOTE: Steve Ballmer, executive vice president of MicrosoftCorp., Redmond, Wash., was among CRN's Top 25 Executives in1995. His column is part of an ongoing series from those executives.The Internet is no longer a possibility, it's a reality. Whatis still open to question is how fast and how far the Internetwill grow-and how VARs can benefit from that growth.In our business model for the Internet, a diverse and denselypopulated world of Solution Providers, resellers, distributors,content publishers and other third-party providers must bringthe pieces of the Internet together-including systems integration,support and training-in order to support corporate Internetusers.There is room here both for major providers-such as Digital,EDS and Andersen Consulting-as well as for the 10,000 otherSolution Providers that design, install and service computernetworks and software. Many of these companies correctly seethe corporate Internet market as the greatest opportunity theyhave and are eager to help their customers build the infrastructureto exploit it.The time for these independent providers to act is now, becausethe Internet finally has a critical mass of users. The Internetalso has some limitations and weaknesses-but that criticalmass of users actually mitigates the weaknesses in a very importantway.The thousands of independent providers in the technology communitynow have a powerful financial incentive to jump in and addresswhatever limits they perceive because the Internet finallyrepresents an extraordinary commercial opportunity, as wellas a technological one.A tremendous opportunity lies in equipping and supporting corporatecustomers with the hardware and software they need to do businessin the new Internet marketplace-business that includes communicating,selling, order handling, invoicing and financial processing,distribution, fulfillment and customer service.But opportunity is not limited to the corporations already onthe Internet, because many more will join them. The Internetwill change the economics of doing business, lowering the overallcost of business entry and raising the potential return oninvestment as companies gain access to larger markets at littleor no additional cost. That will bring more players to thefield-and more potential customers for a VAR's products andservices.New types of providers will appear to service these corporatecustomers, and resellers will be among them. We expect thatcorporations and consumers alike will be attracted to a singlesource for most or all of their Internet-service needs.In addition to Internet online services, Solution Providersand other resellers, many companies will have to work togetherto make this model a reality. Network operators are one example.Systems manufacturers are another. They must provide the multiprocessorsand the fault-tolerant systems, and, in many cases, they mustintegrate the software.Software vendors are also crucial. There is tremendous opportunityfor third-party software developers. Web servers need new applicationsfor databases, commerce, workgroups and so on.On the client side, third-party development will enhance andextend the basic operating system and integrated browser. Onthe bandwidth side of the model, expect to see success forboth of today's midband technologies, ISDN and PC-cable modem.Growth on one side will spur competition and innovation onthe other. But do not count on a revolution in broadband technologiesanytime soon.The development of the Internet may well prove to be analogousto the evolution of the original IBM PC. When it appeared in1981, there was a lot about it that was arbitrary, limitedand problematic.Yet for the past two decades, the evolution of that architecturehas driven most of our industry. The Internet is likely tobe the same way. Parts are still missing, but clearly it willevolve into the ultimate wide-area communications network-andinto a wonderful opportunity for as many resellers and thirdparties as have benefited from the PC revolution.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RESELLER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Issue 664ShadowRAMDino is dead.

And Intel vendors from Compaq, IBM,AST, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment are expected toshow units-publicly or privately-sporting the new processorsat the Winter Consumer Electronics Show here.The Pentium 150 and 166MHz chips will find their way into thelatest consumer systems at lower price points than any othernew Pentium processor because of more efficient manufacturingprocesses, said Frank Spindler, marketing manager for Pentiumat Intel. The company had begun building inventory and shippingproduction quantities to OEMs in December, allowing retailersto have quantities of the units to ship at time of introduction.New desktop systems are just the start of a broad roster ofCES introductions planned this week.Compaq, whose chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer is keynotingthe show, is expected this week to introduce its first productsfrom a joint venture with toymaker Fisher-Price earlier thisyear. Compaq is also expected to make several other breakthroughcomputer-product announcements, some publicly, others privately.Among the more noteworthy, it will show off a new system thatincorporates a scanner into its keyboard. Desktop model 7232uses PaperPort software and can scan items from business cardsto standard-sized paper. The system carries a $2,199 MAP, butCompaq is also expected to sell the unit as a separate accessory.Compaq will also introduce a minitower with Panasonic's PD readwrite optical drive built in. Model 9240 is a Pentium 133MHzwith the PD drive and a $2,499 MAP. Compaq is also showingunits with a six-speed CD-ROM drive, one of many companiesupgrading to that technology beginning this year. The companyis also expected to make hardware MPEG a "modular" option onmost systems. Only two high-end systems have hardware MPEGstandard, though most now feature software MPEG. Compaq isalso expected to tell retailers of an effort to reduce returnsto 5 percent this year from 8 percent, and to launch a 900number for software service, charging $2 a minute.IBM is expected to show new Pentium 150MHz and 166MHz unitshere at CES, while also moving to six-speed CD-ROM drives,and will become one of the first systems makers to show a fourspeed, four-disc CD-ROM changer. Pricing and availability onthe units weren't available at press time, but IBM reportedlyhas told retailers to expect few new SKUs during the firstquarter.Canon Computer Systems has been telling retailers to expecta rejuvenated PC effort, with a new line that includes sixspeed CD-ROMs, a four-disc changer and a removable hard drivethat allows users to store 850M bytes of data on a removablecard.Another company sporting higher-level Intel processors willbe NEC Technologies, which has the Ready 9552, a 150MHz multimediamachine. Among its features are full-screen, full-motion videoplayback, 3-D stereo surround sound, a hand-held remote andan answering machine with speakerphone and voice mail. It includes16M bytes of RAM, a 1.6G-byte hard drive, a 28.8K-bps DSVDfax modem and 2M-bytes VRAM. The system, which has an expectedstreet price of $3,099, features 20 software titles.Hewlett-Packard will use the show to relaunch its OmniGo 100palmtop organizer; the company has fixed a battery problemthat caused memory problems. HP is also expected to show theOmniGo 700, an integrated cellular communications and organizer.It will not be officially launched in the United States dueto regulatory problems regarding the frequency used by thedevice; however, the company is hopeful that it will clearthat hurdle and be able to ship it sometime this year.Toshiba will be showing behind closed doors a sub-$2,000 personalcomputer optimized for the SoHo market that will be poweredby the 75MHz Pentium processor. It is expected to ship in February.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Rise of 0% deals distorts margin -- Retail Reliance On No-InterestFinancing Terms Spurs ScrutinyBy:MICHAEL WALDEDEN PRAIRIE, MINN.-As no-payment, no-interest deals spiraledto new heights during last year's fourth quarter, Wall Streetanalysts, consumer advocates and even some retailers beganvoicing heightened concern about the longer-term expense ofsuch generosity.Amid cut-throat pricing and shriveling product life cycles,liberal financing terms, while driving sales, are cutting intoretail profit margins at a time when retailers are strainingto bulk up earnings. Perhaps more damaging is that some retailers'terms, which require that all back interest be paid if a consumerdoesn't settle his or her bill in full at the end of the specifiedno-interest period, are raising red flags among state regulators.Last year, Oregon-based Smith's Home Furnishings was hit witha $450,000 fine by the Washington State attorney general forfailing to adequately inform consumers about the terms of itsno-interest offer. Smith's has since gone out of business.Later last year, while investigating a Montgomery Ward policythat punishes sales associates for including zero-percent financingin a sale, CRW learned that several state attorneys generalhave formed a task force looking into the broader topic ofno-interest financing deals.While attorneys on the task force declined to comment on thenature of their investigation, they did indicate a high levelof interest in the Montgomery Ward policy.Heightened concern about such financing offers comes as retailersare raising the stakes to new heights. Best Buy last fall uppedthe ante to 15 months.Consumer electronics vendors, some of which sponsor the offers,are said to be considering extending the terms to 18 to 24months. And while little information is available about thedelinquency rate on the longer-term deals, there is a lingeringsuspicion that it may increase with the generosity of the terms,particularly for computer sales."It's particularly risky in computers because of the depreciation,obsolescence problem," said Chuck Cebuhar, divisional vicepresident and general manager for home electronics and homeoffice products at Sears. "What are consumers going to do whenthe bill comes due a year from now if the product is, in theirminds, worth half the value?"But like many retailers, Sears is compelled to offer long-term,no-interest, deferred-payment financing to keep up with competitors,Cebuhar said."We have to offer our customers competitive [no-interest, deferredpayment] financing, but we are not nearly as aggressive asother retailers," he said. "We're in a reactive, defensivemode, rather than in a proactive mode."Offering no-interest, deferred-payment financing reduces alreadythin margins among all retailers that offer such terms.But while players such as Sears and Circuit City offer financingoptions through their own banks, others such as Best Buy mustgo outside their companies to provide such deals, shaving profitseven further.David Childe, a specialty retail analyst at Wall Street brokeragefirm Salomon Brothers in New York, said Best Buy may have attractedcustomers by selling computers on 15-month no-interest, deferredpayment terms, but at a cost."They're not making money doing it, because they're eating upalmost the entire gross margin in the category," Childe said."By my estimate, it probably costs Best Buy 8 to 9 points"of margin to offer such financing.Mark Mandel, an analyst at Chicago Corp., a New York brokerage,agreed."Best Buy's promotional financing moves have generated hugeincreases in sales, but at the expense of gross margins," Mandelsaid. "They're paying through the bigger [fees] they pay tothird-party [financing] providers, which hurts their grossmargin, and aggressive pricing, which also hurts gross marginsin the obvious way. I think it's self-defeating-they're generating15 percent comp-store increases, but their stock is hittingnew 52-week lows since people are cutting their [earnings]estimates because their margins are deteriorating. I thinkthey've gone too far."Best Buy executives were unavailable to discuss the retailer'sfinancing plans.Some retailers, such as Chicago-based Montgomery Ward, are attemptingto recoup some costs of offering no-interest, deferred-paymentsfinancing by cutting sales commissions.Late in October, Montgomery Ward cut commissions up to 9 percenton purchases that involve deferred-payment, no-interest financingrunning from 90 days to 12 months unless a sales associatesimultaneously sells a three- or five-year extended warranty(CRW, Dec. 4/11, 1995)Montgomery Ward and other retailers routinely make fat marginson sales of extended warranties.The company said it enacted the policy because of widespreadabuses by sales associates, whom it accused of using no-interest,deferred-payment plans to induce customers to buy merchandisethat was ineligible for such financing.Montgomery Ward sales associates said the company's cash registersare programmed to prevent such abuses. A company spokeswomanagreed, but said many sales associates have discovered waysto foil the registers and complete such sales.The company's attempt to recoup some of the costs of offeringno-interest, deferred-payment financing apparently is not withoutits own risks, however.When CRW contacted consumer advocates at the Illinois and Californiaattorneys general offices, officials in both agencies vowedto scrutinize Montgomery Ward's advertising of no-interest,deferred-payment financing.Sources said a multistate task force is currently examiningtactics that retailers use to advertise no-interest, deferredpayment financing.In July 1995, Smith's Home Furnishings, which went out of businesslast year, agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a lawsuit broughtby the Washington State attorney general's office in 1993 ona variety of deceptive advertising and sales practices.Among the charges in the lawsuit were allegations that claimedthe retailer was offering "zero down payment, zero interestfor one full year" without disclosing that if the full purchaseprice was not paid within that year, the buyer would be chargedinterest, compounded monthly, from the date of purchase.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Registering Disappointment -- Microsoft's Bob celebrates lonelyfirst birthdayBy:YARDENA ARARLAS VEGAS-So, what about Bob?A year after a Microsoft team led by Melinda Gates unveiledits ultra-user-friendly social interface in an all-out mediablitz surpassed only by Windows 95, Bob's cheery happy-facepackage has largely disappeared from shelves in smaller stores;in larger outlets, he's a little yellow Frisbee in a sea ofWindows 95 products. His name appears in a few OEM bundles,but for the most part, Bob's a pretty lonely guy.While Microsoft would not comment on industry estimates of sales(excluding OEM units) of less than 300,000, the company inSeptember quietly lowered its price from $99.95 to $54.95 andannounced a free Bob "plus pack," obtainable by dialing a tollfree number.Product manager Jennifer Stewart termed Bob "a 1.0 product thatwe're doing a lot of learning with...We'll be taking all thefeedback we're getting and improving the product."Asked if Microsoft was disappointed with sales, she replied "I think you always have high expectations for your new product.Certainly at launch, we were at levels that were similar toestablished home products, like Encarta or Works. Post-launchsales have dipped a bit, but they're steady, and the thingthat's very encouraging and exciting is the customer reactionto the product."However, outside Microsoft, Bob is generally viewed as a rareRedmond ne'er-do-well."Because it is Microsoft and it didn't sell tens of millionsof copies, it's viewed as a failure," said Karl Wong, a softwareanalyst at Dataquest, San Jose, Calif.But Microsoft itself generated those high expectations by hypingthe product beyond what it could deliver, he said."Whether it's a good product or a bad product per se, Microsoftoversold the expectations of what the product actually wasand could be," said Wong.From a broader perspective, he said, "This whole idea of a socialinterface that was going to bring tens of thousands of peopleinto computing was false. Some people are technophobes, andno matter what kind of paradigm you use, it's still a computer."Wong and others also said that Bob's appearance-and especiallyits use of animated characters as personal "guides"-was allwrong for the target audience."The whole cartoon-like atmosphere of the product seemed aimedat the younger set, but younger kids are ready to adapt totechnology and don't need the cutesy interface. Whereas, forthe older ones, it's already embarrassing enough that theyfeel intimidated by technology, let alone to have some animatedcharacter talk to them on screen," Wong said. "If that paradigmwere true, we'd have little animation characters doing taxesand programming the VCR."Lisa Farrell, senior buyer at the Eden Prairie, Minn.-basedBest Buy chain, said Best Buy never stocked Bob in quantity."We didn't grasp what the draw was going to be for the consumer,"she said. "It was not what it was hyped up to be."While Microsoft said that those who do use Bob love it (thecompany reports that 83 percent of registered users surveyedfound their PCs more useful with Bob) Farrell said she seesno indication that the word is getting out to the marketplace."People purchase a lot of software based on word of mouth,"she said. "The sales [of Bob] have been steady...They reallyneed to reposition the product."Consultant Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies, San Jose, Calif.,who, when Bob was first announced, predicted that it wouldfind a warm reception from computer neophytes, said he stillbelieves Microsoft's market research was correct in determiningthat computers needed to be demystified in order to attractnew users."But while novices have been coming in, surprisingly they'vebeen showing a lot of acumen in learning the PC, and they'velooked at Bob and decided they didn't need it," Bajarin said.He theorized that some new users already had their own personalguides-a computer-literate friend or family member. Otherswere really first-time buyers, already familiar with PCs fromwork or school, as opposed to computer novices.Bajarin noted that the learning curve Bob was supposed to helpsurmount is addressed in easy-to-read documentation suppliedwith many popular applications, particularly those intendedfor home use.Some of these applications duplicate Bob's features, and Microsoft'sStewart believes that the Microsoft marketing machine's principalfailure was in educating consumers about the household tasksthe program could handle."One of the mistakes that we made is that you can't lead onlywith selling an approach to computing," she said. "People didn'tknow how useful Bob is for home management-writing letters,tracking schedules...We need to address the issue of what peopleare using it for as well as how easy it is to use."Bajarin agreed that consumers didn't see past Bob's interface.But he questioned whether even new users would be satisfiedwith Bob as, say, a word processor or a household finance manager,when they've seen what can be done with more sophisticatedproducts such as Word or Quicken."The bottom line is, people wanted these robust applications,"Bajarin said.Walter Miao, a software specialist at IDC/Link Resources, NewYork, voiced similar criticisms."It's certainly a cute program and interesting to a neophyte.It's a convenient home-oriented all-in-one package. But oncethe novelty wears off, it's a very boring package," Miao said."I can't do enough with it."Some of these criticisms may be addressed in the next releaseof Bob. Stewart said the product was on an 18- to 24-monthupgrade cycle, which means that Bob 2.0 would not roll outmuch before Q4 of 1996.She declined to comment on changes under consideration, butthey're said to include everything from the addition of telephonyfeatures and less cartoon-like personal guides to the integrationof modules from other Microsoft productivity packages.Bajarin believes Bob may be a product that came before its time.He pointed out that the vast majority of first-time PC buyersright now are in households with income of $42,000 or morea group that would tend to either be PC-literate to begin withor have friends and family members who are.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Top 100 surpass $23BBy:ROGER C. LANCTOTNEW YORK-For the second year in a row, the retail computer industryhit the jackpot in 1995, posting a 38.3 percent gain in sales,according to Computer Retail Week's annual survey of the top100 computer retailers.The retail portion of sales was up a robust 45 percent, to $19.3billion, with total sales, including non-retail sales, surpassing$23.1 billion.The sales data in the CRW report is based on estimates derivedfrom public and private data sources. The data reflects estimatesof sales for calendar year 1995.Five stores finished with more than $1 billion in sales of computerrelated merchandise, two more than last year. CompUSA, BestBuy and Computer City SuperCenters were joined in the billiondollar club by Office Depot and Circuit City Stores.Hardware drove market gains with a hefty 45 percent increasecompared to 1994, according to the CRW report. Software salesswelled by 26 percent, propelled by gains in the office superstore,electronics superstore, mass merchant and warehouse club channels.Software specialists' sales were flat compared to '94 as thismall-skewed channel continued to take a pounding from superstoreretailers and a dramatic broadening of the software marketplaceto include book, toy and media retailers as well as supermarkets.As a group, software specialists Electronics Boutique, NeoStar,Egghead and Software City saw their collective share of retailcomputer merchandise sales drop from 8.9 percent in '94 to6.5 percent in '95.The number of stores selling computer-related products jumpedby 13.3 percent in '95, based solely on a review of the top100 computer retailers. New members of CRW's Top 100 list includeToys R Us with 650 stores selling software, and media retailerVirgin Megastore with five locations.Circuit City jumped into fifth place with a 101.4 percent increasein computer-related sales in '95 compared with '94.

But despite this lack of parameters, interest amongtube manufacturers is surging, with some projecting a 300,000 to 400,000-unit market in 1996, with most PC/TVs carryinga $1,000 suggested retail price.Most of this interest has centered on big-screen tubes in the27- to 35-inch range, which currently have a standard-grade0.55 dot pitch. The market activity will eventually move intothe high-resolution 0.28 dot pitch range, the hallmark of PCmonitors."All we know is we've had a lot of inquiries and a lot of interestin doing a large-format display, with the applications beingpresentations and interactive TV," said an executive with aJapanese electronics giant. "We're all wondering where thisis going, and I think a lot of these guys who are jumping onthe bandwagon are doing so because they've heard somebody elseis."Indeed, when Apple introduced a full-function Macintosh PC witha 14-inch monitor and a TV tuner in 1993, it was alone witha product that survived only a short time on retail shelves.Toshiba followed with the 20-inch Toshiba Integrated MultimediaMonitor (TIMM) in 1994 and has had limited success sellingthe concept to such retail powers as Circuit City.But now Hitachi has said it will introduce a 27-inch model thisyear, while Thomson Consumer Electronics will use the WinterConsumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week to gauge interestin finer-pitch 19-, 27- and 35-inch multimedia monitors. EvenProton, which builds conventional PC monitors on an OEM basis,said it will introduce 15- and 17-inch PC/TVs in 1996, eventhough it concedes a large market won't emerge until 1997.Where these initial product offerings will lead and who willbuy them is open for debate. Many industry officials arguethat corporate presentations are likely to be the first target,and they point to Toshiba's TIMM, which has sold less than100,000 units during its first year on the market at $799 retail."It's really for industrial presentations at this point, andwe may not bring the product to market until 1997," said WilliamTovatt, sales and marketing vice president at Proton. "I thinkthe learning curve in the education for consumers has to start."Stephen Nickerson, vice president of marketing for TVs and VCRsat Toshiba, said the company plans to move to larger sizesand is studying a 27-inch tube currently available in Japan.While TIMM's 0.55 dot pitch has slowed sales, perceptions change"once people understand what the product is and what the differencesare," Nickerson said. "We believe there is definitely a marketfor this and it's just a matter of when we introduce otherproducts."Whether there will be a consumer market for PC/TVs will be determinedat the retail level, where dealers have yet to fully embracethe concept. If the product uses a standard-grade TV monitor,some dealers said, it may get caught up in the dot pitch "numbersgame" that governs conventional PC monitors.The goal of most potential entrants in the PC/TV race is a 0.28dot pitch monitor, but that would require a design to compensatefor the brightness that is lost in moving to a finer dot pitch.While 0.55 monitors serve well for presentations and NTSC video,a fine pitch is needed for a "hard-core work machine" usedfor spreadsheets and other forms of number crunching, manufacturerssaid.One option could be to use a technology like Toshiba's highcontrast "Microfilter" tube, which raises brightness whileelectronically increasing contrast by placing a color filterin front of each phosphor dot."TV/PCs don't spec out with some of the better monitors rightnow," L.A.Tronics video buyer Robert Becker said. "So a lotof people dismiss them as not a serious piece of computer equipment.But as the market matures, there will be a need for cross-compatibility,so these companies are doing the right thing in getting involved."Yet despite the focus on fine-pitch tubes, a medium-resolutionproduct may be the best option for a device designed for mixedapplications, said Edward Egert, vice president of sales andmarketing for Philips Display Products.Egert concedes the company is looking for the "right combinationof performance characteristics," but hasn't decided on thefinal specifications."Multimedia says the consumers will use these products for thealphanumerics as well as with picture graphics," said Egert."Commercial products have been a way of shaking out a technologyand getting a better margin while you're doing it, but I'mseeing this coming from both sides, because there is a lotof interest from the consumer producers as well."One thing that does remain certain, however, is that the marketwill be dominated by conventional tubes. Thomson showed a 26inch wide-screen monitor at Comdex in April, but couldn't sellcustomers on the concept.

"We didn't have the large distributionthat the top titles have," said Glen Uslan, vice presidentof marketing for the software company.Thus, Packard Bell elected to change the company name to a brandthat is immediately recognizable to consumers. The companyalso hired John Rutter, formerly a channel marketing managerwith Microsoft, as senior vice president of sales and marketing.Working under Rutter will be Steve Boehm, vice president ofworldwide sales, who was previously North American sales managerat Medio Multimedia.In addition, the software firm has priced all its products at$24.99 to $29.99 with the intent of increasing perceived value.Uslan said the titles, previously priced at $19.99, were intendedto be merchandised as a budget shipper display. However, Uslansaid retailers generally purchased a few SKUs from the lineand displayed the titles with other CD-ROMs in the edutainmentsection, where customers would expect to see higher-pricedproducts."An impulse purchase only works if merchandised as an impulsebuy, and retailers were not prepared to do that," Uslan explained.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124CA may tailor software bundles -- Publisher's Consumer DivisionLooks To Gain Market Share For Its TitlesBy:Kathleen RichardsISLANDIA, N.Y.-This week at the Consumer Electronics Show, ComputerAssociates' consumer division, 4Home Productions, will discusswith retailers and potential OEM partners customized CD-ROMdisc compilations.The move is an effort by the company to gain market share fromdivision titles, which to date have shown lackluster retailsales.

Mammoth Incredible Universe storessprout in suburbia, Best Buy brings a 58,000-square-foot ConceptIII format to Los Angeles and even Roberd's tries its handwith a 250,000-square-foot outlet in Ohio. Circuit City, onceknown for its cautious approach to expansion, is includinglarger, 42,000-square-foot outlets as only a small portionof the 60 to 65 stores it will open in 1996. Office Depot isopening its first megastores, while The Good Guys! is scoutingturf for new 60,000-square-foot WOW! stores.But while the number of megastores is growing rapidly, profitsare not. Incredible Universe began the year looking for a profit,but will end it with an $11 million loss, analysts said.Best Buy had planned to open 30 to 40 stores in 1996, but ithas come under intense pressure from investors to scale backand restore profitability.The issue has become whether the larger stores can generateenough sales to overcome the increases in overhead that megastoresincur. Analysts point out that megastores should save retailersmoney in the long run, since bigger outlets eliminate the needfor adding several smaller ones in a given market. But thattheory remains open for debate."There is a basic idea at retail that bigger is better, andto a point, that is correct," said Ursula Moran, a researchanalyst at Sanford P. Bernstein & Co., New York. "But the problemis, sometimes retailers don't know when enough is enough. Havingdone well with 32,000 square feet, better with 45,000, BestBuy goes to 58,000, and 58,000 is too big."Indeed, while megastores supply lower prices and larger productselection, they haven't quite defined themselves for consumers.While Incredible Universe tries to provide an entertainingshopping environment, its merchandising of housewares and exerciseequipment with PCs and consumer electronics hasn't producedprofits.Others have tried to offset a price-driven image with venturesinto high-end audio and have met mixed results.Even office superstores that were once easy to define are branchingout to open 50,000-square-foot stores that offer copy centersand office furniture along with PCs and printers.The need to provide a defining characteristic has become evenmore critical in an era where consumers may look at ads fromfive stores but, on average, shop at fewer than two, analystssaid. Shopping demographics like these have led some analyststo project that half of all retail stores will be gone by theyear 2000, and that only those with a niche will survive.Consumer electronics and office superstores are still relativenewcomers to the megastore game, and without a niche they mayhave limited life spans, said analysts."In every big box there is a point where you go beyond beingimpressive to a point where you're too confusing," said BrittBeemer, chairman of America's Research Group, Charleston, S.C."And that's why I think some of Best Buy's newer stores aren'tmeeting their expectations. And if you look at some of theseIncredible Universe stores, they've gone over the edge."But despite such shortcomings, the megastores have their supporters,who argue that the format is in its infancy when it comes toconsumer electronics and that many markets remain open forexpansion."The buyers at Home Depot and Ikea, which are well accepted,all buy consumer electronics. It's the same customer just makinga different purchase," Channel Marketing president David Goldsteinsaid.But where consumers buy products is becoming increasingly criticalin determining the livelihoods of regional retailers. The growthof megastores may also mean the end for some regional chains.And while megastore supporters claim that the bigger outletsincrease overall sales in a given market, the question becomeswhether the sales are new revenues or taken from a competitor.The past year has seen an unusually large number of retailersclose their doors at the same time others are opening theirs.Smith's Home Furnishings liquidated this fall, a little overa year after The Good Guys! and Incredible Universe arrivedin the Pacific Northwest. And Swallen's closed its stores inCincinnati after 46 years, citing, among other things, increasedcompetition from consumer electronics retailers like Sun TV,which entered the market with its larger, 50,000-square-footSuper Savings Centers."It's a zero-sum game at this point, because the projected growthrate of the big retailers is well in excess of the market growthrate. They grow by taking share from somebody else," Moransaid.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Sega now on the MAPBy:KRISTEN KENEDYREDWOOD CITY, CALIF.-Sega of America this year plans to speedrelease of new game titles to market, work to solidify retailrelationships and firm up its new ventures into the distributionand software businesses, president and chief executive TomKalinske said in an interview with CRW last month.Among more notable changes at Sega as the year drew to a close,the company implemented a minimum advertised pricing (MAP)strategy on its products. Retailers "seemed to be OK with it.Almost everyone thinks it is a cool idea," Kalinske said.But the game maker is still struggling with retailer backlashover its surprise decision last year to launch its Saturn systemexclusively to three retailers.While some retailers are still privately expressing dismay overSega's announcement last May that it would ship Saturn systemsearly to NeoStar stores, Electronics Boutique and Toys 'R'Us, Kalinske said Sega's position to retailers will be veryclear during the coming year."We launched Saturn early because of significant consumer demandand to get a jump on the competition," he said. "The impactthat had on our retail relationships was a difficult lessonto learn. I believe we have a very good read on the situationand are working to make relationships with our retailers muchstronger than before, with specific POP, demonstrator and informationcampaigns that are helping our retailers in the entire category."In addition to stitching together some torn retailer relationships,Sega is pushing forward with Sega Soft, a joint venture announcedin November by Japanese software developer CSK Group.Although Kalinske would not discuss specific projects alreadyunder way at the company, he said titles from the venture willbegin to ship sometime in summer or fall. One such project,he said, marries film graphics and computer animation withmultiplayer capabilities; another is a multiplayer sports gamethat lets users make changes in the game that aren't currentlypossible.While Sega Soft will focus primarily on PC and Saturn games,developers will also be designing games for the Internet inthe future, said Kalinske.Combined with the titles that are also in development at Segaof America, Kalinske said there are about 30 software titlesin development for this year, with an additional 25 titlesin production in Japan that could also be marketed in the UnitedStates. Add to that other titles in development from thirdparty developers and the market will see about 180 titles thisyear for the Saturn system, Kalinske said."It always comes down to who has the best software," he said."What we do [in the United States] is create software. We happento have hardware platforms too, but largely we make software.We think that gives us a leg up over the competition, but wewill see."The company will focus on its core hardware products: the Picofor 3- to 7-year-olds, the Genesis for 8- to 13-year-olds,and the Saturn, intended for those 14 and older.Despite the increased number of titles coming to market fromSega this year, the company's distribution facility will stillnot reach maximum capacity. Thus, Sega teamed with the giantSoftbank conglomerate, in a deal announced late last year,to provide distribution services for publishers and peripheralsmanufacturers. At press time, Sega still had not chosen a namefor the company, which has been operating under the code nameGame Express. Sega expects to announce a name for the companyand its first vendors at the end of this month.The new company differs from a traditional distributor in thatit does not seek to help vendors sell products to retail. Whatit will provide instead is efficient distribution and fulfillment.The distribution company's strong suit, according to Kalinske,is a highly effective computer system that can deliver productdirect to stores in as little as 24 hours, but usually between38 and 48 hours.The system can link directly with retailers using EDI. But forthose retailers that don't rely on such capabilities, the newcompany will have reps in the field that can place EDI fromthe retail site using a notebook computer, a feature Sega ofAmerica currently offers its retail customers.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124SPA head testifies in FTC probeBy:KRISTEN KENEDYSAN MATEO, CALIF.-The Software Publishers Association, throughtestimony to the Federal Trade Commission on Dec. 20, madepublic its position on a variety of competitive issues thatface the computer industry, including controversial exclusivedistribution models that have sparked debate recently.Ken Wasch, president of the SPA, told Computer Retail Week thatthe FTC has been conducting broad public hearings to examinehow antitrust principles, written and enforced in the industrialage, will apply to companies as the United States moves intothe information age. The hearings are unrelated to an informalinquiry launched by the FTC late last year into some softwarepublishers' refusal to supply titles to publisher/distributorNewMedia Express.About 30 companies have testified at the broader industry hearings,Wasch said, including the Computer and Communications IndustryAssociation, IBM and Borland. Microsoft, NewMedia Express andGoodTimes Interactive have not testified in the hearings, saidan FTC spokeswoman.The spokeswoman said the three-month-long hearings, which havebeen extended until Jan. 23, will be used to determine if changesare necessary in "policy or other areas" in high-tech competition.The SPA hopes the hearings will result in new guidelines onhow the FTC deals with what the SPA terms "abusive practicesby dominant firms."Wasch's testimony to the FTC was centered on discriminatoryaccess to information from the developer of a market-dominatingoperating system or platform, exclusionary restraints in technologylicensing agreements and control over retail distribution channels.Regarding exclusive distribution agreements, Wasch said in histestimony: "Many of our members depend on the major mass-merchandisingretail chains for the distribution and sale of their softwareproducts to the ultimate consumer."Effective market access rests on meaningful shelf space andother merchandising treatment of their products at the retaillevel. Yet, increasingly, these retail chains have been persuadedto transfer to dominant competitors the control over shelfspace and other critical merchandising functions for entireproduct categories within their stores. As a result, our smallermembers must work through and depend entirely upon their majorcompetitors for their placements in these stores. It is unrealisticto expect fair treatment or anything approaching a level playingfield in this situation."In short, dominant firms have incentives to misuse their powerover retail channels as a means of maintaining and enhancingtheir dominance by impairing the ability of smaller rivalsto develop satisfactory distribution arrangements. Again, wewould invite consideration of whether and how government antitrustenforcement policy could appropriately address this problem."As part of his testimony, Wasch also said the SPA conducteda survey of its 1,200 members regarding anti-competitive issues.Wasch reported that respondents of the survey are "greatlyconcerned that increased distribution control by software companiesraises barriers to entry for new software companies."According to the testimony, eight in 10 respondents said, "Theincreased control of distribution channels by software publishershas raised barriers to entry for new software companies orthreatened the existence of existing software companies."Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Retail DigestThe Home Computing Supershow kicked off its third event in SanFrancisco last week with approximately 34,000 attendees.

The software, which carried a$29.99 suggested retail price, was the first Windows 95 memoryutility to reach the market, and promised to "Double Your Memory,"providing consumers with an inexpensive software solution tothe RAM-intensive Windows 95 operating system.By November, Vancouver, British Columbia-based Syncronys hadsold 400,000 units of SoftRAM95 through retail, and the producthad remained the leading utility at retail since it was firstshipped in August, according to market researcher PC Data,Reston, Va.Although most customers apparently could not tell the differenceas evidenced by few returns-SoftRAM95 provided no memory improvementsto Windows 95 users, according to a National Software TestingLaboratories test commissioned by competing publisher Connectix.Syncronys notified channel partners in an Oct. 25 letter thatfor the Windows 95 version of the product, which was shippedin the same box as the Windows 3.1 version, "RAM compressionis not being delivered to the operating system on a consistentbasis." The letter stated that Syncronys would sticker boxes,and would offer Windows 95 users a Windows 95 upgrade releasefree of charge when it was shipped, or a full refund if desired.Egghead and PriceCostco removed the leading utility immediatelyfrom their stores. CompUSA has reduced the price on the productto $9.95."The recall was to end the consumer confusion and to make aclean break," said Syncronys president Rainer Poertner. "Wewill resubmit upgrades of the Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 versionsof SoftRAM to Microsoft and Veritest, an independent testingfirm, within the next few days."In fact, SoftRAM95 had not qualified for the "Designed for Windows95" logo, although the logo appeared on the box, accordingto Russ Stockdale, Windows 95 marketing manager at Microsoft."They did not qualify and were never authorized to displayit on their packaging," he said.As the market-leading Windows 95 memory utility is recalledfrom retail, competing publishers are left the task of convincingconsumers that the category is still viable.Quarterdeck Office Systems, a supplier of DOS memory managementproducts, shipped MagnaRAM 2 in September, and the same technologyis incorporated in the company's higher-end QEMM 8 memory managementsoftware. Both titles are native Windows 95 applications.Connectix is entering the Windows 95 category after achievingphenomenal success with its RAM Doubler software for the Macintoshand limited success with a Windows 3.1 title. A native Windows95 version of RAM Doubler is slated to ship early this year."I think that [SoftRAM95] has probably caused some confusionamong consumers in Q4 and will in Q1," said Roy MacDonald,chief executive officer of Connectix. "The established companieshave to educate consumers that there are good solutions inthis category. In the long term, it won't have a lasting impact."Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Many retailers increased direct business in '95By:MICHAEL WALDNEW YORK-Many personal-computer retailers reported strong growthin their direct-channel business during 1995, amid new andexpanded mail-order initiatives and corporate sales opportunitiessparked by Windows 95.Others expanded their direct operations onto the Internet orsimply mailed more catalogs.The arrival of Windows 95 last August boosted corporate salesas businesses replaced or upgraded older machines to run thenew operating system, retailers said."We've seen a tremendous increase in our corporate sales ascompanies replaced old systems with Pentium machines, and boughtmore storage and memory for existing machines," said LarryAdler, vice president of marketing at NCA Computer Products,Sunnyvale, Calif.CDW Computer Center president Greg Zeman said his company'smail-order business grew more CPU-intensive as major systemsvendors gave the channel more attention in 1995. The companywon authorization to sell the full Apple Computer line throughmail order, and also participated in a Compaq pilot mail-orderprogram.Some computer retailers that had previously avoided direct channelsjumped in last year. Computer City Super-Centers announcedits entry into the direct-marketing channel last June and sentcatalogs to more than 1 million customers last October. Pricesin those catalogs appeared to match those in its stores.Other mail-order marketers, including Creative Computers, MicroWarehouse, Programmer's Paradise, CDW and Insight Enterprises,issued public offerings in 1995 to fuel expansion efforts focusedmainly on increasing catalog mailings.Mail-order market leader Micro Warehouse moved aggressivelyto increase the frequency of catalog mailings, the number ofpeople and businesses that received them and the breadth ofproduct offerings. Others, such as CDW and Insight Enterprises,also stepped up catalog mailings and said they planned to furtherexpand such efforts in 1996.Insight Direct, a division of Tempe, Ariz.-based Insight Enterprises,mailed 7.4 million catalogs in fiscal year 1995, which endedJune 30. In fiscal 1996, the company projects it will mail20 million to 30 million catalogs.NCA increased catalog mailings from 10,000 units in 1994 to400,000 last year, Adler said. Other smaller outfits, suchas Computer Town in Salem, N.H., and State Street Discountin Portsmouth, N.H., also stepped up catalog mailings thisyear, targeting customers beyond the local market for the firsttime.Even retailers that planned to expand catalog mailings moreslowly, such as Elek-Tek, which plans to go from three mailingsin 1995 to seven in 1996, are following Micro Warehouse's leadin developing specialty catalogs for subsets of customers withintheir databases.Innovation wasn't limited solely to catalog mailings. Severalretailers and mail-order computer resellers unveiled Internetsites in 1995. Some of these sites permitted point-and-clickcredit-card purchases, while others were limited to displayingproducts and a toll-free number for placing orders.The Internet Shopping Network (ISN), Palo Alto, Calif., soldmore than$1 million in personal-computer hardware and software in October1995, vice president of marketing Bill Rollinson said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Traffic Report: A Glance Back And A Look Ahead -- Best-dressed stories of '95and '96By:KEVIN FERGUSONOK, let's waste no time: Here are my top stories of 1995 and1996. Best Slugfest: Undoubtedly no secret to anyone in the industry,the controversy over used parts was a great shocker to therest of the world.The finger-pointing between Compaq and Packard Bell, which isfar from over, quickly escalated to wild mud-slinging. Most Humorous Explanation:Packard Bell's retort to Compaq'sallegations that it was including used parts in its computers.Packard Bell explained that it was just trying to be environmentallyconscious.It's good to know our landfills will only overflow with disposablediapers rather than hard drives, although hard drives breakdown a lot faster. Most Successful Product Launch: Windows 95. Most Annoying Product Launch: Windows 95. Most Impressive Come-back: CompUSA, which improved marginsand sales, and still continued to expand. Toughest Strategy to Defend: The New-Media Express softwaredistribution model. Face it, the idea of working with yourchief competitor in hopes of beating your competitor is nevergoing to be all that popular. Most Familiar Story: Product shortages. While desktop saleswere still as strong in 1995 as they were in 1994, they couldhave been that much stronger if supplies of the most popularitems had been available (typically those employing higherend Pentiums). Look for a repeat in 1996. One Of The More Interesting Retail Stories In Progress: Thecomeuppance due computer and electronics retailers whose zeropercent financing deals are no deals at all. Even Better Than That: The introduction of Internet boxes,$500 PCs or whatever you want to call them.Additionally, the growth of online, interactive gaming and computingthrough cable companies and the Telcos. Mergers I'd Like To See In 1996: Micro Center and Elek-Tek;Packard Bell and NEC; and me and the ski lift at Vail.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Editorial: PC retail market deserves your attentionBy:KEITH NEWMANFor the third straight year, you have in front of you our Top100/CES issue-the most exciting way we can think of to startoff the new year. And, once again, we have gone beyond ourexisting standard by offering more data and analysis with thegoal of keeping you ahead of the sharp PC retail power curve.It may seem odd to consider, but PCs are the most exciting highgrowth category in the retail market today. Still, those whotry and drive it too hard are just as reckless as those whofail to devote the necessary resources and commitment to it.And, right now, the PC retail market deserves significant focus.Consumer computing is booming, thanks to repeat home buyersand work-at-home and small-business customers who overwhelminglyshop at retail. Together, this represents a large and growingpercentage of the entire PC market. It may seem hard to fathom,given the precarious profit picture most are faced with, butthe fact is, PCs remain the savior of technology retailersand PC makers. According to research firm ARS, its survey of50 retail computer superstore locations this past week revealedthat 58 percent of retailers believe that PC sales are betterthan expected. Contrast this with everything else being writtenabout holiday retail sales or the overall outlook of retailand it's easy to see the importance that computers hold forthese merchants.But what remains difficult is trying to package this broad groupof retailers under one banner like the CRW Top 100. There arehigh-service and self-service, destination and mall stores;virtual stores and catalog showrooms; software-only chains;media malls and cyberstores. And the list only continues tobroaden as retailers look to reach more customers and offermore value. However, we feel this makes this comprehensiveand exhaustive project, which is spearheaded by our editorialresearch director Roger Lanctot, more valuable than ever.Just consider some of the findings: Overall store count amongthe Top 100 has surpassed 20,000 locations, and total salesare $23 billion, compared with $16 billion last year. Anotherfinding, to paraphrase an executive of one of our Top 10 companies "Leaders lead or get moved out of the way."A case in point, CompUSA, the No. 1 retailer on our list, isonce again taking a leadership position, marketing to kids,moms, power users, corporate buyers and selling more servicethan ever before. Similarly, Tandy's three major retail chainsall deserve congratulations for driving store counts and saleswhile pushing the envelope and testing new categories and newmarketing efforts.Yet, the powerful regional computer superstores are giving noquarter, while the office superstore and consumer electronicschains are promoting the PC category like never before.There are numerous other key market indicators throughout thisreport and, as with everything we do, we hope it helps youstay on the curve.

And as they play, they will be reinforcing the learning,"said Jonathan Harber, the company president.When he sat down to plan the software lines, he recruited severalveterans of the children's education and edutainment businessto sit on the company's board of advisors. They include a formerexecutive producer and head writer for "Sesame Street" and"3-2-1 Contact," the producer of "Captain Kangaroo" and anassociate in education at the American Museum of Natural Historyin New York.In addition to the new technology, most of the titles employtechniques similar to those that made the PBS children's televisionprogramming so popular: music and character development. JonathanHarber feels both elements are missing from many of today'ssoftware titles.The company plans to release children's music tapes and CDsin conjunction with the software launch. Harber says he hopesto capture a healthy percentage of the children's music market,which is now dominated by one company."The children's music market is 90 percent owned by Disney.Kids really respond to music," said Harber.He said that with the release of the KinderActive series thecompany hopes to change the face of education, bringing itinto the home."Every industry has been updated from 100 years ago. If youput doctors from 1896 in today's hospital, they would be lostand unable to do their job. But if you brought teachers forwardin time, they would feel right at home. The change in children'seducation is overdue, and it's starting in the home," saidHarber.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Business Deals Flourish -- Spinning a Web of infinite opportunitiesBy:BRADLEY J. FIKESMicrosoft's belated but dramatic embrace of the WorldWide Webearly last month proved it: The Web's growth has become selfsustaining. As its ease of use and versatility increases, morebusinesses find the Web impossible to ignore.Just a few months ago, Microsoft appeared to be a near-monopoly,able to set industry standards virtually at will. But duringthe week of Dec. 4, it licensed Sun Microsystems' Java programmingtechnology for the Web and took other steps aimed at makingits software, including Windows 95, more Web-compatible.Meanwhile, companies such as IBM, Netscape Communica-tions,America Online and Intuit made their own Java-related dealswith Sun to create an easy-to-use Web programming languagerivaling Microsoft's own Visual Basic Script.The story goes far beyond Microsoft's struggle to maintain itsdominant position in software, industry observers say. TheWeb has created its own market, as well as opportunities thatthe business community is now beginning to exploit seriously.Trends include: A growing parallel retail market, especially for software andother technology goods. Synergies between the Web and traditional advertising vehicles. Use of the Web as an "Intranet," allowing nearly platform-independentcommunication between distant units of a business.As for retail opportunities, retail outlets on the Web suchas eShop and Internet Shopping Network have so proliferatedthey are no longer a novelty in the industry.Salida, Colo.-based consultant Woody Liswood said the Web hasbecome an important supplementary market for retailing technology.However, the average consumer will have little use for Webshopping for now."I see it as being useful for people who already know what theywant," Liswood said. "When you reach that level of sophistication,you can say 'OK, I wonder what's available' and do a Yahoosearch for modems."As an example, Liswood pointed to one company, modems.com, thatsells its products exclusively through the Web."It used to be retail, they pulled it off the market and nowthey're selling their modem-I think it's one of the best onthe market-strictly through the Web."The canonical example of doing business via the Web is Netscape.The company is known for essentially giving away its popularWeb browser to individual users so as to increase demand forits server software. However, its Netscape General Store hasbecome increasingly more important to the company, said HughHempel, director of electronic marketing.In February, Netscape put up a basic online order form, Hempelsaid. In August, Netscape installed a full-fledged online storewhere browsers could buy software, books, and even clothingitems such as boxer shorts embroidered with Netscape's mascot,Mozilla."The Netscape store showcases our technology, but it's alsoresponsible for transacting at least 5-percent-plus, maybe10 percent, of our business from a software point of view,"Hempel said. "It's a non-trivial part of our story."Hempel pointed to Internet Shopping Network, which advertises"quite liberally" on Netscape's Web site, as another successstory."I know for a fact they're doing good business in both hardwareand software retailing on the 'net," Hempel said. "There arecertainly some people who otherwise would have gotten in theircar and driven down to CompUSA or wherever, but didn't do it.I think it's a phenomenon that is not a flash in the pan byany stretch of the imagination."Liswood and Hempel agreed that the problem of data security,while it exists, has been exaggerated."I think it's something the Eastern press likes to yell aboutbecause it makes good headlines, but they're not computer users,and I don't think they understand the problem," Liswood said.According to Hempel, "The people who ultimately take the riskare not the end users anyway," because credit card companiesdon't make customers pay for fraudulent bills. "If you calledup Visa today and asked how they ranked the risk, the lowestrisk transaction for them is over the Internet. It doesn'tjibe with what the media says."Concern will subside as Internet shopping becomes more familiarto the public, Hempel said. The Web has also given new lifeto the venerable software tradition of shareware. A Web siteeliminates the need to convince online services and bulletinboard systems to offer a software application.Software author Kenn Nesbitt sells his WebEdit HTML Editor forWindows exclusively via his Web site (http://nesbitt.com/).Web consultant Larry M. Edwards said Nesbitt's selling strategyis ideal, because it targets only potential customers."Anybody working on the Web would want to use his product; peoplewho aren't working on the Web have absolutely no use for hisproduct," said San Diego-based Edwards, who helped bring theAmerica's Cup to the Internet as part of America's Cup Online.However, Netscape's Hempel and Charles Gillespie, vice presidentfor publishing of San Diego-based Web content designer BienLogic, said companies with a substantial retail store presencemust be alert for potential conflicts if they set up shop onthe Web."There is a bit of a conflict of interest in cases of softwaredevelopers and others who have very strong relationships withdealers and VAR resellers," Gillespie said. "They don't wantto jeopardize their points of sale by going online and undercuttingthe price."Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Retail Net: DONKEY BUSINESSTwo million preorders for Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's KongQuest, combined with a production schedule that slipped slightly,means serious shortages for Nintendo.

On the entertainmentfront, watch for live-action video titles from PowerHouse Entertainmentas well as simulations and more game packs.WizardWorks is capitalizing on the 3-D craze with a bundle ofthree game titles popular at retail for their 360 degrees ofentertainment. The new 3-D Action Pack includes Terminal Velocity,Rise of the Triad: The Hunt Begins and WarCraft. Suggestedretail price is $19.99.PowerHouse Entertainment, which recently signed a deal to developtwo of its Moviegame live-action video titles for IBM Multimedia,is launching its first game based on that same technology,but with a twist.At CES, the company will be announcing Collision, an arcadestyle game with a live-action video component. However, unlikesome live-action entertainment titles in which movie clipsserve predominantly as a backdrop, Moviegame titles allow usersto interact with video in real time. The technology lets playersnavigate through a live-action car demolition video while theytravel through the universe and attempt to destroy Spine, theenemy leader, and his band of drones.In order to live long enough to dispose of Spine, players mustuse basic driving skills and radar to seek out and smash allenemy cars while avoiding collisions with deadly opponents.Along the way, they also must find weapons and equipment thathelp them blast into the inner circle to do battle with Spine.Meanwhile, The Jungle Book, PowerHouse's first title for IBM,will ship this month. Picking up where the Disney movie leftoff, players travel through the jungle and learn the languageof the monkeys in order to find and return the prized crownof the Monkey King.A proprietary technology developed by PowerHouse lets usersin these titles move from one video sequence to another withoutan interruption in the action. The technology is intended tolet players feel a cause-and-effect relationship between theaction they take and the subsequent video they see on the screen.The user interface-which can be an icon, a moving hot spotor any object on the screen-is constantly responding to theplayer's actions. For instance, the moving hot spots pepperedthroughout the video create instant branching, making the flowof action unpredictable.In addition to deals with IBM, Power-House officials said theyare negotiating with several studios to create other MovieGames for a holiday release this year.The Learning Company is expected to show four new titles forkids, including Logic Quest, a 3-D medieval learning adventurefor children ages 8 to 14.The title develops essential thinking skills, requiring childrento navigate through 12 levels of challenging mazes, puzzlesand construction activities.The Learning Company said the game provides a realistic 3-D,first-person perspective of the medieval world as well as animated3-D construction adventures.Also showing is the Interactive Math Journey, the first productin the Math Explorers Series, which will help develop basicmath skills and confidence for kids ages 6 to 9. It combinesexploration activities and traditional skill-building games.Other titles include the Ultimate Writing and Creative WritingCenter and Reader Rabbit's Reading Development Library 3.The Writing and Creativity Center is a full-featured word processorthat enables children ages 6 to 10 to create reports, storybooks,newsletters, journals and signs. The Reader Rabbit Libraryis the latest addition to the Learning Company's multilevelseries of interactive books. For kids ages 5 to 8, the titlesinclude The Princess and the Pea and The Goose That Laid theGolden Egg.Pricing for the titles is expected to range from $45 to $99.Sanctuary Woods will be showing two entertainment titles aswell as a number of edutainment titles.One of the titles aimed at the entertainment market is Lion,a wildlife simulation in which players assume the role of alion in the African Serengeti. Users can choose to play asa nomad or control an entire pride, selecting from among 20lion characters, each with individual strengths and weaknesses.Orion Burger, first announced at E3 last year, will also bedemonstrated.

Retailers are expectedto take mix management and analysis to the next level to counteractthat glut. And publishers, in turn, will be launching expandedmarketing programs and promotions.While mergers, such as SoftKey's acquisition of the LearningCompany and MECC, or Sierra On-Line's buying binge that mostrecently included Papyrus Software, topped the industry's mosttalked-about list, many retailers said they expected the shakeoutto be more widespread. As a result, even more titles will becompeting for retail attention this year. More mergers areguaranteed, as companies either make it in retail or alignthemselves with the more powerful group of Master Publishers.Nowhere will this trend be more evident than in edutainment,where titles are more brand oriented and where some analystsbelieve there is room for only a handful of players.On a more positive note, perhaps one of the most significantevents this year for PC entertainment software was the launchof Windows 95. In addition to improving the quality of PC games,the auto-install feature in Microsoft's new operating systemsimplified game loading significantly. Where users once hadto spend hours configuring a game to recognize sound boardsand other multimedia enhancements, the auto-install featuretransformed installation into a simple point and click procedure,in most cases. Reducing that installation time was a definitivemilestone toward PC plug and play for the home user.Already, leading developers are showing support for Windows95. Electronic Arts, Activision and Acclaim, for example, haveannounced that game titles this year will be Windows-95-native."Between better performance of video and audio, and Plug andPlay, Windows 95 is very appealing," said Eric Johnson, vicepresident of marketing at Activision. "Computer [games] werejust kind of limited with Windows 3.1, and with DOS there arestill all these configuration problems. With Windows 95 youjust put the disk in and it boots up. On installation thatmeans the customer is happy and we have [fewer] technical supportcalls."Also improving the look and feel of games was the emergenceof the Pentium PC as the dominant system last year, as wellas the increased amount of RAM shipped in entry-level systemsand 3-D boards. With the low end becoming a Pentium 75 with8M bytes of RAM, developers can write more sophisticated programsthat will take full advantage of the Pentium processing might.Sega, for example, released its first games for the PC lastyear but designed the titles specifically for the Pentium processor.At launch time, Sega said only the power of the Pentium wouldallow developers to create a game that would rival play onits console systems. Its first three titles were Tomcat Alley,Ecco The Dolphin and Comix Zone, all based on popular Segaconsole games already in the market.Software with 3-D environments topped the PC Data charts asa host of boards shipped that make playing 3-D games fasterand better. Although the retail market has yet to see a significantinstalled base in 3-D boards, publishers expect the boardsto be standard in PCs shipping for Christmas 1996. As such,most are developing games that will at least perform betterwhen the card is present.Enthusiasm for PC games did not put a damper on the next-generationconsole platforms that were launched this year by Sony andSega. Although Sony has sold twice as many game systems inthe United States than Sega, analysts agree the ultimate testwill be the quality and number of console games available inthe market.At press time, Sony PlayStation had sold about 500,000 unitsin the United States, while Sega, which launched earlier, hadsold about 200,000 units.The popularity of both platforms and a desire to capitalizeon development dollars will result in increased cross-platformreleases next year. Major developers, such as Sega and AcclaimEntertainment, have said cross-platform will be a more importantstrategic decision this year."When you are developing games with million dollar budgets fora single title...it makes sense to amortize costs," said Domarkchief executive officer Dominic Wheatley.While gamers were picking through a new breed of software, thepower of the child was recognized in brisk sales of edutainmenttitles this past year. Special children's sections sproutedin retail outlets, such as CompUSA and Computer City, and educationalretailers began to offer a variety of software applications.Bringing new PC titles to the toy stores and other mass marketsis increasingly becoming the job of a new breed of distributorsthat relied on exclusive contracts with retail outlets in orderto provide effective fulfillment and merchandising to thoseaccounts. This year New Media Express-a joint venture betweenpublisher Davidson & Associates and Mattel, the giant toy manufacturerjoined Good Times Interactive and Electronic Arts in providingsuch services to mass merchants. Together with EA, NMX broughta healthy mix of edutainment and entertainment software tothe giant Toys R Us chain, but also fueled an industry debateabout the propriety of such deals.This year as the FTC continues an informal investigation intosome issues surrounding NMX, the controversy over this issuewill likely continue until traditional computer distributorscan offer the kind of fulfillment services and merchandisingneeded to fuel entertainment software sales in the mass merchantchannel.Another company that could play a role is Sega's new distributionarm, which at press time still did not have an official name.For retailers that don't have established EDI ordering systems,Sega has sales teams equipped with special notebooks that canplace EDI orders directly from the retail store. Fulfillmentwill be between 38 and 48 hours, said Tom Kalinske, presidentof Sega of America.Along with improving information systems, distributors and retailersalike will continue a careful analysis of the product mix,along with more powerful marketing and promotions aimed atthe mass market. With all parties wanting to reduce returns,publishers and distributors are expected to assist retailerseven more with detailed product analysis."There is a ton of product looking for retail shelf space anda lot of this stuff is undifferentiated from what came before,"said John Taylor, president of Arcadia Investments. "If [retailers]don't have strong marketing support, the product is going tosit there and is not going to move."Along with assisting each retailer with the appropriate productmix on a per-store basis, publishers will also begin launchingmore intense marketing efforts to help move products off theshelves. Retailers will see more in-store promotions from publishersas well as consumer advertising on a national level more commonplacethis year. Cross licensing will play an important role in marketing,with many products piggybacking on campaigns for high-profilefilms and television programs. Other publishers will seek tolicense their titles and characters to media organizationsto build product recognition.As important as the marketing plan this year is the trainingof store managers and sales reps, publishers said. Recognizingthat these employees are the gateway to a consumer purchase,many publishers are pledging to spend more time in the storewith training and promotions for store personnel. Publisherssaid they recognize an informed employee will help ensure thatwhen products do hit the shelves, they won't stay there longenough to ensure a premature death at retail.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Olympic events unfold on discBy:KAREN BANNANBETHESDA, MD.-Couch potatoes who dream of Olympic gold now havea way to live the life of an athlete vicariously through theirCD-ROM drive.Discovery Channel Multimedia, based here, and SEA Multimedia,Tel Aviv, Israel, have teamed up to publish a complete 100year history of the modern summer Olympic Games.The title, Olympic Gold, features a searchable database of 16,000medal winners, official rules for each event and informationabout past Olympic host countries since 1896.Users can access 100 video clip segments of record-breakingperformances and events.

LanctotIf there is one lesson retailers learned in 1995, it was thatdemand was strong enough that established players could beginto experiment with higher prices. With a 45 percent gain inretail sales and with overall sales up 38.3 percent, it wasclear to all market participants that computer merchandisehad moved squarely into the mass market.In spite of the overall positive outlook, though, the finalquarter of the year left a cloud over 1996 prospects. Softsales for several computer retailers in November and Decembergave pause to many.The sales gains of 1995 were somewhat more modest than the wildincreases seen in the previous two years, but it was satisfactionenough for most channel participants to top a terrific yearin 1994. It wasn't easy.Best Buy took a comp-store sales beating in the first half of1995, while it avoided taking a down-and-dirty position onadvertised prices. Eventually, the company was forced to takethe gloves off and go toe-to-toe with Circuit City Stores inthe crucial fourth quarter.Having suffered that battle, though, Best Buy is now in a positionto notch impressive comp-store gains in 1996 without the shadowof Windows 95 hanging over hardware systems and productivitysoftware sales. Look for a somewhat less aggressive Best Buyin '96, and look for other retailers, such as Incredible Universe,to follow suit.After failing to achieve profitability in its third year ofoperation and showing poor comp-store gains, Incredible Universefound a new vice president, general manager in Henry Chiarelli.Currently conducting a chainwide review of operations, Chiarellisaid changes are in store at Incredible Universe, includinga lower profile on price-matching."We don't want to be the most expensive guy on the block, butwe won't be the least expensive, either," he said. That isa change from the division's original lowest-price-in-townapproach.Computer City SuperCenters, another Tandy division, continuesto hold its ground on pricing, which contributed to negativecomp-store sales comparisons at the end of '95.By now, it is clear that retailers have figured out how to createa market in computer products. The challenge in '96 is to startmaking money.Hardware sales were up by 43.7 percent in 1995 vs. 1994, andaccounted for 70.6 percent of all computer-related merchandisesales. Margins have always been narrow in hardware, but withseveral vendors shifting printer and systems offerings intominimum advertised price programs, and with Compaq cuttingits three-year warranty back, retailers are prepared to startmaking money with hardware.Similarly, in the software category, retailers and suppliersturned to MAP programs and new captive distribution models.The past year has demonstrated that demand is strong. Softwaresales were up 26 percent in the retail market compared with1994, with several distribution channels showing huge salesgains in spite of plummeting prices.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124The Big Keep Getting Bigger -- Strong sales in all categoriespropel retail computer hardware and software sales above $23billionBy:MARIA V. GEORGIANISHeading into the fourth quarter last year, computer retailersexpressed cautious optimism about the strength of PC-relatedsales. With such high expectations set in 1994, they wonderedif that year's multimedia PC boom would be repeated. What titlewould emerge as the Myst of 1995? How far could Windows 95Pentium PCs drive the market?By all indications, there was nothing to worry about after all.In the fourth quarter alone, combined sales from CompUSA, ComputerCity SuperCenters, Circuit City Stores, Best Buy and OfficeDepot were projected to increase to $3 billion-a 50 percentjump over last year's period-according to market research firmInternational Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. These retailerswere anticipated to account for 40 percent of PCs sold throughconsumer outlets and 20 percent of PCs sold in the United States.CRW's list of 1995's Top 100 Computer Retailers found that themarket grew by 38.3 percent, coming off a 50 percent jump in1994. In addition, the billion-dollar players' club grew tofive, and Best Buy surpassed $2 billion in computer merchandisesales for the first time.Micro Center nudged closer to the billion-dollar mark with salesestimated at $930 million, generated by only 11 stores, whileEgghead Software backed off somewhat, to $890 million.Micro Center had high- profile openings in Boston and Dallas,launched its first stand-alone training center and introducedthe latest version of its WinBook private-label notebook, amongthe top 10 selling notebooks overall in the United States,according to IDC.CRW's tally of the Top 10 computer retailers showed a few surprises,particularly the substantial gains by the office superstoresall of which made the Top 10. CompUSA once again topped thelist with sales of $3.2 billion. Computer City spent the yearcatching up to chief rival CompUSA. Last year, Computer Cityentered 11 new markets, increased its promotional activitywith weekly four-color newspaper flyers and launched a directmail catalog. Computer City rounded out the year with 88 U.S.stores, only seven shy of CompUSA's 95 store mark.Best Buy predicted PC products would account for 38 percentof fiscal 1996 sales, projected to surpass $7 billion. Butgiven the category's brutal margins and Best Buy's low-costoperating model, the retailer said in the future it intendedto rein in the category to between 33 percent and 35 percentof its sales. A 47 percent gain for Best Buy propelled thecompany well above the $2.5 billion mark in computer-relatedsales.Top 10 competitor Circuit City more than doubled its sales ofcomputer-related merchandise and surprised the industry whenHewlett-Packard selected it as the first retail chain to rollout its Pavillion desktops. But with its commission-based modelmore reliant on higher gross margins than that of noncommissionedBest Buy, Circuit City saw fit to restrict the PC categoryto the mid-20 percent range of its overall revenue.Among the office-product superstores, only Office Depot onceagain could claim to keep company with the likes of CompUSAand Best Buy in the upper tier of the Top 10. As the largestoffice-superstore operator, Office Depot was expected to postrevenue greater than $5 billion in its fiscal year ended lastDecember. Its impressive overall computer sales of $1.6 billionranked the retailer fourth among the Top 100 for the secondyear in a row.Last year, Office Depot pushed the envelope on its store formatwith the debut of 50,000-square-foot mega-stores-double itstypical square footage-in Las Vegas and New York (its firstentry in that market). Historically, Office Depot's space allocationto PC products has been about 2.5 times that of its competitorsOfficeMax and Staples, corresponding with PC sales 2.5 timesthat of its rivals, noted Merrin Information Services, PaloAlto, Calif.Computer superstores, consumer electronics chains and officeproducts superstores are expected to post the greatest growthrates in computer product revenue over the next three years,according to Merrin. During that same period, the share ofPC-related sales is projected to decline among the departmentstores/mass merchants, software stores and warehouse membershipclubs.Nevertheless, participants in the latter three categories-Eggheadand Sears-made the Top 10 cut. Sam's did well, with a gainof about 10 percent, but fell behind CDW Computer Warehouse,Sears, OfficeMax and Staples. Wal-Mart had a 67 percent gainin computer merchandise sales, but managed to drop a notch,to 13th place on the list.With its focus on productivity software, Egghead was a majorbeneficiary of the launch of Windows 95. Although short ofmanagement's expectations, comparable- store sales increased20 percent following Windows 95's launch. Preliminary resultsfrom Egghead's new retail format-anticipated to make the chainmore competitive with superstores-were also positive. Salesin the first new-format store, opened in Beaverton, Ore., lastJuly, increased 61 percent during its second quarter, endedSept. 30, over 1994's same period. The 6,600-square- foot-storewas expanded from 2,600 square feet and put Egghead in thePC hardware category for the first time. It also introduceda more browser-friendly environment, with computer demo stationsand software merchandised by categories, similar to the merchandisingapproach found in a bookstore.On the downside, Egghead's corporate division, accounting forabout half of the company's overall sales, lost money in itsfirst two quarters. It was also expected to be unprofitablein the third. Efforts to turn around the division were adverselyaffected by the company's consolidation of its regional callcenters to its new Spokane, Wash., headquarters. Positionedas an expense reducer, the relocation spoke volumes to theindustry. Its message? Only the nimble, low-cost operatorswill survive.While Egghead continued to close stores in its fiscal first,second and fourth quarters, the company was expected to endits current fiscal year with 10 new stores, most of which wouldbe of the new superstore variety. The company also said itis moving rapidly to renovate existing stores. An overall salesincrease of 5 percent is expected for the fiscal fourth quarterending April 1996, according to a source close to the company.The outlook for software specialists NeoStar and ElectronicsBoutique remained bleak at year's end, although both chainscontinue to open new stores both in and outside of malls. NeoStarwas expected to put the brakes on its downturn by year's end.Media retailers MediaPlay, Virgin Megastore and Hastings continuedto improve in 1995, but greater gains are anticipated for 1996.Bookstores Barnes & Noble and Borders failed to make the top100 list in 1995, but '96 looks promising for these retailersas well. However, vendors reported that Borders was findingmore success with software than Barnes & Noble, and NeoStar'saggressive store-within-a-store strategy at B&N was not thoughtto be finding success.Toy stores flexed their muscles in '95, giving every indicationthat they would be a force to be reckoned with in '96. Andeducational toy retailers such as Imaginarium, Learningsmithand Zany Brainy were seen as the true "sleepers" of 1995.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124'Net Result: Hardware Boom -- Sales still grow despite chronicproduct shortages and an uphill battle against eroding marginsBy:Gregory QuickAs surfing the 'net to get on the World Wide Web became theraison d' tre for consumer PC purchases, multimedia was displacedas the driving force behind soaring PC sales in 1995.Overall, hardware sales soared at retail, growing 43.7 percent,to $16.3- billion from $11.4 billion in 1994. The sales increaseincludes strong growth across product categories such as memory,monitors, hard drives, video and audio upgrades, scanners andprinters.Hardware was the driving force behind most sales gains in '95,with four retailers surpassing $1 billion in sales. CompUSA,meanwhile, topped $2 billion in hardware sales.These retailers succeeded despite vendors placing obstaclesin the path of growth, with select products in short supplyonce again this year. Compaq, Apple and AST Research, amongothers, were short on some popular products during the year.And everybody that was still doing business with IBM had tosit on their hands at one point or another waiting for goods.Meanwhile, average PC prices declined prior to the Aug. 24 launchof Windows 95, shot upward by several hundred dollars shortlyafter the launch and have recently shown signs of spiralingdownward. But a greater concern for retailers has been decliningmargins.Retailers and their suppliers worked together in 1995 to curbthe margin decline by shifting to MAP programs and exclusivePC offerings. For example, Power Computing unveiled its Macintoshclones and signed an exclusive deal with Computer City. Thenew year should bring more of the same.The critical issue for the market leaders in hardware salesis that systems sales generate traffic, which, in turn, generatessales in the software, accessories and supplies departments.The downside of systems sales, though, is that vendors havebundled so much hardware and software in the systems that someupgrade opportunities are beginning to evaporate, even as retailersare putting in the infrastructure to support in-home and instore upgrades.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Sales Climb and Barriers Fall -- Office and consumer-electronicssuperstore sales soar, while mall players struggleBy:Kathleen RichardsIn 1995, total retail software sales increased 26 percent, to$4.1 billion, from $3.5 billion in 1994, according to CRW estimates.Retail sales of CD-ROM software doubled in both dollars andunits in 1995, driven in part by a robust holiday season in1994.The lower cost of goods, combined with a higher average pricefor CD-ROM products, meant CD-ROM publishers enjoyed highergross margins and a broader retail channel that now includedmass merchants, bookstores, video and music retailers, andsupermarkets.At the same time, the old guard-software specialty retailersand computer superstores-had to rethink merchandising, storeformats and pricing strategies as consumer electronics stores,office-product superstores and warehouse clubs continued tocapture greater market share.Egghead, the top software retailer in 1994 according to CRWestimates, maintained its status this year with $735 millionin software sales, down from $750 million in 1994.Computer superstores continued their reign on the top 10 softwareretailer list, benefitting more than other retailers in thethird quarter from Microsoft's release of the Windows 95 operatingsystem.Indeed, these stores augmented their market share to 33 percentin October, from 24 percent in July, according to StoreboardChannel Tracking, a research division of Computer IntelligenceInfoCorp., La Jolla, Calif. Still, CRW estimates show the overallshare of retail software sales declining, from 35.4 percentin 1994 to 33.1 percent in 1995 for computer superstores.Despite widespread claims that software specialty retailerscontinue to lose market share faced with decreasing marginsand increased competition, Egghead, NeoStar Retail Group andElectronics Boutique maintained their top 10 status. But theirshare of sales fell to 28.8 percent from 35.4 percent.This year, office-product superstores increased software visibility,picking up more categories and cashing in on greater demand,driven in part by Windows 95. Office Depot increased totalsoftware sales to $122 million from $71.5 million last year.OfficeMax and Staples posted substantial gains.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Applauding the Best , Brightest -- Overdue recognition for retailinnovatorsBy:Roger C.

It sounds simple;everyone should be able to do this. Yet, in the retail PC industry,almost every retailer fails miserably and spends millions ofvendor dollars (and a little bit of their own) in doing so.The key point is knowing your target customers. Many retailersare still targeting the majority of their marketing effortsto the first-time system buyer, yet the majority of systemssold in the U.S. market today are sold to second-time buyers.Second-time buyers want to buy high-end, full-featured machinesor want to be able to upgrade and enhance their existing PCs.They want selection, and they want to buy when they're readynot when the retailer decides it is a good week to featurecomputers. And they want a very good justification to makethe purchase today.The best retailers, including the three top nominees, recognizethis and market accordingly. Knowing the customers, and givingthem what they want-now that is a marketing philosophy to liveby.Adam Levin is the president of Levin Consulting, Shaker Heights,Ohio, and is a regular contributor to Computer Retail Week.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124The Best Pricing Strategy -- After years of increasingly brutalprice wars, retailers, particularly computer and consumer electronicssuperstores, look to implement higher-margin business modelsBy:PHIL MAGNEYLow-cost, high-volume retailing is the fundamental approachbehind superstore retailing, but this strategy is evolvinginto a higher-margin model.CompUSA no longer regards "lowest prices" as its primary competitiveadvantage. By comparison, other retailers that compete withCompUSA may be as much as 10 percent lower in price on a givenproduct-sometimes at, or below, cost. CompUSA is now more likelyto charge what the market will bear, at prices that earn 10percent to 15 percent gross margins.Micro Center, Computer City and Fry's Electronics are beginningto represent the high end of retail. Vendors note that Fry's,in particular, almost always sells products above their minimumadvertised prices. Customers at these stores may be more experiencedand willing to pay more than those at Best Buy or Circuit Cityfor better selection and service.Best Buy no longer "low-balls." The retailer starts high (say12 percent to 16 percent margin) and then works prices downas conditions warrant. Best Buy may still be the best pricein town, with "7 Percent Over Cost" sales, but these salestypically last for only a few days.Despite store-opening blitzes from Micro Center and occasionalclearance sales, today's retail market presents a pricing spectrumincreasingly bent toward the high end.Phil Magney is president of ARS, a research and consulting firmbased in Dallas.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124The Best In Broadcast Advertising -- Stores should drive theirown brand-name awareness and loyalty, while pushing price outof the driver's seatBy:PAUL GIGANTEWhile bringing customers into your store is the No. 1 objectiveof retail advertising, building your store's brand (i.e., yourstore's name) is just as important. Ironically, while all retailersrecognize the value of listing the brand names of the merchandisethey sell as well as the weight those names carry in termsof quality and loyalty, they seldom recognize the value oftheir own brand image.In a price war, those retailers with the strongest brand loyaltywill win every time over those that do little more than publishprice lists. Look at the success of CompUSA, Circuit City Storesand Office Depot. They've each built their own distinct imageand personality, providing their customers with a reason tocome back time and again to enjoy the shopping experience.What separates effective retail advertising from typical effortsis advertising that answers a simple question: Why come intomy store rather than my competitor's? Like any effective advertising,effective retail advertising creates emotional bonds betweenstore and customer through a consistent voice.Retailers cannot drive traffic consistently at the exclusionof their brand image. Only by building brand image and loyaltywhile driving traffic will retailers keep customers comingback again and again.Paul Gigante is president and creative director of Gigante VazAdvertising, New York.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124The Best Print Advertising -- Effective print advertising mustreflect the personality of the company and its customers.

Print advertising can be more efficientthan broadcast advertising.Either way, advertising must include a "call to action." Goodads reflect the personality of the company and its customers.But to be effective, advertising plans must achieve criticalmass.Most retailers jam too much in their ads to appeal to the broadestcustomer demographic and capture the greatest amount of supplierfunding. Consequently, it can be difficult to differentiateone retailer's ad from another.The personal-computer industry could use more ads that attemptto inform and educate the consumer.Based on the available demographic data, we know that we arespeaking to an intelligent consumer who is thirsty for information.Consumers ask, for example, "How real is the obsolescence factor?"and "How much memory do I really need?"Among the best at answering these questions are Best Buy, CompUSAand Computer City SuperCenters.Peter Janssen, a computer retailing and manufacturing executive,is president of Peter Janssen & Associates, Seattle.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124The Most Efficient Distribution of Products -- Few are ableto consistently get the right product to the right place atthe right time in the right quantitiesBy:Roger C.

By this time, retailers have learned thatthe computer merchandising model is so tight and the marginopportunity so narrow that there is little room for error.Windows 95's arrival sorely tested the distribution acumen ofall channel participants. From coordinating special eventsto ratcheting down purchases of systems with Windows 3.1 whilecranking up purchases of PCs loaded with Windows 95, retailershad their hands full.That experience taught all retailers that excellent productdistribution involves good forecasting, dependable infrastructureand systems, reliable personnel and strong vendor relationships.A little good fortune helps, but successful retailers makeopportunities happen with sound planning and execution.Still, even the most skilled merchants are always learning,and no replenishment scheme, however elegant, is beyond improvement.The new year promises to be yet a new test.Roger C.

These are fundamentalbits of information, without which the sales associate willfail.Sales associates must also have some knowledge of general categorycharacteristics. What do the specs actually mean? How willthe customer perceive the performance of the product?It's also critical for associates to know the store's salesand administrative procedures, so that the actual purchasingprocess for customers can be as painless as possible.Once these basics are taught and reinforced, then individualvendor information may be introduced.

"I only set up thesystems that I sell, so Staples benefits from it. I wait untilI get off work and set a scheduled time for the customer, witha fee of $20 to $30 per hour."A consumer might pay about $50 for the same services from anindependent contractor, the sales associate estimated. As longas it doesn't affect his work in the store, the sales associatesaid, his manager approves of his helping Staples customersat their homes.The sales associate, who said he doesn't solicit such businessfrom customers or hand out his business cards in the store,only offers his services when customers ask if they are available."I've been doing it for two years," he said, adding that customersrecognize his particular store as very service-oriented becauseof his efforts.A Staples spokeswoman said the company has not established apolicy regarding house calls."We don't officially have anything set to send associates tohomes, but we don't have a policy saying associates shouldn'tdo things to help customers outside of Staples," she said."Staples is constantly reviewing the marketplace and the servicesit offers."Not all retail management approves of moonlighting by salesassociates, however, and some prohibit it outright.Any sales associates contemplating moonlighting should be clearon an employer's stated or unofficial moonlighting policy."A lot of my techs won't take [the chance] because of the repercussions,"said an OfficeMax computer supervisor in a Northern Californiastore. "Making $20 to $40 [on the side] isn't worth losinga $300 paycheck."After establishing that you won't jeopardize your job by moonlightingfor your store's customers, make sure you are technically upto speed. If you don't do this, you risk damaging a customer'scomputer equipment, your employer's reputation and your ownjob.CompTIA, Lombard, Ill., is a not-for-profit professional organizationthat developed a personal-computer technical proficiency examadministered by training and testing centers nationwide.The ability to pass CompTIA's A+ certification program examinationis widely recognized as a strong measure of comprehensive personalcomputer competency.Whether or not you have A+ certification, be up-front with customersabout your abilities. Explain that services you provide areon your own time and do not involve your employer. This minimizesthe risk if a problem arises in the course of servicing, upgradingand setting up a customer's equipment, particularly if theproblem is neither your own fault nor your employer's.Another piece of advice for would-be moonlighters: Be patientwith customers.Many beginners are looking for basic training with their computer.While you may find the process of teaching the basics tedious,your experience is valuable and can build an ongoing, potentiallylucrative customer relationship.Providing such personalized customer service on the side "usuallycreates more sales for the store," said a manager of a Babbage'sin the Midwest. "There are people who will buy products fromus even if something costs $5 or $10 more [than at a competitor],because they know someone here can help them with it."He occasionally offers his services as a consultant to customersfor $20 an hour, although at most, he said, he probably earns$200 a year from such moonlighting.Like the Staples sales associate, the Babbage's manager saidhe doesn't offer his services unless a customer asks for help.He believes Babbage's unofficially approves of moonlighting,within reason."We're not allowed to say, 'Buy this hard drive, and I'll installit for you,' " the manager said. He said he realizes his employermay be concerned that sales associates would take advantageof the situation by selling some products and then tellingcustomers their systems require an upgrade related to thatpurchase.The manager said he ends up helping customers by telephone moreoften than making house calls. Babbage's wholeheartedly endorsesthis practice, he said.A spokeswoman for Babbage's said sales associates are not permittedto make house calls, regardless of whether or not a customerrequests such service.According to some store managers, employers' concerns regardingmoonlighting center primarily on a store's potential exposureif a customer is unhappy with the services performed."It's not about the money; it's about trying to control theinteraction of the customer and the salesperson," said a managerat a Doppler Computer store in Seattle. "You can't controlwhat the employee does once they leave the store. If they dosomething that upsets the customer, it reflects poorly on the[retailer]. The worst-case scenario would be if something wasstolen from a customer's home."The Doppler manager said the issue came up with an employeewho had his own computer consulting firm and was solicitingcustomers for work outside the store. That sales associatewas warned not to solicit customers for his consulting businessfrom the store floor. Doppler moved to formally prohibit itssales associates from soliciting outside business in its employeemanual, the manager said.Among retailers offering in-home support-a service that is becomingmore widely available-sales associates are foolish to riskcompeting with their employers.Sales associates interviewed by CRW said they provide servicesnot offered by their employers, such as installing hard drivesand extra memory, or teaching users the basics of the Windowsand DOS operating systems.Because they weren't duplicating services their employers sell,most felt there was no conflict of interest. Others at retailersthat offer in-home or other technical services said they helpcustomers for free.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Power Promos: GET IN THE GAMECompton's NewMedia, Carlsbad, Calif., is running a sweepstakesthat includes a grand prize of two season tickets for a luckycustomer to his or her favorite professional or college footballteam's 1996 home season games.

The Secret Shopper wanted to find out whethersales associates know which of the new joysticks work bestwith Descent, and whether they know their triggers from theirfire buttons overall.The Secret Shopper entered the store to find it teeming withcustomers, mostly families with small children in tow.The store's signage, both hanging and on shelves, was plentiful.The Secret Shopper used it to find the aisle where joystickswere located, toward the middle of the store.After locating the joysticks, the Secret Shopper took some timeand perused the shelf, since every sales associate in the areawas busy waiting on other customers. It was a full 10 to 15minutes before a harried sales associate approached offeringhelp.The Secret Shopper asked the sales associate which joystickswork best with Descent. The sales associate responded withquestions of his own. His first questions were designed tolearn about the Shopper's system. He asked about such specificsas the system's memory and available ports. He also asked whichsoftware titles were on that system, and whether the SecretShopper already owned Descent. After establishing that theSecret Shopper was indeed just looking for a joystick, he gotdown to business."How much do you want to spend?" he asked. Assured that theSecret Shopper was an avid gamer and money was no object, hepointed toward the ThrustMaster MarkII Flight Control System,explaining that it was very intuitive and ergonomic, and thatit would work with a variety of games.This didn't surprise the Secret Shopper, since the ThrustMastermodel was the most expensive on the shelf. It carried an $89.99price tag.In addition to the ThrustMaster stick, CompUSA carried a widevariety of joysticks, including several from Microsoft, Logitechand Advanced Gravis.After making a recommendation, the sales associate excused himselfto wait on a family of four whose members looked like theymight be interested in something that cost more than a $90joystick.The Secret Shopper didn't feel slighted, since the sales associatehad been helpful. As he excused himself, he told the SecretShopper to think it over, and offered to answer any other questions.All told, the sales associate spent about 10 minutes answeringthe Secret Shopper's questions-impressive since the store wasoverrun with holiday shoppers, several of whom cast Scroogelike glances at the Secret Shopper for monopolizing the salesrepresentative's time.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124CRW Sales Clinic: Helping customers configure a system designed to meet theirneedsBy:The CRW StaffEnTry-Level: Acer Aspire 2710Price:Typically sells at $1,500 to $2,000Features:These products generally ship with 14,400-bps internal voicedata fax modems incorporating at least a basic speakerphoneand microphone.

With the popularity of CD-ROMcome numerous questions regarding packaging, shelf space, fixturesand preview mechanisms for the consumer confronted by thousandsof titles.By October 1995, CD-ROM titles represented 47 percent of allsoftware units sold through retail and 40 percent of retailsoftware dollars- almost double the percentages year-over-yearfrom 1994, according to market research firm PC Data, Reston,Va.Similarly, static applications that provide content that becomesout of date as soon as the disc is pressed are starting toevolve into dynamic programs that link to online databaseswith up-to-the-minute information.Meanwhile, Windows 95 is still expected to drive productivitysoftware sales in 1996 as more business users migrate fromWindows 3.1 to the Windows 95 operating system.The majority of retail PCs will ship with the 32-bit versionof Windows pre-installed, further increasing the demand fornative Windows 95 applications.Many companies, however, may bypass Windows 95 and upgrade tothe more powerful next version of the Windows NT operatingsystem, code-named Cairo, which will offer a Windows 95 shell.Cairo is expected to reach beta late this year and ship in1997.Although Microsoft indicated that it would not release interimversions of Windows 95, the company will offer service packsthat feature drivers and other upgrades, which are also availablethrough the company's Web site.This month, Microsoft is expected to offer the first Windows95 Service Pack, which will feature client codes for NetWare4.1, an upgrade to the Internet Explorer browser, infraredtransmission port drivers, ISDN support and updated devicedrivers for video and sound cards. The company will not sellthe service packs through retail.Windows 96, code-named Nashville, is scheduled for release thisyear, but has been characterized by the company as a minorWindows 95 upgrade. This version will focus on Internet integrationthroughout the operating system, according to company officials.Microsoft has not committed to a release date.The number of Windows 95 applications reaching the channel willincrease exponentially this year as the majority of Windowstitles are developed as native 32-bit Windows applications.In the first quarter, IBM subsidiary Lotus is slated to release1-2-3 96 for Windows 95 and Organizer 96 for Windows 95, roundingout its suite of native Windows 95 applications in SmartSuite96, which shipped in November.Graphics powerhouse Adobe plans to ship several native Windows95 applications in the first quarter, including Adobe Illustrator,Adobe Persuasion, Adobe Acrobat 2.0 and Adobe Type Manager.While analysts who predicted a software shift to Windows 95in 1995 were overly optimistic, this year at retail the 32bit operating system is likely to become the dominant Windowsplatform.In October 1995, total sales of Windows 95 products represented15 percent of unit sales and 20 percent of retail softwaredollars, according to PC Data. Windows 3.1 still dominatedretail software dollar sales in 1995 for the year-to-date throughOctober with a 40 percent market share, followed by DOS with19 percent, Macintosh with 17 percent, Windows 95 with 9 percent,hybrid products with 6 percent and OS/2 with a 0.61 percentretail market share.Nevertheless, IBM is ringing in 1996 with strategic plans forits OS/2 Warp line of products. Apple Computer is expectedto release a new version of its operating system this year,code-named Copland, which offers interface enhancements, moremultimedia capabilities and a shell that supports multitasking.Also this year, the threat of online applications and serviceswill loom larger.Microsoft released one online program last fall, CarSource,that may serve as a model for software to follow. The clientsoftware is free to Microsoft Network subscribers who, in effect,have the option to download a "form" and then access dynamicconsumer car reports from the Microsoft Network. The primarybenefit is that users have access to the latest information,such as pricing.This year, Microsoft plans to release three or more additionalonline-only programs, said Marty Taucher, senior group marketingmanager, Microsoft Consumer Division.The company will also pursue the opportunity to offer extensionsof shrinkwrapped products online. For example, small-businessadd-ons or templates could be offered for products such asMicrosoft Works or Microsoft Publisher, said Taucher.Other publishers are expected to follow Microsoft's lead.In 1996, accessing the Internet may seem like last year's hottrend. However, many productivity releases will ship with Internetbrowsers and offer free access to publishers' Web sites formore information on company products and enhancements to existingsoftware.Online links may also start to change the traditional upgradepath. Publishers that have online connections to users' desktopsinstantly increase options regarding product promotions, minorupgrades and information dissemination.A whirl of mergers and acquisitions changed the face of thesoftware industry in 1995, and more of the same is expectedin 1996 as larger publishers build extensive product libraries,often targeting a range of price points and affiliate-labelprograms.This month, the fate of Novell's applications group, namelyWordPerfect and the PerfectOffice suite of applications, maycome to light. Novell has pledged to finalize the sale by theend of January to coincide with the end of the company's firstfiscal quarter.Novell's announcement to sell the division last fall has stalledproduct cycles, delaying the release of the Windows 95 versionof PerfectOffice, which was originally slated to ship in thisquarter. The uncertain status of Novell's applications grouphas also temporarily halted plans to roll out SelectOffice,an innovative retail program that would allow users to essentiallybuild their own customized suite by sampling 50 titles on aCD-ROM and then buying the desired programs. The CD-ROM, whichwould offer several free titles, could be purchased for a nominalfee. Retailers were to receive margins on each title selected,even if the software was not carried by the storefront.Another trend last year had leading publishers seeking marketshare in the value-priced category, a phenomenon partly drivenby the success of companies such as SoftKey International andExpert Software. One publisher, however, will not try to selltitles priced less than $20."It may be our mistake, but Microsoft will not actively participatein the budget category," said Microsoft's Taucher.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Data StreamSOFTWARE DISPATCH: Productivity software may be hard to locatethis week at CES amid the edutainment and entertainment titlescrowding the show floor. Nevertheless, several publishers willshow productivity titles worth checking out.Specom Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif., is demonstrating a$49.50 video-conferencing title called VisionTime Pro. Thesoftware allows small-business users to send video, graphicsand text over standard telephone lines when used with a modem,a video capture card and a camcorder. VisionTime Pro also supportsISDN lines. This Windows 3.1 application shows both the remotevideo and local video whiteboard onscreen. It supports documentconferencing with simultaneous voice, provided that the userhas a DSVD modem. High-resolution images from TWAIN-compliantdevices such as scanners can be transmitted to the receiveror saved for later use. In addition, users have the abilityto add drawings or text to video. The company promotes thesoftware as a video-conferencing solution for notebook userswith a PCMCIA video capture card.Specom Technologies is developing an Internet version of VisionTimePro, scheduled for release in the first quarter of 1996.Syracuse Language Systems, Syracuse, N.Y., is showing threetitles from the Living Language Multimedia series. Let's Talkis a four-language vocabulary builder in Spanish, French, Germanand Italian that supports speech recognition. This Windows3.1 CD-ROM has an expected street price of $29.95. Also ondisplay are two full-language learning titles that the companyshipped in October: Spanish Your Way and French Your Way. Bothtitles incorporate speech recognition-the software evaluatesa user's pronunciation-and ship with a microphone plus an audiocassette that contains conversations. Each title has an $89.95expected street price.Not available for viewing at CES-but worth noting-is the latest3-D effects title from Visual Software, Woodland Hills, Calif.Instant 3D for Windows 95 lets users enhance Windows 95 documentsor presentations with 3-D text and images. It features hundredsof 3-D clip-art objects and textures that can be scaled oredited in a 3-D window. Instant 3D for Windows 95 follows closeon the heels of the company's Simply 3D, a Windows 3.1 title.The SRP for Instant 3D is $49.

By July, the Consumer ProductsDivision had been renamed the Personal Access Division, andthe focus was shifted to applications with links to onlineservices.In November, Novell announced plans to sell off the applicationsgroup, which included WordPerfect and the PerfectOffice suiteof applications, to a suitable bidder by the end of January1996, to coincide with the completion of the company's firstfiscal quarter.Rapid consolidation in 1995 was characterized by a multitudeof acquisitions, notably IBM's hostile takeover bid for Lotusin June. That same month, Quarterdeck acquired Landmark Research,and Symantec agreed to buy Delrina in July.In May, Microsoft terminated its plans to acquire personal-finance software publisher Intuit, due to ongoing governmentinvestigations that were distracting company principals. MicrosoftMoney, the publisher's entry in the personal finance category,and Intuit's Quicken were again positioned as competitive titles.The Redmond publisher had intended to sell its laggard personalfinance title to Novell pending the merger; instead, it continueddevelopment on the product, and released Money 4.0 under theMicrosoft Home brand in the fall.In June, Netscape Communications shrinkwrapped its popular NetscapeNavigator Web browser for off-the-shelf retail sales. The softwarewas still available free for downloading from the company'sWeb site. Netscape Navigator Personal Edition carried a suggestedretail price of $39.95 and offered customers printed documentation,Eudora e-mail and technical support.Microsoft discussed a MAP program for the Windows 95 upgradeSKU in June. The SRP would be $89.95, and the MAP policy wouldrun through December. The publisher expected between 20,000to 30,000 retailers and resellers to carry Windows 95, abouta 35 percent increase since the launch of Windows 3.1.The start of summer had consumer software publishers SoftKeyInternational and Expert Software each announcing intentionsto offer children's lines of value-priced titles.At the same time, Apple continued to consolidate its softwaredivisions, a plan that had begun in April. The company integratedall software divisions, including AppleSoft, under the jurisdictionof Apple subsidiary Claris. Guerina Delucca, former head ofthe AppleSoft division, was appointed president of Claris inMay.When Microsoft finally shipped the Windows 95 operating systemon Aug. 24-more than a year after the product's planned shipdate-the launch exceeded the industry's expectations. A declinein productivity software sales, which had started in late 1994and continued through August 1995, ceased as publishers startedto release native Windows 95 titles and traffic flooded stores.However, Microsoft's MAP policy did not maintain adequate marginfor retailers, who had to depend on attach-rate product salesto recoup software dollars.Within four days of the Windows 95 launch, Microsoft had sold1 million units, according to company officials. At retail,the first week of sales posted $108 million. By the fourthweek, sales had leveled off to $33 million, according to PCData research.And while Microsoft told analysts at its quarterly earningsconference that the company had sold 7 million units of Windows95 through OEM and reseller channels in the first five weeks,several retail buyers were telling suppliers that excess Windows95 inventory was impinging on open-to-buy dollars. Microsoftacknowledged a level of unsold inventory at retail, but saidthe levels were manageable.In November, SoftKey Inernational continued its series of acquisitionsby announcing a hostile bid for educational software publisherThe Learning Company, which had accepted a merger proposalby Broderbund in July, and a bid for Minnesota EducationalComputing Corp. (MECC). SoftKey's next move was to acquirereference software publisher Compton's NewMedia from the TribuneCo.By the start of the holiday selling season, the number of softwareSKUs at retail had increased to 13,569 from 10,997 in 1994,and the Windows 95 platform was significantly impacting retailsoftware sales. It represented 15 percent of software unitssold and 20 percent of software dollars during October, accordingto PC Data.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Business SKUs still dominateRESTON, VA.-Despite widespread reports that business productivitysoftware is rapidly losing shelf space to entertainment andeducation titles, market researcher PC Data's year-to-dateSKU count in October indicated the category remains dominantat retail.Retailers carried 5,549 business software SKUs during the first10 months of 1995, up from 4,855 in the year-earlier period.Personal productivity SKUs increased by about 500 to 1,800from 1,358 in 1994.The combined number of education and entertainment SKUs closelymatched the business software SKU count. Retailers carried2,286 education SKUs, an increase from 1,672 in 1994, and 3,283game SKUs, compared to 2,502 in 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Controversy surrounds concept of $500 device -- PC Vendors DividedOver Form, Market For PrototypeBy:GREGORY QUICKSAN MATEO, CALIF.-Heightened discussion about a $500 computingdevice has not died down in the aftermath of Comdex/Fall, asmanufacturers jockey for position in a market which, thus far,doesn't exist.While many now agree that some sort of device in the price rangewill be introduced in early 1996, the features, functionalityand marketplace-and need for the device-are still up in theair.At last month's PC Outlook Conference here, the $500 PC wasone of the hot topics of discussion. One panel was dedicatedexclusively to the topic, but the subject kept cropping upthroughout presentations.The confusion it has created was evident in the contradictoryremarks that came from both supporters and detractors of theproduct-sometimes even from within the same company.Battling back from one side was Apple Computer and Oracle. Whileexecutives from both companies agreed in concept on the $500device, they were miles apart on specifically what it willbe.Apple demonstrated its Pippin device, which was launched lastmonth in Japan. It will hit volume shipments by midyear andeventually reach the U.S. market, said Michael Spindler, Apple'spresident and chief executive.While Pippin was originally positioned as a game machine, Spindlerdemonstrated its ability to access the Internet and its expandability.He said that it was a mistake to characterize these machinesas "crippled PCs." Instead, he said, they should be thoughtof as products with microprocessors aimed at a different market.Spindler cited a much-used industry figure that only 30 percentof U.S. homes have PCs. There may be a percentage of thosewhich do not have a PC and may want a device that allows themto simply view information, much like they use the TV for now,he said.Spindler admitted there was not yet the bandwidth for the expandedcapability companies now associate with such machines, includinginteractive games with which millions could conceivably playat once.Satjiv Chahil, Apple's vice president and general manager ofnew media and entertainment, said the PC marketplace shouldnot be satisfied with only 30 percent penetration into thehome market. Studies have shown that the huge bulk of homeusers are upper- income families, suggesting a broader massmarket is not being reached.He said that a sector of the market is not "price adverse,"but rather technology adverse, so that interactive deviceshave to be as easy to use as a CD-ROM player.Oracle, the company that provided fuel to fan the interest ofthis market, repeated company chairman Larry Ellison's commentsthat not only was it possible to have devices at $500, butthat they would be available in the first quarter of 1996.The company said that in every other market there is a rangeof offerings at different price points, but claimed the PCmarket maintains prices that are artificially held at a certainlevel.An Oracle spokesman said a $500 PC is "not an affront to thePC industry, but an adjunct to it. There is no magic that takesa $2,500 PC and makes it into a $500 PC.''However, while Apple and other backers see such units as multifunctionaldevices with expansion capabilities, Oracle's course is definedby a much more limited device incapable of using other media.Carl Yankowski, Sony Electronics' president and chief operatingofficer, opened his comments by noting Sony's pending entryinto the PC marketplace "is not the $500 PC."He cautioned "not to be swept up in this nonsense," and addedthat the $500 PC is not the key to expanding the consumer market.But he also agreed that there would be a market for such devices.One of the most active in casting doubt about the viabilityof and need for a $500 device was Intel's Avram Miller, vicepresident of corporate business development."This is like the RISC/CISC debates. It has become polarized,and the real issues such as ease of use have become overshadowed,"Miller said.There have been many attempts at the low end of the personalcomputer market that have failed. Among them are pen computingand PDAs, said Miller."Why should a $500 device be easier to use than a PC? I don'tsee it," he said, adding, "A lot of things are happening rightnow, but they are happening on the PC."Craig Barrett, Intel's chief operating officer and executivevice president, echoed Miller's remarks when he said the $1,000PC has been around, but has not sold well. Users want a hostof interactive capabilities, including the ability to create,he said.Barrett said Intel is, "seeing surprisingly strong sales inthe high-dollar-priced personal computers. The $2,000 PC isthe best Internet terminal you can find." He dismissed theissue as simply a push by the network operating system companiesbattling Microsoft.Supporting the Intel position was Compaq. Robert Stearns, vicepresident of technology and corporate development, noted flatlythat "the $500 price point is impossible to refute becauseno one has defined it." He doubted that people would give uptheir PCs for a device he believed would be extremely slow.Stearns cited potential problems in getting a device in under$500, such as difficulty running PC fonts on a television,the lack of applications or applets, the need for a keyboardand the need for lots of RAM as well as its high cost.While the trend is toward increased ease of use, users alsowant features. And to get below a set price point, you haveto throw away features, he said.However, Stearns' boss, Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's presidentand chief executive, said that "this is the most interestingdirection we will be seeing in the next two years. We see clearlythe paradigm shift" toward the $500 PC.Pfeiffer acknowledged that a solution of this type could openthe Internet to a much larger population."Price elasticity is important to consumers" who want to avoidcostly systems and equipment, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Street Beat: MAP PRICES DO NOT REFLECT TRUE STREET PRICESBy:Steve KoenigMAP pricing policies can do much to control the advertised pricepoints for printers, but MAP prices do not dictate street prices.In most cases, street prices for printers with MAPs are lowerthan the established MAP price. This is not to suggest thatMAP prices do not work. MAP pricing policies work quite welland are generally responsible for restoring channel marginsfor retailers. Hewlett-Packard, Okidata, Epson and Canon haveall gone to MAP pricing recently.On average, retail street prices on MAP-priced printers areabout 2 percent to 5 percent below the actual MAP price. However,actual price variations may be much greater than this. Forexample, in Dallas the street price of the HP LaserJet 5L recentlydropped to $433 when a price war broke out among retailers(MAP price on the LaserJet 5L was $479)Although the MAP price sets a floor for print advertisements,the MAP price does not restrict what a retailer can sell theprinter for. This also holds true for in-store advertising.In the case of the HP LaserJet 5L, Micro Center, Dallas, hadan in-store price of $433 on the LaserJet 5L. But the retailer'sprint advertisement for the product did not include any price.Most retailers are generally pleased with MAP pricing becauseof the impact on margins. For example, HP sets MAP prices sothat channel margins range from 10 percent to 13 percent dependingon product. Even though actual street prices are a few pointsbelow this range, channel margins are substantially higherthan before implementation of MAP pricing, particularly onHP's retail printers where margins typically ranged from 0percent to 4 percent.Since ARS collects mostly in-store pricing for the Retail PriceMargin Model, the average street prices reflect the true streetprice of the products and not the MAP price. Listed above arethe average retail street prices versus the MAP prices forvarious printers.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Promising Products: Supplies SideBrand Name: 3D Wireless RingMouseCompany: Kantek Inc.Phone: (516) 593-3212Exp.

IBM and NECT both released systems withpowerful processors aimed directly at the gaming markets.MPEG compression started to emerge as a standard feature ondesktop systems, both as an integrated hardware and as a softwaresolution built into the systems.Apple moved its Power Macintosh technology to retail and jumpedon the PCI bus, allowing add-in card developers to create productfor both platforms.The chips that powered the systems moved very rapidly last year.The price point for Pentiums fell faster than expected in October,a surprising event since Intel's leading competitors were fallingfurther behind in the industry race.NexGen and Advanced Micro Devices were forced to merge to staycompetitive; and Cyrix is going direct early this year, althoughits high-end Pentium rival 6x86 is currently available.However, over the course of the year, several of the major playersused processors from both AMD and Cyrix. Among those who tookthe plunge were Compaq, Canon, Hewlett-Packard, AST and Epson.The action was in the Pentium-class processor, with Intel havingphased out most of its production of 486 processors by midyear. Despite a much-publicized flaw in an earlier versionof the chip, its popularity grew tremendously as the year progressed.Pentium portables also made a big splash late in the year. Intelexpects the Pentium adoption in the portable market to be fasterthan in the desktop arena.Portables started to gain solid sales in the retail channelas well as users with one system at home opt for portabilityin their second system.With portables increasing sales share, vendors were focusingmore on providing add-on solutions for them, primarily in thePCMCIA card market.PCMCIA cards not only gained attention last year but a new nameas well-now simply PC cards. Besides a variety of storage solutionsthat encompass hard-drive, DRAM, SRAM, Flash and wireless solutions,PC cards are winning popularity as fax modems, LAN adaptersand an increasing host of other functions.Users have the capabilities now to use a wireless connectionto a LAN in an office to stay in touch with e-mail.The need to stay in touch, with e-mail, the Internet or an onlinebulletin board, helped keep modem sales strong. The technologyrapidly advanced from 14.4K bps to 28.8K bps, and cable modemscapable of moving even faster are on the horizon.As the year ended, DSVD modems, which can send voice and datasimultaneously, were also rapidly gaining popularity.ISDN modems, which provide even greater speeds desired by hardcore Internet surfers, are also poised to explode in the nextyear, if modem manufacturers have their way.The year 1995 also ushered in the start of changes in the 3.5inch floppy drives, a standard on PCs for most of this decade.Several major Japanese companies started looking at Iomega'sZip drives, which store as much as 100M bytes in a 3.5-inchmagneto optical format. Power Computing and Micron Electronicsboth started including it in systems.However, Iomega was not alone in the removable mass storagemarket. SyQuest introduced rival technology called the SQ3270,which is also vying for share of mind and market.Windows 95 helped drive demand for hard-drive upgrades as wellas the sale of DRAM as users upgraded systems to handle thenew operating system.The market for multimedia upgrades continued to swell. Despitepremature reports of the market's death, the companies involvedhave continually upgraded product to provide customers withofferings not available from PC manufacturers.Such items as 6x and 8x CD-ROM drives, 3-D stereo, 28.8K-bpsmodems and now ISDN offerings first hit as upgrades long beforethe rest of the industry caught up.The market for handheld devices saw some advances last yearbut still has not expanded the way analysts and other industryobservers predicted it would several years ago. However, manyof the players in the market did enhance their product offerings.Last year saw new systems or upgrades of existing ones fromHewlett-Packard, with its OmniGo 100, Apple's Newton 2.0 specificationand the second-generation MagicLink from Sony.The peripherals market, meanwhile, has seen rapid technologytransition.Digital cameras started to reach the price points and featuresets that made them click with retail consumers. With thisdecline in prices has come an increase in competition. Somelong-time players such as Apple have upgraded existing productsand lowered prices in the face of competition from newcomerssuch as Epson, Fuji, Ricoh and Minolta.While CD-ROM drives are spinning faster, they are also holdingmore discs, an important feature with the advent of multi-discprograms and games. Pricing on four-disc changers at the endof the year roughly paralleled the delta between single-speedand quad-speed drives when the latter were launched. Many manufacturersexpect these changers to become a standard feature in desktopsystems by mid-1996.As the speed and capabilities of CD-ROMs have increased, a newtechnology saw standardization late last year, and is expectedto challenge the CD-ROM in several markets. Digital Video Disc(DVD) has become the accepted standard among the giant consumerelectronics and media companies, which were originally headedin separate directions. The discs, which will have capacitiesas large as 14G bytes, should be on shelves by next fall.Multifunction devices, which combine scanning, printing andfaxing functions, started to gain steam with players like Panasonic,Hewlett-Packard, Canon and others entering the market. Theystill face tough merchandising and consumer-awareness issues,however.Computer monitors last year saw an evolution into truly multimediastations, as vendors began endowing them with speakers andmicrophones, as well as headphone jacks and other functions.The dedicated game machine market is in the midst of yet anothertransition, this time to 64-bit technology. Nintendo of Americapreviewed its next-generation game machine, the Ultra 64, whichwas jointly developed by Nintendo and Silicon Graphics; itis expected to have a $250 street price.But the game-system competition was fierce last year: Sega shippedits Saturn three moths early in select markets while Sony hitthe ground running with its PlayStation, which saw strong salesin the weeks after its introduction.The talk at the end of the year was the feasibility of the $500PC, and whether such a product would truly suit the businessor home markets. Would the machine be a dedicated Internetcruiser or an expandable system also capable of running spreadsheetsand games?While the talk was fast and furious from such leaders such asApple, Intel, Compaq and Oracle, no company thus far has takenthe concept beyond the discussion stage.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Advanced Gravis ships pair of game controllersBy:GERGORY QUICKBURNABY, BRITISH COLUMBIA-Advanced Gravis Computer Technologyhas expanded its game controller offerings with a pair of newproducts, one destined for the Macintosh market and the otherfor Windows users.The Mac Firebird Programmable Flight and Game Controller forMacintosh is an advanced controller designed for use with sophisticatedgames.The Mac Firebird has a total of 21 buttons including an eightdirectional hat switch that can be adjusted by the user. Thebuttons can be used in a variety of ways, including traditionaljoy stick mode or to activate single keystroke commands. Buttonscan also be custom programmed.In addition, the controller has a programmable throttle leverand a elevator trim control for flight games and comes withan input slot that supports most popular PC rudder pedals.The Mac Firebird is compatible with mouse-, keyboard- and joystickcontrolled games, and automatically downloads most game settings.Once a custom setting has been finalized, it can then be printedout to be used as a reference card when that program is usedagain.The software that comes packaged with the Mac Firebird includes80 predefined settings for use with most popular games. Thesoftware also allows a user to cut and paste features fromone game program to another. It also allows for individualfeatures to be drag-and-dropped between different program controlsets, said Grant Russell, Advanced Gravis' chief technologyofficer.Despite the fact that Windows users far outnumber Macintoshusers, Advanced Gravis has seen strong sales for its controllersin the Mac marketplace."The Macintosh has a high penetration into the home. And whilesuch systems may have been purchased for education purposes,entertainment quickly becomes one of its primary uses," saidRussell. "We are seeing a lot of game developers writing softwarethat takes advantage of our controller. We should start seeingmany of those applications very soon."Still, he acknowledged that since the Macintosh market is significantlysmaller than the Windows market, shelf space is much more limited,especially in smaller stores. But the company also recentlyadded Wal-Mart to its retail lineup.The controller is currently shipping and has a $89.95 retailprice.For the Windows market the company has an entry-level controllerthat does not include the advanced programmable features ofthe Mac Firebird.The Gravis Thunderbird Flight & Game Controller has a four-waydirectional hat switch and the same elevator and throttle controlsand four quick-response buttons.The Gravis Thunderbird is currently shipping and has a $49.95list price.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTER RETAIL WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996  Issue 124Product LinesBest Data, Chatsworth, Calif., has introduced a line of modemswhich are capable of simultaneously transmitting both voiceand data.

And while we are certain there arechains out there that'll say they've defied the odds, wordof several companies looking at negative comp-store sales theweekend before Christmas doesn't bode well.But what's on retailers' minds now is January. Compaq, amongothers, is dropping prices to make way for an aggressive, earlyshipping product line. Will there be room in the channel forall these new lines, sporting yet a new round of processors,if there are stockpiles of the old lines?Compaq, which is making the most of its CES attendance sinceit doesn't attend Comdex, has a host of technology announcementsplanned for the show. One item that won't be given the highestprofile is the company's rumored decision to switch to a oneyear return-to-depot warranty across its desktop line.While the spoken logic is that Compaq is appeasing retailerssuch as CompUSA who want to sell third-party extended warranties,the cost savings to Compaq must look phenomenal on paper. Expectother top-tier vendors to give serious consideration to theirthree-year warranty programs.Packard Bell's decision to rethink its former rejection of minimumadvertised pricing has other makers reconsidering the same.Packard Bell has flown select retailers to its Sacramento compoundduring the past month to talk product and to discuss the prospectof MAPs on certain sell-through models. Sources said Acer Americaalso informed key retailers it is considering doing the sameon select models early next year. If it's true, it could reflectan acceptance of MAPs not only by the vendors, but by retailersthat in the past have strongly objected to MAPs. Best Buy wouldbe among the more notable of these.Speaking of Best Buy, word on the street is that the retailertook Wall Street's advice to trim back its expansion plansthis year. One financial whiz close to the company said toexpect 15 to 20 new Best Buys this year, down from 35 to 40.In the same boat, apparently, is Incredible Universe, saidto have reduced its planned new stores this year to six froma former 10; and Computer City, which is now expected to open20 rather than 30 units in 1996.While new stores drop, watch prices of color inkjet printersdrop as well. Sources said Lexmark will break ground with theindustry's first $199 color inkjet when it reduces prices onits model CJ1020C on Jan. 4.On the personnel front, Fred Brown, the former AT&T retail vicepresident, recently took up with MetaTools, the Santa Barbara,Calif., software company formerly known as HSC Software.

However, this has mostly beenthe domain of lofty brand-development and advertising types.With increasing retail competition, it's time to take a newlook at integrated marketing.It's simple. If retail is at the core of a product's life, retailshould be at the core of a product's integrated marketing.Sure, the notion remains the same: Put all your eggs in onefocused, highly orchestrated marketing basket. The implementationis quite different, though.In the previous version, integrated marketing meant developingproduct positioning and slick communications that applied neatlyto consumer advertising. Then, you'd move into "secondary"efforts such as packaging, channel advertising, retail merchandisingand sales promotion. The primary objective here is buildingbrand awareness.My new version, appropriately dubbed Integrated Retail Marketing,flips this by first asking the question, "What will work bestat retail?" The primary focus here is on building retail sales,and the critical components are:Retail packaging. Nothing matters more. Marketing programs comeand go, but your product packaging lives on. Don't skimp.Public relations. If I only had a dime left after my killerretail packaging was developed, I would insert it into theP.R. machine. Look for plugged-in tacticians who can put youin all the right places.Promotion and merchandising. Few things turn the sales cranklike retail sales promotion and merchandising. Unlike almostall other marketing efforts, this combination pulls togetherthe resources of both sales and marketing to drive stockinglevels, merchandising positions and retailer promotion.Consumer advertising and direct mail. Do it, but only if youcan afford to do it right. Always integrate it into retailpromotions and merchandising campaigns. And never do it justbecause the competition does it.Interactive marketing. The Web can be a powerful marketing tool.But don't just settle for a pretty site with product information;go for the gusto with promotions that will help close the sale.Bottom line? Integrated marketing works best. Just don't forgetwhere your sales are.Back to Headline List WT03-B31-25IA059-000323-B011-48http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec79.html 205.156.212.5 19970114214816 text/html 23127HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:46:06 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:47:07 GMTContent-length: 22940Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec79.html Sample Issue Copyright COMPUTER WORKSTATIONS via NewsNet January 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES TEXAS INSTRUMENTS SOFTWARE SHIPPED FOR DIGITAL UNIX (453 words) DIGITAL DEMONSTRATES BROAD RANGE OF ALPHA- AND INTEL-BASED WORKSTATIONS (580 words) HIGH-PERFORMANCE TECHNICAL COMPUTING MADE AFFORDABLE (964 words) VIDEO CODEC CHIP BRINGS QUALITY VIDEO AUTHORING (662 words) ROBERT IANNUCCI NAMED CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH LAB DIRECTOR (270 words) CopyrightCOMPUTER WORKSTATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 1996TEXAS INSTRUMENTS SOFTWARE SHIPPED FOR DIGITAL UNIXTexas Instruments (TI) Software will begin shipments ofComposer for Digital Equipment Corporation's Digital UNIX.Texas Instruments Software's Composer is a market-leadingcomponent-based development tool for client/server applicationdevelopment.

Digital has showcased these new capabilitiesin an array of eight AlphaServer 8400 systems with a total of96 Alpha 64-bit processors running 64-bit Digital UNIX.Digital makes high performance affordable for compute-intensive, technical applications such as computational fluiddynamics, computational chemistry, weather modeling, andmolecular and genetics research. Digital delivers outstandingprice/ performance by taking advantage of standard,high-volume, low-cost components including a high-speedinterconnect and optimized software. As each processordelivers 600 MFLOPS, a 96 processor system delivers 57.6GFLOPS of computing power -- for only $4.5 million.This combination of affordable price and high performanceenables a wide variety of users to attain performance levelspreviously available only with expensive, specializedsupercomputers. Users who would never have been able to affordsupercomputer-class power can now do so with Digital'ssystems."Digital is making high-performance computing affordable formore applications than ever before," said Dr. Michael Levine,scientific director, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. "We'refinding that Digital's approach to connecting AlphaServers iselegantly simple, and both very powerful and very costeffective. We can connect AlphaServers of different sizes,which is important to us because it enables us to match oursystems and applications most efficiently. We're currentlyusing the system for molecular dynamics, visualization, finiteelement and simulated annealing code, and think thistechnology prepares us for the future of high-performancecomputing.""Digital's new scalable AlphaServer 8400 array offers apreview of the next generation in enterprise supercomputing,"said Gary Smaby, president, Smaby Group, Inc. "By linkingdozens of its blazingly fast Alpha microprocessors through arobust memory interconnect architecture, Digital hasconstructed a mainframe-class computing platform for high-endtechnical users tackling applications that benefit fromparallel processing. The system leverages the cost benefits ofcommodity componentry to deliver a compellingprice/performance alternative to traditional supercomputersand MPPs."Standards-based Commodity Components for OutstandingPerformance and AffordabilityDigital delivers these new levels of price/performance byleveraging commodity hardware and software components. Astandards- based PCI bus Memory Channel interconnect is usedto link multiple AlphaServer systems. This low-latency (lessthan 5 microseconds), high-bandwidth (100 Mbytes/sec)interconnect provides high-speed, memory-to-memorycommunications among up to eight AlphaServer 8400 systems,which allows the multiple systems to operate essentially as asingle system with 57.6 GFLOPS of power. The Memory Channelinterconnect can also link lower-cost AlphaServer 2000systems for extremely cost-effective high-performancesolutions.Digital also provides a suite of software tools that allowstechnical users to optimize their applications for the newtechnology. The software includes:o Digital UNIX, the industry's only 64-bit UNIX operatingsystem, which provides greater standards-compliance and higherperformance than any other available UNIX operating system.o High Performance Fortran (HPF), which allows the arrayedsystems to be programmed as easily as a single system. HPFautomatically optimizes communications among processors formaximum performance and allows the system to be easily scaledfor a variable number of processors.o Parallel Software Environment (PSE), which provides theruntimes for HPF, and performance analysis and debugging toolsfor developing parallel applications.o Digital PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine), an enhanced versionof public domain PVM, which facilitates the creation ofparallel applications.o MPI (Message Passing Interface), software developed withEdinburgh Parallel Computing Centre, which enables users tocreate parallel applications for these systems using anoptimized version of the industry-standard software formessage passing.Digital's use of these standards-based, off-the-shelf hardwareand software components allow it to deliver systems that arelower cost, easier to expand and simpler to program thancompetitive systems."Digital is the leading provider of high-performance UNIXsolutions, as demonstrated by the industry's firstimplementation of 64-bit UNIX in 1993, our Very Large Memorysystems last spring, and now the new level of price andperformance of arrayed systems," said Pauline Nist, vicepresident, AlphaServer Business Segment, Digital EquipmentCorp.

In business, the freshcalendar often coincides with the start of a new budget. Unlikepersonal vows, which more likely than not are conceived late onDecember 31 and very possibly under the influence, the plans ofan organisation may take as long to formulate as they do toexecute. This does not necessarily make the promises of businessany easier to fulfill. One important measure of a person ororganisation is its resolve. Another, often more tellingcharacteristic is perseverance when things go awry. There aremany reasons why coping skills fail in the face of theunexpected. And for every good reason there are a millionexcuses. If there is one prominent cause of an individual ororganisation going into crisis in the wake of ordinaryfrustration and disappointment, it is self-delusion. For themost part, kidding one's self doesn't begin with a consciouseffort. Rather, it starts with a garden variety error injudgement and grows from there. It thrives in the fertile soilof hubris.                             WannabeesIt blossoms every time one fails to admit events have taken anunforeseen turn or that the conditions that exist differ fromthose one wished for or anticipated. Eventually, though, it'stime to 'fess up. When hopes, plans and dreams cannot berealised, only a fresh beginning will do. This requires thesincere performance of an act that is easy enough before one isin trouble but damned difficult once problems have grown tomenacing size. That act is called, in Yiddish, talking tachlis.Talking tachlis means looking at the bottom line, getting downto basics. While known to the Maccabees - a sensible if overlygoal-directed tribe of years past - talking tachlis seems to bea lost art among the crowd running things today, the Wannabees.In corporate life, an avowal of failure is all too often acareer-limiting gesture. Ambition si, admission no.                           By Hesh WienerPost-industrial society has reached a truly appalling state.It's no longer what you do that counts. It's how you look doingit. The inevitable result is a world in which positions ofinestimable power are occupied by idiots with great aplomb. Nowplease don't get us wrong. We like nice guys as much as the nextperson. We want to see them get ahead. But we just can'tpersuade ourselves that fooling people is the right thing, evenif it's done in a pleasant manner. Or even when the dissemblerhas persuaded himself that he is in fact telling the truth as hesees it at the time. Listening to a charming, articulatehorsefeathers artist just makes us want to say, loudly andimpertinently, "Hey, cut that out!" This new year, 1990, isdestined for the Guinness Book. A record number of people willbe forced by circumstances not beyond their control to talktachlis. Chief among them in our estimation will be IBM'sexecutives, who will be joined in this sober-minded exercise bysome of their best customers. The process will be quite amusing,for it will not only involve getting down to brass tackscollectively, but individually, too. The cold, hard facts aredifferent for each IBM product line, and for each customer'ssituation as well. It would be unfair of us to say that the3090-J is not a new machine, except for the facts. It's a recast3090-S, which is a recast 3090-E. And if IBM adds some morewindow dressing in the form of a feature or two, that willhardly make it a different system. It's not necessarily bad thatIBM is selling mainframe customers yet another 3090. The bottomline - whether the user should move to a J - may have little todo with a new generation or another set of model designations.Customers want more bang for the buck, however they can get it.If the 3090-J offers it, that's good enough. But wait a minute.Hold the phone. IBM has got to be working on a long-overdue nextgeneration of large systems. These machines will sock it to thevalues of earlier mainframes. So how could anyone be relaxedabout investing in today's IBM iron?                             ByzantineWhat the customer wants is not only lower cost per MIPS, butalso lower cost per transaction. If the user moves to a fastermachine and MVS/ESA, and then finds that the system softwareeats more computing power than the new hardware brings to thetable, where's the advantage? Is it really wise for IBM to proveto the customer that pain is a necessary but not sufficientcondition for gain? If customers want to stay with the Byzantinesystems they're used to, we're sympathetic. But when computerscan no longer give user companies enough extra productivity tocover their direct costs - let alone help offset inefficiencieselsewhere in an enterprise - our heart alsogoes out to the other people affected. These victims of themainframe include user's general managers and the shareholdersat whose sufferance they serve. C'mon, folks. You're all in thistogether. How about an end to the conspiracy of silence thatmakes every interested party - vendor, user, financing company -look worse every day? Maybe IBM should acquire Tandem. Maybe weshould all be patient and in a couple of years get Tandem toacquire IBM. Actually, we'll settle for IBM stealing allTandem's good ideas as fast as it can. This leads us to NewYear's Talking Tachlis Prediction Numbers One to Five - but theywill have to wait for another issue.(C) 1989 Technology News of AmericaBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTERGRAM INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1990   PICK AND POQUET ARE SURVIVERS AS INFLUENZA BUG EATS INTO                      FUJITSU's UK SEMINARSFujitsu UK Ltd was joined by companies from various areas of thecompor $2.5m.

Poquet claims that its firstproduct is the smallest fully functional, fully-compatibleMS-DOS portable available. Poquet found that 40% of personalcomputer users in the corporate market are always on the moveand that 30% of these would seriously consider buying a portablepersonal computer. The Poquet PC is compatible with MS-DOS 3.3,weighs just 1 lb, and measures 8.75" by 4.3" wide and 0.9"thick; the two standard AA batteries are claimed to last for 100hours of continuous use. There is a QWERTY keyboard and 80character by 25 line screen. It is built around an 80C88 with512Kb of system RAM and 640Kb of ROM with two slots for 500KbRAM or ROM memory cards. These cost around #50 and for the ROMcard version of Lotus 1-2-3 the price is #445. The cards are 68pin Jieda format and Poquet along with Dupont, Microsoft, Lotusand others, hopes this will become a standard in the nearfuture. There is an RS-232 port and input-output expansion buscompatible with the XT bus, and the Poquet can be linked to adesktop MS-DOS machine with 5.25" or 3.5" floppy to up- anddown-load files; remote access to files is also possible. Aserial cable will be supplied. Built-in applications include adiary, calculator, address book and text processing, andPoquetTalk communications can be used with a modem.

AT&T has let it be known that it has notmade a profit out of its Unix software activities, and royaltyrevenues are currently low, at now more than about $50mannually. Computer Systems News argues that, comparing theOperation with companies such as Adobe Systems or MicrosoftCorp, it would have a market value of around $200m, despite itslack of profits. The true worth of the Operation however, wouldbe more sensibly valued by its stategic importance to theinterested companies, which apparently include bothHewlett-Packard Co and DEC.

Through brokers S G Warburg & Co, Alcatel isoffering 60 pence for each of the ordinary shares in NationalTelecom, representing a premium of 22% over the market closingprice of 49 pence on December 21. Alcatel has already receivedirrevocable committments to accept the offer from shareholdersaccounting for 26.5% of National Telecom Ordinary shares.National Telecom, which saw pre-tax losses of #1.6m on sales of#22.4m for the six months ended September 30, started its ascentto prominence in 1983 as a company with the uninspiring name ofSmall Systems Engineering, operating out of a garage in NorthLondon. The quality and competitiveness of the office telephoneexchanges that still, in more sophisticated forms, make up thehub of National Telecom's business, were enough to tempt PeterChamberlain out of British Telecom to head the company, andafter changing the name to the more impressive-sounding NationalTelephone Group, he managed to convince John Nash of the venturecapitalists Advent to back the product - Nash had previouslyvisited the company in 1982 but was put off by the lack ofmanagement skills. With a #1m cash injection and a governmentcommitted to telecommunications liberalisation, things happenedswiftly in the next five years, with subcontraction ofmanufacturing to the then Thorn Ericsson, the move to newoffices in London's Docklands, and diversification by acquiringAnsaphone and by offering complete turnkey packages fortelephone system installation, servicing and maintenance; bythis time, turnover had risen to #19.5m for the year endingMarch 31 1988, with pre-tax profits of #2.9m. The hugelysuccessful flotation in July 1988, which was 17 timesoverscribed at a share price of 120 pence, valued the company at#29.7m and was followed by acquisitions in the UK and the US,with National Telecom paying #7m for cellular telephone andairtime supplier Tactico, #3.3m for Solid State Systems, anAtlanta, Georgia-based designer and marketer of digital PABXs,and #2.3m for the distributor TVC General Telephones.                       Lack of accountabilityBut by May of this year, it became clear that significantproblems had arisen in the key private telephone exchangedistribution business, with lack of accountability atmiddle-management level and deviation from group strategy beingcited as reasons for a disappointing net profit of #2.2m for theyear ended March 31 1989, against market expectations of wellover #4m. Since then, those profits have turned into losses, andeven talks with prospective buyers have not run smoothly, withNational Telecom at one point considering a U-turn from itsoriginal plan and going it alone. All this meant that with lastweek's bid, Alcatel will be buying at exactly half their 120pence price at the flotation, and well down on the 153 pence ithit just over a year ago. For its part, Alcatel sees theacquisition as providing a UK outlet in the businesscommunications equipment market using National Telecom'sexisting distribution channels; National Telecom has alreadystated its desire to be part of a larger group in order toachieve "its ambitious growth plans" - among which could be thesetting up and running of its own network, an objective hintedat by Chamberlain in happier days. - Mark JohnBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTERGRAM INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1990        ALPHAMERIC CALLS IN THE OCTAGON COMPANY DOCTORS                     TO ADVISE ON ITS FUTUREKeyboards, viewdata terminals and data broadcasting companyAlphameric Plc has decided that it needs outside help to get itsbusiness back onto an even keel, and has called in OctagonIndustries Ltd, the Drs Robb Wilmot-Geoff Bristow vehicle backedby Close Brothers and Octagon Group Ltd, which is already busytransforming the former Compsoft Plc, now Headland Group, into abusiness well-nigh unrecognisable to its founders.

IBM UK's porte parole on the subject was not availableto say whether there are any plans to introduce the service inthe UK, but in the US, it offers - for what sounds a steep $30 amonth per machine - users of large numbers of personal computers- which can include Macintoshes and Compaqs or whatever as wellas PS/2s - a high level of handholding that extends to thegenerality of third party software as well as the hardware. Butthat price - clearly pitched at what IBM thinks the market willbear, and which must be about what others are charging,indicates the size of the potential business, and how importantit must be to the companies that currently offer such services.And those companies are the very ones that IBM should be wantingto keep sweet as spring water - the dealers that sell itspersonal computers. It is already clear that with the rampantdiscounting going on in dealer channels (CI No 1,328), there isgoing to be a bloodbath in the US computer high street andno-one is going to be making any money out of hardware, so IBM'smove is seen by dealers already feeling the pain as taking thevery bread out of their mouths by entering the one businesswhere they can make money, in particular with their preciouslarge accounts, the very people at which the new IBM service isprimarily aimed. Accor ding to the Wall Street Journal, IBM hastried to  calm dealers' fears by saying that the new programmetargets only a narrow segment of the personal com puter market -but it is the very segment of the market that those dealersthat have survived the previous shakeouts have successfullytapped; and IBM has  had to concede that the new programme maycost deal ers some business. IBM sells about 80% of its personal computers to dealers in the US and increased its  unitshare of the market to an estimated 35% in the  first 11 monthsof 1989 from 31% in 1988, according  to Audits & Surveys Co -not least because it has  been wooing dealers with attractiveincentives and  offers of training.

Noting the visitors, corporate attire,employees figure these are legitimate businessmen on their wayto a company meeting. They couldn't be more wrong. Surprisingeveryone, the suit and tie executives suddenly pull outautomatic weapons and order employees to lie on the floor. Ina few terrifying minutes, they pillage the company'scomputers, remove valuable memory chips and flee withcomponents having an estimated value of $5 to $12 million!This latest chapter in an ongoing story of internationalintrigue is not a scene from a James Bond movie. Californiaand is merely a small part of the disturbing trend of risingcomputer theft and other "Techno-Crime."In California's Silicon Valley alone, it is estimated that $1million in components are lost to Techno-Thievery each week.Worldwide, overall costs to electronics and insurance firmsare approaching a staggering $8 billion a year and areexpected to soar to $200 billion by the year 2000, accordingto the Technology Theft Prevention Foundation in Clinton, NewJersey.The Foundation was started by insurance companies who, afterpaying out millions in computer theft claims, wanted todevelop ways to curtail the rising Techno-Crime Wave.According to FBI and other law enforcement agencies who areworking with the Foundation, Techno-Crime can come in manyforms that may or may not be considered thievery. But as faras theft is concerned, although everything from motherboardsto modems and disk drives are targeted by Techno-Thieves, CPUs(Central Processing Units) and SIMs (Single In-Line MemoryModules) represent the crown jewels of computer theft."Basically, these parts are non-traceable, said Keith Lowry,sergeant for the San Jose Police Department. "They are veryliquid just like gold, and the market for resale is fantasticbecause there aren't enough products to go around;It's big business and it's opportunistic," Lowry noted.Manufacturers and consumers alike are being short changedbecause Techno-Crime is having a substantial effect on thequality of available memory products on both the wholesale andretail markets.Although electronic and computer buyers believe they aregetting a good deal, they are frequently getting ripped- off.And the Techno-Crime Crime itself is sometimes not an obviousone, such as that mentioned in the beginning of this story;often the crime is difficult to identify and the price paidcan't be quantified--but consumers are paying the price. Forexample, consumers are often attracted to flashy packaging,which shows a product in its best light. Upon closerinspection, however, the product within may not live up to theadvance billing given on the box. It is not uncommon for themodule inside not to have been manufactured or assembled bythe company shown. It is important that the consumer knows whothe real manufacturer of the product is and that it is areputable company--one that is respected throughout theindustry, no t just at the store on the corner."Everybody and their brother is slapping together cheap littlememory products," explained Jim Wong, president of MicroSolutions, Inc., in Corvallis, Ore., designer of systems forhighly demanding users with specialized applications. "Youhave to be very careful about who you buy from and what youbuy." cautioned Wong. "I've heard horror stories from peoplewho haven't been, but are now our customers because they canconstantly rely upon the quality we provide," Wong said.With SIMMs comprising up to 50% of a computer system's cost,and providing much of the computing power, the quality ofmemory has become paramount, which has been a boon tomanufacturers putting emphasis on quality.One such firm is Century Microelectronics, Inc., in SantaClara, California. Century, an industry leader in themanufacture of computer memory, has implemented extra measuresto ensure its memory modules maintain the highest qualitystandards.One way Century does this is by dealing directly with only thelargest, most reputable DRAM manufacturers who have strictinternal controls. Century then adds its own qualityprotective measures. For example, each assembled module bearsthe Century name to insure strict accountability. The consumercan clearly identify that the module has been assembled byCentury and not another third party manufacturer with lowerstandards. Unless the circuit board manufacturer puts theirname on the board as Century does, there is virtually no wayto trace the product back to the manufacturer when troublesarise.Companies like Century use the highest quality components notjust in the DRAM, but in the design and manufacture of the PCboard as well. This philosophy has so far served companieslike Century well in the marketplace where wholesalers,retailers and consumers have voiced concern over the affect ofTechno-Crime on overall product quality. "A big part of mybusiness is the ability to give my customers the reliabilitythat they are getting a first rate part," said Gary Barlow,owner of RAMTECH in Boulder, Colo., the computer memorysupplier to a majority of users in that area."Most of the time price is not the issue as long as you'rereasonable," Barlow explained citing his reason for relying onCentury as his prime memory supplier. "I've been in thisbusiness a long time and I believe Century has the highestquality parts available," he said. Micro Solutions' Wong whooften utilizes Century products because of their inherentreliability, agreed with Barlow on stressing quality. "We'rejust a small company so what's really important is who ourclients are and the type of machines that we configure," Wongexplained. "We have some pretty major clients like HewlettPackard who buy our memory products for insertion into theirown machines so quality is very important to us."To less scrupulous suppliers, however, price, not quality, isthe primary motivator. Because of competition from makers ofcheap "clone" systems, keeping costs down has become paramountto both supplier and manufacturer. In this market climate,even well known original equipment manufacturers (OEMS)sometimes offer to buy back old memory chips as credit towardsnew memory purchases. These suppliers then reuse the memory,which, since it is used, has a shorter life cycle.While this might not appear to be an obvious Techno-Crime tothe consumer, such as armed theft or the like, it is, in factTechno-Crime in its worst form because while the monetary costis just as severe, the crime itself is all but impossible todetect.Another factor in the link is when OEMs put pressure on chipsuppliers to step-up production so that increasing marketdemand can be met. To please their OEM customers, memorybrokers with limited resources are often tempted to purchasesubstandard parts in the "gray market" because they are beingoffered a deal that is too good to pass up.Of particular concern to manufacturers is that substandardparts within the gray market have often failed to test to"grade All specification and instead of ending up as scrap orin a lower performance non-computer application as intended,the y often end up in machines where they are not up to thetask.A chip that shows a 60 nanosecond (60ns) rating, for instance,could really only be able to perform up to a 70ns level.Pressed for time, unscrupulous suppliers can't be botheredwith checking for quality so substandard memory batches areeither mixed with those having passed inspection, or aresimply remarked with the higher rating that OEMs require.To remark a product, third party manufacturers will actuallysand the identifying marks off of chips, remark them so thatthey appear to be higher performance chips than they actuallyare, and resell them to unsuspecting buyers. Themanufacturers, then, end up installing the lower qualitycomponents in their machines because many trust their memorydistributors to bench test the chips. But unfortunately, manydistributors in need of quick revenue unload the componentswithout testing them. Installed in machines they weren'tintended for, these parts fail immediately, or after a fewmonths of use.And while a substandard chip may only cause a computerized toyto go haywire, it could just as well put a glitch into thenavigational system of a commercial airliner or cause asurgical device to malfunction, putting patients at risk. Evenif only a small percentage of available computer chips arefaulty, but are resold as acceptable, the implications arefrightening.Because popular new software programs require more memory thanever to operate efficiently, technology market analysts saythe demand for memory modules is likely to remain higher thanthe supply. Manufacturers will probably continue to experienceperiodic chip shortages which will drive up the value ofmemory modules, and drive more OEMs into the gray market.Consumers should understand that they can easily fall victimto Techno-Thievery without realizing it because Techno-Crimesare not always obvious. Unless buyers take extra precautionsto ensure the quality of the product they are buying, they runthe risk of purchasing substandard components that could notbe able to perform up to advertised specifications, or couldfail altogether causing disastrous results.In light of all this, consumer awareness is increasing and thedemand for superior computer components from the highestquality manufacturers is expected to be greater than ever.For further information, call John W.

In brief, it's a strategy that focuses on theprice and performance points of Bay's products and the company'sglobal distribution and customer service programs.In the Philippines, however, Bay's business will still largely becarried out by its four resellers: Anixter, Alcatel, Computer N/W,and Trends and Technologies.A plan to set up a Philippine office has not materialized, Bayofficials said, because they have not yet found a country manager.BUSINESS UNITSAlthough the bulk of Bay's business continues to come from theenterprise area, company officials believe the highest growth ratewill take place in its Internet unit, especially in the next 12months."Companies are now starting to build networks that willaccommodate their telecommunications and Internet requirements bybeing linked to the backbone of the enterprise networks," saidGary A.

"Wedid our homework and saw that from this year to 1999 the serviceprovider market has a growth potential of over 300%."The EBU is still expected to have the most number of people,products and sales. Some of its product offerings and customers,however, are likely to overlap with that of the ITBU. For example,telecommunication companies which traditionally fall under theenterprise group, are also now among the customers that ITBU willbe aiming to get.Intranet requirements of big corporations, however, will beaddressed by EBU, not the ITBU. In fact, according to Bruce Sachs,executive vice president and general manager of ITBU, about 80% ofthe products to be sold by his unit will be developed by the EBU'sresearch and development team because of the product overlap.The CBU, on the other hand, which focuses on the SOHO (smalloffice, home office) market, is in an area which Bay officialssaid has a potential growth of 160% over the next three years.Again, the Internet is seen fueling this growth, with more homeoffices hooking up to the Net.PRODUCTSBay officials believe next year's worldwide market for access,routing, shared media and switching products will grow 50%. InAsia, they said, the growth will be even sharper, adding that themarket already grew over 100% last year. To date, the globalnetworking market is estimated to be worth $15.36 billion, andcould rise to $32 billion in 1999.This year, sales of Bay's switching products, according to Rogers,have already caught up with its routers and are continuing togrow. High demand for the company's remote access line is alsoexpected, given the Internet explosion.SUPPORTBay also realigned its worldwide customer service operation inline with its new market-focus structure. Lloyd Carney, vicepresident of Bay's worldwide customer service said there arebasically three kinds of services: for large resellers with fullinfrastructure, for those who need logistic support, and forconsultants with no support infrastructure.Lloyd expects the service requirements of the CBU to be theeasiest to handle because this segment pushes more low-endproducts. On the other hand, he expects both the EBU and the ITBUto have demanding service requirements because their clientele arethose which have millions at stake when their networks go down.Bay's global customer service support recently achieved one of itsgoals when it was awarded an ISO 9001 certification. Carneyadmitted they still have to beat Cisco in the support area, butalso said Cisco gets high ratings because the products itsupported in the past were not that complex."Bay's been supporting the heart of the network, and we have athree- to four-year lead time dealing with complex networks," saidCarney.In Asia, Bay has support and training centers in Hong Kong, Tokyo,Singapore, and Sydney.Meanwhile, Lloyd said Bay also encourages its channel partnersworldwide to be part of the customer support business program.Copyright 1996 ComputerWorld PhilippinesBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES via NewsNetOctober 31, 1996Cable Television can be backbone for digital servicesfrom COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996By Melba-Jean M. ValdezCW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITERMANILA, Oct. 31 -- Cable television can be a backbone in ametropolitan area for a new set of digital services such asInternet access, telephony, video conferencing, and wirelessnetworks. This means that via just one cable running into a house,a family can avail of a range of network services.During the recently concluded COMDDAP '96 exhibit and convention,Robbie Villabona, technical operations manager at Sky Internetsaid that Sky Cable already has the technology to deliver Internetto homes over cable. "However, one of our concerns is that we arenot allowed by law to sell this service," he said.Villabona said a possible set-up is that Sky Cable may lease outbandwidth to franchise holders such as Globe Telecom and BayanTelor value-added network providers. Apart from this obstacle,Villabona also pointed to other important issues that still needto be addressed worldwide. At present, for instance, there is nostandard for data transmission over cable television, he said.Interoperability is also a problem, since a manufacturer's cablemodem may not be able to communicate with another manufacturer'scable modem. Modulation and transmission techniques also need tobe addressed by manufacturers, Villabona said. Another issue isthe quality of service. Villabona noted that it isn't possible,for instance, to commit bandwidth over cable. On the bright side,Villabona said, a consortium of cable companies in the US calledCabeLab is now defining standards, such as an interface between acable modem and a PC."A lot of activity is going on between vendors and cabletelevision operators to deliver digital services to the home,"said Villabona.A major benefit of using cable for the Internet, he said, isspeed."One of the common complaints by Internet subscribers today is thespeed by which they can access a Web site," said Villabona. Hesaid that with cable, downloading 1MB file from the Internet usinga cable modem at a burst of 4Mbps would only take two seconds.Another advantage is that cable can be split when it gets into ahome, making it possible to connect a TV to televisionprogramming, and a PC and modem to the Internet. Villabona said.Copyright 1996 ComputerWorld PhilippinesBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES via NewsNetOctober 31, 1996Philippines: Gov't awarded NCR a project worth P108Mfrom COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996By Melba-Jean M. ValdezCW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITERMANILA, Oct. 31 -- The government has awarded the National CrimeInformation System (NCIS) project, a computer-based network systemthat aims to modernize the country's judicial process, to NCRPhilippines, Inc.NCR, which bid P108 million (about $4.1 million), bested threeother IT vendors for the project, and will set up a client-serverbased system with four multiprocessing servers, 99 departmentalservers, and hundreds of Pentium-based workstations, all connectedon a Windows NT network.The NCIS was established through Executive Order No. 386, whichprovides for mechanisms necessary to develop a computer-basedsystem involving the five pillars of the Philippine CriminalJustice System (PCJS).Colonel Tirso L. Rosal, head of the Philippine National Police(PNP) computer center and vice-chairman of the NCIS technicalcommittee, said the five-phase project has an approved budget ofP108 million for phase one alone."NCR was selected based on the technical and financial proposalsthey submitted," said Rosal.EVALUATIONThe bidding process formally started in January this year upon thepublication of an invitation to prequalify and to bid.Commissioner Alexis Canonizado of the National Police Commission(Napolcom) and chairman of the NCIS prequalification, bids andawards committee for information technology resources (PBAC-ITR)said 38 vendors expressed interest in the project, but only 24actually submitted prequalification documents.After screening the documents, the number of qualified proponentswas reduced to 10. Canonizado said that upon requests from theproponents, the submission of the bid proposals (technical andfinancial), originally set for May 27, was rescheduled to July 29.Canonizado said only four of the 10 qualified proponents were ableto submit their proposals within the deadline set by the PBAC-ITR."Prior to this, and due to the controversies generated by theTopweb scam, the NCIS project and bidding process was presented tothe Padolina commission tasked to review and investigate thebidding rules and procedures followed in large-scale informationtechnology projects such as the NCIS, pursuant to Section 3.1 ofExecutive Order No. 341," said Canonizado.Canonizado further said that on Sept. 10, members of the technicalevaluation subcommittee (TES) started the technical evaluation ofthose complying with the minimum requirements set by the PBAC-ITR.He said the evaluation results showed that Prime Systems Plus,Inc. (PSPI) and NCR garnered weighted scores of 49.49 and 54.65,respectively. He said the sealed financial proposals of bothvendors were opened on Sept. 20.On Oct. 4, the TES submitted the results of the integratedtechnical and financial evaluation to the PBAC-ITR. The resultsshowed PSPI and NCR garnering weighted scores of 40.00 and 39.97,respectively."Combining the technical and financial scores to come up with theintegrated score, NCR, with 94.62% was adjudged the winner overPSPI, with an integrated score of 89.49%," said Canonizado.FIVE PILLARSThe PCJS is composed of the various organizational units withineach of the following five pillars:1. Law enforcement: the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI),Napolcom, and the Philippine National Police (PNP)2. Prosecution: the National Prosecution Service (NAPROS), theOmbudsman, and the Tanodbayan3. Adjudication: the Supreme Court of the Philippines (SCP), theCourt of Appeals (CA), regional trial courts, and the municipal ormetropolitan trial courts, and the Sandiganbayan4. Rehabilitation: the Bureau of Correction, Bureau of JailManagement and Penology, the Parole and Probation Administration(PPA), and the Bureau of Pardons and Parole5. Community: the Department of Social Welfare and Development(DSWD), and the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG)All the units will eventually be linked to each other, with theNapolcom acting as system administrator.CLIENT-SERVER SYSTEMThe NCIS will be an intranet type of wide-area network runningunder a client-server environment.Red Torres, account manager for government accounts at NCR saidthey chose Magic Rapid Application Development (RAD) system as thetool to develop the NCIS application. The NCIS system will alsoconsist of Windows NT as the network operating system andMicrosoft SQL Server as the database management system.Torres said hardware will include four NCR S40 multiprocessingservers and 99 NCR S10 servers, which will be deployed among thevarious organizational units of the five pillars.Three hundred NCR 3349 Pentium-based workstations will also bedistributed among the units.Cora Pinoy, general manager of Magic Software Philippines, Inc.,said the National Crime Reporting System (NCRS) will basicallyallow law enforcers to capture incident reports at police stationlevel through a graphical-user interface (GUI) application.The system will also allow the police to make online inquiries oncriminals, vehicles, firearms and more.Pinoy said the system will also be capable of generating incidentstatistics in text or graphical format.Fingerprinting and a geographical information system (GIS) willalso be incorporated in the system in later phases.Another feature of the NCIS is the Weblink, a facility that willenable the five pillars of the criminal justice system to exchangeand share crime information via an intranet."Any agency needing information can send its query to the webserver and the web server will decide which organization'sdatabase to retrieve the data from," said Pinoy. Pinoy said eachorganization's database will be updated in real time to provideup-to-date information for better decision-making.The NCIS is a five-phase project that has an indefinite timeperiod. Development of a database system and implementation of apilot network within Metro Manila is expected to be achieved inthe first phase. Phase two involves nationwide connectivity.System upgrades and enhancements will be done in the remainingphases.Copyright 1996 ComputerWorld PhilippinesBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES via NewsNetOctober 31, 1996Philippines: NEDA chief supports massive IT build-upfrom COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996By Melba-Jean M. ValdezCW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITERMANILA, Oct. 31 -- To gain economic tiger status, the governmentand private sector needs to allot bigger budgets to acquire andimplement information technology (IT) resources in the comingyears. Speaking during the Internet World '96 earlier this month,Secretary of Socioeconomic Planning and Director-General at theNational Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Cielito F.Habito said the Philippines was ranked number two in computerusage among Asian countries in the 1970s. "[The country'sleadership] slipped away due to missteps in economic policymanagement, which led to a prolonged economic slump," Habito said.Habito, who is also the co-chairman of the National InformationTechnology Council (NITC), said that while there are over 150information technology (IT) training centers in the country today,IT development still remains inadequate. He said the country'scomputer-to-person ratio is at 1:50 compared to the ratio in otherASEAN countries which stands at 1:10.This state of affairs he attributed to the government's low budgetallocation for IT. For instance, he said, in 1988, governmentspending on IT represented only .42% of the national budget. In1991, this inched up to .63%.Past administrations, Habito added, had not fully appreciated thebenefits that can be derived from using IT.Despite all this, Habito said, the improved economic environmentin the 1990s brought about a wider use of IT, particularly in viewof decreased computer costs. The government as well as educationalinstitutions have increased their acquisition and use ofcomputers, Habito added.Unlike previous administrations, Habito said, the Ramos governmentis implementing vital policies and programs that will help propelIT development in the country.He also noted that the deregulation of the telecommunicationsindustry is of strategic importance to the informationsuperhighway.POLICY REFORMSIn an interview with `Computerworld Philippines,' Habito said theNITC is looking into mechanisms to achieve interoperability amonggovernment agencies -- which includes review and improvement of ITpolicies such as the National Information Technology Plan (NITP)2000."The IT sector is moving very rapidly. So similarly we have to beable to adjust the plan," he said. "We have to reexamine thespecific components of the overall government computerizationprograms."Habito couldn't pinpoint which components of the NITP needrefinement. "I can't really be specific at this point, but amongother things we have to look into is the compatibility of thevarious systems being put in place."He said that while it is necessary to link agencies, there may besome problems later in trying to interconnect all of them."In the end, what we really want is to have a government that isgetting the full benefits of IT," Habito said.Habito told Computerworld the NITC is working closely with theprivate sector and the Government Organization for InformationTechnology (GO-IT) to achieve interoperability among the agencies."Of course, there is a lot of technology involved. It is more ofcoordination and enhancement to make sure that all the systems cantalk to each other," he said.Copyright 1996 ComputerWorld PhilippinesBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES via NewsNetOctober 31, 1996Netscape confident about browser standingfrom COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996By Reynard I. JuanirCW PHILIPPINES STAFF WRITERMANILA, Oct. 31 -- NETSCAPE Communications Corp. is still veryconfident of keeping its lead in the browser arena despite thegrowing popularity of Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0.At a press conference organized by Netscape's local distributor,Client Server Technologies Inc., Netscape regional manager forASEAN/South Asia region Casey Ong said that the company's marketshare for browsers is still between 70% and 80%. "I don't havethe exact figures, but we're still the leader when it comes to thebrowser market."Ong expressed his doubts over Microsoft's strategy of integratingthe browser into future versions of the Windows 95 clientoperating system. "I think this is a very marginal comparison,"said Ong. "Even if you have better integration with the desktop,the question is, is the integration with other servers and othermachines better?"Netscape has for a long time positioned itself in the area ofproviding applications and tools for both Internet and intranets.Ong said the only way for the Internet to go beyond the levels ofuse today is through the network computer, not the PC. "If youthink about it," said Ong, "the cost of PCs is still very high...its not so personal as a `personal computer'. It's not so far-off in the future that the whole thing about Windows is going tobe irrelevant."He said the market in Asia is much more suitable to NetworkComputers than in the Western countries. "I think in Asia,Network Computer has an even stronger proposition. We're not likethe US, where the use of PCs has got a much strongerbackground....so probably this is even more timely and better forthe Asian users." Ong said he sees the Philippines as more than amarket, but as a source for IT talent. He declined to be morespecific, however, about his company's plans for tapping thistalent.Netscape's failure to be at the "Browser Brawl" opposite Microsoftat Internet World Philippines produced some fairly negativereactions against Netscape, but Ong said it's simply a matter ofscheduling problems.Copyright 1996 ComputerWorld PhilippinesBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES via NewsNetOctober 31, 1996Philippines: Laissez-faire policy fuels internet growthfrom COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996By Melba-Jean M. ValdezCW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITERMANILA, Oct. 31 -- Private investments and the government'slaissez-faire approach have produced one of the region's mostvibrant markets for Internet services.This was the assessment offered by Jim Ayson, president of W3Business Communications, Inc., an Internet presence provider thatdesigns and maintains Web sites for a number of corporate clients.Speaking at last month's Internet World, Ayson said the non-intervention of government has created the freest Internetenvironment in Asia. Unlike Singapore, China, and Vietnam, hesaid, there is no Internet regulation in the Philippines.On the other hand, Ayson said, the heavy competition meansInternet service providers need to be more aggressive to get ashare of the business. Already, he noted, ISPs have turned toadvertising and promotions aimed at a growing consumer market fortheir services.Also as a result of competition, Ayson said, he expects excitingnew Internet services to come from big players such as Infocom,which is partly owned by the Philippine Long Distance TelephoneCo.Ayson added that small Internet service providers might have toevolve into niche players and serve specific players to survive.Ayson said the increased popularity of the World Wide Web andother Internet applications have also increased the demand forbandwidth. Thus, ISPs are planning to expand their existingbandwidth. Links provided today by ISPs range from 64Kbps to T1and E1.Another exciting area is the prospect of cable companies offeringInternet access through cable modems. Ayson said that a cablecompany called TimeNet, a joint venture between Nortel and theLopez group of companies, has announced plans to launch anexperimental project in Naga City, which will consist of 100 betatest users.PHONE LINESOn the negative side, Ayson said the market could grow even moreif more telephone lines were available and if interconnectionamong ISPs and telecommunication companies were not a problem."The biggest obstacle to the growth of the Internet in thePhilippines is the poor telephone infrastructure," said Ayson."You obviously can't get to the 'Net if you can't get a dial-tone."Ayson said that ISPs have complained that PLDT can't provideenough lines and have turned to new telecommunication companiessuch as Bayantel and Globe. "But the new telecommunicationcompanies are in turn hampered by interconnection problems withPLDT," Ayson said.Another issue is the slow access to local Web sites due to thelack of interconnection among ISPs. He said that all inboundtraffic must still be routed to the US first, before bouncing backinto the country."There is an ongoing project by PLDT with the help of some PISO(Philippine Internet Service Organization) members to develop alocal network access so that Philippine traffic remains inbound,"said Ayson.In his talk, Ayson also traced the birth of the Internet in thePhilippines to 10:18 a.m. on March 29, 1994, when PhilNet, anacademic and research network funded by the Department of Scienceand Technology, connected to the Internet through a 64Kbps leasedline to the US.However, Ayson said, even before this hook-up, several electronicbulletin boards had already provided an interface to the Internet.He said that in 1991 an E-mail gateway to the Internet wasestablished.Shortly after the PhilNet hookup, the first commercial Internetservice provider, Mosaic Communications, entered the market."Initially, PHnet and Moscom operated in grey legal area becauseof a perceived need of franchising," said Ayson.However, the Public Telecom Act passed in 1995 stipulated thatnetwork companies could operate without a congressional franchise,thereby starting a gold rush. "The effect of RA 7925 was thecommercial Internet area became fair game," said Ayson. Ayson saidthat in June 1995, ISPs started pouring in. A series of commercialonline service providers also entered the market and evolved intoISPs later.Today, the number of Internet service providers in the countrystands at about 68. Ayson said that there is no formal marketstudy on the number of Internet users today, but informedestimates range from 30,000 to 45,000 users.Ayson said the players in the Internet industry can be classifiedas one or more of the following: Internet service providers; E-mail only providers; ISP networks that don't sell directly to theend-user but to ISPs; cybercafes; Internet presence providers; andeducational institutions that provide accounts to the public.Copyright 1996 ComputerWorld PhilippinesBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES via NewsNetOctober 31, 1996Philips sees 15" monitors moving to mainstreamfrom COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996By Wong, Chin WahCW PHILIPPINES EDITORMANILA, Oct. 31 -- Eyestrain may no longer be a common problem aslarger screens and better resolution make it to mainstreamcomputer monitors. This was the view of an official from Philips,one of the world's largest manufacturers of PC monitors."The trend is toward bigger monitors, and the move from 14" to 15"is very clear," said Louis van Uden, regional marketing managerfor monitors at Philips Business Electronics.Van Uden said, the 17-inch segment of the market is also growingrapidly.Speaking at a recent international convention for Philips PCresellers in Cebu, Van Uden said multimedia and windowingapplications are driving the monitor market towards bigger formatscreens. Fourteen-inch monitors, which accounted for more than50% of the market in 1995, will represent only a quarter of allmonitors sold by the year 2000, Van Uden predicted. In the sameperiod, 15-inch monitors, which accounted for about 30% in 1995,will become the dominant screen size. At the same time, he said,available resolutions will become higher, as will screen refreshrates.Other trends, he sees are:* The adoption of PC manufacturers of the Universal Serial Bus;* The increasing use of software-based monitor controls; and* The increasing acceptance of environmental measures to allowrecycling and lower energy consumption.Copyright 1996 ComputerWorld PhilippinesBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES via NewsNetOctober 31, 1996Philippine 3Com office expandingfrom COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996By Alma J.

Edeza declined to give the names ofthe companies."We already have the products in the country. It's just a matterof delivering them to the beta sites. It would depend on ourcustomers how long they will perform the tests. 3Com wants to trythe products in various parts of the world," said Edeza.But unlike Bay and Cisco, 3Com has not come up with a division tofocus solely on the Internet and the requirements of serviceproviders. However, Edeza said they have plans to start aPhilippine program that involves financing packages especiallydesigned for for start-up ISPs who may not have the resources tobuy routing and networking equipment outright. He said the programwould allow the ISPs to grow their operations and become viablebefore paying for their equipment.In addition, 3Com Philippines is expected to move to a new officesoon.NEW PRODUCT3Com also released this month its third generation of stackableEthernet hubs packed with features to handle network segmentation,management and redundancy.Wei-Ping Ong, 3Com's South Asia channel development manager, saidthe SuperStack II is the industry's most advanced stackableEthernet hub for workgroups of all sizes.The new product introduces a number of technology innovationspreviously unavailable in a stackable system, such as portswitching, fully integrated graphics-based network management, hotswappability and uninterrupted power supply.The new SuperStack II is available in 12-port and 24-port variantsand 10 hubs that can be stacked together in any combination, saidOng.

It would funnel about P17 billionannually into R&D projects, making such efforts a cornerstone ofeconomic development.Another measure also being considered would establish a computercenter in all state colleges nationwide. All these, Verceles said,are bills of first impression that will contribute to building anIT environment.In his opening remarks, Verceles also gave importance to theTelecommunications Act of 1995, which paved the way for thederegulation of value-added network services such as Internetaccess. He also reiterated his support for a central exchange thatwill link all local Internet service providers (see CW, Aug. 31,1996).These developments, he said, run parallel to the government'sservice area scheme, where telecommunication firms are required toset up land lines in their respective service areas."As the telecom facilities are put into place, you will see theemergence of a market for more IT services [in areas outside MetroManila]," Verceles said.He noted, for instance, that his home province of Catanduanes willsoon be connected to the Internet via a 64K connection, with localgovernment offices getting free access."This shows that the Internet doesn't need to be limited to urbanareas, but can reach rural areas as well," Verceles said.In reply to E-mailed questions about the House bills, Vercelessaid the IT Academy would probably have similar directions as theDevelopment Academy of the Philippines (DAP), which teachesgovernment policy to public officials.The IT Academy, he said, would "impress upon public officials andpersonnel" information about global trends in IT to enable them tomaximize its use as a critical development tool."Right now government officials do not know the critical need forIT as a development tool," Verceles said. "They must be taught.Information officers in government also are not kept abreast ofnew technologies. This affects the planning of IT and developmentof systems in their offices. An academy is needed to assist thegovernment in their IT planning," he added.Verceles said it isn't clear yet how much funding would be neededfor the academy, but said this could come from government savingsor the Office of the President, then later on be an integralannual cost item under the General Appropriations Act.It would probably be run under a policy-making board composed ofthe National Computer Center, the Department of Transportation andCommunication, the Department of Science and Technology, theNational Economic and Development Authority, the National SecurityCouncil, and the National Information Technology CouncilCopyright 1996 ComputerWorld PhilippinesBack to Headline List WT03-B31-29IA059-000323-B011-192http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ec01.html 205.156.212.5 19970114215059 text/html 56602HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:48:31 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:22 GMTContent-length: 56415Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ec01.html Sample Issue Copyright CONSUMER ELECTRONICS via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES * THIS WEEK'S NEWS * STATE OF THE INDUSTRY (162 words) WINTER CES 1996 -- 'DVD' SAYS IT ALL (735 words) JUSTICE DEPT.

Undeniably,that's the new, unified DVD, and manufacturers have been hoardingmockups, prototypes and announcements for U.S. consumer electronicsindustry's major showcase -- earlier editions of which launchedVCR, camcorders, CD.     Vast amounts of consumer electronics industry's hopes aresquandered on that elusive long-sought "new product," and in itsfavor, at least, is fact that entire industry is behind single DVDformat.  It almost seems that companies not showing such players inLas Vegas will be exception rather than rule.  Scarcer still arecompanies not promising DVD leadership positions or conceding theywon't be involved in first round of product deliveries.  While muchof DVD news will be generated on main floor, highlight will beseries of consecutively timed news conferences on eve of show Jan.4 (Thurs.) by Pioneer, Sony, Thomson, Toshiba.     While major Japanese and Korean manufacturers are expected toshow prototypes from own factories, many industry eyeballs will beriveted on company that doesn't yet have DVD player productioncapability -- TV and VCR industry leader Thomson ConsumerElectronics (TCE), which has been tantalizing industry with promiseof $500 player.     TCE is expected to announce multiproduct deal with majorJapanese manufacturer, including DVD players that can be sold atits target price, leveraged, perhaps, by plum of major contract forother products.  TCE, which is buying major chunk of StarSight andis entering services arena for first time (TVD Dec 18 p13), isexpected to make another significant move outside its traditionalfield -- this time into DVD program distribution in pump-primingeffort, possibly with significant partner.     Thomson promises DVD marketing announcements under RCA, GE andProScan labels, as well as unspecified software component. Retailers that met with TCE officials last month said company hasdrafted definite plans on how it wants to bring DVD to market,based on philosophy that first hardware dealers will be encouragedto carry software titles.  Retailers told us TCE seems poised toannounce specific ways of helping retailers market DVD software,but Dec. meetings revealed few specifics.     Dolby AC-3 audio -- now component of DVD software for U.S. --gains more momentum at show when Sony for first time willdemonstrate working prototype of AC-3 processor.  It's expected tobill showings as "technical demonstration only" and is "not yetprepared" to discuss specific marketing plans, Hi-Fi Vp Vic Pacorsaid.  First processor is likely to be outboard rather thanintegrated receiver, he said, with delivery to "coincide" withlaunch of first Sony DVD players.     In many respects, it will be traditionalentertainment-oriented CES, with gimmicks and gadgets galore, andheavy emphasis on communication products, including all kinds ofphones, along with audio and video.  Although word "multimedia"will be featured prominently, many of those products will beperipherals or items already shown elsewhere.  Videogame glitz haslong since disappeared and migrated to E3 show, perhaps never toreturn.  Likewise, after several forays into computer area, CES hasbeen unable to compete with Comdex, now a show for CE as well astraditional business equipment dealers.     Not that computer hardware and software manufacturers arewriting off CES completely.  It attracts nation's top CE dealers --and that's too important a group to ignore.  IBM and Compaq will beon show floor, displaying wares designed for CE trade but alreadyexposed at Comdex and elsewhere.  Microsoft is exhibiting, but itsmain presence will be "at suites and doing meetings," Senior GroupMktg. Mgr. Marty Taucher said, adding:  "It's not clear to uswhether CES will have a big role for us in the future, but we'dlike to keep our options open."     Like other umbrella industries, consumer electronics issplintering.  CES was first major showcase for prerecorded video,consumer computers (a la early Apple, Commodore and Atari) andvideogames -- all of which became industries in their own right,spawning their own shows.     Debut of DVD and high interest in such fields as DSS,on-screen program guides and booming projection TV presumably willguarantee respectable attendance at this year's event.  Strangely,as entertainment and computer products "converge," they also growfarther apart in terms of showcasing.  And who knows what vainhopes were tied up in designation of Compaq Pres. Eckard Pfeifferas 1996 CES keynote speaker.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER ELECTRONICS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996JUSTICE DEPT. EXAMINING DVD PATENT SITUATION     Design for central pool as one-stop supermarket for DVD patentlicenses could run into problems with U.S. Dept. of Justice (DoJ),which recently reached agreement with Philips and Sony to modifytheir CD patent pool practices.  Soon after specs for single DVDformat were agreed upon last month, contact was established betweenDoJ and Sony and Philips, perhaps other patent holders, andcompanies currently are formulating reply to DoJ's questions.     At recent Tokyo DVD forum, there was talk of establishingpatent pool administered by 4 major developers -- Philips, Sony,Matsushita and Toshiba -- to which secondary patent holders wouldbe invited (TVD Dec 18 p14).  DoJ's questions about DVD patentswere described by knowledgeable sources as routine, but agency didsucceed in forcing significant changes in way CD patents arelicensed.     CD patents in past were bundled into single packageadministered jointly by Sony and Philips, with Philips in charge ofactual licensing.  Thus, to make any product covered by any CDpatent, company had to take out blanket CD license.  DoJ startedprobe about 2 years ago and, as one CD duplicator paraphrasedquestionnaire, asked licensees for all available data including"every letter and every agreement that you've had with thesecompanies."     Voluntary settlement, quietly reached with Philips and Sony,permits entities to obtain licenses under individual patents orgroups of patents rather than buying entire package.  "If a companywishes to," Sony official said in Japan, "a company will be able toobtain licenses for Sony patents from Sony," although company saidit intends to maintain procedure under which Philips handles mostpatent licensing.  All present U.S. licensees will be givenopportunity to choose terms of revised licensing program ratherthan continuing blanket licenses.     In new licensing contracts, companies agree to be moreexplicit about how patents can be used and when they expire, andnew agreements limit Philips' and Sony's protection in infringementlawsuits filed by licensees, according to reports.     CD licensing has been gold mine for patent holders as resultof explosive growth of CDs and derivative optical disc products. Disc Mfg. subsidiary of Quixote Corp. was quoted as saying it paidPhilips and Sony 6 cents per disc pressed in 1993 when it made 70million discs -- about $4 million.     In answer to our question, Sony conceded that "the revisionswill result in lower royalties, though... we do not comment onspecific royalty rates."  We were unable to obtain more detailedinformation last week because of holiday closings and partial U.S.govt. shutdown as result of stalled budget talks.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER ELECTRONICS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CHRISTMAS WASN'T VERY MERRY AT RETAIL     CE retailers, many banking on holiday sales to brightenlackluster year, were rebuked strongly by consumers who bypassedtheir products despite lure of financing programs and prices atall-time low.     Heavy snow in parts of U.S. and lack of compelling productswere among reasons offered by retailers, but bottom line was thatconsumers weren't buying what many dealers were selling, despitesuch deep discounts as 10-60% off sale at Wiz.     Retail same-store sales in 31-day shopping season wereprojected to be down 3.8% overall, with Northeast and West Coastdecreasing 7.1 and 4.3%, respectively, followed by Midwest, off4.1%;  Southwest, off 4.0%;  Mid-Atlantic, down 2.2%;  Southeast,down 1%.  Data were provided in TeleCheck Services survey ofsame-store check clearances.  Checks account for about 1/3 ofretail spending, TeleCheck said.  By week's end, analysts hadprojected same-store sales at Best Buy (BB), Circuit City (CC) andTandy chains would be flat to slightly up, although Sears, whichdoes strong business in CE, was expected to show 5% rise tiedlargely to clothing.  Most retailers are expected to post Dec.results this week.     Retail malaise spared few product categories.  TVs, VCRs andcamcorders almost uniformly were down from year ago, as was DSS,darling of industry in 1994.  There were some bright spots inaudio, including Dolby AC-3 receivers and speakers, but retailersreporting increases said they were result of change in merchandisemix, rather than any specific hot-selling product.  Even musicsoftware, onetime profit center, appeared to lose ground, caught inprice war between Circuit City and Best Buy that dropped some newCD releases to below $10.     PCs were top sellers but, with margins razor thin, generatedmore volume than profit, retailers said.  PCs' impact on CE wascharacterized by one retailer's tale of watching shoppers atadjacent CompUSA store load up cars with PC gear while his storestood nearly empty.  But other retailers said PCs didn't disrupt CEbusiness.  "I'm not sure that some consumer dollars that normallywould have gone to a big-screen TV went to a computer," Lowe'sVideo Mdse. Mgr. Mark Galchutt said.  "I think in reality there wasnobody in the stores and the customers voted this year that theywere going to control their spending."     Holiday sales didn't fail for lack of trying.  Retailerslowered advertised VCR prices in $10-$20 increments leavingoff-brand products such as Symphonic 4-head and 2-head models at$149 and $119, respectively.  CC advertised what appeared to beDaewoo-made 25" set at $199.  Chasm between low-end point-and-shootcamcorders and more featured models grew as GE's Sanyo-made 8mmImages model appeared in ads at $279.  And cordless phones becamecommodity item via $50 rebates offered by office superstore chains.     "You could walk out of some stores with a hi-fi VCR, 25" TVand a camcorder, having paid $650," said East Coast retailer. "Last year, you paid $650 just for a decent camcorder."     Slow holiday season also may cause manufacturer and retailerinventories to rise, although few industry observers expectedrepeat of year ago.  Dealers, many of whom were left sitting withhuge amounts of inventory then, were more cautious this year andsales to dealers in 3rd week of Dec. showed double-digit decreases(see separate report, this issue).  "The key thing now is what isthe inventory situation going to be like after the first of theyear," Thomson Consumer Electronics Exec. Vp Joseph Clayton said. "I don't think it's going to be as bad as last year.  I'm not asconcerned because [retailers] didn't buy a lot.     Yet some retailers disagreed, insisting there's enough left inpipeline to touch off another round of price cutting in first half. "Whatever we've thought was going to be the low was even lower, sothere's no bottom," said Bernie's TV & Appliance Pres. MiltonRosenberg, whose chain is honoring competitors' rebate coupons. "Everything is hitting new never-been-done-before low price points. But once the inventory levels get more realistic, I think everybodywill calm down."     Shrinking prices and profits may push more retailers to seekbankruptcy court protection and force others to close this year,said analysts who predicted that another 5-6 "notable" chains willfile for Chapter 11 this year.  Among candidates will be Fretter,which closed 190 stores last year and said it's weighing alloptions, including bankruptcy.  Sluggish holiday sales also mayplay role in determining future of 1995's Chapter 11 casualtiesincluding Bradlees, Caldor, Harvey Electronics, Savemart.     "The 2 principal factors which have caused the decline incomparable-store sales were competitive pressures and a sluggishretail environment," Sun TV & Appliances Chmn.-CEO Robert Oystersaid in reporting that 46-store chain's 3rd-quarter net incomedropped to $1.3 million from $4.2 million year ago as same-storesales plunged 10%.  Sun, which expanded into Cincinnati last year,has said it's studying several options to boost stock value,including possible sale or merger, although Oyster has indicatedchain isn't "actively" seeking deal (TVD Nov 6 p14).Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER ELECTRONICS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996DSS PRICING FOLLOWS CE TREND -- DOWN     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to dropand competition increases, entry-level product appears poised todip below $300.     Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) low-end RCA DSS system thatstarted 1995 at $699, was being advertised by year-end at $499, andretailers said profit was in danger of drying up.  To combatfalling prices, some retailers are focusing on step-up RCA and SonyDSS products that promise 20-25% profit margins, but slower sales. Overall, 1995 sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to dealers were expectedto surpass 1.5 million, while rival Primestar reported close tomillion subscribers.     "You've got some very big players coming into the business [in1996] and many aren't going to be able to take the high road,"Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you are 6to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."     Lower retails are expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshibaand Uniden enter DSS race this year with Uniden already indicatingit may price product in $499-$549 range.  In addition to DSS,Alphastar and Echostar are planning to introduce own services --latter partnering with Philips to bring Magnavox product to CEretail.  Even Primestar, which primarily has leased equipment toconsumers, has tested sales through group cable operator TCI.     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCAand GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has beenadvertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony piece, whichoriginally had $749 suggested price tag, was featured in Wiz ad at$648.     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze CE suppliers,who have said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones withhardware offered virtually free and profits made on service. Echostar spokeswoman conceded as much.  Echostar hasn't formallyreleased pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardwareretails could hit $500, with programming at $20.     Alphastar has said it will avoid selling own brand at CEretail, relying instead on combination of Amway, satellitedistributors, multilevel marketing.  Company signed agreement withSamsung Electromechanics in Aug. to build integrated receiverdecoders (IRDs) and said it's seeking similar agreement with 2ndsupplier.  Samsung and 2nd supplier are expected to sell brandedproduct to CE dealers.  "I would think that for this product theequipment would pass the cost curve much more rapidly than themarketing cost of attracting a subscriber," said AlphastarPres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein, whose company plans to launch120-channel service in first quarter with hardware packages at$600-$700.  "When that happens, it makes sense to give the box awaybecause the long-term value is in the subscription and the ongoingrevenue that comes from that subscription."     But with so many satellite systems to choose from, futurehinges on manufacturers' ability to differentiate products.  Manyretailers already have said they won't give category same amount ofshelf space as other products such as VCRs, meaning that supplierswill be battling for every square inch.     "The big question will be whether manufacturers can createclear differences for consumers so they can make choices," TopsAppliance City Senior Vp-Gen. Mdse. Mgr. Rick Jones said.  "Whenyou can't [tell differences], you end up dealing with a price issueand end up with $499 satellite systems."Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER ELECTRONICS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EMERSON SUES ORION     Emerson Radio has sued Orion Electric, claiming long-timesupplier breached contract by failing to offer it same pricedecreases on select video products that it granted Wal-Mart.     In suit filed in U.S. Dist. Court, Newark, Emerson chargedOrion and parent Otake Trading violated agreement signed in Feb.(TVD Feb 27 p16).  Under that pact, Orion was to supply Emersonwith TVs, VCRs, VCPs and TV/VCRs in return for right to use Emersontrademark for video products it sold to Wal-Mart.     Orion has "failed to exploit privileges" granted by licensingagreement, and sales of Emerson video products to Wal-Mart droppedto $136.1 million for 6 months ended Sept. 30 vs. $181.3 million insame period year earlier, suit said.  Orion supplied 89% of Emersonproducts in 1995 and Wal-Mart accounted for 53% of Emerson salesfor fiscal year ended March 31.     Orion failed to offer Emerson same price reductions on 19" and25" TVs that it granted Wal-Mart in Aug., suit said.  Suit saidEmerson was paying 2% less than Wal-Mart for 25" TVs until Sept.,when Orion dropped retailer's price $17, creating $13 gap.  Orionalso is selling 3 VCRs at Wal-Mart not offered Emerson and hasn'tsupplied camcorders.     Instead, Orion is selling Memorex camcorders to Wal-Mart,brand licensed from Hanny Magnetics by group of ex-Emersonexecutives who formed Memcorp (TVD June 26 p13), suit said. Emerson also has sued Memcorp, charging Pres. Barry Smith breachedpartnership agreement (TVD July 10 p11).  Emerson and Smith'sHopper Radio created E&H Partners in 1994 to distribute refurbishedEmerson products in U.S. and overseas and new items in LatinAmerica.     Orion also "ignored plain meaning" of agreement requiringcompany to accept returns of Emerson product from Wal-Mart startingAug. 1, suit said.  Manufacturer hasn't accepted  all products,leaving Emerson with about $2.3 million worth of returned merchandise, suit said.  Orion contended in its suit that Emersonintentionally delayed receiving Wal-Mart returns and began advisingchain before July 31 to send them to Orion.     Orion sued Emerson Dec. 21 charging company violated agreementby disclosing confidential information, including its marketing ofEmerson brand products and number of sales to Wal-Mart (TVD Dec 25p11).  It also claimed Emerson failed to pay $2.3 million in Nov.in effort to force parent Otake to accede to pricing and supplydemands.  Otake said Emerson's suit was "without merit" and it was"trying to hide behind a smokescreen when, in fact, it is theguilty party."     In delving into history of relationship between companies thatbegan with opening of TV assembly plant in Princeton, Ind., in1987, Emerson's suit said Otake Pres. Shigemasa Otake told it in1992 that Orion brand would be sold at retail as competing product. At same time, Otake hired ex-Emerson executive John Bond, who was"familiar" with company's trade secrets, suit said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER ELECTRONICS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996TOPS MAPS CHANGES     After year-long experiment with noncommissioned sales, TopsAppliance City is returning to full commissions as it seeks toexpand home office business.     Edison, N.J., chain switched to noncommissioned sales lastJan., but strategy didn't "achieve expected results" and resultedin turnover of sales force, Vice Chmn.-CEO Robert Gross said.  Topsrevived commissions in Nov. and will complete conversion this monthcovering 1,400-member sales force, he said.     Commissions also are being reintroduced as Tops moves to add4th PC brand and expand hardware to 22 items from 15, SeniorVp.-Gen. Mdse. Mgr. Rick Jones said, but he declined to identifynew supplier.  Tops currently carries Apple, IBM and Compaq PCs,and Hewlett-Packard appears likely addition, sources said. Retailer also will merchandise current assortment of 300-400 PCsoftware titles more "aggressively" in terms of pricing andpromotions and expand peripheral product offerings beyond current60 items, he said.     Goal is to boost home office sales to 12% of revenues fromcurrent 4-6%, Gross said.  While he conceded PC margins are low,product appeals to middle and upper income consumers that store istrying to attract as part of effort to soften one-time hard edgeimage.     To make room for home office offerings, Tops will"deemphasize" videogames and isn't buying new products for next 2months as it reviews strategy, Jones said.  "It's been difficult tomanage the software and we've been unable to get good support fromsoftware companies," he said.  "We think it still has a place inour stores, but we'd like to see where it can fit in."     Return to commissions also was made with aim of increasingextended service contract sales and boosting margins.  Servicecontracts accounted for about 5% of revenues, and margins ran 23.2%in 3rd quarter, Gross said.  At same time, Tops has consolidatedoperations in stores and at hq, resulting $1.8 million saving, saidGross, who declined to disclose how many employees were affected bychanges.  Some were moved to other positions in chain, he said.     Tops earlier reported it had obtained site in Brooklyn for 9thstore, with plans to open by late 1996 (TVD Dec 25 p14).Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER ELECTRONICS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996RECORD OCT. AUDIO SALES     Significant double-digit increases in portable audio andcomponents overcame modest declines in systems and aftermarketautosound to push factory audio sales to 13.9% increase, settingall-time billion-dollar record for any month, EIA Market ResearchDept. said.     Oct. shipments climbed to $1.066 billion from year-earlier$935.73 million.  Record result came despite 2% decline in systemsand 0.8% drop in aftermarket car audio.  Home theater boomcontinued to spark once-beleaguered components category, pushingshipments up 33.4% gain.  Portable audio shipments were up 20% inOct., posting monthly record sales total of $426.03 million.     For 10 months, total shipments topped $7 billion, rising 5.9%to $7.03 billion from year-earlier $6.64 billion.  Components ledall categories with 13.8% sales increase, other segments postingmore modest gains, portable audio climbing 5.4%, aftermarket caraudio up 3.1%, systems up 1.9%.     Home theater boom prompted recent surge in audio componentssales, which followed many months of consecutive declines.  EIA'sConsumer Electronics Mfrs. Assn. (CEMA) credited recovery to"white-hot sales" of speakers and AV receivers.  For Oct.,receivers rose 41% to $66.4 million and surpassed $400 million insales for Jan.-Oct., CEMA said.  Turntables also were pleasant Oct.surprise, rising 27%, said CEMA, which didn't reveal actual salesestimate.  Overall home speaker sales doubled in Oct. from yearearlier to $84.3 million, spurred partly by fivefold rise in salesof surround sound speaker packages for home theater, CEMA said.     Trade group said 20% Oct. sales gain in portable audio torecord $426 million was category's best percentage rise since April1992, when shipments jumped 20.2% over year earlier to $156.74million.  CEMA reported 6% rise in sales of boombox stereos withoutCD to $28 million, while CD boomboxes posted "healthy" 17%increase.     Unspecified decline in rack system sales hurt overall systemscategory in Oct., CEMA said, emphasizing that sales were up 2% for10 months.  Pattern for most of 1995 repeated itself in Oct., withstrong sales of compact systems supporting category.  Aftermarketcar audio sales "held relatively steady" in Oct., CEMA said,without mentioning 0.8% decline in month.  Shortfall came despite11% rise in sales of car speakers, CEMA said.     CEMA quoted Yamaha Mktg. Dir. Tom Graham as saying that 33%rise in Oct. components sales "gives further affirmation to theescalating home theater ownership trend."  He said:  "Consumers arelearning that home theater is more than just video and requireshigh-performance audiovideo receivers and components coupled withquality speakers to truly recreate the movie theater experience."
