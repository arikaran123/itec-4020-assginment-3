To our readers, our advertisers, the smoke shops, the staff, the Lockwoods, and last, but not least, my family: Thank you, one and all. (Anyone not included in the above list that feels slighted, please insert your name and know that it applies to you too!) The Holidays have always been about togetherness and belonging: feelings that we cigar smokers get to feel year-round. Smoking a cigar with another lover of the leaf will break any awkwardness or lack of understanding; it brings a commonality to the table that allows everyone to relax; and lighting up with a neophyte creates an instantaneous bond that words can not express. We've all heard the stories such as: you run out of cigars in the middle of nowhere and a total stranger gives you one upon hearing you mention it to the person you're with; or, you're walking down the street, someone comments on what you're smoking and you hand out a stick. There is a universal truth in the karma of giving out a cigar, I guess because it is a gesture so far beyond what words can convey. A cigar is not just about lighting up a bunch of dried out, rolled up leaves. It's about moments, relationships; it's about pleasures, it's about life. I suppose that's why this sense of belonging prevails year-round. I feel sorry for those who will never experience this and/or want to quash it. It astonishes me that these anti-smoking, anti-meat eating, anti-alcohol consuming, anti-fornicating, health nazis want to take away the few physical pleasures we have left on this earth. Where do these people come from? What do they do for enjoyment? I wish I had the opportunity to take all of them to a steak dinner, downing a bourbon, and lighting up a stog' -- then let them curse the unity of cigar smokers. Instead, I think they will come to recognize what the rest of us already know; that cigar smokers, although not an elite group, are a passionate one; we are generous and truly carry that special "togetherness feeling" that others experience only once a year. But most of all, we have a love and passion for life! Happy Holidays everyone -- smoke 'em if you got 'em!

For four generations, Finck fathers have passed their interest and passion for cigars onto their sons. "We are probably the most diverse cigar company in the United States," observes Bill Finck Jr., 34, the most recent family member to join Finck Cigar Company, which celebrated its 100th anniversary three years ago. Finck Cigar Co. manufactures a popular line of machine-made short-filler cigars in addition to its Travis Club machine-made long-filler cigars, which until recently were distributed primarily in Texas. The company also is the exclusive U.S. distributor of Cruz Real cigars from Mexico, and is preparing to import two of its own premium handmade blends from the Dominican Republic and Honduras. The family's traditions are deeply ingrained. "I've been around cigars since I was a little kid," says semi-retired company president and family patriarch Henry William "Bill" Finck Sr., 65. "I used to sack tobacco stems in the factory when I was 8 years old. We sold the bags for nests for homing pigeons for 50 cents a piece." Bill Jr. and the family's other six children, two boys and four girls, all worked at the factory at various times while they were growing up. Only Bill Jr., however, got tobacco in his blood. - Click on the button to turn to the next page of this article.WT03-B21-4IA050-000857-B008-260http://www.smokemag.com:80/1296/nyc1.htm 192.41.17.142 19970111124820 text/html 1001HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Sat, 11 Jan 1997 12:48:23 GMTServer: ISERVER/1.5.1Last-modified: Thu, 05 Dec 1996 04:31:47 GMTContent-type: text/htmlContent-length: 816 Cigar Haunts of New York by Sean T.

Santa-esque actors, barely able to disguise their superfection of how all those years of Shakespearian training have come to this. Likewise, it's difficult to smoke even a few cigars without hearing tales of pre-Castro Revolution cigars. Most of use are like to balk when we hear that the going rate s about $75 a stick. What could POSSIBLY make a pre-Revolution cigar SO much better than one rolled today? I mean, the tobacco plants come from the same seed; the rollers are still the same (though they may have relocated.) Yet anyone who has tasted a pre-Revolution cigar will recall its seemingly limitless complexity, a certain musty elan, the sweet kiss of decay that the cigar left gently lingering on your lips. What it comes down to, of course, is aging. Cigars change as they age. Anyone who has bought a box of cigars, smoked a few and put the rest away for a few months has probably discovered this. The first time it happens, you say to yourself, "I don't remember it tasting like this before..." Then you start wondering if the cigars have gotten some blue mold disease and you start scrutinizing each and every cigar in the box. Then you start wondering if you're going mad. But, don't worry! It's just the natural aging process! (Of course, I mean!) This aging process is probably most pronounced in the first year. Some people prefer cigars young and fresh while others appreciate an older, more experienced cigar -- it's all a matter of taste. To those who prefer the flavor of aged cigars, the obvious question is, "Hey, why not age my own cigars?" Since vintage cigars are not commonly sold (and, when they are, the prices are exorbitant), this turns out to be a pretty good question. The basic ingredients of cigar aging are: 1) cigars, 2) a place to age your cigars and 3) time. The amount of time you age your cigars, is, as I said, a matter of personal preference. In general, you should probably age them at least a year, but I've never been able to wait that long. Now, the last thing you want to have happen is to patiently age your cigars for a year or more only to find that after all that, they taste like dirt! This is where #1 and #2 on the ingredient list come into play. The first thing to think about is what types of cigars you're going to age. Like politicians, not all cigars age well. In the game of aging, a cigar must be built to withstand the rigors and challenges of -- well, basically sitting motionless in a box for a really long time. No big deal, right? Wrong! As we shall see when we discuss #2, there is a virtual WAR going on inside your humidor, and your cigars must be built like battleships to survive! With each day that cigars age, they lose an infinitesimal amount of the oils and aromatic compounds that give them flavor and character. If you start out with really light, grassy-tasting cigars, within a few years you will have cardboard! Look at the ends of the cigars to find the ones rolled with darker, richer tobacco. Keep in mind that these cigars, which when aged will have pleasantly rich flavors, when young may smell like a kitty litter box that hasn't been changed in a month, much in the same way that good wines for aging are too tannic to drink when young.

And if they had actually lived some 140 years ago, that is just what a pragmatic, tough-as-nails New York Native and a soft-spoken Southern Gentleman who speaks with a slight drawl, respectively, would have done. Individually these two men have, for the better part of this century, seen all the cigar booms and busts that the world has had to offer. They are legends in the cigar industry. For the past twenty-five or so years, they have combined their special talents in the form of a company called Danby-Villazon. Drawing upon a Hollywood analogy, this company is similar to Miramax in that they are big enough to do things their own way, but small enough that they do things exceptionally well. This past Fall, word had leaked out that Danby-Villazon was in negotiations to sell itself to the Culbro Corporation, the parent company of General Cigar Company. When this deal is consummated -- which all parties seem to agree that it will be -- Blumenthal and Llaneza will continue to run things; however, one can't help but feel that part of an era is ending. SMOKE caught up with these two cigar tycoons to bring you the following candid conversation about the way things were in the cigar industry, how they are today and where they are going; but, more importantly, it is a first-hand chronicled account of the cigar industry from two of the few men left to tell it.

The actress was hired to work a single day opposite Dennis Franz. So compelling was Lawrence that she's been "Blue" ever since. In fact, Sylvia Costas, the very human Assistant D.A., wife of beleaguered cop Andy Sipowicz (Franz), and mother of their child, is one of the show's most popular characters. The North Carolina-born, theater-trained actress has wisely capitalized on the opportunities "Blue" presented her, performing in several popular TV movies. Most memorably, however, Lawrence mercilessly chewed the scenery in a "Caroline in the City" guest stint, and that paved the way for her starring role in "Fired Up," an NBC mid-season replacement that's generating quite a buzz. Here, SMOKE catches up with the vibrant, chatty Lawrence before she embarks on the double-duty task of acting in both "NYPD Blue" and "Fired Up."

A Texas A&M graduate, Bill Jr., notes that he finished college on a Friday and started to work at the factory the following Monday. A college degree wasn't in the future for Reinhold Finck, Bill Jr.'s great-grandfather, who came to San Antonio in 1852 -- 16 years after David Crockett, Col. William Barrett Travis and Col. James Bowie died with their troops defending the Alamo against the Mexican army. The Civil War to start nine years later. Reinhold Finck started a German-language newspaper, but fled the city for New Orleans in the 1860s at the height at a cholera epidemic. Reinhold's son, Henry William Finck, returned to San Antonio for health reasons after managing cigar factories in New Orleans and New York. He started Finck Cigar Co. in 1893 on the lower floor of the family's modest two-story home. "My grandfather learned the cigar-making trade in New Orleans," Bill Sr. says. "There were cigar companies in just about every town in the country back then." Indeed, at the time Finck Cigar came into existence, cigarettes had not yet become popular; four out of five American males, and more than a few women smoked cigars. "When he opened Finck Cigar he lived upstairs and made cigars downstairs," Bill Sr. says. "He'd make about 300 cigars a day, then pack them up and ride around the city on his bicycle and sell them on the streets. At the time, there were 16 cigar companies in San Antonio. All you needed was a table, chaveta and a few pounds of tobacco. None of the other companies are around anymore." Henry William Finck's signature cigar was the Finck Cheroot, which he sold in a wooden box in quantities of 250 for $2. "He obviously was very bright and very diligent," Bill Sr. says. "They got to be the biggest cigar factory west of the Mississippi." Henry William's three sons, including Bill Sr.'s father, Edward Reinhold, worked in the factory. Bill Sr.'s father was responsible for buying the tobaccos that were hand rolled into Finck Cigars. "Daddy would go to Cuba, Puerto Rico and Connecticut to buy tobacco," Bill Sr. says. "Back then, trips like that were a big deal. To buy your own tobacco, and Daddy was good at that, you got on the train to New Orleans and then you got on a boat to wherever. Sometimes he'd be gone for months, but he always brought back good tobacco." The company prospered during the middle of the century, introducing machine-made cigars in the 1940s to save labor costs. Like many other cigar companies, Finck Cigar reached a watershed when President Kennedy stopped commerce between Cuba and the United States in 1961. "The Cuban embargo had a big effect on us," Bill Sr. offers. "At the time, we used the best Cuban filler. Cuban tobacco that is aged right is really, really good." The embargo forced the company to find other sources of tobacco, quickly -- primarily in Jamaica. Later Finck Cigar switched its blends to tobacco from the Dominican Republic and Honduras.

Obviously, if you're going to invest the time and energy to age cigars, you'll want to insure that they will be smokable when the time comes. Finding a well-constructed cigar is important. A cigar which is too loosely rolled may lose all of its flavor by the time you have aged it, while a cigar which is too tightly rolled may crack its wrapper with changes in temperature and humidity. The size of the cigar is also important. The larger the ring gauge, the greater the variety of tobacco leaves and hence, the more complex the final flavor of the aged cigar will be. Further, the insides of larger cigars tend to be somewhat shielded from the outside environment, less apt to be affected by fluctuations in humidity and temperature (hence, the "cone" of ash produced in young cigars that are rapidly loosing their moisture content). This added stability that larger cigars provide is highly desirable for long-term aging. Probably a good 50%, if not more, of a cigar's flavor is determined by its wrapper, making this something you'll want to focus on when you're picking out your cigars. As we mentioned earlier, it is the oils and aromatic compounds that provide the cigar with much of its flavor. The amount of oil in a cigar is revealed by the presence of small oil spots, as well as translucency of coloration and the presence of variegation and mottling (these occur in the body of the leaf and are not to be confused with bruising, which occurs along veins and indicates damage caused by the crushing of leaves, or with the small, white "sunspots" which are relatively harmless). Aromatic compounds impart a yellow to reddish tint to things, turning the otherwise pale brown cigar wrapper a deeper shade of reddish brown. Hence, a darker colored cigar may be more appropriate for aging. Don't be confused by "maduro" cigars, whose dark coloration and distinctively strong, sweet flavor is produced by a process of artificial aging. While these cigars have found a place in many people's hearts, they will not benefit from aging. While the inner filler and binder will age nicely, the wrapper of these cigars has been "fixed" -- essentially killed, as far as aging is concerned. The same is true of other "cured" cigars from Brazil, the Philippines, etc. You may also note that most cured cigars are not kept humidified, for this very reason. Letting a cigar dry out also serves to "fix" its flavor, by causing dehydration and oxidation, leading to polymerization and chemical decomposition, which precludes further aging from occurring. This brings us to the important topic of #2: "where 'ya keep 'em" -- that is the environment of the aging cigars. Everyone has probably guessed, based on the presence of walk-in humidors (the large temperature and humidity-controlled rooms found in quality cigar stores) that temperature and humidity may be just a teensy bit important in aging and maintaining cigars. Fundamentally, cigars should be kept at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 70 percent relative humidity -- the well-known 70-70 rule. Any more and your cigars will rot; any less and the aging process begins to be impeded. And by the way, that fancy, decorative hygrometer often found in cigar stores and humidors is just that -- a decoration. Use it to brighten up your Christmas tree, but don't believe the little dial. You can tell the correct humidity by experience: the cigars will be supple and the foot will yield to gentle pressure easily without "crackling" or "rustling" but will feel elastic to the touch. The cigar which feels "mushy," "spongy" or which drips when you squeeze it, has been over-humidified. The more obsessive-compulsive of you can obtain a relatively accurate hygrometer at your florist. The most crucial aspect of aging is maintaining a stable environment for your cigars. A constantly fluctuating milieu spells disaster. Rapid changes in temperature and humidity cause cigars to expand and contract, cracking their wrappers and may also lead to partial "fixation," disrupting the aging process. Ideally, one would have a sort of decompression chamber, much like the ones used by divers to use upon entering and exiting the humidor, which would be lit solely by darkroom "red light." Not everyone can afford this happy condition. For those of us here on Earth, there are a few pointers you may want to follow. Avoid exposing cigars to direct sunlight for months on end. This would give you a bad sunburn, and your cigars don't like it either. Sunlight heats things up and provides energy for chemical reactions and photosynthesizing creatures. Uneven heating can dry cigars out and ruin them. Extreme cold is also the enemy of cigars (i.e., the refrigerator) since it causes water condensation and at times crystallization, as well as shifting many volatiles to a solid phase, effectively "fixing" them and stopping the cigar aging process. Cigar aging is an active, "living" process. You can't just shut your cigars in a sealed box at a specified temperature and humidity and be done with it. The chemical reactions of the aging process produce many, at times noxious, gasses as by-products, which if allowed to build up would be an impediment to further aging. But by providing egress for these gasses, we also provide an opening for water vapor to escape spoiling our constant humidity. This problem resulted in the invention of the humidor, an open box with a constantly replenished humidity element. Ideally, the space in the humidor should be at least twice the volume of cigars - Click on the button to turn to the next page of this article.WT03-B21-12IA050-000862-B002-401http://www.smokemag.com:80/1296/finck3.htm 192.41.17.142 19970111130512 text/html 4145HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Sat, 11 Jan 1997 13:05:10 GMTServer: ISERVER/1.5.1Last-modified: Thu, 05 Dec 1996 04:30:36 GMTContent-type: text/htmlContent-length: 3959 Texas Style Cigars Bill Sr. recalls. "Everybody was trying any tobacco they could get their hands on. The tobacco merchants would send samples, and I smoked and smoked and smoked until I turned purple. The tobacco that we ended up with made cigars that were milder than what we had been making with the Cuban filler we had used up until then." The embargo made it necessary for Finck to forge new relationships with non-Cuban growers to insure that other tobacco would be available. "We've always been very careful to maintain a source of tobacco supply. Sometimes it's been difficult, but we grew and we're still here in the cigar business." Chuckling, Bill Sr. adds: "We're too dumb to quit." "The best cigars coming out of Cuba now don't match up to pre-embargo days," Bill Sr. offers. "In the Cuban heyday, they had a lot of tobacco -- some was good, some was OK and a lot of it was terrible. You had to be careful what you bought, but you could find good tobacco and good cigars. Today, about 90% of the Cuban cigars I've smoked have been very disappointing. I don't think they cure the tobacco very well." Bill Sr. says that the 20 years' experience that growers in the Dominican Republic and Honduras have with Cuban-seed tobacco is paying off with some excellent crops. "Cuban-seed tobacco in the Dominican Republic has its own taste and Cuban-seed tobacco from Honduras has its own -- they are not the same. The Cuban-seed tobacco they are growing in both countries now is pretty uniform in taste and they get a good burn on it. It's got some characteristics of Cuban tobacco that their native tobaccos don't have." Finck Cigar Co.'s most recognized cigar is the Travis Club -- a line of 11 all-tobacco machine-made cigars, two of which are a long-filler, short-filler combination that sell for between 60 cents and 75 cents each. The other nine varieties are short filler. The Travis Club Premium line, which recently became available nationally, consists of six sizes -- all machine-made long-filler featuring Cuban-seed Dominican and Brazilian tobaccos wrapped in a Connecticut-shade leaf with a Connecticut broadleaf binder. Prices range from $1.70 for the Palma to $2.60 for the Churchill. The Travis Club is named for an early 20th century social club in honor of Col. William Travis that Henry William Finck contracted to make cigars for. "We have the No. 1 cigar in Texas in the Travis Club Senator," Bill Jr. says. The Senator is 5-3/16 inches long with a 52-ring gauge and is one of Finck Cigar's short-filler/long-filler combinations. The Travis Club Premium line has been in limited production until recently. "We've made just a few Travis Club Premium for 15 or 20 years, and we've sold them only in Texas. We decided to get serious about distributing them last spring. The demand has been huge," Bill Jr. says. Bill Jr. says that nearly as much labor goes into manufacturing a machine-made cigar as goes into a hand rolled cigar. The primary difference, he says, is the time that it takes to roll the cigar. "It can take up to four people to make a machine-made cigar," Bill Jr. says. "There is a tremendous amount of hand work." Both father and son are involved in selecting and buying the tobacco that goes in to Finck cigars. "We've used some of the same farms for years," Bill Jr. says. "My dad understands how to make cigars properly and how to make them without sacrificing the quality." - Click on the button to turn to the next page of this article.WT03-B21-13IA050-000857-B011-179http://www.smokemag.com:80/1296/nyc3.htm 192.41.17.142 19970111125450 text/html 2647HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Sat, 11 Jan 1997 12:54:45 GMTServer: ISERVER/1.5.1Last-modified: Thu, 05 Dec 1996 04:31:55 GMTContent-type: text/htmlContent-length: 2461 Cigar Haunts of New York Name: BARCLAY-REX Address: 7 Maiden Lane (off Broadway), New York, NY 10038 70 East 42nd Street, (between Madison and Park Avenue), New York, NY 10165 Tel: (212) 962-3355 , (888) DRTOBAC Proprietor: Vince Nastri Years Operating: 86 years Downtown, 10 years Midtown # of Brands: "It's easier to count the ones we don't carry."

One should take note that what retailers call a "fifty-cigar" humidor will, when packed, hold about fifty 6" x 42 ring gauge (corona size) cigars, and so will in actuality have a somewhat smaller capacity if you have nothing but churchills or toros in there. Essentially, any container you can construct to fulfill these criteria should be adequate. Some of us are quite content to use an old picnic cooler with a couple of bricks (unglazed) or a hunk of florist's clay, both of which hold water superbly well. The less intrepid, and more well-heeled, will be inclined to purchase a real honest-to-gosh wooden humidor, complete with a tiny sponge that you can add distilled water to with a tiny, little dropper. This will provide hours of fun for many but does not actually work any better. Many would also insist on using distilled water rather than tap water. Using Evian or other non-distilled waters won't lead to any significant mold or bacterial "contamination" unless you use sea water or water from a nearby fresh water lake, but the more obsessive-compulsive among you may be distressed by the eventual "hard-water" build up on your humidification device (caused by the trace minerals present in all but steam-distilled water), at which time you have my permission to go out and buy a new sponge. If you dearly love your shiny metal-plated humidification system, then distilled water is a must. Others would argue that the cedar wood interior of the costly, wooden humidor is a superior aging environment. (I won't spoil the fun by saying that I just go down to Woolworth's, get some cedar wood anti-moth blocks and drop 'em in the picnic cooler.) The case for cedar is a valid one. The oils and volatile compounds of the cigars are constantly mixing and evaporating during the aging process, leading to a blending of flavors. Any compounds added to the environment by the substance of the container itself can also react or act in a catalytic way. Metal and glass tend to be relatively inert. Plastic and wood both have adsorptive properties and, over time, acquire a tacky buildup of evaporative oils and aromatics. Ideally, these compounds should stay in the cigars. Otherwise, we would have to smoke the humidor to get any flavor, a less than ideal situation. Cedar wood, however, is a highly aromatic wood, full of its own oils which also evaporate and result in a state of homeostasis, minimizing the loss of oils (and flavor) from cigars. With the passage of time, the interaction of these tobacco oils amongst themselves and with the cedar oil of the wood leads to a mellowing and blending of flavors resulting in the subtle complexity which many associate with "pre-Revolutionary" flavor. By following these simple guidelines, you should be able to effectively age your cigars for many future generations to come. But what do you do when you're ready to smoke those cigars? Well, in the same ways you probably wouldn't want to be in a small, pitch dark, humid box when you're getting ready to light up, neither do your cigars (are you surprised?). The environment ideally suited to smoking has about as little to do with the ideal aging environment as your New Year's resolutions have to do with what will actually transpire in the coming year. Understanding these differences can mean the difference between heaven and hell in your smoking experience. And, as always, the answers are not necessarily what you think.

The process of choosing a wrapper and positioning it so that it can be cut to shape and applied to the cigar takes place at yet another station on the machine. Because stripping the middle vein from the tobacco leaf creates two halves of the wrapper that mirror each other, a cigar is either rolled by machines that are "lefthanded" or "righthanded." "We were in the hand rolling business until the early 1960s," Bill Jr. says. The company began to introduce machine-made cigars in the 1940s, but continued to hand roll some cigars until no longer able to do so. "The economics of making a cigar, more than anything, made us move to machine-made cigars," Bill Sr. says. Neither father nor son gives any quarter to hand rolled cigars. "The quality of machine-made cigars, if you know what you are doing, can be a whole lot better than a majority of handmade cigars," Bill Jr. insists. "They certainly are more consistent." Bill Sr. echoes, "I've always believed that a good machine-made cigar is better than a fair handmade cigar." Outside the cigar business, Bill Finck Sr. is also an attorney and lobbyist. He nurtures a reputation as an ornery politician. Elected three times as state representative in the late 1960s, he achieved distinction as being among Texas' most powerful politicians while chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. In the halls of the legislature Bill Sr. was fond of carrying a box of Travis Club Senators under his arm and passing them out. "He's pretty well-known for that," Bill Jr. says. In 1982 Bill Sr. ran for Bexar County treasurer on a single promise -- that he intended to abolish the office. He refused to accept the job's $32,500 annual salary and used his first paycheck to light a Travis Club cigar while standing on the steps of the county courthouse. The treasurer's position was abolished by a Finck led referendum three years later. When Finck subsequently threatened to run for justice of the peace, county commissioners responded by eliminating the office.The Finck's have explored the thought of reinstalling hand rollers, but have been unable to follow through. "The problem is that most of the experienced hand rollers are going through Miami, where they are being hired," Bill Jr. says. "We've hired a number of Cubans, but they mostly have experience with machinery. And it's hard to get rollers to come to the United States from other countries -- to leave their families and their cultures behind and come to Texas." Finck Cigar employs about 80 people, many of them women, whose hands are more adept around cigar-making machinery, Bill Jr. says, with 50 or so women involved in production of the cigars. The entire Finck line and spot production for other companies keeps more than 60 machines clanging away. Besides its own cigars, Finck distributes Mexican-made Cruz Real for Tabacos y Puros de San Andres S.A. de C.V. Finck plans soon to distribute a Honduran handmade version of its "Charles the Great" line, which until recently had been made by machine in the United States. Finck also recently stepped up production of its "Lamb's Club," line, which was previously imported in limited quantities from the Dominican Republic. Although riding the crest of cigars' current popularity, Finck Cigar's longevity means that it's seen the good times and it's seen the bad times. Finck Cigar Co. remained in business during the Depression by cutting the price of its cigars in half -- from 10 cent to 5 cents. "They were able to keep the entire group of employees during the Depression," Bill Jr. says. The company's loyalty to its employees also spurred loyalty in return. In the late 1980s two employees -- Liberata Fernandez and Rafaela Sanchez -- retired after working for Finck Cigar for more than 70 years. Bill Jr. is proud of that. "When you have had something like this for four generations you want to keep it going," he says with a sweeping motion of his arm while standing on the factory floor. "It is something that we are especially proud of." Before their retirement Fernandez and Sanchez told a local magazine that they remembered when Bill Sr. was born, having been hired by Henry William Finck. Sanchez succinctly described the company's founder as a "muy bien hombre." The best cigar roller in Texas still works for Finck Cigar Co., according to Bill Jr. It's his father. "Rolling a cigar is not as easy as it looks. I can make something to smoke, but it doesn't look pretty. Dad still hand-makes his cigars every day, and they are good cigars. It's part of the tradition." - Click on the button to turn to the first page of this article. - Click on the button the return to the Table of Contents.WT03-B21-16IA050-000857-B011-248http://www.smokemag.com:80/1296/nyc4.htm 192.41.17.142 19970111125527 text/html 2128HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Sat, 11 Jan 1997 12:55:14 GMTServer: ISERVER/1.5.1Last-modified: Thu, 05 Dec 1996 04:31:58 GMTContent-type: text/htmlContent-length: 1942 Cigar Haunts of New York Name: ALFRED DUNHILL Address: 450 Park Avenue (corner of Park and 57th Street), New York, NY 10022 Tel: (212) 753-9292 Proprietor: Alicia Wilson, Manager Years Operating: 63 years, 6 years in current location # of Brands: 20 Hours: Mon.-Fri., 10-6:30; Sat., 10-6; Sun., 12-5.

Provisions are however "subject to the availability of appropriations". And, no funds have been appropriated for the years 1996 or 1997. It will come up again for vote in 1998, but again, no appropriations, no enactment. Final language was amended deleting the words "safe and humane" from the bill; regulation was replaced with mere guidelines; recommendations will be performance based (BAD) not engineering based; and the final version took on industry studies. BOTTOM LINE - The horses did not get a thing. They are still being transported in double decked cattle trucks with no water or rest without preloading veterinary inspections. VERY IMPORTANT AB3167 - By Assemblywoman Diane Martinez - Amended to make it a crime to export out of this any pet or companion animal for the purpose of slaughter and use as food.

Hi, My name is Mirage. Please come and visit me. Jenny and her new foal, Sage. BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENTS! You helped name the rescued mustangs Remember the contest we ran in our last mailer to name the rescued mustangs? Betty White was very touched as she read through the reasons why you chose the names that you sent in, and had a difficult time picking only two. The winning names are: for the mother (mare) - Whisper and for her daughter (filly) - Shadow. But wait, that's not all...Whisper surprised us and turned out to be pregnant! She gave birth to a beautiful little chestnut colt named Mirage. We saved mother and daughter mustangs from the slaughter earlier this year. Originally, captured by the Bureau of Land Management, they were adopted to a man who, as soon as he had legal title, brought them to the auction to sell for slaughter. Congratulations to the Winners of the Winter Drawing!! First: Angela Carroll Second: Anne Clarke Third: Viki Moldenhauer Fourth: Mindy Jergens Redwings rescued mustangs, Shadow, Whisper, her new foal, Mirage and wild burros Brownie, Jenny and her new foal, Sage, are safe here at the sanctuary. For the thousands of wild horses and burros who roam throughout the West on federally protected public lands they are anything but safe. Wild horses and burros were considered a part of our American heritage, something to be protected and treasured for the future. The public demanded this protection (resulting in 1971 Act to protect wild horses and burros) - at least that was the case in the past. Public interest is no longer the driving force behind this protection. The demands being put on the lands in the West for grazing (4 million cattle and sheep) and mine expansion have placed wild horses and burros in jeopardy. This is evident in the increased funding within the Bureau of Land Management(BLM) for roundups. Fewer wild horses and burros leaves more vegetation for cattle and sheep; thereby placating the ranchers who continue to apply tremendous pressure on the BLM. If the public does not force the government to change its policies no one else will. PLEASE HELP END THE SUFFERING AND THE EVENTUAL EXTINCTION OF AMERICA'S WILD HORSES AND BURROS! Call Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt (202)208-3171 and President Clinton (202)456-1111 TODAY and tell them you're concerned about the wild horses and burros on the public lands and demand that President Clinton and Secretary Babbitt uphold the laws which were put in place in 1971 to protect them.

It is prescribed almost exclusively to women during menopause. The mares are kept factory farm style for most of their pregnancy in stalls too small to allow them to turn around. Last year over 70,000 mares stood row after row, chained by the head, fitted with suspended collection apparatus that does not allow them to lie down. Some foals are killed after birth but most are taken from their mothers after 3-4 months and sold to slaughter. Mares who can no longer produce are also sent to slaughter. With the exception of a few farms in North Dakota, all production farms are located in remote areas of Canada. Once again this July, I traveled to England to teach Humane Horse Handling at the Redwings Horse Sanctuary in Norwich. The minute I arrived I was handed a list of news reporters who had called for interviews. It seems the article which appeared in our Spring newsletter on Premarin was the breaking story in the United Kingdom regarding the abuse and slaughter involved in the production of this estrogen substitute; as the name implies, Premarin is derived from pregnant mares' urine. The drug is prescribed to millions of menopausal women all over the world. I spent three weeks talking with concerned doctors, reporters, women, and even a micro-biologist about Premarin and its manufacture. I also met with the public relations representative of Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, the sole manufacturer of thedrug. The representative has become quite busy doing damage control as thousands of British women on the drug are demanding plant derived synthetic alternatives from their doctors. This meeting was a unique opportunity for me to discuss our supporters' concerns about the production of this drug with Wyeth-Ayerst. I brought to the drug representative's attention that the pregnant mares' water intake is purposely restricted to ensure their urine be more concentrated, and therefore, worth more money. (Horses whose diets consist of dry roughage such as hay, require free access to water to guarantee their good health.) The rep countered by saying the veterinarians that Wyeth used did not consider withholding water from the pregnant mares' to be a problem. The drug company claims that, "Horses are in no way mistreated as a consequence of the manufacture of Premarin." Again, I questioned this statement asking their rep, "What about the 70,000 plus foals that were taken from their mothers last year at four months of age and sent to slaughter?" She insisted that the manufacture' of Premarin "...has nothing to do with that. The foals belong to the farmers and are of no concern to Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories and therefore, we have no responsibility as to their future." The drug rep had a ready answer and/or denial for every point I brought up until I showed her photographs from the March 25, 1994 issue of Farmers' Weekly of mares chained in their tiny stalls. (See photo above). Looking closely, she muttered under her breath, "But they told me the mares could turn around and lie down!" It seems the manufacturer of the most widely used prescription drug in the United states is telling a lot of people a lot of things. (Wyeth's official recommendation to farmers is that a stall be four feet wide for a 1,300 pound horse, and five feet wide for those over 1,700 pounds.) Meanwhile, sales of Premarin in this last year reached $700 MILLION. The company is expanding its facilities in anticipation of making more $$$$ as Baby-Boomers approach menopause; as the demand increases, so does the potential for profit. Currently, over 1,200 farmers have applied for permits to produce pregnant mares' urine. Since the first Premarin article which appeared in our Spring newsletter, we have received hundreds of letters from women throughout North America voicing their outrage. They tellus they have met with their gynecologists and stopped using Premarin. According to a recent medical survey, 63% of doctors across America are now recommending synthetic alternatives as well as lifestyle changes.

The Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971 declared that wild free-roaming horses and burros are living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West, and require protection. Yet today, there are fewer wild horses and burros on public lands than there were in 1971, when the Act was passed. The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for the protection of these animals, and sadly, tragically, it is this same agency which is responsible for their "fast disappearing from the American continent" By revising policy and circumventing the law, individuals within Bureau of Land Management are bringing about the destruction of the wild horses and burros. Criminal investigations by several Bureau of Land Management law enforcement agents which would have exposed illegal activity in the Wild Horse and Burro Program, have been obstructed by numerous BLM managers and employees. Allegations include : Funneling of horses through and internal pipeline destined for slaughter. Individuals being allowed to select wild horses and burros without having to go through the public adoption process. Falsification of horse adoption documents by Bureau of Land Management employees thus allowing the illegal. slaughter of wild horses. As a member of the American Wild Horse and Burro Alliance, Redwings Horse Sanctuary urges all of our supporters write or call their representatives in the House and Senate and demand that: 1) Grand Jury criminal investigations be allowed to continue unobstructed and, 2) that the Bureau of Land Management must uphold and enforce the law which insures the protection America's wild horses and burros. The wild horses and burros have no other advocates but us. PLEASE HELP! Your legislators can be reached through the Washington switchboard (202)224-3111 Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971 Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) is attempting to reform law enforcement within the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). PEER is assisting BLM law enforcement officers who are trying to stop the illegal slaughter of wild horses that are supposed to be protected by BLM. The officers have observed horses with the BLM "freeze brand" being brought into slaughterhouses in Texas. Selling wild horses for processing into commercial products is prohibited, even after the title has been transferred. Unfortunately, all too often the horses end up at the slaughterhouses because meat packing companies pay about $700.00 for each horse. BLM maintain, however, that it is not required to enforce the law after the title has been transferred after one year. PEER will be cooperating with the grand jury investigations into the slaughter of wild horses by helping BLM law enforcement officers document the illegal activities.

(left to right are Bonnie Stoehn of Redwings, Linda Moss of Equus, Susan Wagoner of Equine Advocates, and Cathleen Doyle of California Equine Council (Redwings Advisor). Horse racing, rodeo, show horses, rental stables, polo, draft horses, pony rides, wild mustangs, Premarin foals, warmbloods - what is the common thread that runs through the above list which, though extensive, is far from complete? Yes, all involve equines and sadly . . . all involve the slaughter industry. There is no impressive pedigree or amount of talent or ability that will assure any horse immunity from eventually being sold to slaughter.* The only way to guarantee that horses do not go through the horrific experience of transport on a cattle truck without food or water, standing in line shaking and peeing on themselves as they wait for their turn to have a four-inch spike driven into their heads - the only way to put an end to having horses treated like yesterday's garbage, used and abused and then thrown away has nothing to do with regulations or providing rubber mats - the only way to keep horses from going to slaughter is to simply stop horse slaughter - put an end to it. Those of us who have experience with politics realize that the likelihood of trying to pass a law to accomplish this through the legislative process is almost nil. That is why Redwings has teamed up with the California Equine Council** and become part of a growing coalition to put an initiative on the ballot in California for 1998 to stop horse slaughter. As you may know, the initiative process bypasses the politicians and the lobbyists for those who profit from horse slaughter. It puts the decision making process in the hands of the people - polls show 93 percent of the people think horse slaughter should be stopped. We know from experience, as goes California so goes the nation. The California initiative to end horse slaughter is just the beginning of the end for horse slaughter in this country. We hope you will lend Redwings your support on behalf of the horses as we endeavor to bring this foreign owned industry to a halt. For The Horses, Bonnie Stoehn *Hundreds of thousands of horses every year are slaughtered in this country for foreign human consumption. **CEC is the organization that spearheaded the successful attempt to ban horse tripping in California two years ago. Since then seven other states have passed similar legislation.

Did you know that when someone puts a bridle on a horse. The metal bit is not held between the teeth, but instead rests on the horse's sensitive gums? Usually, depending on the severity of the bit, this causes no discomfort until the human picks up the reins, pulls back, and applies pressure. Many people assume that pulling on the reins automatically causes a horse to slow down or stop. If you've ever watched a horse race you may recall that the reins are not loose, but instead are being pulled tight by the jockeys who want their horses to run as fast as they can. Obviously, pulling on the reins is not the key to asking a horse to slow down. Horses need help from a knowledgeable, compassionate trainer to help them understand that a light touch from the reins means to slow. Without such help the horse will become confused and respond to the pain in his/her mouth the same way you or I would, by trying to avoid it. The usual scenario goes something like this: When the human pulls or yanks on the reins, the horse attempts to avoid the pain by opening his/her mouth. The human responds by tying the horse's mouth shut with something called a nose band. As the pain continues, the horse raises his/her head up high in an attempt to transfer the pain from the gums to the corners of his/her mouth. The human then ties the horse's head down using equipment such as a martingale or "tie down". Some horses respond to this type of extreme physical manipulation by rearing, bucking, or even running away. Out come the whips and chains with the human feeling that any amount of physical violence is justifiable because the horse is being "bad and unmanageable" or "trying to get away with something". All of this because the human did not take the time to help the horse understand in the first place. It has been my personal experience that most "so called" horse trainers know far more about using and adjusting equipment to cause this horse discomfort and pain than they know about communicating with horses. As long as students and clients continue to reward such abusive behavior by paying someone who communicates through pain, the practice will continue. When you pay someone to work with your horse, they are your employee -you are their boss and as such can demand that they not abuse your horse. If your trainer's knowledge of horses only revolves around whips and chains and "devices" that force submission, by all means do your horse a favor and get him/her out of that situation. Find someone who has more to offer your horse than a trainer who is ignorant of how special, sensitive, and intelligent horses are. If you need help, come visit the sanctuary and watch the humane horse handling demonstration or buy our "How To Make Friends With Horses" training video. I can be reached at (408) 624-8464. Whatever you do, don't allow someone to talk you into letting them hurt your horse.

Unfortunately, a "compromise" on Senate Bill 1459 (this is also the House number) has been negotiated by Representative Sherry Boehlert (R-NY) under pressure from Speaker Gingrich and western grazing interests. Rep. Boehlert's office has conceded "this is a bill you (environmentalists) will not like". Interested parties had hoped to sneak it onto the House floor the next day. When we found out (through the GrassRoots Environmental Effectiveness Network) what was about to happen, we and thousands of others from different environmental groups began making phone calls. When I spoke to one of Rep. Boehlert's aides, he indicated that their office had been inundated with calls! Our efforts paid off! The earliest this bill will come to the floor is the first week in September. Call today! Please call your representative(s) and let them know of your opposition to Bill 1459 as it now stands. Your representative can be reached through the Capitol switchboard (202) 224-3121. Again, your message of NO on both S. 1459 and Rep. Boehlert's version of the grazing bill is important. Adopt-A-Horse Program The Grand Jury investigation in Del Rio, Texas will not convene as we had hoped. The Grand Jury was to look into allegations which have been made against certain individuals within the Bureau of Land Management's Adopt-A-Horse Program. These allegations concerned BLM employees who have knowingly allowed wild horses to go to slaughter. The charges have been dropped! Redwings will continue to urge the Justice Department to investigate ongoing allegations of abuse within the wild horse program. Clearly this program needs constant monitoring.

Jasmine would have been shipped to a Texas slaughter house had Redwings not purchased her from a slaughter auction. The National Commercial Transportation of Horses to Slaughter Bill What was passed? Authority was given to the USDA to promulgate through "creating guidelines" for the transport of horses destined for slaughter. Provisions are however "subject to the availability of appropriations". And, no funds have been appropriated for the years 1996 or 1997. It will come up again for vote in 1998, but again, no appropriations, no enactment. Final language was amended deleting the words "safe and humane" from the bill; regulation was replaced with mere guidelines; recommendations will be performance based (BAD) not engineering based; and the final version took on industry studies. Bottom Line The horses did not get a thing. They are still being transported in double-decked cattle trucks with no water or rest and without preloading veterinary inspections.

Kiro Kinetics is the only unalterable identification recognized internationally. The recent theft of local horses that have yet to be recovered brings home the need to take precautions to prevent horse theft and have your horse freezemarked! Other actions include: Take identification pictures of your horse in both summer and winter coats. Don't leave your halters out to be used by thieves. Keep your pasture or barn well lit. Know your neighbors, they can be your best "watch dogs" when you are away. Create a double fencing system, a perimeter fence that can be locked with pastures and corrals inside. Don't think this can't happen to you! If your horse is stolen immediate action is needed! The more time that is wasted the less chance you have for recovery! Call your local law enforcement agencies. Call your brand inspector, call auction houses. Call the media! Newspapers and television can reach vast numbers of people very quickly. Call the slaughter houses. Post fliers with a description and clear pictures of your horse. You must act immediately!! Redwings keeps lists of slaughter houses, brand inspectors, and auction yards which we will send to you.

It will be open to the public every Open Day, and available during the week for school group tours. Among other things, the Center will have many resource materials, including a video library, a legislative table where visitors can learn the facts about pending bills, and stationery and envelopes for letter writing. There will also be a video monitor with a library of educational/ informational tapes covering all aspects of horse care and equine related issues. Return to Index Protect Your Horse Kyro Kinetics Home Page. Kyro Kinetics Freeze Marking Clinic will be held at Redwings Horse Sanctuary. Come join us for a day of speakers and freeze marking.* For more information, call Shelly at 408/624-0315. Reservations are needed if you want your horse freeze marked. *A freeze mark is a permanent, unalterable series of symbols on an animal's neck applied with an "iron " that has been immersed in liquid nitrogen. The procedure is painless and the symbols represent information pertaining only to that animal. Return to Index Wild Horses Mother and daughter were huddled inside the horse trailer. Bonnie and Shelly of Redwings would not have known they were there had they not asked questions while waiting for the trailer to be unloaded, and upon viewing the freeze marks, pressed the owner for more information. Three days previously, the owner had received title to them through the Bureau of Land Management's adoption program. They were now going on the auction block destined for slaughter. It is illegal for mustangs to be sold for commercial purposes according to the 1971 Act protecting wild horses and burros, yet many go to slaughter because the Bureau of Land Management does not enforce the law as originally written. I have spoken to several BLM law enforcement agents and they concurred - it is illegal. How can it be that animals considered a national treasure are ending up at the slaughterhouse? This mare and filly will be considered treasures at Redwings and can look forward to a safe and loving home for the rest of their lives. All of us have been given the responsibility of protecting the mustangs and burros which live on the public lands. I urge you to speak up for those that have no voice in Congress. Please write and demand that, at the very least, the Bureau of Land Management make prospective adopters aware that selling mustangs to slaughter is illegal. We have been unable to find it mentioned anywhere in their literature. Our legislators must not forget about them and it's up to all of us to remind them of their duty to enforce the laws protecting the mustangs and burros. Wild Horse Annie must be turning over in her grave! ! Wild Burro Rescue of Washington will be in charge of another roundup this year of wild burros in Death Valley. These burros would otherwise be shot by the National Park Service. There will be approximately 30-40 burros that will need homes. Please contact Diana and Gene Chantos at 360/985-7282 if you're interested in providing a good home for these special animals. Someday soon there will no longer be any wild burros in Death Valley. They are not wanted - 400 of them have been shot since the National Park Service began implementing its policy to eliminate the burros from the area. Redwings personnel will be hands on assisting with the wild burro rescue.

Return to Index We've Redefined Being on the Net - The Redwings Network Finds Homes for the Horses in Distress Thanks to those of you who have called in and contributed towards making our networking system such a success. Recently, a Redwings supporter called to see if I could help find a home for a pony with founder* at a children's camp. If not, the little mare would be sent to auction in two days. That didn't give me much time, but I knew with the founder she'd be sold to slaughter. I had to act fast. Fortunately, there are people on my list looking for horses who are willing to consider animals with some physical limitations. The family that offered to take the pony were willing to not only give her a permanent loving home, but also devote whatever time and money it would take to bring her back to health. It is so wonderful to know people are able to open their hearts and homes to horses in distress. Please call me if you want to give a horse, pony or donkey a permanent, loving home.

Jim worked many hours during his days getting it in tip-top shape for Redwings. Return to Index One Person Can Make a Difference We recently received a letter that we knew all our supporters must see. It is a shining example of the difference each of you make for the horses. Dear Redwings: I implore the public to take an animal abuse situation in hand and put a stop to it. I have done so many times. One person can make a difference. A few years ago, Arcadia started having Fall fairs. I went to the second one and to my dismay they had riding ponies on leads that kept them walking at a fast pace Tied were two ponies in reserve. I noticed one holding its foot up, unable to put it to the ground and seemed to be in pain. I tried to question the man in charge, but ignored me, being only interested in blood money. I wrote the Arcadia Chamber of Commerce and complained and also enclosed an article where mechanical rides could be rented and suggested they use these instead of riding ponies. I also called the director of my Humane Society and he in turn called the Chamber of Commerce. I am happy to tell you there have been no more riding ponies, but several mechanical rides for several years now. It's better to champion a losing cause you believe in than to keep your silence and risk nothing.

No one seemed to notice even though she would rear up or resist being saddled. It wasn't until the Humane Society rescued Bonny that she had any hope for the future. They brought Bonny to Redwings Horse Sanctuary where she will live out the remainder of her days with the promise that no one will ever ride on her back again. When Bonny arrived at the sanctuary, the veterinarian to x-rays and discovered that her back was fractured in three different places. She received all the best care and attention, including acupuncture and deep body massage. Today Bonny has a happy life at Redwings. It is a joy to watch her run through the pastures with her mane flying in the wind! Select: Redwingsto return to our home page.

And certainly they haveenough resources and advice at hand to do so - what with newspapercolumns, newsletters, investment guides, seminars and radio andTV programs devoted exclusively to investment strategies. Trouble is, most people either don't have the time, or theinclination - or sometimes the discipline - to watch over whatthey have. Especially when there are so many choicesto make - and so much work involved in evaluatingthem all. Instead, busy people today are more inclined to put their energiesinto getting more out of life; to letting other responsible peopleworry about their money, so they won't have to. This paper presents some essential, broad guidelines to considerwhen deciding how to handle investments. Most importantly, it focuses on the questionsto ask should you be thinking about outside help. How Times Have Changed Not so long ago, very few people had to worry about handlinglarge sums of money or extensive investment portfolios. The "rich"were few and far between. And those that had money usually hadso much of it that they could afford to have professional peoplewatch over it full time. These days -- thanks to things like generous retirement payouts-- careful saving, investment and financial planning practices... and, of course life insurance settlements ... more peoplethan ever have large sums of money to handle. It's not uncommon,for example, for one partner in a marriage to pre-decease theother -- leaving a substantial, and often unexpected, amount ofinsurance money or investments behind. Whatever the case -- while they may be not like the very richof years ago -- larger numbers of "average" people arefaced with money management questions. Choosing a Money Management Strategy As with everything else, time may be the most important factorin determining how to manage money. With time on your hands, youcan explore the many options available -- stocks and bonds, mutualfunds, CDs and other bank instruments, precious metals ... includingtheir degree of risk, tax implications, the impact of inflationand the like. There's no shortage of "advice" available in helpingyou decide what to do. Brokers, financial planners and bankersare always available to give you some direction -- as are countlessinvestment publications and guidebooks, not to mention talk-showson both TV and radio. Having time, though, is of the essence. First, it willtake considerable time just to gather your own personal informationtogether and establish your objectives. You must identify yourspecific financial strengths and weaknesses -- evaluate your portfolio... and determine what, exactly, are your financial goals. Then, you have to be prepared to read and do research ...to evaluate and analyze ... to investigate, interview and probedeeply into all the "paths to riches" which will comeacross your desk regularly. And, of course, you have to be readyto act quickly -- otherwise, critical windows of opportunity willbe missed. The question is, do you have the time -- or more exactly,do you want to spend the time -- watching over your financesand managing your investments? The answer is maybe -- especiallyif you've just reached a well-deserved retirement, have a time-consuminginterest or avocation ... or are actively involved with grandchildrenor community affairs. Or perhaps you're still involved with yourcareer or running a business. Getting The Help You Need Whether you've managed to accumulate a substantial investmentportfolio over the years, or simply just received a a retirementpayout or inheritance -- chances are, as indicated above, youdon't have enough hours in the day to manage it. Beyond that, it's likely you don't have the discipline,either. For, as diligent as you may be in all other aspects ofyour life, it's difficult to muster the daily, full-timemonitoring and precise record-keeping that profitable money managementrequires. Without the time, inclination or discipline, then -- what'sleft? For many successful people, a Personal MoneyManager is the answer -- a trained professional who canoffer the advice and expertise required to help you keep whatyou have -- and to make it grow. Just from the standpoint of confidence alone, a MoneyManager is probably just what you need to help shape fundamentaldecisions and re-affirm your own judgments about where you wantto go. For example, a Money Manager can help you analyze your financialposition and portfolio initially -- then define and set realisticgoals. Are you looking for stability .... for long-term growth... for current income? Is there a major objective on the horizonlike a new house or a child's or grandchild's education? Actually, making the decision to employ a Personal Money Managerinvolves the same kind of commitment you make when picking a doctoror a lawyer. You simply decide that you have confidence in hisor her judgment and that you'd like the relationship to be on-going.Your Money Manager will get to know you as an individual ... getto know your financial "personality" ... so that investmentdecisions, in general terms, can be based on the way youwant things done. You want to work with a Manager you like, of course-- one who is responsive, interested, and understanding. You wantto make sure you're on the same wave length ... that you bothhave a clear understanding about where you want to be headed.Your financial situation -- but mostly your goals ... andattitude toward risk ... must be in clear focus before you takeanother step. Once you and your manager get a "fix" on where youwant to go and why, then it's a question of getting out from underthe troublesome details. The day-to-day research, monitoring andpaperwork is turned over to the professionals. Your Manager handlesthe fine points; you and your financial objectives control thebasic direction of your portfolio. How To Take The First Steps In Selecting A PersonalMoney Manager Again, when thinking about a Money Manager it's a good idea-- first -- to make sure your financial objectives are well-defined.Write down your goals; make certain you take everything into account,including long-term debt ... and any "big dreams" youhope may come true someday. In the process of picking a MoneyManager, questions about your goals will come up frequently. Soget them written down and keep them handy. Choose from several candidates Make a list of several Money Managers and plan to interviewthem by phone or mail -- or if possible, in person. (Look in theYellow Pages under "Investment Counselors or Advisers."Or ask a Banker, Lawyer or Accountant friend for some suggestions). Ask each Manager to send you written material. You'll wantto volunteer some information "up front" about yourself,your financial resources and your goals -- just so prospectiveManagers can decide whether you're a good "match." Whateveryou do, get in touch with several possible candidates. Look at credentials Ask to see a copy of the Manager's Form ADV -- the UniformApplication for Investment Adviser Registration, which must befiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It willtell you all about a potential Manager's education, experienceand background. Questions To Ask A Money Manager First, don't be reluctant to ask about anything. Afterall, it's your money you're talking about ultimately. Besides,you'll be expected to ask questions. That's what builds the rapportthat's so important to a good long-term relationship. What services will be provided? In general terms, a Money Manager will manage your assetson a day-to-day basis -- according to the guidelines you agreeon mutually. But what else? Will the Manager help you with portfolioanalysis? Tax questions? All transfers and paperwork? Regularreports? Financial planning? Find out. What techniques will be used in handling your investments? Money Managers have different approaches -- methods -- inmeeting investment objectives. Ask what types of investments aManager prefers -- and why his or her "philosophy" willwork for you. Are they primarily in mutual funds, or junk bondsor blue chip stocks? What is the strategy or "game plan?"What's the safety factor -- how has the track record been up tonow, especially over the long term? It's simply a question of asking the Manager about his orher approach to managing money -- how they will match your objectiveswith investment opportunities. How are fees set? A Personal Manager should be working to improve your financialwell-being -- and not to earn commissions or sales fees basedon individual transactions. You should never feel any sales pressure-- or that there is a conflict of interest. It's best to look for a Money Manager who is compensated byset fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management.Be sure to discuss the specifics. And if your potential Manageruses Mutual Funds, ask about management fees and other expensescharged by the funds. Sometimes they are assessed over and abovethe Manager's fee -- which is a system you should avoid. What kinds of clients do you serve? A Money Manager who focuses on large institutional accountsmay not be right for you. Try to discover what type and size accountsyour candidate handles generally. That way you can avoid being"lost in the shuffle" should his or her interest bein very large portfolios primarily. Ask about the success rate with clients having portfoliosof your size precisely. And again, when asking about results --be sure that results over a long term are reported to you. What about reviews and reporting - how frequent? Money Managers have widely different ideas about reviewingand reporting on accounts. It's wise to ask how often your portfoliowill be reviewed -- and how frequently you will receive writtenreports on its progress. Monthly reviews should be expected --as well as quarterly written reports, at least. Where will assets be held - who is in control? When you sign on with a Money Manager, your assetswill be held in an account with a broker or other financial institution.But you should always have personal access to your funds. Askyour Money Manager candidates about procedures; they will needa limited power of attorney to buy and sell investments -- andto re-invest the proceeds -- on your behalf. Ask about safeguards,however. How will your account be protected against unauthorizedtransfers or transactions not in keeping with your objectives? What about references? Ask for professional references -- such as from attorneys,CPAs or established professional people. You should also feelfree to ask for an extensive list of clients -- especially thoseknown to have similar objectives to your own. Your Money Managershould be willing to give you the information, including telephonenumbers. With references in hand, you should not be the leastbit reluctant to call and ask questions -- including those aboutthe personality and temperament of Money Manager you're considering. * * * * * * While most people who have an above-average investmentportfolio are tempted to watch over it themselves, rarely arethey satisfied with the results. Those who are responsible formoney today simply have too many choices ... face too many decisions... to meet with success on a part-time basis. To protect moneyand make it grow, professional, full-time management is virtuallymandated these days. Although people with money still have strong opinions aboutwhat to do with it, the wisest among them look to qualified professionalsfor help. After all, the greatest dividend money earns is in buyingtime -- to enjoy life's pleasures. A Check-List of Key Questions To Ask Potential Money Manager Candidates You may find it helpful to have the following check-listhandy during your Money Manager selection process. What is your philosophy of money management? What kind of services will you provide, exactly? Are you registered with the SEC? Is your Form ADV available? What techniques will you use in handling my investments? What kinds of clients do you serve now - private individuals, institutions, or pension funds What size accounts do you handle generally? How are you paid? What is your fee schedule? How often will my account be reviewed? Who, specifically, will review my account with me? Will I always have access to my money? How does thatwork? What is your track record ... past investment performance? Do you have a printed list of references I couldreview? A Word About Cabot Money Management, Inc.

And just like the silver screen advice advocating plastic as the future, carbon fiber will revolutionize the composition and quality of almost every product imaginable. Not only is it six times stronger and two times stiffer than steel, it�s lighter than plastic. Unfortunately, past applications of carbon fiber were hampered due to extremely high prices that limited it to government or defense uses. Not any longer. As the accompanying chart illustrates, as prices have fallen, the actual and potential applications have exploded in number. Examples of new applications abound. For example, Zoltek is working with Morrison Molded Fiberglass Company to assist in the manufacture of automotive drive shafts that are 60% lighter in weight, yet twice as strong. They have teamed with Thiokol to produce high volume, earthquake-proof, wrapping for bridge columns. There is even an effort to produce the world�s longest I-girder bridge as a pedestrian crossing in Kentucky�s Daniel Boone National Forest. These few examples are in addition to Zoltek�s more traditional relationships, such as their alliance with TRW to be the sole provider of carbon fibers for automotive airbags. As Zoltek�s proprietary process drives the cost of carbon fibers down below $5 (their goal for the year 2000), the uses for it will explode into the high volume consumer market. The change in seasons reminds us of the adage that change is a permanent component of life. By being unemotionally invested in aggressive growth stocks (i.e., constant change), Cabot clients will participate in the tremendous growth affiliated with "change" stories such as Zoltek�s.

Xiarhos, Vice President Technology -- a single word that is simultaneously capable of producing panic in the technophobics amongst us and elation and unbridled optimism among those that embrace it. Those that are afraid seem to think they�ll never be able to keep up and they�re probably correct. Those that embrace technology sense America�s dynamism, spirit of capitalism, and world leadership. At times our portfolios are heavily concentrated in that broad industry classification known as "Technology." Consider for a moment the amount of technology that each of us depends upon every day. Here�s a typical daily routine for me: I awaken to a digital alarm clock, come downstairs to a hot pot of coffee made by an automatic coffee maker, and warm a muffin in the microwave. I jump in my car (which has digital instrumentation, ABS brakes, and electronic fuel injection) and head for the gym. At the gym I use either a Stairmaster or a treadmill; both of which have electronic displays of time, calories, etc. Some days I�ll stop at an automatic teller to get a few bucks or at the gas station using one of the automatic credit card readers (both are faster than waiting in line). At the office, I spend my entire day using a computer which is linked to a LAN (local area network) looking into a display doing research, checking quotes and account balances, and speaking with clients about our investment strategies. I couldn�t even begin to convey to you the volume of information I�m exposed to daily. Almost all of my contact is over the telephone. Once I�m back home again, I�ll likely work in my home office for a few hours doing further investment research or browsing on the Internet. My two young daughters have an Apple computer for which we�ve bought a number of educational CD-ROM�s and games. Like most homes, we have cable TV and I�ll occasionally relax by watching a sitcom or movie. Embedded microprocessors run the digital alarm clock, coffee maker, electronic fuel injection, and exercise equipment (Intel). High speed telecommunications transport my banking and credit card information and provide cable TV broadcasts (Ascend, Cascade and Cisco). Millions of lines of computer code run software applications that make all this technology run smoothly and quickly (Microsoft, Peoplesoft and HBO & Co.). And technology consulting firms provide the leadership and vision that allows Corporate America to embrace these technologies and make them a part of their products and services (Cambridge Technology Partners). Technology has become ubiquitous in our lives. Technology is so pervasive, broad, and differentiated that it can be broken into dozens of segments, many of which bear little resemblance to one another save for their common lineage of the silicon wafer. Any portfolio should be a representation of the economy in which it invests. A great portfolio will select those companies helping to craft and implement these vast technological advances. Our goal is to position your assets not for the past but for the future.

Mutual Fund Investing Cabot's Recommendations by Robert T. Lutts, President The dramatic growth of the mutual fund industry over the past decade now means there are many more mistakes a novice mutual fund investor can make. Instead of providing you with more information about the current status of your mutual fund holdings, I have chosen to review some of the potential pitfalls in mutual fund investing. We are aware that there are many effective methods in investing. However, Cabot has some very concrete ideas concerning mutual fund selection. We speak from our experience and are fully aware that many will disagree. Here are three common mistakes in mutual fund investing: 1.) Avoid investing in too many funds. Nearly once a week we weed through a new client�s mutual fund portfolio made up of 20 -25 different mutual funds. This is far too many. With this number of funds you will end up with an index type portfolio which tends to under-perform the market because of the fund�s fees. What is the right number? In our opinion three to five should usually do the trick for a growth fund investor. And a conservative, bond-oriented investor really only needs two or three funds at the most. 2.) Avoid the now very popular buy and hold philosophy. The entire mutual fund industry has been singing the "Buy and Hold Tune" for better than ten years now. And most investors and long-term mutual fund holders are now believers. Why? Because the market has been in a long rewarding bull market. Bear markets have not been wiped off the face of this earth. We will have another nasty bear market some day. Ask investors in Japan if they know about bear markets. They have had a terrible one for several years. We expect to be able to achieve good performance for you by avoiding a good portion of the next bear market. An important part of avoiding the next bear will be remaining on the lookout for a troubling market environment and moving to a highly defensive position at the right time. Don�t believe the buy and "hope" mutual fund story, or you will probably end up singing the "Buy and Hold Blues". 3.) Avoid investing in very large funds. One of the first things we look for in selecting the Cabot mutual fund holdings is the size of the fund. We think you should avoid most mutual funds with over $2 billion in assets. Why? It�s simple math. In our stock accounts, we like to hold positions in stocks we really like to around 5%. In a two billion dollar fund a 5% position would be $100 million. This size position can only be purchased in the largest 5 to 10% of companies in nearly all markets. This means the best companies with the most growth prospects are eliminated from the buy list. In the business of investing, a very large asset size tends to reduce performance. Therefore, try to concentrate on great managers that have not been fully exploited. Many of our favorite funds are in the $100 - $200 million size and the largest is $2 billion. Accordingly, we suggest you avoid S&P 500 and DJIA index funds.

But I'm buying this new HeritageStock! Here are a few details: It's a small New Hampshire company with $40 million in sales and 120 employees. Not wellknown at all. But the firm's crackerjack research team has developed a revolutionary new printingtechnology. It's a scientific breakthrough that will lead the printing industry into the 21st century. REVOLUTIONARY, PATENTED PRINTING TECHNOLOGY This patented printing technology uses computer controlled lasers for direct imaging ontoproprietary printing plates. Within 17 minutes of starting time, a single pressman can be producing high quality, four-coloroffset printing at dramatically lower cost. Any printer using this technology can drastically undercut - by 30% to 40% - the prices of localcompetitors who don't use it. And this new technology is environmentally friendly. It uses no films. No hazardous chemicals.No noxious fumes. This little New Hampshire firm has already teamed up with Heidelberg of Germany, the largestprinting machinery manufacturer in the world. As a result, this new technology is being incorporated into the standard printing presses made bythis giant of the printing industry. The small firm I'm recommending gets a $50,000 royalty from each Heidelberg press using the lasertechnology, along with $60,000 for each laser imaging system made in New Hampshire for Heidelberg. HUGE RECURRING INCOME What excites me most about this small company is the big money that will come from recurringincome. You see, the new technology requires special waterless printing plates. And this obscure littlecompany will furnish every single printing plate, anywhere in the world, on the presses sold byHeidelberg. Result: a huge recurring income stream for this little firm from its patented plates. In a way, it's like getting the contract from General Motors to furnish all the gas tanks for autos. . . ..and also the contract to supply all the gasoline for each gas tank every time it becomes empty. EXPLODING EARNINGS Think of it! These plates sell for around $9.50 each. Each Heidelberg press with this new laserprinting technology uses 10,000 to 15,000 of the special plates a year. And these printing platescannot be reused. Here you have another razor/razor blade, camera/film situation. That recurring revenue is the best ofboth worlds for any company. Gross plate revenues per printing machine in the field will amount to about $125,000 a year for thissmall company. . . . .year after year after year. Multiplying $125,000 times the first 100 presses inthe field yields a revenue of $12,500,000. If half of this is profit, it could contribute about $.90 pershare to earnings. Imagine the potential as more and more of these patented plates are used on moreand more presses. In five or ten years, this firm could be earning $20 or more a share! Earnings will literally explode in the years ahead. The stock of this dynamic company is poised for remarkable gains. I believe the stock has thepotential to appreciate in value by 20-fold, 30-fold or even more. That's why I call this stock "The #1 Stock for 1997".

These rules form the foundation of the investmentphilosophy used in The Cabot Market Letter. 1. COMMIT NEW CASH TO THE MARKET WHEN. . . . .BUT NOT UNTIL. .. . .A GENERAL MARKET UPTREND HAS DEFINITELY BEEN ESTABLISHED.This can best be determined by a buy signal rendered by Cabot'smajor market timing indicators. 2. IN GENERAL, SELECT SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES (NOT PROBLEM COMPANIES)AS INVESTMENTS, companies with excellent management, improvingsales and earnings and superb fundamentals. Give preference tocompanies whose stocks are consistently outperforming the market.This is a good indication that those stocks are under accumulationweek after week, month after month. Relative performance (RP)studies are a superb way to identify these companies. 3. AVOID CONCENTRATION ON THE HUGE WELL-KNOWN COMPANIES WITH BILLIONDOLLAR SALES. Their growth is limited. Favor smaller companieswith sales of "only" $50 million to $600 million. 4. DIVERSIFY. . . . .BUT DON'T OVER DIVERSIFY. Your portfolioshould contain at least five but no more than twelve issues. Thisprovides you with enough diversification in the great majorityof cases. 5. ONCE COMMITTED TO SPECIFIC ISSUES, PRACTICE PATIENCE. Thisis the single most important virtue in any investment program.Frequently stocks don't go up as fast as you might want them to.Nevertheless, if you can develop a persistent and tolerant attitudecoupled with plenty of patience, you will have a great advantageover the next person. We call this STAYING POWER!! (This needfor patience does not apply to losses. Read Rule 6.) 6. CUT LOSSES SHORT. Be intolerant of losses!! Concentrate ontaking losses, almost to the point of becoming a fanatic aboutit. No matter how hard you try, you are going to select stocksthat go against you as soon as you buy them. Get rid of thesestocks quickly! With most medium-priced stocks, do not let yourloss of your original money invested exceed 20%. 7. CONTRARILY, LET YOUR PROFITS RUN!! Persist in this. Developstaying power. Do not think of taking profits in your growingstocks. Let your profits run and run and run. This is how bigmoney is made in the market. Not by taking 10% and 20% profitsbut by thinking big. . . . .in terms of 100% and 200% and largerprofits. 8. AS TIME PASSES, CONCENTRATE ON ADDING MORE SHARES TO YOUR ONEOR TWO BEST STOCKS. Try to do this during corrections in the stock,not after the stock has posted a major run-up. Of course at theoutset you have no idea which one or two issues will perform thebest. It is only as week after week unfolds that the story ofeach company develops in the price of the stock. . . . .pointingout to you which ones are the outstanding stocks where earningsand prices are making significant gains. These are the companiesin which you should buy additional shares. In other words, averageup, never average down. 9. TRY TO DEVELOP ONE OR TWO "HERITAGE" STOCKS. . .. .stocks you might contemplate holding for five or ten yearsor longer if you have a large profit, if sales and earnings continueto show excellent improvement and if the company continues tohave superior growth potential. These stocks would be the oneor two stocks you would plan to keep right through a sell signal,even though you sell the balance of your portfolio. 10. SELL STOCKS AND TAKE PROFITS IN THE FOLLOWING CASES: IN A BULL MARKET In a bull market you can tolerate long corrections, timewise,in a stock's relative performance (RP) line. . . . .frequentlyas long as 13 weeks but seldom more than 20 weeks. . . . .beforeconcluding that the stock's momentum has turned down. When theselimits are exceeded, sell the stock without regret. Note: This rule does not apply to the one or two Heritage Stocksyou have identified as such and plan to keep in your portfolio. WHEN A SELL SIGNAL IS FLASHED BY OUR MAJOR MARKET TIMING INDICATORS The flashing of this signal should cause you to become very defensive.Think in terms of preservation of capital and accumulation ofcash. Sell any stocks in which you have losses. Sell your stockswith the weakest RP lines. Then, place mental stops on all theremaining issues. These stops should be placed somewhere belowthe low point of the previous week's trading range. Sell a stockif it closes at or below its mental stop on any trading day. Otherwise,hold. Such an approach will allow the exceptionally strong stocksin your portfolio to continue to move ahead without being soldprematurely. At the same time the other stocks that do start tounderperform the market will be sold one by one as they penetratetheir mental stops. This will automatically build up the necessarycash for use at the time of the next market buy signal. copyright 1996 The Cabot Market Letter [ Home | Investing System | Special Offer | Free Trial ] WT03-B21-76IA048-000838-B042-53http://www.cabotm.com:80/cabot/cabot2.html 204.167.107.17 19970119153952 text/html 10637HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsMIME-Version: 1.0Server: CERN/3.0Date: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 15:39:48 GMTContent-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 10434Last-Modified: Monday, 30-Dec-96 02:08:21 GMT Momentum System 1000: Finding The Top Stocks Momentum System 1000 Introduction The Cabot Market Letter, published since 1970, has developed agrowing, faithful following of individual investors as well asbanks, mutual funds, and other institutions. For the most partthese investors are not interested in a short-term trading approachwhere only the tax man and stockbroker benefit. They are interestedin taking positions in growing situations where some rather substantialprofits can be accumulated over a period of months or even years. This Momentum Analysis report will introduce you to some new ideasof stock selection. You will find out why certain companies, withno apparent investment following, began to turn into growing successfulenterprises. And, you will be exposed to several former most-admiredblue chip stocks where the forward momentum began to slacken monthsbefore the realization of problems by the investing public. UNCEASINGCHANGE, FOR THE BETTER OR WORSE, IS WHAT THIS REPORT IS ALL ABOUT. Don't Ignore The Market! There are two distinct aspects in investing that should neverbe forgotten. The first is market timing. Never, never, neverinvest in stocks until you have established that the market directionis up. This is of prime importance. NO MATTER HOW FAVORABLE THEFUNDAMENTAL FACTORS APPEAR FOR AN INDIVIDUAL STOCK - IT SHOULDNOT BE PURCHASED IF THE MARKET TREND IS DOWN. When the marketis in a downtrend, all stocks, the blue chips as well as the catsand dogs, go down together. When you invest with the guidance of Cabot's long-term markettiming indicators, you will be fully and aggressively investedin bull markets. That's when you'll accumulate your big profits.But in other periods, when a defensive posture is indicated, youwill gracefully move to the sidelines with most of your fundsand wait for an improvement in the investing climate. And that'swhen you'll avoid losing money! Successful Companies.....Problem Companies Over the years, we have given a lot of thought to the variouselements that make companies succeed and fail: improved management,a new or unique product, increased competition, poor cost control,lack of new products or changing tastes and desires of customers.And we have come to recognize companies as successes and failures.Naturally we want to invest in successful companies and get outof the problem companies before they are generally acknowledgedas such. So how do you determine whether a company is a success or a failure?The stock market! The stock market is measuring, day by day, allof the thousands of pieces of information it receives in the formof buy and sell orders for a given company. These bits of informationare reflected in the price of the stock faster than most investorsrealize. This information then, as it is pieced together day after day,starts forming a momentum trend giving us the first indicationsof a change in the fortunes of a given company. The study of thesechanges in company fortunes (and hence stock trends) is what wehave chosen to call Momentum Analysis. Companies Have Life Cycles Here's another way of looking at it. All living things have lifecycles. They grow, mature and then finally die. We see this allaround us in many different forms: in flowers, animals, treesand people. BUT WE ALSO SEE IT IN ORGANIZATIONS. Organizationsgrow and mature. They develop strengths and weaknesses for a varietyof reasons. And many of them die, either through bankruptcy ormerger. The manner in which a company gains or loses momentum can be theresult of a few major inputs or dozens of subtle inputs. Positiveinputs might arrive in the form of improved top management, increaseddemand for the company's product or even improved manufacturingefficiencies. Negative inputs could materialize in the form ofpoor cost controls, increased competition or the lack of new products.Frequently, the reason for the change in momentum is not at allobvious to many at the time it's happening. The typical investor receives many conflicting stories concerningthe company in which it has an interest. And he has an extremelydifficult time establishing the real story. Take IBM, for example,when the stock's momentum turned down in 1985 at a price of 130.At the time everything seemed wonderful. By the time the correctstory was available to the investor, the stock had plummeted to50. Similar experiences could be cited in the cases of Boeing,U.S. Surgical, Merck and many others. These were cases where thestock's momentum turned down many months before the unfavorablefundamental story was available to the public. Why Momentum Analysis Works YOU CAN'T HIDE A COMPANY'S RECENT PROBLEMS OR ITS NEW SUCCESSESUNDER A BUSHEL BASKET!!! As soon as a significant change (forthe better or worse) takes place, it is bound to be reflectedin the price of the stock. And remember, it doesn't have to beheadline news. It might not even be reported to the press. Butslowly and surely, the actions of knowing investors will resultin the stock's momentum being affected.....for better or worse.More often than not, this change in momentum is the forerunnerof a significant change in stock prices. Measuring Momentum Cabot uses a graphical tool called Relative Performance (RP) tomeasure the action of a stock. Relative performance continuallyanswers the question: "How is my stock doing when comparedto the market as a whole?" The stocks we are most interested in are those whose relativeperformance lines continually and persistently move ahead on apositive steep slope with a minimum of corrections. Of courseRP lines, like people, have their own personalities. Some arefiery and dynamic, and others are composed and consistent. Theimportant feature to look for is that the RP line has an establisheduptrend, and is thus outperforming the stock market as a whole. What are the Fundamental Criteria of a Successful Company? It's a small company, with sales between $20 million and $500 million. It has a revolutionary product or service with a major benefit. It has high barriers to competition, such as patents or market dominance. It has large recurring income from disposable products or services. It has excellent, innovative management. It has no debt or little debt. It has huge mass markets. It has strong positive momentum. It has growing sales and earnings. It has substantial ownership by management. When Is It Time to Buy A Stock? Don't buy a stock - even though the fundamentals look good - untilthe RP line has established a strong, positive uptrend for atleast 13 weeks (one quarter). Naturally, when possible, you shouldtry to buy on a minor pullback of two, three or four weeks. Butthis is not always possible. If the issue is particularly strong,you may find yourself waiting a long time before the stock pullsback. The Advantages of Momentum Analysis It identifies the strongest issues, even in weak markets,thereby assisting you in your selection process. It provides you with STAYING POWER, the persistence to remainwith an attractive position - for several years if warranted -rather than selling it simply because you have a profit. IT TRAINSYOU TO SIT TIGHT AS LONG AS THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE LINE IS INA HEALTHY UPTREND. After all, if you know you are in a great issue,why change? It provides the continual monitoring required for stock marketsuccess. It induces you to compare your holdings periodically,and without hope or wishful thinking being a factor, it forcesyou to take the necessary action. CONTINUAL VIGILANCE IS A DEFINITEREQUIREMENT AS THE FORTUNES OF COMPANIES CONTINUALLY CHANGE THROUGHTHE MONTHS. There is a big psychological advantage in using RP lines.IT TRAINS YOU TO WATCH YOUR STRONG STOCKS GROW AND IT TRAINS YOUTO HOPE THEY GROW MORE, not being fearful that you might losewhat profit you have. It trains you to put more emphasis on the time element andless on the absolute price. With RP lines you find yourself beingless concerned with the absolute price of your stock as long asit recently hit new RP highs. AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, IT TRAINS YOU TO SELLYOUR WEAK STOCKS - a continual weeding out process - because itemphasizes that they are doing worse than the averages. INDEED,IT TRAINS YOU TO FEAR THAT THE LOSS MIGHT GET LARGER. Realistically,it places the emphasis for action where it belongs, with yourpotential losers, not with your winners that are continuing togrow. Conclusion In summing up these ideas we can say that the principal objectiveof this Momentum Analysis approach is to keep your funds investedat all times in the best performing stocks. If you weed out yourpoorer stocks on the first sign of RP weakness, you will automaticallybe cutting your losses short and at the same time letting yourprofits run. This process of letting your profits run in orderto accumulate significant long-term profits is of primary importance. copyright 1996 Cabot Heritage Corporation Special Note for our World Wide Web audience: This is merely anabridged version of Cabot's 16 page Special Report Momentum System1000, a study in Momentum Analysis and Common Stock Selection.The report is now in its 24th printing.

Theseare stocks that can remain in your portfolio as long as they cancontinue to grow. . . . . sometimes for years. There are two basicadvantages of cultivating Heritage Stocks. First, you take advantageof the eighth wonder of the world: the compounding of your profits.This can produce wondrous results if you but let the compoundingdo its job and work for you over the years. Second, there is nogreater tax haven than unrealized appreciation in soundly growingcompanies. Imagine being able to postpone taxation on your profitsfor years on end! Here are Cabot's Criteria for these special kinds of stocks: It's a small company, with sales between $20 million and $500 million. It has a revolutionary product or service with a major benefit. It has high barriers to competition, such as patents or market dominance. It has large recurring income from disposable products or services. It has excellent, innovative management. It has no debt or little debt. It has huge mass markets. It has strong positive momentum. It has growing sales and earnings. It has substantial ownership by management. If you are fortunate enough to own a stock that doubles in value,you have a 100% profit. If you sit tight and it doubles again,you have a 300% profit. And, if it doubles again, you have a 700%profit. If the stock then doubles again, you have a 1500% profit.Impossible? Not at all. All you need is a good, well-managed company.....andtime. What is a Heritage Stock? It's a stock in which you have at least doubled your money . .. . .and in which the potential for profits from continued investmentremains very large. That's all. What can a Heritage Stock do for me? It can make you rich . . . . .through the wonderful "magic"of compound growth. It can give you peace of mind, by taking youout of the frantic world of the short-term trader/investor andmoving you into the calm world of the patient, long-term investor.And it can help you postpone taxes. Because every year that youdon't sell that big winner is another year the mushrooming profitscan compound and the tax man has to wait. How do I find a Heritage Stock? You find a potential Heritage Stock using Cabot's Criteria . .. . .and attempt to grow your profits beyond the 100% level. Onlythen can you consider labeling it a Heritage Stock. Should I buy more of my Heritage Stock? Buy it again and again, time after time . . . . .ideally, youwant to buy more at the bottom of market corrections. When do I sell my Heritage Stock? In a well-established, mature company that has historically demonstratedstrong relative performance and regular earnings growth, you shouldsell when the RP line (Cabot Criteria #8) deteriorates significantly.Normally, this will be soon followed by poorer earnings growth.But in a young, fast-developing company with a ragged historyof earnings growth and an alternately hot and cold relative strength,the time to sell is when fundamental factors appear to diminishthe prospects for future earnings growth. In any case, we urgeyou to give your Heritage Stock plenty of leeway. And here's why.When you sell, you're betting that even after you pay your taxesyou can replace your Heritage Stock with a stock that's better. What are today's potential Heritage Stocks? Cabot prefers small companies. They all have the potential tomultiply their sales and earnings many times over. And they allprovide you with the opportunity to benefit from the unforeseeableand the incalculable. When you put your money in a well-managedcompany in a growth industry and then let things take their course,you put yourself in the position to benefit from that future.And even though you cannot foresee it, and even though you cannotcalculate it, it can reward you mightily. copyright 1996 Cabot Heritage Corporation [ Home | Investing System | Special Offer | Free Trial ] WT03-B21-78IA048-000838-B042-132http://www.cabotm.com:80/cabot/cabot9.html 204.167.107.17 19970119154031 text/html 4354HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsMIME-Version: 1.0Server: CERN/3.0Date: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 15:40:24 GMTContent-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 4152Last-Modified: Friday, 13-Dec-96 19:00:41 GMT Cabot's Four Proven Market Timing Indicators Cabot's Four Proven Market Timing Indicators 1) The Power Index 2) The Advance-Decline Line 3) The Cabot Trend Lines 4) Cabot's Two-Second Indicator 1) THE POWER INDEX A very basic fact is that money always goes where it's treatedbest!!! As interest rates climb, money starts to leave the stockmarket, being pulled, just as a magnet pulls, into higher yieldingbonds and money market funds. And conversely, as interest ratesdrop, the attraction of bonds and money market funds diminishes,and money starts flowing back into the equity markets. This simpletruth cannot be emphasized too much. The POWER INDEX is constructed by dividing the current month'syield of a given short-term Treasury note by the yield of thesame note six months ago. When the current yield risesabove the six months past yield, giving us a reading of more than1.00, a sell signal is flashed. Conversely, when the current yieldfalls below the six months past yield, giving a reading below 1.00,we get a buy signal. 2) THE ADVANCE-DECLINE LINE The Advance-Decline Line is constructed by taking each day's differencebetween those stocks that advanced in price and those that declined.The resulting line, generated by adding these differences everyday, is a far better method of determining the direction of themarket than the popular averages. This indicator typically hitsbottom at roughly the same time as the market and therefore isof little help in anticipating a change in direction. But at markettops, it's a different story. This indicator tends to level offand move sideways several weeks or months in advance of the DowIndustrial top. As long as the Advance-Decline Line continuesto make new highs every two or three months, the odds are stronglyin your favor. Generally, once the A-D Line fails to reach a newhigh within a six-month period, the odds are against you. Andit becomes a time for extra caution. If too, the Dow moves aheadto new highs but this indicator remains in its recent confines,it's a danger signal that the Dow Industrials are painting a prettypicture, but the internal market strength is fading fast. Lowerprices can be expected. 3) THE CABOT TREND LINES The Cabot Trend Lines are our unique way of determining the long-termtrend of the stock market. As long as both the Dow Industrialsand the Dow Transports fluctuate above their respective trendlines, we consider the market to be bullish. If both Dow Averagesare below their trend lines, we are in a bear market. The CabotTrend Line for each Dow Average is a composite of two moving averages,a 20-week and a 39-week moving average. We use only the lowerreading of the two moving averages in any week. The techniqueof using two different time-length moving averages produces earlierbuy signals safely when a new bull market is getting under way(the 20-week average) and it allows plenty of room for severecorrections in bull markets without false sell signals being given(the 39-week average). So using the trend principle, we can neverbe on the wrong side of the market for very long. And once thenew trend forces us onto the correct side of the market, the probabilitiesfavor a continuation of the current market trend. 4) CABOT'S TWO-SECOND INDICATOR Detailed Analysis of Cabot's Two-Second Indicator copyright 1996 Cabot Heritage Corporation [ Home | Investing System | Special Offer | Free Trial ] WT03-B21-79IA048-000838-B042-176http://www.cabotm.com:80/cabot/cabot6.html 204.167.107.17 19970119154045 text/html 3537HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsMIME-Version: 1.0Server: CERN/3.0Date: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 15:40:40 GMTContent-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 3335Last-Modified: Friday, 13-Dec-96 19:00:36 GMT When To Sell A Stock When To Sell A Stock Even in a bull market it is prudent to watch for problem stocks.All stocks simply do not advance in unison. And individual companiescan run into problems anytime. Many investors like to use stops just below recent resistancelevels as a basis for "locking-in" profits. We thinkthis is a mistake. For example, if we had used stops we wouldhave been taken out of some of our best Model Portfolio stocksat lower levels. In general we much prefer to wait until the stock'smomentum has stalled out and turned down before selling. Thistechnique allows us to build up far greater long-term profits. The stock of Winnebago is an example of a well-known stock thatwas flying high until the end of 1983. At that time the stock'sfundamentals were excellent. Earnings were accelerating and thestock price was consistently hitting new highs. No one seemedto perceive the approaching difficulties about to swamp the company...risinginterest rates, rising gas prices, huge inventories. The RP (relativeperformance) correction began at the beginning of the second quarterof '83. There was a bounce in August, but by October it was evidentthe momentum had turned down and our RP line gave a clear sellsignal. It was a full year before the first devastating quarterlyreport of poor earnings. The RP line was sagging under the weightof insider selling. There were brief rallies in the stock's momentum(one in 1985 and one in 1986) but the downslide continued through1990. The RP line, which tells us when an individual stock should besold, usually behaves in one of two ways. Either there is a severesell-off followed by a weak bounce (as in the case of Winnebago)or the RP line tends to stall out month after month, eventuallyslumping to new lows. Usually the business news concerning thesestocks is favorable. Earnings may even still be climbing. Butbehind all of this pleasant news the stock is slowly being distributedto unknowing investors. These new buyers are not aware of whatthe insiders know, and so they believe the sell-off is only atemporary correction. BUT WHEN THE RP CORRECTION PERSISTS FORMORE THAN THIRTEEN WEEKS, BE CAREFUL! In a stock where you have a substantial profit, you might let the RP correction run to 20 or more weeks. But the longer the correction the higher the odds that the stock is losing its positive momentum. Sell and take your profit when this happens. In a stock where you have little or no profit, you should sell quickly if a 13-week RP correction takes place. If you are developing a loss, never let it grow to more than 15% or 20% of your original purchase price. copyright 1996 Cabot Heritage Corporation [ Home | Investing System | Special Offer | Free Trial ] WT03-B21-80IA048-000838-B042-215http://www.cabotm.com:80/cabot/cabot16.html 204.167.107.17 19970119154109 text/html 1477HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsMIME-Version: 1.0Server: CERN/3.0Date: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 15:40:53 GMTContent-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 1275Last-Modified: Monday, 06-Jan-97 21:23:32 GMT Our Track Record Our Track Record A Word on Cabot's Performance...

One is avoidingbig mistakes. In recent years, many investment advisors have been far toocautious. Misplaced concerns about fundamentals like price/earnings ratiosand dividend yields have kept them from enjoying this great bull market.And that's been a big mistake. (According to Hulbert, we rank fifth inmarket timing over the past fifteen years. We are proud of that record.) The other factor is your ability to pick a few great stocks. . . . .andhold them for their entire upward move. You don't need many. Past bigwinners for us, for example, include Cisco, Home Depot, American PowerConversion and Summit Technology. From today's portfolio holdings, any onehas the potential to multiply your money manyfold. . . . .if you just giveit time. copyright 1996 Cabot Heritage Corporation [ Home | Investing System | Special Offer | Free Trial ] WT03-B21-83IA048-000838-B042-292http://www.cabotm.com:80/cabot/basguide.html 204.167.107.17 19970119154146 text/html 20200HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsMIME-Version: 1.0Server: CERN/3.0Date: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 15:41:37 GMTContent-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 19997Last-Modified: Monday, 30-Dec-96 03:34:05 GMT Cabot's Basic Guide to Investing in Common Stocks for Newer Investors Cabot's Basic Guide to Investing in Common Stocks for Newer Investors What is a stock? A stock is more than a piece of paper. It's a piece of a company. Ownership of that piece of the company entitles you to vote on important matters such as the election of the corporation's directors. It entitles you to receive any dividends that are paid. And, most important of all, it entitles you to benefit from that company's growth over time, as the stock's price changes over time to reflect the company's progress. Why should I own stocks? To make your money grow! Over the very long-term, stocks have proven a better investment than anything else. Since 1945, for example, the stocks in the S&P 500 have brought investors an average annual rate of return of 11.9%. Stocks of small companies, which grow even faster than big companies, have brought investors 14.4%. By comparison, investors in Treasury Bills have earned just 4.7% and investors in silver have earned just 4.6%. How many stocks should I own? The typical investor needs no more than 5 to 10 stocks. Of course, just one stock can be enough if it goes up. But all stocks do not go up. And you'll find that success is generally achieved by quickly getting rid of your losers while holding, and even buying more of, your winners. When you have a portfolio of 5 to 10 stocks, you should always be on the lookout for those that are failing to perform, thinking about where that money could be better utilized. How do I buy a stock? First you must open an account at a brokerage firm, usually by mailing them a check. From there, It's simple a matter of communicating your buy and sell orders. Though It's not necessary, It's a good idea to know the stock's trading symbol (example: Microsoft's is MSFT) when you place your order. You should also know the current price of the stock so that you can calculate the number of shares you want to buy. At most brokerage firms, you'll pay a lower percentage as a commission if you buy larger amounts of stock. And you'll get more favorable rates if you buy round lots (100 shares, for example, instead of 97). What is a stock broker? A stock broker is the middle man who takes your buy or sell order and relays it to the market. A discount broker can perform this same basic service for a relatively small commission. And if you use a discount broker with modern technology, you may never even talk to another person. Then there are full service brokers, where you pay a higher commission, but you get personal service from a professional. In the best cases, this professional is able to help you by suggesting specific investment moves tailored to your personal situation. His goal is to keep you as a long-term successful client. But remember, the broker only gets paid when you trade. So there is an incentive to advise you to trade. . . . .to buy and sell stocks, possibly more frequently than you should. What or Where is the stock market? You might say that Wall Street, in lower Manhattan, New York City, typifies the stock market, because that's where most exchanges and stock brokers are concentrated. But in this age of electronic commerce, geography really doesn't matter. There are three major exchanges in the U.S. The New York Stock Exchange (otherwise known as the Big Board) is where you'll find the biggest, established companies. Many of these companies pay dividends. The American Stock Exchange is the second oldest exchange and holds smaller firms. And the Nasdaq. . . . .National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (or OTC market) is a particularly vibrant market where you'll find some of the fastest growing companies in the country. The majority of Cabot's stocks are found on the Nasdaq. All three of these exchanges provide daily price quotes to newspapers of all their stocks. But there are other, less formal markets called the OTC bulletin board or pink sheets, where trading is less regular and risk tends to be higher. In most cases these stocks are too speculative for us. What is a dividend? A dividend is an amount of money, paid by a company to its shareholders, usually on a regular basis. Why does it do this? One, to keep shareholders happy by passing on profits to them. And two, because the company can't find a better use for the money! Management doesn't know how to use the money to make the company grow. Usually, the bigger the dividend, the poorer the company's growth prospects. How does Cabot pick stocks? Cabot's stock selection system starts by focusing on stocks that are strong, going up faster than the general market. These stocks are said to have positive momentum. But we need to see more than that. Behind each stock we want to see a great growth company. In most cases we require a company to be demonstrating strong growth of both sales and earnings. And we want to find a story that convinces us this great earnings growth is likely to continue in the years ahead. How does Cabot determine that a stock is strong? We look for stocks with strong relative performance (RP), sometimes called relative strength. These are stocks performing better than the general market over the long-term. How does Cabot identify a great growth company? In short, we want to see a company that appears capable of multiplying its earnings rapidly. Characteristics we like to see include a revolutionary product or service, mass markets, high barriers to competition, little or no debt, substantial ownership by management, and large recurring income from products or services. We prefer small companies because they can grow faster, and we prefer companies that are profitable now. Do all Cabot's stocks go up? No. No one picks winners all the time. Sometimes your stocks will go down right after you buy them. If they do, you should get out of them, keeping your losses small. On the other hand, you should hold your winners as long as they are doing well, cultivating them with the hope of holding on for the huge profits that can develop over several years time. In general, we feel we've done a good job if 60% of our stock picks end up as winners. The key to success is letting the profits in your winners get larger while keeping your losses small. How do I know when to sell? The most important rule in investing. . . . .and the hardest to learn is, "Cut your losses short." That means if your loss exceeds 15% or 20% at the end of any trading day, you sell. Period. On the other hand, you will have many winners, and knowing when to sell them is more difficult. In general, though, we believe it is wise to sell when a stock has underperformed the market for thirteen weeks. The stock's RP (relative performance) line is a good indicator of this. Are there times when this rule should be broken? Yes, there are exceptions, in particular involving Heritage Stocks. These are stocks in which you already have doubled your money. . . . .or more. . . . .and still see the potential for great appreciation in the future. In such cases, you should hang on to your stock through corrections, confident that the long-term results will prove rewarding. If you can do this, you'll benefit mightily from the magic of compounding. What is so magic about compounding? All right, it's not really magic. But when you see the way it can turn a small amount of money into really big money, sometimes it seems like magic. Consider this example. You invest $10,000 in a stock. Its price doubles in a year. So you sell it, pay your capital gains taxes and invest in another stock. That one doubles in a year, too. So you sell it and pay your taxes and buy a third stock that also doubles in a year. After paying your taxes (assume a 30% rate), you have $27, 440. Not bad. But what would happen if you simply hung on to one great stock, letting it triple in value over three years? You would have $80,000 instead of $27,440. It would still be growing. . . . .and you haven't paid a cent of taxes. If you did finally sell the stock and paid your taxes, you would end up with an impressive $56,000. That's over twice as much as in the first example, and the only difference is that you didn't sell and give your profits to the government. You held on and your profits kept working for you. That's the magic of compounding.In plain English, you might say that money makes money. And the money that money makes money. Understanding the power of compounding is one of the keys to real success in the market. Is it smart to take my bet off the table once I double my money? No. On the surface, it looks like a way to reduce your risk. And It's true. You can't lose that money if It's not invested. But neither can you use it to make more! If you want to take advantage of the magic of compounding, you've got to leave that money invested. . . . .let your profits run. . . . .until you're convinced the stock's major growth phase is over. Is it risky to buy stocks hitting new highs? In the long run, no. Remember, a trend, once established, tends to persist. So if you're convinced a stock's trend is up and you're convinced the business is capable of great earnings growth in the years ahead, you should buy. Because the most likely trend is up! At the root of this, you will generally find a shifting change in the public's perception of the company. We call it sponsorship. As more and more people come to develop improved opinions of the company, it's natural they will buy more of the stock and drive it to higher prices. Why are earnings so important? Companies are in business to make money. Thus, earnings are the ultimate score card. Companies that can grow their earnings rapidly and do it repeatedly see their stock prices rise to reflect their success. Conversely, companies that stumble on their growth path see the price of their stock fall. Investors are always looking ahead to what they believe the company's earnings will be in the future. Thus investors' perceptions of the company's prospects can be as important as the reality. . . . .in the short term. But in the long run, earnings and earnings per share are most important. To measure earnings per share, just divide earnings, usually for the last four quarters, by the number of shares of stock outstanding. If a company reports earnings, or profit, of $5 million in a year and has 10 million shares outstanding, earnings per share (or eps) is $.50. Remember, you own shares, so if the company can grow earnings while keeping the number of shares constant, the underlying value of your investment has increased. But if the number of shares increases at the same time, (perhaps the company sells more shares because it needs more cash) the value of your holdings becomes diluted to a degree. At the extreme, if earnings double but the number of shares also doubles, the underlying value of your investment has not improved. What is a price/earnings ratio? If you divide a company's stock price by its earnings per share, you'll come up with a price/earnings ratio, or PE. This simple number reflects how well-thought-of the stock is by investors. A single-digit PE is considered to be low, while a number over 20 is considered to be high. If stocks were commodities, like bananas, a low price/earnings ratio would represent a bargain. . . . .a good value. But at Cabot a high PE does not keep us from buying a strong stock. Because stocks are not commodities. When you buy a stock you are betting that earnings will grow in the future. And a high PE is simply confirming that other investors as well believe your company will experience fast earnings growth in the future. Are investors always rational? No! While the long-term course of a stock's price will ultimately reflect earnings, its short-term course is highly dependent on investors' perceptions. . . . .and their emotions. Investors, generally, can be motivated by fear or greed. When they are fearful, they can sell a stock so that its price falls to unreasonably low levels. And when investors are greedy, they can bid a stock's price up to unreasonable heights. The challenge for the individual investor is to avoid getting caught up in the emotions of the crowd. Does The Cabot Market Letter ever advocate short-term investing? No. All our recommended investments are made with the hope of holding on for years. Admittedly, these hopes are not always fulfilled. A stock can turn down much sooner than we expect, and we will recommend that you sell. Losses can be hard to take, psychologically. But they are the price you pay for finding the big winners. . . . .the ones that fulfill your hopes and even exceed them. In short, you can't get rich with short-term winners. Only long-term winners, combined with the magic of compounding, will do the trick. In fact, when you invest for the long-term and you are able to hold the stock of a successful company over a period of years, you benefit from the unforeseeable and the incalculable. That is, you reap the rewards of progress at the company that was totally unforeseen years before but was brought to fruition by capable management given time to do its work. What is short selling? Short selling is the practice of borrowing shares of a stock so you can sell it (short), planning to buy it back later at a lower price. . . . .returning the shares and keeping the difference in price as your profit. In brief, you're betting that the price will fall. At Cabot, we do not recommend the practice, for a couple of good reasons. First is the long-term trend of the market, which has been generally upward over the decades, even centuries. When you invest (long) in a stock, you're investing in synch with the long-term trend. But when you go short, you're betting that the stock you're shorting will move contrary to that long-term, upward market trend. And you're betting that you're clever enough to time your entry and exit points to catch this move. It's tricky. Equally important is the fact that the potential profits of a short-seller are limited. If the stock's price falls to zero, the best you can do is double your money. Contrast that with the potential of a fast-growing company that could triple your money, or more, in a year or two. Conversely, on the long side the worst you can do is lose all the money you invested in that stock, while if you're short, your potential losses are unlimited! What is investing on margin? Someday your broker may ask if you'd like to invest on margin. In effect the broker is offering to lend you money so that you can invest it and profit from it. The broker is a guaranteed winner, because you pay him interest on the money you borrow and he gets the commissions when you trade with that money. But your profits will be harder to come by. You've got to pay that interest and those commissions . . . . .and your risk is increased. If you're doubled up on margin, for example, a simple stock drop of 10% will hand you a loss of 20%! And a 20% drop will give you a 40% loss plus a headache. In general, we don't recommend investing on margin. What are options? An option gives you the right to buy or sell shares of a stock if it reaches a specified price by a set date. On the surface, it seems a relatively inexpensive way to invest, with the promise of a big payoff if you're right. Trouble is, you'll seldom be right. Most times, your "investment" will disappear, leaving you with absolutely nothing. And even if you do have profits, they'll be short-term. As with short-selling, the argument is that not only must you be right about the direction the stock will move, you also must be right about the time. It's far simpler and more rewarding to simply invest on the long side, patiently letting time work for you. What is a bull market? A bull market is a long period when most stocks are going up in price. While there are no universally agreed upon methods of determining when a bull market exists, it is without doubt easier to make money in stocks when the major trend is up. What is a bear market? A bear market is a long period when most stocks are declining in price. It's tough to make money in bear markets. Happily, they tend to be briefer than bull markets. Over the very long term, the major trend of the market is up. What is market timing? We are strong believers in long-term market timing. . . . .mainly so we can sell stocks and preserve cash when the broad market enters into a major decline. This is not an exact science. But it can be tremendously rewarding to avoid losing money. And we've had great success with market timing over the years. So we feel confident in recommending that all investors practice it. On average, The Cabot Market Letter gives one major market timing signal per year. If it's a sell signal, we work to reduce risk by selling our poorest performing stocks and putting close limits on the others. The object is to reduce the risk of loss and to raise cash for the next buy signal, when bargains abound. When that buy signal comes, we invest aggressively in the best-performing stocks we can find. Interestingly, that's the time most investors are scared to death. Is it risky to invest when public sentiment is negative? To the contrary, that's the best time of all! The public, in general, tends to react to what has already happened and assumes that the past will continue. Investors have no way of seeing the end of a trend until it's well behind them. But we know that all trends end when the last holdout joins the crowd. . . . .when the last buyer buys or the last seller sells. The trend ends when sentiment reaches an extreme level. Then, because all the fuel for that trend is exhausted, the trend reverses. In general, the better you are at gauging the mood of the crowd, the more confident you will feel about buying when all about you have sold in panic. . . . .and moving to the sidelines when all about you are buying feverishly. To become a truly successful investor, therefore, you should Work to identify truly great growth companies. Cut your losses short. Let your winners run. Hold stocks of good companies long term. Avoid buying on margin, avoid short-selling and avoid options. Use market timing to reduce risk in bear markets. Understand the effect that public sentiment has on the price of stocks.

This is the most important numberwe look at all day. The smaller that number the better we likeit. And it takes us only two seconds to check it. That's why wecall this new indicator Cabot's Two-Second Indicator! This new indicator, unlike any other market timing indicator weknow of, answers the question, "How healthy is the stockmarket today?" When you use it, you are simply taking thetemperature of the stock market. All you have to do is glancein your newspaper and note the number of stocks on the NYSE thathit new 52-week price lows for the previous day. This single number,when properly interpreted, will give you a very good idea of thehealth of the current stock market. Is this indicator perfect? No. No timing indicator is infallible,and we never expect to find one that's perfect. Nevertheless,we have found a strong correlation between the number of dailynew lows and the health of the stock market itself. Essentiallywe see that as long as the number of daily new lows does not exceed40, the market is sound and in no danger of falling significantly. In sum, the indicator is most helpful during normal markets andat market tops. But in addition, at market bottoms this indicatorcan help you identify the reduced selling that takes place beforethe next major market advance. As a result of our research, we have been able to divide the stockmarket into three distinct categories of varying degrees of strengthor weakness. Here are the categories: CATEGORY ONE - A ROBUST MARKET This type of market is the strongest and typically has no daysof 40 or more new lows. Even on market corrections of 100 Dowpoints or more, no 40 readings occur. This is an exceedingly healthymarket on a safe footing. When the daily new low readings areconsistently fewer than 40, it's impossible for the stock marketto drop significantly. CATEGORY TWO - A HEALTHY MARKET This type of market, while not as strong as the one identifiedabove, is nevertheless a healthy market. And it is more typicalof what we see in an advancing market. Sometimes this type ofmarket can be quite strong and yet interspersed with correctionsthat have reasonably short periods (one to twenty days) of 40or more new lows. In this category the 40 reading doesn't appearuntil the market correction has been in force for a few days.So these occasional pockets of 40 readings are not worrisome.They occur around the bottom of a normal correction. And the sellingpressures ease rather quickly if the market is basically healthy.In fact, the subsequent shrinkage to readings of fewer than 40can be considered a good buying point for stocks. CATEGORY THREE - A SICK AND DANGEROUS MARKET Do not underestimate the danger of this market! If you are awareof only this category and take defensive action when it firstappears, you will be extremely well rewarded. In these cases weobserve that as the market advances to a new market peak or asub-peak, the daily new lows start expanding simultaneously toproduce readings of 40 or more, day after day. DANGER, DANGER,DANGER!!!! Internally, the real market is heading down, producinga dangerous number of new lows day after day, even though theDow is hitting new peaks and even though the daily new highs mightbe expanding! A sell signal is flashed as soon as five consecutivedays of readings in excess of 40 new lows are registered. TheCategory Three market remains in effect as long as the new lowsremain greater than 40. To conclude that the Category Three decline has truly reachedits end, we like to see a retest of the market bottom with thedaily new lows at reduced levels followed by at least four daysof fewer than 40 new lows in an advancing market. REVIEW OF CABOT'S TWO-SECOND INDICATOR Probably the best way for you to understand this indicator isto look at some history. The detailed comments show you how youcould have spotted each of these new market trends, not in hindsight,but in real time, as it was developing. You'll find one exampleof Category One, one example of Category Two and then eight examplesof Category Three. This is the category of greatest interest becauseit helps you to identify market tops as they occur. It warns youof serious market declines and even of impending market panicssuch as the one of October, 1987. A ROBUST MARKET Category One, 1991 1991 was a typically bullish year in which the Two-Second Indicatorrepeatedly signaled that the stock market was healthy and therewas nothing to worry about. The new lows remained at fewer than40 throughout the entire year except for five trading days inthe middle of January when the market was going through a normalcorrection, one day in August when Gorbachev of Russia was oustedfor a day, and then in late November and December when the marketwas correcting again. (These year-end corrections could be consideredCategory Two configurations.) The year 1983 provided us with anothergood example of a Category One configuration. In that year, nonew lows in excess of 40 appeared until December, and that wasduring a market correction. There were only nine recorded daysof more than 40 new lows in 1983. A HEALTHY MARKET Category Two, 1992 In 1992 the Two-Second Indicator produced readings of less than40 throughout the year except on 35 trading days. And those 35trading days occurred during five distinct market corrections.There were two in April at the bottom of the correction. Therewere seven in June, during a correction. Two in July during marketweakness. Two in August during a sell-off. And finally, beginningin September and extending into November, there was a series ofdays of more than 40 new lows (22 days in all). These 40 or morereadings kept appearing and then disappearing during the September-Novembermarket correction. But the new lows never expanded. Ever-so-slowlythey started drying up and then eventually disappeared. This isa good example of Category Two, a reasonably healthy market thatis frequently interspersed with reasonable market corrections,none of a damaging nature. You would have been safely and profitablyinvesting throughout the entire year. A DANGEROUS MARKET Category Three, 1962 In January of 1962 the Dow had just hit record highs of 725 inthe Dow, had corrected and was advancing again in March, justa handful of points short of the January record highs. The dailynew lows were substantially fewer than 40, without exception.On March 15 the market peaked at 723. On the 18th, with the Dowat 720, the daily new lows exceeded 40, and then day after daykept getting larger and larger. We were witnessing Category Threeunfolding. The market was right at its highs and yet the dailynew lows started expanding. We were able to record five consecutivedays of 40-or-greater readings by the time the market droppedto 714 in the Dow, on March 25th. This flashed a sell signal.Fundamentally, there was news to precipitate the weak market thatdeveloped in late March and April. President Kennedy had confrontedthe steel industry and forced the steel companies to rescind theirrecent price hikes. The stock market took this badly. The DowIndustrials dropped from 723 to 535 (a huge drop of 26%) in littlemore than three months' time. A DANGEROUS MARKET Category Three, 1966 In February of 1966, the Dow Industrials were hitting a new recordhigh at 995, breaking up through the previous highs of mid-January.But surprisingly, only one day after that peak, with the Dow slippingonly five points, the new lows expanded to 50 and continued toexpand. That was the first day of a whole series of days untilNovember, where 97% of all the readings exceeded 40 day afterday. The sell signal was flashed at Dow 973, only six days afterthe yearly market high was recorded in mid-February. This wasclearly a Category Three sell signal. The market skidded and divedthroughout the year, dropping from Dow 995 in February to 745in early October, a drop of 25%. It was a great year to be anywherebut the stock market! A DANGEROUS MARKET Category Three, 1970 1970 witnessed the daily new lows expanding rapidly in January,but not until a correction was well under way (Category Two).Then, as the market advanced again into early April, the new lowsshrunk, as expected, to below 40, but only briefly, actually forsix days. Then, while the Dow was resting at its market peak ofDow 790, the new lows started to expand dramatically with thefirst reading in excess of 40 occurring four days prior to themarket's ultimate peak. This was a weak situation and spelleddanger for the market. The fifth consecutive reading of excessivenew lows occurred right at the exact market top in mid-April,producing a market sell signal. This coincided with the liquiditycrisis that occurred at that time. The market plummeted from theDow 790 area to 630 in less than two months. That amounted toa shocking 20% drop. A DANGEROUS MARKET Category Three 1973 In 1973, as the Dow hit record highs of 1050 in mid-January, thedaily new lows started expanding and exceeded 40 on the very firstday following that all-time Dow peak. That was a bad sign, indicatingthat the market was getting pneumonia. A market sell signal wasflashed at Dow 1000 on January 25, after five consecutive dayswere registered. The new lows remained in excess of 40 until September.In those eight months the market plummeted from Dow 1050 to 853,for a loss of 19%. A DANGEROUS MARKET Category Three, 1974 In 1974, as the Dow advanced to a new high for the year (in Marchat Dow 890) the new lows started to expand and a short four daysafter that peak the new lows were 50. This was a bad sign, newlows expanding to beyond 40 just four days after the peak in theDow was being reached. The sell signal was flashed in late Marchwith the Dow at 870, only 20 points off its peak. These new lowscontinued to expand day after day, remaining in excess of 40 untilOctober. The market was in a shambles. The Dow had collapsed fromDow 890 to 585 in less than seven months. The Dow drop amountedto a gigantic 34%. A DANGEROUS MARKET Category Three, 1980 In 1980, the big market drop lasted only six weeks, but a lotof damage was done in that time. However, the daily new lows exceeded40 for six days before the market top of Dow 900 in mid-February.The indicator gave a sell signal one day before the market peak.And the new lows continued to expand day after day. The new lowsfinally reached an extreme of 698 at the end of March before dryingup rapidly. The drop in the Dow from 900 to 760 amounted to a16% plunge. A DANGEROUS MARKET Category Three, 1987 1987 provided the record market crash of modern times. The yearstarted out bullishly enough with very few daily new lows forthe first three months. In the April-May market correction, thenew lows expanded beyond 40 just near the bottoms of the severalpullbacks (Category Two). Then the Dow advanced to new all-timepeaks in August to Dow 2722. And the daily new lows looked fine.We had a normal correction in September where the new lows expandedto beyond 40. Then the Dow started advancing again, moving upto 2640 over a period of two weeks. But on this 150-point advance,as the daily new lows tried to contract to below 40 they failedto do so, with the exception of one day in early October, justone day before the peak. Then the new lows exceeded 40 again,the Dow started dropping, and the new lows started expanding sharply!After five days, this indicator gave a sell signal. And you hadabout six more trading days to act before the crash occurred.From the October peak of Dow 2640 to the close of 1841 on October20, we saw a market drop of 30%. The new lows expanded sharplyto a gigantic 1175 on that nightmarish October day. A DANGEROUS MARKET Category Three, 1990 Before the bear market started in July, there was a Category Twoconfiguration in January, extending into February. The marketthen rallied up to 2760 in mid-April, and this indicator flasheda sell signal as the new lows persisted at more than 40 for fivestraight days. But this signal proved to be premature since themarket strengthened and went ahead to about Dow 2909 in June withthe new lows drying up. Then there was another normal pull backin late June. But as the market rallied again to a new all-timepeak in July just short of Dow 3000, the daily new lows failedto shrink from the June correction. They remained in excess ofthe 40 level. This was a bad sign, because the Dow was clearlyabove its peaks of early June and yet the daily new lows wererunning between the 40 and 60 level, a very unhealthy situation.That was a clear-cut sell signal. The new lows kept expandingas the market started a correction. Thirteen trading days afterthe market peaked (it was down 150 points by then) news arrivedthat Iraq had invaded Kuwait. The market rout was under way andit wasn't until mid-October that the market bottomed at Dow 2360.Thus, the market drop amounted to 21%, a serious decline. Now, after reviewing these details, you have a better understandingof how you can use this indicator for more profitable investing.Of course, no indicator is infallible. That's why we stronglyadvise that you use this Two-Second Indicator in conjunction withCabot's other indicators, such as the Power Index and the dailyAdvance-Decline Line of stocks on the NYSE.

Every day, it gives you a simple, unbiased reading of the healthof the stock market. 2. It is extremely broad-based, involving the entire NYSE. 3. It is a specific reading of what the stock market itself isdoing. It is not some secondary or tertiary indicator, such asthe economy, or interest rates, or employment rates or inflationrates. 4. This indicator gives you an ongoing picture of the generalhealth of the market. When there are no or very few daily lowsin excess of 40, you know it's a robust market. When the dailynew lows begin to exceed 40 in the depths of a market correction,you know it's still a healthy market, and you should remain investedor even take advantage of the buying opportunity. 5. With this indicator, you can identify market tops as they occur.As a general rule, when the Dow Industrial Average advances stronglyfor roughly two weeks to a month to a new peak or a sub-peak andis accompanied at the top by five continuous days of daily newlow readings in excess of 40, it's a sign of danger ahead in thestock market. The earlier the five readings occur, the more dangerousthe situation! copyright 1995 Cabot Heritage Corporation [ Home | Investing System | Special Offer | Free Trial ] WT03-B21-85IA048-000838-B041-10http://www.cabotm.com:80/cmm/form.htm 204.167.107.17 19970119153634 text/html 4437HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsMIME-Version: 1.0Server: CERN/3.0Date: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 15:36:23 GMTContent-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 4232Last-Modified: Wednesday, 08-Jan-97 20:35:07 GMT Cabot Money Management, Inc. - Inquiry Form Cabot Money Management, Inc.

We remain bullish,long-term, and we recommend full investment now. Imagine You're An Intelligent Farmer . . . Many decades ago we read a science fiction novel about the state of theworld, post-apocalypse. Vegetation in the recovering world was so scarcethat when a roving band of survivors found a thin crop of corn, tended by asolitary settler, they quickly devoured the shoots, leaving nothing butdirt. Understandable, perhaps, given the circumstances. But how muchbetter they would have fared had they had the patience to wait for theripening of the real crop! Imagine a farmer growing corn in Iowa today. He plants various seeds invarious fields. The crops in some fields, of course, develop faster thanothers. But if he's an intelligent farmer, he expects this. And he knowsit would be the ultimate in foolishness to go out and harvest the small,developing ears of corn in his best-performing fields in the early days oftheir growth. Yet this is what many investors do! They buy a stock, believing it has thepotential to make them big money. Then as soon as it increases 30%, 50% or100% they go out and sell it! To us, it's the ultimate in foolishness!What these investors should be doing, if they want to make really big moneyin the market, is buying more of their best performers. By emphasizing your winners and maintaining a long-term attitude, you canput yourself in a position to take advantage of the magic of compounding.This way, your profits continue to work for you instead of for the tax man!

Let one of our satisfied subscribers tell you! Dear Mr. Lutts: This is the kind of letter I prefer to write -- and the kind I'm sure you receive often! (Have you guessed already that I am another happy subscriber to your stock advisory?)You've seen the brochures from those "experts" that I now classify as "all the others", blatantly announcing that X's newsletter is the best, and reciting endless testimonials from a few mysterious (ever try to contact any of them?) subscribers stating that they've... "tried them all, but (X's) is the best!" Well, Mr. Lutts, I really have tried all of the better ones -- and while I admit that I'm sometimes difficult to please, not one of those other letters can hold a candle to yours. Not one. Period. Before I invested one cent in your stock choices, I read your advisory for a full year. I watched the market very closely, and compared your findings to daily movements. At the end of that year it was obvious that your indicators were absolutely 100% on target, 100% of the time, and that your recommendations were by far the most accurate of any available. Only then did I begin investing based on your suggestions. And I have not been disappointed, not once. Your service really is a service. I especially like the RP line and the Two Second Timer.

Conceptus is dedicated to expanding the clinical choices of reproductive physicians in order to improve patient outcomes. Our company is comprised of a dedicated group of professionals with many years of experience developing innovative device technology in other areas of medicine. We are united not only by our similar backgrounds and successful track records in the medical industry, but also by our strong commitment to bringing the benefits of less invasive medical device technology to the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive disorders. Reproductive medicine is our singular focus at Conceptus. Working together with physicians and patients to identify their clinical needs, our mission is to significantly improve the delivery of reproductive medical care, and ultimately, improve reproductive outcomes. Our purpose in creating this web site is to provide information on tubal factor infertility and the minimally invasive diagnostic procedures used to identify it. Please let us know if the information we�re providing is useful to you by commenting in the "Contact Us" section of this web site. And visit us often. We will be updating these pages frequently. Thank you for visiting.

Our initial focus is on improving the diagnosis and treatment of fallopian tube disorders, a major cause of female infertility. In the last twenty years, there has been an increase in the number of couples diagnosed as infertile, and fallopian tube disorders are implicated in over 35% of these cases. Many of the life style changes of the last two decades are thought to be at least partially responsible for increasing rates of infertility. The tendency for women to defer childbearing in order to establish careers outside the home, for example, has contributed to increasing rates of female infertility because a women at 35 is statistically three times as likely to be infertile as a women of 25. Due to the anatomical position of the fallopian tubes, accessing the tubes in order to facilitate diagnosis and treatment has been difficult and often necessitated invasive surgical techniques. Recently, tremendous strides have been made in the development of device technology that allows non-surgical access to remote areas of the body, facilitating less-invasive diagnosis and treatment. Devices, such as micro-catheters and small telescopes, are commonly used in cardiology, gastrointestinal, peripheral vascular and neuro procedures. Many of us at Conceptus were a part of this dramatic change in the way medicine is practiced and we want to see the same patient benefits brought to reproductive medicine. Conceptus� mission is to bring this proven medical device technology to reproductive medicine, develop technology where it doesn�t exist , and modify and optimize existing technologies for routine use in identifying and treating common reproductive disorders. The Company has developed proprietary micro-catheters, smaller than the lead in a pencil, and tiny guidewire systems to allow physicians the ability to access and navigate the proximal end of the fallopian tube (near the uterus) in a non-surgical approach. These devices are inserted through the natural opening of the vagina, into the cervical canal and across the uterus to enter the tubal opening. We believe that our fallopian tube access system facilitates a more rapid and accurate diagnosis of tubal diseases and disorders than conventional diagnostic methods, which are known to be inaccurate. More importantly, we believe that a more accurate diagnosis will lead to more appropriate infertility therapy, providing the patient with a better result. Our first catheter system for fallopian tube catheterization was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States in 1995. Data from physicians performing tubal catheterization procedures using our catheter system indicate many patients can be spared the trauma and expense of more invasive surgical procedures such as tubal surgery and/or in-vitro fertilization. We at Conceptus are also excited about the potential application currently under investigation of our tubal access catheters and other related devices to perform a non-surgical, permanent contraception procedure to replace surgical tubal ligation, the most common form of "birth control." Stay tuned as we evolve the applications of our unique catheter access products and develop new technologies to expand your options in reproductive medicine.

In addition, it supports the changes in the gametes which lead to fertilization, embryo cleavage and transport of the zygote towards the normal site of implantation in the uterine endometrium. The fallopian tube is far more than just a conduit between the ovaries and the uterus; its finger-like ciliated cells that line the tubal lumen must be healthy in order to assist sperm in their migration toward the ovum, and, if conception occurs, to reverse the direction of movement to propel the newly-fertilized ovum toward the uterus. In addition, the secretory cells must be functioning to create the chemical environment necessary to achieve fertilization. The fallopian tubes are delicate and difficult to access because they are very narrow, tortuous and convoluted in shape. As a result, they do not lend themselves to easy study and treatment. Because of the difficulty in accessing the fallopian tubes, current non-surgical techniques for diagnosing fallopian tube diseases and disorders often do not adequately or accurately delineate the nature, extent and location of tubal pathology. Therapeutic choices for the treatment of infertility are equally constrained by the difficulty in accessing the fallopian tubes, and therefore, most fallopian tube therapies must be performed surgically. Tubal Factor Infertility Human reproductive diseases and disorders are increasingly common medical problems in most developed countries. Infertility is one of the most common and emotionally traumatic of reproductive disorders. In most countries, female infertility appears to be increasing, both because of the increase in diseases which damage the fallopian tubes, such as sexually transmitted diseases, and because of the increasing tendency of women to defer child-bearing until later in life, when fertility begins to decline naturally. Studies indicate that approximately five to eight million couples in the United States or up to 15% of couples of child-bearing age (20-44) are clinically infertile.

Adhesions can interfere with transport of the egg and implantation of the embryo in the uterus. Artificial Insemination (AI)--- Placing sperm into the vagina, uterusthrough artificial means instead of by coitus --- usually injected through a catheter or cannula after being washed. This procedure is used for both donor (AID) and husband's (AIH) sperm. This technique is used to overcome sexual performance problems, to circumvent sperm-mucusinteraction problems, to maximize the potential for poor semen, and for using donor sperm. Catheter--- A flexible tube used when injecting fluids. Catheterization--- Injection of fluid, often into the fallopian tubes to determine if they are open. (see hydrotubation) Cervix--- The opening between the uterus and the vagina. The cervical mucus plugs the cervical canal and normally prevents foreign materials from entering the reproductive tract. The cervix remains closed during pregnancy and dilates during labor and delivery to allow the baby to be born. Chlamydia--- A type of bacteria that is frequently transmitted sexually between partners or from one an infected mother to her newborn child; the most common sexually transmitted bacteria disease. A disease that may cause impaired fertility by infecting and damaging the fallopian tubes. Chromopertubation--- Injection of blue dye into the fallopian tube during laparoscopy. Cilia--- Tiny hairlike projections lining the inside surface of the fallopian tubes. The waving action of these "hairs" sweeps the egg toward the uterus. Ectopic Pregnancy--- A pregnancy outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. Such a pregnancy can rarely be sustained, and often leads to decreased or complete loss of function in the affected tube. Embryo--- The early products of conception; the undifferentiated beginnings of a baby; theconceptus. Endometriosis--- A condition where endometrial tissue is located outside the uterus. The tissue may attach itself to the reproductive organs or to other organs in the abdominal cavity. Each month the endometrial tissue inbreeds with the onset of menses. The resultant irritation causes adhesions in the abdominal cavity and in the fallopian tubes. Endometriosis may also interfere with ovulation and with the implantation of the embryo. Endometrium--- The lining of the uterus which grows and sheds in response to estrogen and progesterone stimulation; the bed of tissue designed to nourish the implanted embryo. Fallopian Tubes--- Ducts through which eggs travel to the uterus once released from the follicle. Sperm normally meet the egg in the fallopian tube, the site at which fertilization usually occurs. Fertility Treatment--- Any method or procedure used to enhance fertility or increase thelikelihood of pregnancy, such as ovulation induction treatment, varicocoele repair, andmicrosurgery to repair damaged fallopian tubes. The goal of fertility treatment is to help couples have a child. Fertility Specialist--- A physician specializing in the practice of fertility. The American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology certifies a subspecialty for OB-GYNs who receive extra training in endocrinology (the study of hormones) and infertility. Those who acquire certification are Reproductive Endocrinologists (REs). Fertilization--- The combining of the genetic material carried by sperm and egg to create anembryo. Normally occurs inside the fallopian tube (in vivo) but may also occur in a petri dish (in vitro). See also In Vitro Fertilization. Fimbria--- Finger-like projections at the end of the fallopian tube nearest the ovary. Whenstimulated by the follicular fluid released during ovulation, the fingerlike ends grasp the ovary and coax the egg into the tube. Gamete--- A reproductive cell: Sperm in men, the egg in women. Gonorrhea--- A sexually transmitted bacterial infection with a special propensity to cause tubal damage and infertility. Hydrosalpinx--- A large, fluid-filled fallopian tube that results when the end of the tube is closed as a result of infection or inflammation. Hydrotubation--- Injection of fluid, often into the fallopian tubes to determine if they are open. (see chromopertubation) Hysterosalpinogram (HSG)--- An x-ray of the pelvic organs in which a radio-opaque dye is injected through the cervix into the uterus and fallopian tubes. This test checks for malformations of the uterus and blockage of the fallopian tubes. Hysteroscopy--- A procedure in which the doctor checks for uterine abnormalities by inserting a fiber-optic device. Minor surgical repairs can be executed during the procedure. Implantation (Embryo)--- The embedding of the embryo into tissue so it can establish contact with the mother's blood supply for nourishment. Implantation usually occurs in the lining of the uterus; however, in an ectopic pregnancy it may occur elsewhere in the body. Infertility--- The inability to conceive after a year of unprotected intercourse or the inability to carry a pregnancy to term. Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)--- A procedure in which "washed"sperm is directly deposited into the uterus, bypassing cervical mucus and depositing the sperm more closely to the fallopian tubes, where fertilization occurs. Used to bypass hostile cervical mucus and to overcome sperm count and motility problems. Laparoscope--- A small telescope that can be inserted into a hole in the abdominal wall forviewing the internal organs; the instrument used to perform a laparoscopy. Used to diagnose and treat a number of fertility problems including endometriosis, abdominal adhesions, and polycystic ovaries. Examination of the pelvic region by using a laparoscope is called a laparoscopy. Laparotomy--- Major abdominal surgery where reproductive organ abnormalities can be corrected and fertility restored, such as tubal repairs and the removal of adhesions. Ovum--- The egg; the reproductive cell from the ovary; the female gamete; the sex cell that contains the woman's genetic information. Patent (open)--- For example, fallopian tubes should be patent after a sterilization reversal operation. Pelvic cavity--- The area surrounded by the pelvic bone that contains the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries in women, and the prostate gland and seminal vesicles in men. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)--- An infection of the pelvic organs that causes severeillness, high fever, and extreme pain. PID may lead to tubal blockage and pelvic adhesions. Proximal tubal occlusion (PTO)---- An obstruction in the proximal portion of the fallopian tube. Salpingectomy--- Surgical removal of the fallopian tube. Salpingitis--- Inflammation of the fallopian tubes. Salpingitis isthmica nodosa--- an abnormal condition of the fallopian tube where it attaches to the uterus, characterized by nodules. Salpingolysis--- Surgery to clear the fallopian tubes. Salpingostomy/Fimbrioplasty--- Surgical repair made to the fallopian tubes; a procedure used to open the fimbria. Secondary Infertility--- The inability of a couple to achieve a second pregnancy. This strictmedical definition includes couples for whom the pregnancy did not go to term. The common vernacular, however, refers to a couple which has one biological child but is unable to conceive another. Sonogram (Ultrasound)--- Use of high-frequency sound waves for creating an image ofinternal body parts. Used to detect and count follicle growth (and disappearance) in many fertility treatments. Also used to detect and monitor pregnancy. Sperm--- The microscopic cell that carries the male's genetic information to the female's egg; the male reproductive cell; the male gamete. Sterility--- An irreversible condition that prevents conception. Tubocornual Anastomosis--- Surgery performed to remove a blocked portion of the fallopian tube and to reconnect the tube to the uterus. Tubouterine implantation may also be performed to remove fallopian tube blockage near the uterus and reimplant the tube in the uterus. Tubotubal Anastomosis--- Surgery performed to remove a diseased portion of the fallopiantube and reconnect the two ends; sterilization reversal. Uterus--- The hollow, muscular organ that houses and nourishes the fetus during pregnancy. Venereal Disease--- Any infection that can be sexually transmitted, such as chlamydia,gonorrhea, ureaplasma, and syphilis. Many of these diseases will interfere with fertility and some will cause severe illness. Zygote--- A fertilized egg which has not yet divided.

As presented by Stefan Rimbach, M.D., of the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in the 315 patients analyzed at the time of the meeting, visualization of the fallopian tube was successful in more than 80 percent of those tubes which could be catheterized using falloposcopy. In falloposcopy, a new diagnostic method to directly image the interior of the fallopian tube, a physician first introduces a unique flexible catheter into the fallopian tube. The 3,000 imaging fibers of the flexible fallopian tube endoscope (falloposcope) then enable physicians to image the lumen of the fallopian tube by gently withdrawing the catheter and the falloposcope through the full length of the tube. In nearly 70 percent of the cases, falloposcopy corrected false information or provided additional clinical information when comparedto the conventional diagnostic methods hysterosalpingography (HSG) and chromolaparoscopy (LSC). The study also showed a complication rate of less than four percent. Fallopian tube disorders are a major cause of infertility; studies indicate that 35 percent of female infertility in the United States is attributable in whole or part to fallopian tube disorders (Source: ASRM). A diagnosis of tubal disorders often leads to costlyand invasive treatments, such as open tubal surgery or in-vitro fertilization with embryo transfer (IVF). Inaccurate infertility diagnosis can further delay the application of appropriate treatment,a major problem for those women whose fertility status is already compromised by age. The International Multicenter Study of Falloposcopy, sponsored byConceptus, involves 21 centers in Europe and Australia and was initiated in 1994 by Dr. Rimbach, Prof. Wallwiener and Prof. Bastert (University of Heidelberg, Germany). To date, 371 patients have been enrolled in this study using the Company's falloposcopy system, known as STARRT (Selective Tubal Assessment to Refine Reproductive Therapy). In October 1995, Conceptus filed a 510(k) for use of its STARRT System in the diagnosis of proximal tubal occlusion (PTO). The Company re-filed its 510(k) with updated clinical data in June of 1996. In September 1996, the Company received a letter from the U.S.Food & Drug Administration stating the Agency's determination that falloposcopy devices used to evaluate PTO will be reviewed for marketing through the 510(k) process instead of the more lengthy PMA process. Also in September 1996, Conceptus received a request from the FDAfor additional data regarding the re-filed 510(k) and the Company filed the additional data in October, 1996. The re-filed 510(k) application is currently pending review at the FDA. Outside of the U.S., Conceptus has obtained the necessary regulatory approvals for sale of its STARRT System in most of western Europe, Canada, Israel, Australia and South Africa, and is seeking approvals to sell its products in other countries. Conceptus, Inc. designs, develops and markets innovative medicaldevices that provide minimally invasive access to the female reproductive system. The Company's initial focus is on the development of systems to improve the diagnosis and treatment of fallopian tube diseases. The Company is also developing a non-surgical approach to fallopian tube sterilization, the most commonly performed contraceptive procedure worldwide.

Microgyn is focused on developing products to increase the safetyand performance of resectoscope procedures, including therapeutic hysteroscopy. The acquisition is to be accounted for on a purchase basis. Significantly all of the $4 million fixed portion of the purchase price is expected to be accounted for as in-process research and development and expensed in the fourth quarter of 1996. Therapeutic hysteroscopy is one of the most rapidly growing procedures in gynecology to treat uterine disorders which may result in recurrent pregnancy loss, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and pelvic pain. This procedure can often provide a less invasive alternative to hysterectomy, or the removal of the uterus, which is an invasive surgical procedure performed approximately 600,000 times each year in the United States. "Microgyn's technology provides Conceptus another platform from which to broaden our product portfolio for the interventional gynecologist," commented Kathryn Tunstall, President and CEO of Conceptus. "Significantly, Microgyn's hysteroscopy-based products are highly complementary to our core catheter technologies, providing what we believe will be improved clinical solutions which are less invasive and more cost effective." Conceptus's Transcervical Tubal Access Catheter (T-TAC) system, consisting of proprietary microcatheters and guidewires, enables moredirect and accurate diagnosis of diseases of the uterus and fallopiantubes. T-TAC also forms the basis for the company's Transcervical Falloposcopy system (incorporating specialized fallopian tube microendoscopy products) and the S/TOP (Selective Tubal Occlusion Procedure) System for nonsurgical female sterilization. "We share Conceptus's vision of creating a company dedicated to developing innovative clinically valuable products for the diagnosis and treatment of the gynecologic patient," stated Keith Isaacson, M.D., co-founder of Microgyn and a recognized expert in hysteroscopy. "We are pleased to be part of a broad effort to transform the practice of interventional gynecology, a previously underserved area of medicine, though the creation of new technologies specific to gynecologic applications." Microgyn's lead product, the continuous-flow Isotonic Solution System (CISS), is designed to permit the use of isotonic, or physiologic, fluids during hysteroscopic procedures. Today, these procedures require the use of hypotonic fluids, the absorption of which can lead to a number of clinical complications, including death. Microgyn filed a 510(k) application for the system in June 1996. The CISS is compatible with the large installed base of existing hysteroscope systems and electrosurgical generators. Microgyn is also developing other related products that are intended to further improve the performance of hysteroscopy. Conceptus, Inc. designs, develops and markets innovative, minimally invasive medical devices for the interventional gynecology market. The company's initial focus is on the development of systems to improve the diagnosis and treatment of uterine and fallopian tube diseases and disorders.

(NASDAQ:CPTS) announced today the presentation of pre-clinical results as well as early clinical data from the Company's trials of its non-surgical sterilization system, termed Selective Tubal Occlusion Procedure, or S/TOP System. To date, 28 patients undergoing a hysterectomy on the same day had the Conceptus S/TOP device implanted. As presented at the annual meeting of theRadiological Society of North America (RSNA), eighty-three percent of the fallopian tubes that could be accessed in the hysteroscopically aided procedure resulted in successful placement of the S/TOP System's metal coils. Hysteroscopic and x-ray guidance were used in pre-clinical studies which demonstrated that S/TOP was 100 percent successful in preventing conception when Conceptus' devices were placed correctly and remained in the fallopian tubes of rabbits. "Each year, more than five million women around the world undergo tubal ligation, the current surgical sterilization procedure," said Amy S. Thurmond, M.D., Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Oregon HealthSciences University and an early pioneer of the research that led to the development of the S/TOP System. "A non-surgical alternative that is both effective and without serious complications will have significant advantages to already overburdened public health programs." Dr. Thurmond added, "In the United States, almost half of the married women 35 years or older have undergone a surgical fallopian tube sterilization, primarily due to the limitations of other methods of contraception. Conceptus' S/TOP System is designed to provide a non-surgical approach to fallopian tube sterilization, the most common method of permanent contraception worldwide. This System is intended to be permanent, to be performed in the physician's office, and to require minimal recovery time. Original developers of the Company's S/TOP System include Dr. Thurmond, Julian Nikolchev, Conceptus's Chief Technical Officer, and a team of engineers at Conceptus. Upon insertion, the S/TOP System's medical grade metal coils are designed to alter the architecture of the fallopian tube lumen and impede their normal function, including the movement of egg and sperm, thereby preventing pregnancy. Transcervical device placement in the fallopian tubes is being evaluated with hysteroscopic, ultrasound or x-ray guidance and Conceptus' proprietary non-surgical tubal access technology. "There is a significant pent-up demand for an alternative method of female sterilization especially for one that does not require hospitalization or abdominal incisions. I am confident that S/TOP will be an effective method of sterilization," said Jay Cooper, M.D., OB/GYN Consultants, Ltd., Phoenix Baptist Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona, and principal investigator of Conceptus' S/TOP System. In September of 1995, Conceptus initiated its clinical trial program with tests of its S/TOP System in women undergoing same-day hysterectomy. Recently, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration granted approval of an IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) to initiate an additional trial for patients who will undergo placement of Conceptus's sterilization coil in each fallopian tube six to twelve weeks prior to hysterectomy. In vivo device stability and mechanism of action will be evaluated.

Proximal tubal obstruction is the cause in approximately 10% to 20% of these women. Proximal tubal obstruction may result from a variety of causes such as spasm, amorphous "plugs," salpingitis isthmica nodosa, fibrosis, or endometriosis. Traditional therapy for proximal tubal obstruction is invasive and costly, requiring laparoscopy with chromopertubation to confirm obstruction, followed by open surgery to cut out the occluded segment and reattach the two ends of the fallopian tube. Recently, less invasive techniques using selective salpingography and transcervical tubal catheterization have been developed to better diagnose proximal tubal obstruction. Approximately 40% of tubes that appear occluded by HSG are found to have proximal patency after a selective salpingography. The placement of small catheters directly in the proximal fallopian tube with selective injection of contrast agent allows the physician to overcome tubal spasm (reflex closure) and improve visualization of tubal anatomy. Proximal tubal catheterization is successful in opening between 70% and 90% of fallopian tubes. In 30% to 40% of patients receiving tubal catheterization, no further expensive, invasive surgical procedures such as laparoscopy or IVF are necessary.

Each option has certain advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. A hysterosalpingogram is an X-ray of the uterus and the fallopian tubes which allows visualization of the inside of the uterus and fallopian tubes. The X-ray will reveal any abnormalities of the uterus as well as tubal problems such as blockage and dilation (hydrosalpinx). The HSG is considered a non-invasive procedure; it�s performed without anesthesia in an outpatient setting. One of the disadvantages of HSG is the potential for tubal spasm (reflex closure) at the cornua, which leads to the erroneous diagnosis of tubal blockage. False-positive readings occur in as high as 40% of patients undergoing an HSG. Laparoscopy & chromopertubation is a procedure used to evaluate pelvic structures and determine whether or not the fallopian tubes are patent (open). A laparoscope (medical grade telescope) is inserted into the patient�s abdominal cavity through the belly button. After assessing the appearance of the pelvis, blue dye is injected via the cervix, through the uterus, and into the fallopian tubes. Using the laparoscope, the physician observes whether or not there is free spill of the blue dye from each fallopian tube into the abdominal cavity, indicating whether the fallopian tubes are open or blocked. However, laparoscopy & chromopertubation is an invasive procedure and does not provide the physician with an understanding of what the uterus and fallopian tubes look like inside.

Apparent obstruction in this region is often caused by tubal spasm (reflex closure), or cellular debris and can be diagnosed by catheter techniques. True obstruction caused by fibrosis and peritubal disease can also be diagnosed using injections of dye via a catheter. Selective salpingography and tubal catheterization have developed into procedural extensions of hysterosalpingraphy that result in improved visualization of the fallopian tube anatomy. Fallopian tube catheterization has proven to be a simple and noninvasive method for determining tubal patency in patients who otherwise would have needed laparoscopy or laparotomy for tubal diagnosis.

The procedure is performed in the first half of the patient�s menstrual cycle. Access to the uterus and the tubal ostium is gained by a catheter system (fluoroscopically) or via a uterine catheter placed in the working channel of a rigid hysteroscope. After placing the tip of the uterine catheter in the tubal ostium, a selective injection of contrast (fluoroscopically) or blue dye (hysteroscopically) is injected directly into the fallopian tube. If proximal obstruction of the fallopian tube is diagnosed, a micro-catheter and guidewire are advanced into the fallopian tube, the guidewire is removed, and contrast agent is injected. This procedure enables more accurate diagnosis by either confirming proximal obstruction or determining that the tube is actually clear, suggesting that the apparent obstruction may have been due to soft cellular debris.

Backfill material used to fill the space in a mine after ore has been extracted Ball mill a mill using metal balls as the grinding medium Boudin structure arising from tensional forces. It develops by stretching of a competent bed along bedding planes giving rise to tension cracks. Appearance is that of a string of sausages. Carbon-in-leach a process very similar to carbon-in-pulp. In the carbon-in-leach process, the leaching and absorbing of gold onto carbon take place in the same tank Carbon-in-pulp a process to recover gold from a cyanide leach slurry. Coarse, activated carbon particles are moved counter-current to the slurry, absorbing the gold. Loaded carbon is removed by screening, and the gold is recovered from the carbon by stripping in a caustic cyanide solution followed by electrolysis or by zinc precipitation Cash cost includes production costs, royalties, marketing and refining charges, together with all administration expenses at the joint venture level Commercial production production for accounting purposes Cut-and-fill a mining method which involves excavating a stope, then filling it with waste material to provide support Cut-off grade the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic; used in the calculation of the ore reserves in a given deposit Cyanidation a method of extracting gold grains from crushed or ground ore by dissolving them in a weak solution of sodium or calcium cyanide: also known as leaching Decline ramp an inclined haulage road Dip the angle at which a vein, structure or rock bed is inclined from the horizontal, measured at right angles to the strike Disseminated ore ore carrying small particles of valuable minerals, spread more or less uniformly through the gangue matter; distinct from massive ore, wherein the valuable minerals occur in almost solid form with very little waste mineral included Dor� impure mixture of metallic gold and silver produced through the smelting of gold and silver concentrate, sand or precipitate. Typical impurities include base metals Epithermal hydrothermal deposits formed at low temperature and pressure Flotation a process for concentrating materials based on the selective adhesion of certain minerals to air bubbles in a mixture of water and ground-up ore. When the right chemicals are added to a frothy water bath of ore that has been ground to the consistency of talcum powder, the minerals will float to the surface. The metal-rich flotation concentrate is then skimmed off the surface Footwall the mass of rock beneath a geological structure such as an orebody or fault Formation the ordinary unit of geologic mapping consisting of a large and persistent stratum of rock Gold equivalent silver expressed in equivalent ounces of gold using a conversion ratio dependent on prevailing gold and silver prices Gravity separation recovery of gold from crushed rock or gravel using gold�s high specific gravity to separate it from lighter material Grinding media material used to finely grind ore material to a size which allows recovery of the desired contained material Hangingwall the mass of rock overlying a geological structure such as an orebody or fault Hedging an arrangement which effectively offsets a price or exchange risk inherent in another transaction or arrangement In-fill drilling drilling within a group of previously drilled holes to provide a closer spaced pattern to define more accurately the parameters of the orebody Leaching the process in which a soluble metallic compound is extracted from ore by dissolving the metals in a solvent; see cyanidation Level a horizontal opening in a mine; levels are usually established at regular intervals Merrill-Crowe a precipitation process to recover precious metals using zinc dust to treat a de-oxygenated precious metals-cyanide solution Mineralized zone any mass of host rock in which minerals of potential commercial value occur Net smelter return an interest in a mining property held by the vendor on the net revenue generated from the sale of metal produced by the mine Operating cost cash cost plus depreciation and amortization Ore material that contains one or more minerals, at least one of which can be recovered at a profit Ounces troy ounces of a fineness of 999.9 parts per 1,000 parts, equal to 31.1034 grams Oxidized ore the alteration of metalliferous minerals by weathering and the action of surface waters and their conversion, partly or wholly into oxides, carbonates or sulfates Phyllite scaly minerals, micas, chlorites and clays; a term more recently applied to minerals with a layered crystal structure Porphyry rocks containing conspicuous phenocrysts in a fine-grained or aphanitic groundmass Precipitate a mixture of mineral particles filtered from solutions as a result of a chemical reaction Proterozoic the younger of two Precambrian systems or eras Pyroclastic produced by explosive or aerial ejection of material from a volcanic vent Pyroclastic deposits deposits made up mainly of rock material that has been expelled aerially from a volcanic vent Reagent a chemical used in the mineral recovery process Reclamation the process by which lands disturbed as a result of mining activity are reclaimed back to a beneficial land use. Reclamation activity includes the removal of buildings, equipment, machinery, other physical remnants of mining, closure of tailings impoundments, leach pads and other mine features, and contouring, covering and revegetation of waste rock piles and other disturbed areas Reserves that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Reserves are customarily stated in terms of ore when dealing with metalliferous minerals. There are three categories of reserves: Proven ore � material for which tonnage and grade are computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, underground workings or drill holes; grade is computed from the results of adequate sampling; and the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are so spaced and the geological character so well-defined that size, shape and mineral content are established. Probable ore � material for which tonnage and grade are computed partly from specific measurements, samples or production data and partly from projection for a reasonable distance on geological evidence; and for which the sites available for inspection, measurement and sampling are too widely or otherwise inappropriately spaced to outline the material completely or to establish its grade throughout. Possible ore � material for which quantitative estimates are based largely on broad knowledge of the geological characteristics of the deposit and for which there are few samples or measurements. Resource mineralization based on geological evidence and assumed continuity.

The wooded property, which covers approximately 6,500 hectares, ranges in elevation from 1,900 to 3,000 metres above sea level. In 1995, the mine produced 34,900 ounces of gold at a cash cost of $359 per ounce compared to 39,300 ounces at a cash cost of $321 in 1994. Lower grades, a shortfall of tonnage milled and additional development costs in accessing the ore zones on the 1,000 and 1,300-metre levels were responsible for the lower production and higher costs. TVX Gold has owned a 100% interest in the Mineral Hill mine since October 31, 1993, when it acquired the 50% interest previously held by Homestake Mining Company of California. Proven and probable ore reserves in the Mineral Hill deposit were estimated at December 31, 1995 to contain 287,000 ounces of gold. When the Mineral Hill deposit began production in September 1989, its reserves contained 350,000 ounces of gold. By the end of 1995, the mine had produced over 253,100 ounces of gold. Exploration of the new Ski Slope zone, discovered in 1995 half a kilometre down dip from the Mineral Hill ore zone, was very successful adding approximately 50,000 ounces of gold to reserves. The Crevice Mountain deposit is also expected to yield more ore when underground exploration and development begin. Additional mineralization in the area represents future exploration potential. The Mineral Hill orebody is a stratiform deposit which occurs within Archean metasediments, in banded iron formation, biotite schists and in quartz lenses and boudins within the biotite schists. Gold mineralization, associated with sulphides and occurring as free gold, is accompanied primarily by arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and scheelite. The Crevice Mountain orebody sits within the same group of metagreywacke rocks as Mineral Hill, and consists of numerous sub-parallel quartz lenses. Gold occurs predominantly in free form within the quartz, and is accompanied primarily by arsenopyrite and pyrite. Access to the Mineral Hill mine is from four adits. Mining is carried out seven days a week using a combination of cut-and-fill and room-and-pillar methods. Most of the waste rock mined to access the ore is used as backflll. Ore from the mine is treated at the on-site mill which uses the cyanide leach Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation process to recover gold. During 1995, mill capacity was increased from 500 tonnes to 600 tonnes per day by increasing thickening and filtering capacity. A gravity feed circuit will also be incorporated into the process in 1996 which is expected to reduce the requirement for reagent supplies substantially, and hence decrease milling costs. About 30% of the 4.3-kilometre access tunnel being driven from the Mineral Hill mine to the Crevice Mountain deposit had been completed by the end of 1995, unexpected groundwater having slowed progress. The tunnel which was begun in October 1994, is now expected to reach its target in early 1997. The estimated cost of the Crevice Mountain project is $14 million. Development of the Ski Slope project began in August 1995. By the end of 1995, the access ramp had been driven 220 metres towards its target length of 1,000 metres. The project will cost an estimated $2 million. Mineral Hill's total production for 1996 is planned at 40,000 ounces of gold.

This operation is located in the Snow Lake mining district of northwestern Manitoba, 700 kilometres north of Winnipeg. The mine was officially opened in November 1995. To the end of the year it had produced 14,500 ounces, and is planned to produce at an annual rate of 100,000 ounces with cash costs averaging $210 per ounce for the life of the mine. Capital costs to bring the mine into production were $38 million. TVX Gold has a 50% interest in and operates the New Britannia mine with High River Gold Mines Ltd. holding the remaining 50% interest. This joint venture is managed by a committee on which each company has equal representation. Its extensive landholdings cover over 10,000 hectares and are contained within a 200-square kilometre defined area of interest for which an extensive exploration program is planned. New Britannia�s proven and probable reserves were estimated at the end of 1995 to contain approximately 806,000 ounces of gold, sufficient for eight years of operation at planned production rates. It is expected that exploration will add substantially to reserves. The decision to put the mine into production was based, to a large extent, on the considerable exploration potential in the area. In anticipation of future discoveries, the mine and mill facilities have been designed to allow for expanded capacity at reasonable cost. When operated previously, between 1949 and 1958, the Nor-Acme mine, as it was then called, produced 620,000 ounces of gold from above the 460-metre level. Mining was halted because of the rising costs of production and the fixed price of gold. Following positive results from a feasibility study completed in early 1994, TVX Gold announced a production decision in mid-1994. As an initial step, the mine was dewatered to the bottom of the existing 600-metre shaft, and mine rehabilitation started in January 1995. Shaft deepening began in May and reached its final depth of 1,000 metres by the end of the year. Development of a haulage drift on the 920-metre level and a crusher station on the 950-metre level is scheduled to commence early in 1996. The Snow Lake region forms part of the Proterozoic Flin Flon-Snow Lake greenstone belt. Gold occurs within quartz-carbonate alteration zones within an intercalated sequence of altered felsic and mafic volcanic and pyroclastic rocks. In addition to the Toots, Dick, Ruttan and Hogg zones which make up the New Britannia deposit, the Boundary, No. 3 and Birch zones have been identified to the north and the Bounter zone on an optioned property to the south. These zones are all associated with east-trending, north dipping faults that intersect a major north trending thrust fault to the west. The initial ore for the New Britannia mill is being supplied from the No. 3 zone. This satellite orebody was developed by a decline ramp to a depth of 100 metres and ore was stockpiled until the mill was ready. Longhole mining, as currently planned, will be completed in early 1996. In the main New Britannia mine, the Toots zone in the upper part of the mine, will be mined by conventional longhole methods. A ramp is being driven from the 545-metre level between the Dick and Ruttan zones to provide access to these orebodies which will be mined by longhole retreat methods, without backflll. Tracked haulage systems will be installed on the 390 and 920-metre levels. The 1,850 tonnes per day milling complex which incorporates conventional crushing, grinding and carbon-in-pulp technology was completed in October 1995 and poured its first gold in November. Recoveries are expected to average 87%. Approximately $1.5 million will be spent on exploration at New Britannia in 1996, of which half will be directed towards underground targets along strike and down dip of the major ore zones. The remainder will be spent investigating targets on the New Britannia landholdings and on optioned ground in close proximity to the existing infrastructure. Production for 1996 is planned for 100,000 ounces of gold.

This resulted in a decision in February 1996 to construct a new gold mine, at an estimated capital cost of $190 million, with production scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 1997. The mine will produce approximately 200,000 ounces of gold per year for 11 years, at an average cash cost of $200 per ounce. TVX Gold has a 32% interest in the project with Placer Dome Canada Limited, which operates the joint venture, owning the remaining 68% interest. The 9,100-hectare Musselwhite property is located at Opapimiskan Lake, 120 kilometres north of the town of Pickle Lake and 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. Proven and probable reserves at Musselwhite are currently estimated to be 10.2 million tonnes averaging 6.9 grams of gold per tonne and containing 2.3 million ounces of gold. There is significant exploration potential to prolong mining beyond the currently planned 11 year mine life. Musselwhite's gold deposits occur within the Weagamow-North Caribou greenstone belt of the Superior geologic province of the Canadian Shield. Stratabound gold mineralization occurs primarily within a tightly folded iron formation in a volcanic sequence. The main deposits form a series of sub-vertical tabular bodies along the tightly-folded, northwesterly plunging, T-Antiform structure. Numerous exploration targets on the property include the down plunge of the T-Antiform structure and the south iron formation. The final feasibility study envisages a two stage mining plan for Musselwhite. In the first stage, a decline ramp will be developed to access the ore in the upper levels of the mine with trucks hauling ore to the mill. In later years, a shaft will provide access to the deeper levels and ore will be hoisted to surface. In addition, lower grade ore from a small open pit will be developed early to create an ore stockpile. The proposed mill will have an estimated capacity of 3,300 tonnes per day and employ conventional gravity separation, cyanide leach and carbon-in-pulp processes. Gold recoveries of 95% are anticipated. Environmental impact and reclamation plans have already been approved by the provincial and federal governments. When it starts operations, the new mine which will be a fly-in, fly-out operation will provide approximately 280 new jobs. TVX Gold's share of the $15 million 1995 program amounted to $4.8 million.

The mine produced 61,200 ounces of gold in 1995 compared to 100,100 ounces in 1994 primarily as the result of increased emphasis on the development of new mining stopes. Cash costs increased to $449 per ounce in 1995, because of the reduced production, the higher development costs and emphasis on backfill. TVX Gold has a 60% interest in Casa Berardi and is the operator. The remaining 40% interest is held by Golden Knight Resources Inc. The property covers approximately 15,000 hectares over a 35 kilometre stretch of land along the Casa Berardi fault. Mining occurs on a 5 kilometre strike length encompassing the Est and Ouest mines and the Principale orebody which is located between the two mines. Proven and probable reserves at Casa Berardi at the end of 1995 contained approximately 1.3 million ounces of gold. A major underground drilling program is expected to upgrade and increase reserves, especially in the Principale Zone which is currently estimated to contain over 600,000 ounces in geological resources. This deep exploration program will continue throughout 1996 and 1997. Located within the Abitibi greenstone belt of the Canadian Precambrian Shield, the Casa Berardi gold deposits lie within a 1-2 kilometre thick sequence of intermixed volcanic flows and pyroclastics, coarse to fine classic and chemical sediments, which are bound to the north and south by iron formation. These volcanic and sedimentary rocks appear to thicken and contain a higher proportion of volcanic units to the east, suggesting that an ancient volcanic centre may be located in that direction. Economic gold mineralization occurs within quartz-carbonate vein complexes and stockworks and in zones of silicification, and sericite-carbonate wallrock alteration. Gold is present as fine free gold in quartz veins or in intimate association with disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite in the zones of silicification and wallrock alteration. The Est and Ouest mines located about five kilometres apart, are currently being mined at Casa Berardi. Sublevel longitudinal longhole mining with delayed backfill is the main mining method and ore from both mines is treated in a common carbon-in-leach milling facility located at theEst mine. The mill is capable of processing 2,400 tonnes of ore per day. With the acquisition by the joint venture partners in July 1994 of a full 100% interest in a property containing part of the Principale ore zone, the Casa Berardi joint venture embarked on a major $22 million deep development program. The objective of the program is to allow for more efficient and expeditious mining of the Principale zone as well as providing for exploration at depth and expansion of production. The new 340-metre shaft sunk near the existing Est mine surface plant was commissioned in December 1995 and is currently providing access to the Est mine. The 4.5-kilometre tunnel being developed at the 300-metre level to link the Est and Ouest mines with the Principale orebody is expected to be completed in April 1996. This will allow ore and waste from all operations to be rail hauled underground and hoisted to surface instead of being trucked up each mine's ramp. The complete development program, when finished, will allow Casa Berardi�s annual production to increase to 800,000 tonnes annually. Development of the Principale deposit from the 300-level tunnel began in February of 1996 with production expected during the second quarter of 1996. Total production from Casa Berardi in 1996 is planned to be 100,000 ounces of gold.

In 1994 and 1995, TVX Gold completed 23,300 metres of drilling, sampled 8,500 metres of underground drifting and built a sample preparation facility, a fire assay facility and an 18-kilometre road to the property. The work on a high grade zone outlined proven and probable geological reserves of 657,600 tonnes grading 13.6 grams of gold and 79 grams of silver per tonne, 4.3% zinc and 0.7% lead. An additional 300,000 tonnes are contained in the possible category, grading 12.3 grams of gold and 71.5 grams of silver per tonne. Based on these results, an adit is being driven into the deposit to permit development and further exploration. The 1996 program calls for 6,000 metres of drilling, 600 metres of access tunneling and 180 metres of underground drifting along high grade structures. Metallurgical testing has indicated favorable gold recoveries with significant silver and zinc credits. Pachicutza is projected to produce approximately 58,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually and a by-product zinc-lead concentrate, over a period of six years, with an estimated cash cost below $200 per ounce of gold equivalent. Mine construction is estimated at 18 months with a capital cost of approximately $30 million. In anticipation of development of this mine, TVX Gold acquired the mining equipment, energy generator and processing plant from the mined out Novo Astro mine in Brazil. The plant was dismantled and prepared for shipment to Ecuador in early 1996.

It is located in Copiapo Province, 800 kilometres north of Chile's capital, Santiago, and is accessible by a 140-kilometre road from the regional centre of Copiapo. In 1995, La Coipa produced 282,000 ounces of gold and 9,426,000 ounces of silver, or 409,200 ounces of gold and gold equivalent at a cash cost of $168 per gold equivalent ounce. TVX Gold has a 50% interest in La Coipa, held through its 50% indirect interest in Compania Minera Mantos de Oro which owns the mine. An indirect subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc. of Vancouver owns the remaining 50% interest and is the operator. Reserves at La Coipa at the end of 1995 contained 6.7 million gold equivalent ounces, sufficient for over 16 years of operation at planned production rates. The La Coipa property consists of approximately 7,500 hectares of mineral claims. The ore deposits form part of a precious metal epithermal system located in the northern Chilean Tertiary volcanic belt known as the Maricunga belt. The main Ladera-Farellon and Coipa Norte zones are about three kilometres apart. Exploration drilling which resumed in 1992 after an 8-year break has since identified the satellite Farellon Bajo ore zone adjacent to the Ladera-Farellon pit, and the Brecha Norte orebody beside the Coipa Norte deposit. All of La Coipa�s reserves occur in oxidized zones. The eastern portion of the Coipa Norte orebody and the Farellon deposit are semi-tabular in form, characterized by high gold grades associated with argillitic alteration and occur primarily within Triassic sediments. The Ladera and western Coipa Norte orebodies are mushroom-like in shape, have high silver-to-gold ratios, are silicified, and occur within a pyroclastic unit, in the upper portions of the mineralized zones. It is believed the Coipa Norte silver zone has not undergone significant erosion, while at Ladera, the upper portion of the host pyroclastic rocks is strongly leached and almost barren, suggesting secondary enrichment as the source of the high silver in the ore. Mining of all ore and waste at La Coipa utilizes conventional open pit mining methods and equipment. The Ladera-Farellon orebody is being mined in three separate pit phases. Mining of the Coipa Norte deposit began in 1995. In the milling process, ore is crushed, then ground in a circuit incorporating a semi-autogenous mill with a pebble crusher and two ball mills. The ground ore is leached, then filtered and washed to separate out the tailings, and passed through a Merrill-Crowe plant and the refinery. In operation since 1991, the Phase II La Coipa plant was designed to process 15,000 tonnes of ore daily. During 1995, certain installations from the original Phase I 1,000 tonnes per day agitation leach plant, which was in operation from May 1989 until April 1991, were returned to production to increase overall capacity to exceed 16,000 tonnes per day. Funding of the Phase II plant was provided by $250 million of project financing arranged on a non-recourse basis to TVX Gold. Based on a $25 million prepayment in December 1995, it is expected that this financing will be repaid before the end of 1996. Production from La Coipa in 1996 is planned to amount to 237,000 ounces of gold and 13.6 million ounces of silver.

A paved road links Crix&aacutes to the Belem-Brasilia highway 120 kilometres to the southeast. In 1995, the mine produced 126,500 ounces of gold at a cash cost of $177 per ounce, compared to 126,300 ounces at $170 per ounce in 1994. TVX Gold has a 50% interest in the Crix&aacutes mine. The remaining interest is held by a Brazilian affiliate of AMSA Limited, a Minorco company. At the end of 1995, proven and probable reserves in the Mina III and Mina Nova deposits contained 2.7 million ounces of gold sufficient for 17 years of mining at current production rates. Additional reserves are expected to be confirmed by continuing underground exploration in 1996 focused on the new Corpo Sul orebody. This orebody was discovered in 1995 and is adjacent to the Mina III deposit. It is currently estimated to contain geological reserves of 608,000 tonnes averaging 6.8 grams of gold per tonne. The 20,782 hectare Crix&aacutes property is located in the vast Crix&aacutes greenstone belt. It forms part of a well-preserved tract of Archean terrain which is composed of three belts of volcano-sedimentary rocks trending north-south and intruded by granitic rocks. The Mina III orebody, which currently provides all feed for the mill, is a stratabound deposit. It occurs within folded metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the Ribeirao das Antas formation. To date, three zones have been identified in the Mina III deposit, along three stratigraphic horizons. They are elongated in a west-northwest direction, stacked vertically above one another, and separated from each other by about 60 metres of barren rock. The Upper Zone is geologically complex, and contains massive sulphide ore, chloritoid-garnet ore with lesser amounts of arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and magnetite and sericite ore, a quartz-sericite schist with minor disseminated arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite. The Intermediate Zone, sandwiched within a dolomite unit, is very similar to the Upper Zone but less continuous than the other zones. The Lower Zone is associated with a very persistent metachert horizon which has been traced by drilling for 1,800 metres down plunge. Gold mineralization occurs within the metachert, at the footwall of the chert and in the footwall and hangingwall of graphite schists. The Mina Nova satellite orebody is located approximately two kilometres from the Mina III mine. Developed by a decline ramp, it will be brought into production during 1996 and is expected to produce 55,000 tonnes of ore grading 4.2 grams per tonne annually. The Mina III deposit, which is an underground operation accessed by a decline ramp, has been in production since 1989. Mining is carried out primarily by mechanized cut-and-fill and room and pillar methods concentrated between the 150-metre and 200-metre levels of the mine. Ore is hauled to surface by 22.5 tonne trucks. The on-site mill uses the Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation process to recover gold. During 1995, several operational improvements, at minimal capital cost, allowed the mill to process 508,000 tonnes of ore compared to 453,000 tonnes in 1994. Approximately $100,000 will be spent in 1996 to increase the mill's annual capacity to 540,000 tonnes. The Crix&aacutes mine is planned to produce approximately 126,000 ounces of gold in 1996.

In 1995, the mine produced 162,500 ounces of gold, compared to 168,800 ounces in 1994. Cash costs averaged $235 per ounce in 1995, compared to $196 per ounce in 1994. The increase in cash cost year over year was primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency. TVX Gold increased its equity interest in the Bras�lia mine by 10% to 33% effective January 25, 1995. The other partners are a Brazilian subsidiary of Rio Tinto-Zinc plc (51%) which is the operator and a subsidiary of Montana Power Corporation (16%). The mine property, which has been in commercial production since 1988, covers 57,000 hectares. Proven and probable reserves at Bras�lia contained 3.4 million ounces of gold at the end of 1995. This is sufficient to maintain production at planned rates for a further 14 years. The Bras�lia gold deposit occurs within the Paracatu sandstone-shale formation, a unit of Proterozoic age in the central Brazilian Shield. Native gold, alloyed with minor amounts of silver, tends to occur around quartz boudins, especially where these are marked by layers of iron carbonates and pyrrhotite. These boudins, sometimes up to 0.5 metres long, occur within a weathered, well laminated, dark grey, 40 metre-thick phyllite layer which contains thin lenses of carbonate, lenses or single crystals of sulphides, a thin but persistent bank of quartzite and other thinner and less consistent sandstone horizons. Mineralization also continues for approximately 30 metres below the main phyllite, in a partially weathered phyllite with visible sulphide and a high graphitic content. Grades in this lower layer, which is not included in the current mining plan, are similar to the remainder of the orebody. The ore at Bras�lia is sufficiently soft that it requires no drilling or stripping and only minimal blasting. Bulldozers loosen and heap the ore for front-end loaders to lift into dump trucks which deliver it to the mill. In the plant, the ore is crushed and ground and introduced into a flotation circuit. After the coarse gold is recovered by gravimetric methods, the remainder is recovered by cyanidation and carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp processes. An ore stockpile is built up during the dry season to provide millfeed in the wet season when pit mining is slowed by heavy rains. Ongoing improvements to the mill have allowed throughput to exceed 13.4 million tonnes annually over the last two years. A further expansion of capacity to 18 million tonnes annually is also planned, at a capital cost of approximately $65 million. This will include construction of a $45 million hydrometallurgical plant starting in mid-1996. The goal of the expansion is to increase annual production to 260,000 ounces of gold in 1998, with production thereafter planned to average 210,000 ounces of gold per year to the year 2005. The introduction of 85-tonne trucks and ancillary equipment as part of the expansion, at a capital cost of approximately $14 million, is expected to improve production efficiencies early in 1996. The new equipment replaces the previous 20-tonne mining fleet operated by a contractor. Production from Bras�lia in 1996 is planned at approximately 158,000 ounces of gold.

The property is 160 kilometres southwest of Prague and about 20 kilometres from the border of Germany. TVX Gold holds a 100% interest on this 10,500-hectare property through its wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Bohemia Dulni a.s. When TVX Gold acquired its interest in the property in 1994, the proven and probable reserves were estimated to be one million tonnes grading 6.0 grams of gold per tonne. During 1995, the Company conducted an aggressive $3 million exploration program. This included 1,750 metres of underground development on the 700-metre level of the Golden Creek deposit, 13,000 metres of underground drilling and 6,900 metres of surface drilling. By year end, the reserve and resource base in two separate zones was estimated to be 3,332,000 tonnes grading 9.4 grams of gold per tonne. The larger Golden Creek deposit is estimated to contain 911,500 ounces of gold and the smaller Zdanov zone 96,500 ounces. Both mineralized structures are open along strike and at depth, while previous drilling confirmed the presence of significant gold mineralization over a 1.5 kilometre strike length west of the deposits. The shear zone hosted gold mineralization is associated with quartz veins and lenses and with mineralized gneiss and migmatite. Very fine to microscopic gold occurs primarily in its native form as well as in gold-bismuth complexes. During the first half of 1996, the Company plans to carry out a further 300 metres of underground development and 7,000 metres of underground diamond drilling to confirm and extend the mineralization within the Golden Creek deposit in anticipation of a pre-feasibility study in the second half of the year.

The property covers 31,400 hectares and includes three mines, base metal milling facilities and a ship-loading facility on the Aegean Sea. TVX Gold was named the successful bidder for Kassandra Mines in March 1995, pursuant to an international auction. Discussions to advance the completion of the transaction continued throughout the remainder of the year, and engineering, procurement and environmental work were initiated in anticipation of the closing which occured on December 21, 1995. The Company purchased the Kassandra Mines assets for approximately $46 million, with $19 million paid on closing, and five equal installments of approximately $5.5 million, plus interest, payable on the anniversary dates of the closing. TVX Gold made its bid for Kassandra Mines after its studies showed that the current silver-lead-zinc operation could be rehabilitated to include an efficient and economic gold operation. Although the deposits have been mined for over 30 years, the gold content of the ore had not been exploited because of its refractory nature. By incorporating pressure oxidation technology into the ore processing phase, TVX Gold expects to achieve gold recoveries in excess of 90%. The cost of construction of a gold plant and modernization of the existing operation is currently estimated to be approximately $285 million, to be spent over the initial two years of the project. A portion of this amount will be allocated to the enhancement and modernization of the existing mining and milling operations, and will include environmental rehabilitation. The balance relates to the construction of the gold plant, which is expected to start up within two years from receipt of all relevant licences and permits. Full capacity is estimated to be in excess of 300,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually during the initial years of operation, tapering thereafter to approximately 200,000 ounces annually. Significant grants have been made available for the Kassandra Mines project by the Greek government. The Greek government approved, subject to Parliamentary ratification, grants to the project of 35% of eligible capital expenditures. Under the original grant application this constitutes approximately $69 million. The purchase contract provides assurances from the Greek government to TVX Gold of its cooperation to ensure timely issuance of all the necessary licences and project approvals and the early approval and implementation of grants to the maximum degree possible. The Kassandra orebodies are massive sulphide stratabound replacement deposits, and occur within marble layers interbedded with gneiss and amphibolite in the Kerdyllia formation of the Serbo-Macedonian massif, a series of Paleozoic and older rocks. Gold mineralization in the Olympias deposit is associated with arsenopyrite and pyrite. The deposit consists of two zones. The west zone is lensoid in shape, averages 11 metres in thickness, 350 metres along strike and 1,500 metres down dip, and occurs on the west flank of an anticline. The east deposit, 300 metres distant, is arc-shaped, averages nine metres in thickness, 250 metres along strike and 550 metres down dip. The smaller Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres deposits are skarn deposits, and occur in or at the contact of marble layers with the overlying schists and gneiss. Sulphides are primarily galena, sphalerite and pyrite, and also arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, tennantite-tetrahedrite and a wide range of other metallic minerals. Indicated reserves at Kassandra Mines are reported to be approximately 17.7 million tonnes grading 5.8 grams of gold per tonne (approximately 3.4 million ounces), 100 grams of silver per tonne (approximately 800,000 ounces of gold equivalent), 3.6% lead and 4.8% zinc. The Madem Lakkos mine is accessed by a 315-metre shaft and uses the retreat undercut-and-fill mining method. An adit provides access to the Mavres Petres mine, which also uses an undercut-and-fill mining method. Ore from both of these mines is delivered to the Stratoni mill. This 1,200 tonnes per day plant incorporates two flotation circuits and produces lead, zinc and pyrite concentrates, averaging 70% lead and 53% zinc. TVX Gold proposes a number of modifications to improve efficiencies and recoveries at this mill, as well as replacing equipment which is reaching the end of its useful life. It is expected that the Stratoni mill rehabilitation will be completed and recommence operation by the end of the first quarter, 1996. The Olympias mine is accessed by a 300-metre shaft and two declines and uses undercut-and-fill and blasthole retreat stoping methods to mine the ore. For this operation TVX Gold proposes the use of longhole mining with pastefill as the main mining method in the future. Olympias ore is delivered to the Olympias mill, which is similar to the Stratoni plant. Plans are in place to upgrade this mill. The gold plant will treat refractory ore primarily from the Olympias mine. Power for the new plant will be supplied by constructing a 24-kilometre transmission line from the national power grid at Stagira. Additional potential on the Kassandra property includes the Skouries copper/gold porphyry deposit, estimated to contain 72 million tonnes averaging 0.5% copper and 0.7 grams of gold per tonne.

The licensed areas involved cover 2,400 hectares. TVX Gold acquired a 50% interest in the deposit in August 1995 for $3.4 million, through the acquisition of 50% of the outstanding shares of Trevozhnoye Zarevo, a Russian company. TVX Gold has the contractual obligation to make additional payments totalling $5.3 million to fund completion of a feasibility study and to obtain final permitting upon completion of which, subject to Russian law, it will have earned a 100% interest in the company. Preliminary Russian metallurgical work has indicated that a substantial amount of the reserves occur as free gold, and that recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable by gravimetric and normal cyanidation processes. The deposit is classic, high grade, epithermal-vein type, associated with the recent volcanism that characterizes the circum-Pacific region. With some pre-feasibility work already done on the Asacha deposit, TVX Gold anticipates commencing feasibility studies in 1996. Given positive results, the Company envisages an operation producing 100,000 ounces annually.

TVX Gold Inc., 60% owner and operator, and its joint venture partner, Golden Knight Resources Inc., announced today that the Casa Berardi Mine in Quebec will suspend its mining and milling operations. It is anticipated that the suspension will be effective following the three month notice period required by Quebec legislation. The actual suspension date will be confirmed in discussions with Quebec authorities. The decision has been taken as a result of continuing operating losses and the need to drill and develop the existing reserves. During the three month period, TVX on behalf of the Joint Venture, will seek a purchaser for the property which would provide for continuity of operations at Casa Berardi. The decision to suspend operations at Casa Berardi will result in a charge to fourth quarter earnings of both TVX Gold Inc. and Golden Knight Resources. The extent of the charge is not yet determined although TVX and Golden Knight have book values respectively of US$55 million and Cdn$58 million. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-144IA048-000845-B039-202http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr120396.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119195520 text/html 59514HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 19:53:20 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 05-Jan-97 18:43:54 GMTContent-length: 59301 TVX Gold Inc. - Conference Call Tanscript: December 3, 1996 Telephone Conference Call December 3, 1996 11:30am PRINCIPAL(S): John Hick Vice-Chairman; Eike Batista, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; David Murray, Cliff Davis and Ken Sangster, operating management team;, Rogerio Berto, Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer; Albrecht Schneider, Senior Vice-President of Exploration; Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations all of TVX Gold Inc. OPERATOR: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the TVX Gold Inc conference call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Hick Vice-Chairman of TVX Gold Inc. Please go ahead Mr. Hick. HICK: Thank you operator. Ladies and gentlemen good morning and welcome to the call. With me today in Toronto is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Eike Batista, our new operating management team of David Murray, Cliff Davis and Ken Sangster who I'll say more about in a minute. Rogerio Berto our Senior Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer. Albrecht Schneider our Senior Vice-President of Exploration and Ed Baer our Manager, Investor Relations. The main purpose of the conference call today is to introduce the new senior operation team of TVX. Also to discuss the press release that we distributed last night regarding the update of Kassandra, and then to discuss and take questions on TVX generally. Dealing with the new operating team, just a few words and background about them. David Murray who is now President and Chief Operating Officer of TVX. David brings to TVX over 25 years of mining industry related experience as well as a strong leadership in operations and project management. Prior to joining us at TVX he held the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of RTZ Mineracao in Brazil whose interests include the $230 million dollar Fortaleza Nickel Mine and the Brasilia mine in which TVX has a one third interest. David was responsible for the $400 million dollar development and operation of the Neves Corvo underground copper tin mine in Portugal during his tenure with RTZ, and for that achievement he was named the "Order of the British Empire". Cliff Davis who is Senior Vice-President, North America and as you'll hear later North America in our terms includes Russia. Cliff joined us from Echo Bay Mines where he held the position of Vice-President Projects since 1992. Prior to that he also was involved with the RTZ group, joining them in 1979. In 1985 he took over the operations of Neves Corvo in Portugal as Project Manager where he later held the position of Production Manager and went from there in 1989 to become General Manager of Kennecott Corporation's Greens Creek, a lead-zinc-silver-gold mine in Alaska, and then General Manager of Kennecott's Ridgeway gold mine in South Carolina. Ken Sangster joins us from Otokumpu Oy where he's been since 1990 holding senior executive positions responsible for, among other things, the development of the $600 million dollar Zaldivar mine and processing plant in Chile which is a 50/50 joint venture between Otokumpu Oy and Placer Dome. Prior to that he too spent time with RTZ, joining RTZ Metals Europe in 1975 as Group Technical Director where he was responsible for, among other things, the recommissioning of the Weeljame tin mine in Cornwall. Technical representation on the $400 million dollar Neves Corvo copper-tin mine where he met David and Cliff, and then after as senior consulting metallurgist on a variety of RTZ European projects. Of course that gives Ken tremendous knowledge and experience in dealing with Europe and as Senior Vice-President of European Operations. I'd now like to turn it over to David Murray to take you through a presentation and then at the end, of course, we'll take questions. Thank you. MURRAY: Thank you John. I look forward to meeting with some of you over the next few days and few months. The presentation that we have organized today starts with some overall comments from me, some comments of my ideas on operating and project philosophies, and then I will review South American operating investments. Cliff Davis will then talk in terms of North American operations and projects, and as John has said that includes our project in Russia. Albrecht Schneider will specifically talk about the Skouries drill results announced last night. Ken Sangster will then talk in terms of the European projects that we have under development. And Eike Batista will then summarize for you. The new operating team came in to place effectively in the third quarter of this year. Subsequent to that, between us, we have reviewed and visited all TVX operations and projects and our initial assessment in simple terms is as follows: firstly TVX has strong skills in securing deals; secondly, we believe that the operating structures and procedures need improvement; thirdly, the South American operating investments are solid; fourthly, as a general comment, the North American operating investments are under-developed, however, the North American projects are promising; and lastly, the European projects have a very strong resource base which you will see are certainly strong enough to more than double TVX output over the next five years. The generalized comments that I have in terms of operating and project philosophies are very simple. First of all, our structures need to be defined better than they are today - responsibility, accountability, and authority. We need improved procedures in terms of how we look at new investments of capital expenditure, we need a more rational view in terms of personnel, and we need to improve our purchasing procedures. In my experience, and coming from a relatively developed company like RTZ, I am a very strong believer in operating management with a key executive led by a general manager of the mine. The head office role is to support the general manager with as few staff as possible. In so far as running projects are concerned, again one needs simple structures. It is extremely important that the owner maintains control of the flash heat permanently. However, I also believe that the owner should supervise an EPC or EPCM contractor and I do not believe in TVX running a project organization of its own. Those are very simple directives. Turning now to our operating investments in South America. The three investments have two common features. First of all they all have reserves in excess of ten years. Secondly, each of the three are managed by reputable companies. Turning to La Coipa, owned 50 percent by Placer Dome and 50 percent by TVX, we shall in the future be faced with declining gold grades. However, this is offset by the fact that La Coipa is now debt free and of course La Coipa has the Chimberos silver deposit which will be of high significance over the next three to four years and which you may well be aware of, we are doing feasibility studies on at the present time. Turning now to Brazil. The Crixas mine is 50 percent owned by Anglo-American and 50 percent by TVX. It has been and will continue to be a reliable and consistent producer. There is expansion potential available and that is under discussion with our partners at the present time. We also have the Brasilia mine, 51 percent owned by RTZ and 33 percent by TVX, again, a reliable consistent producer. It is currently under expansion to 18 million tonnes a year and that is scheduled to come into production by the fourth quarter of 1997 or maybe even a little bit earlier. I am quite satisfied that that expansion will occur on time. The attributable production in 1996, estimated in terms of our share of South American production, is approximately 320,000 to 325,000 ounces at a cash cost around something in the order of $190.00. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a solid operating base. I now turn you to Cliff Davis who will talk about our North American operations and projects. DAVIS: Thank you David. Good morning. I'll start with the operation which is my primary concern at the moment, that's Casa Berardi. Casa Berardi in Quebec is an underground gold operation. We have made some progress there this year. Operating costs are reducing significantly compared with where they started at the beginning of the year. However, we have continuing problems in terms of production of gold. It's very variable, varies month by month from satisfactory to unsatisfactory largely as a result of inflexibility because of inadequately developed reserves. The future production of Casa Berardi depends very much on the development of the Principale Zone and between the East and the West mines which is where production is coming from at present. We've been looking at the development of the Principale and it is apparent that we cannot bring that into production for between one to one and a half years from now. This leaves us with a number of alternatives for Casa Berardi and we are looking at all of those alternatives, we're discussing them with our partners. The key alternatives under consideration at the moment are to continue the operation at a reduced throughput mining only the remnant ore reserves of the East and the West mine. The second alternative is to continue doing that and at the same time develop in the next year to year and a half the Principale Zone and then bring production up based on those reserves. A third alternative being considered is to close the operation down and thoroughly explore the total land package which is a very large land package. And our last alternative is to sell the operation. We are considering all those alternatives. We are discussing them with our partner and we expect to have a decision by the end of this year. Our next operation is the New Britannia underground mine in Snow Lake Manitoba. Considerable progress has been made there this year. We expect to produce 70,000 ounces in 1996 at a cash cost of $310.00 an ounce. For 1997 we're increasing throughput to obtain 85,000 ounces at a cash cost of $275.00 an ounce. Production is steadily improving. Costs are steadily decreasing. And the cost next year will be achieved in spite of the fact that we are going to continue a very high rate of development and a very high rate of underground diamond drilling, both definition drilling and exploration drilling with the aim of increasing the developed reserves until we get to the point where we have at least one year of developed reserves ahead of us. Musselwhite, a project in Ontario which is operated by Placer Dome, is scheduled for an April start up. Musselwhite is approximately one month to six weeks ahead of schedule at present. It is on budget currently and is estimated to be about five million US under a budget of $170 million total. The TVX share of that is $54 million. Annualized production is 200,000 ounces a year with TVX share of 64,000 ounces. Next year we're showing a total production of 144,000 ounces commencing in the beginning of April. The estimated '97 cash cost is $230.00 an ounce. In Russia we have a project which is an advanced stage project, the Asacha project in Kamchatka. Asacha is currently in the middle of a feasibility study being carried on by Davy International here in Toronto. It's a high grade underground deposit, 15 grams a tonne. We believe it has a lot of potential. We expect to have the feasibility study done by the middle of next year. At the same time we should have Russian mine permits in place and we should be in a position to make a product decision at that time. The current activity there is completion of a surface diamond drilling program to firm up reserves and add additional reserves and obviously the feasibility study which I mentioned at the start. And that is a quick summary of North American activities. And on to Albrecht Schneider Exploration Vice-President. SCHNEIDER: At Skouries, which has been one of the main attractions of TVX's Kassandra assets, the company has started a comprehensive drilling program in August which will lead up to December of this year. Skouries is a classic copper-gold porphyry about ten kilometres inland from the Aegean. Company objectives for this year was to drill about 15,000 metres to a maximum depth of 1,000 metres to assess previous information which is composed of 16,000 metres of drilling and 600 metres of underground development by Nippon mining in 1962, Placer Development in 1967, and Kassandra Mines in 1975. The objectives were also to revise ore reserve estimations made by Billiton circa 1980s. Billiton concluded that Skouries has an initial reserve of 72 million tonnes at .45 percent copper and .7 grams per tonne gold. TVX objectives were further to explore deeper into the deposit to establish the size of the gold and copper grade information, establish total resource estimates for gold and copper mining conditions and to initiate metallurgical test work for copper and gold. The current status of the project is as follows. Twelve holes were drilled in the central part of the area. Nine holes were drilled in the southern extension. We will have all 22 holes completed by December 15th. At present we have 4,098 metres analyzed which are the seven holes and the two partial holes given to you with the press release. The preliminary metallurgical test work is completed. We can summarize so far we already had a classic porphyry copper. The volume of known potential ore mineralization extends vertically to 750m. At surface 300 by 250 metres. The opening widens over 500, 400 metres. The full extent of deep level mineralization for both laterally and horizontally are still unknown. The ore is two kinds of ore consisting basically of chalcopyrite-burnite gold with high levels of magnitite. There's also the presence of a shallow copper oxide zone at surface. High copper and gold grades than previously reported were achieved due to the change in drilling methodology and our analytical quality. We have highly consistent gold rates and copper rates over very large intervals. The mean copper rate gold data is 0.64 percent copper and for gold 1.17 grams per tonne gold. Average grades at .25 percent copper and .25 grams of gold give a grade of .75 percent of copper and 1.36 grams of gold, which we reduce the current data base by 15 percent. The high grade ore near surface averages .8 percent copper and 1.5 grams of gold and the project shows a high grade gold zone at depth which is averaging around 1.1 percent copper and 2.2 grams of gold. Furthermore, we can conclude so far that there's large volume at grades of approximately .6 percent copper and 1 gram of gold with potential credits between 1 and 2.5 grams silver and .15 grams palladium. Initial metallurgical results show a good copper concentrate of 30 percent with very good recovery in the order of 92 percent. Gold grade in the concentrate ranges from 1.5 to 3 ounces and it's recovery is 88 percent. In general there are very low impurities associated with this concentrate. I thank you very much. Now Mr. Ken Sangster will continue to speak about our European projects. SANGSTER: Good morning. I'd like to cover the areas in two parts. First of all Kassandra in Greece and then the Czech republic. First of all some highlights from the general situation with regards to Kassandra. Activities during the year were divided into two main parts. Firstly, to put systems in place commensurate with developing large scale projects and secondly a continuation of our drilling program to further define the ore in situ. In 1996, drilling done in the Stratoni Madem Lakkos Mavres Petres areas totalled some 15,000 metres and in Olympias 5,000 metres and I make special note of that because underground drilling has continued all year in Olympias and at Skouries, which Albrecht has just mentioned, some 15,000 metres. I would also like to highlight the issue that there is now a strong central government in place in Athens. There is generally a very positive attitude to investment. If I can now move down and subdivide the Greek operations. Kassandra mines, the Stratoni operations which involve the Stratoni mill and the Madem Lakkos/Mavres Petres mines. During the year the Stratoni mill was refurbished and is now operating at a rate of 250,000 tonnes per annum treating mainly Madem Lakkos ore at grades of around 10 percent zinc, 8 percent lead and 200 grams per tonne silver. These operations at Madem Lakkos/Mavres Petres, we believe, have about four to six years life on current mining reserves. But there are possible expansions including areas of high gold at the Madem Lakkos mines. As I mentioned earlier the Olympias infilled drilling continues to confirm ore resources and grade. We have also been working lately on some process enhancement. We believe the use of heavy media separation can remove up to 40 percent of the concentrate weight at zero gold loss. We're also looking at a biox and partial roast as a pre-treatment to autoclave which allows for a smaller autoclave and a smaller gold plant. And work should carry on in generally improving the environment which will include re-treatment of both the concentrate stock piles and of the original tailings. We're proceeding to work on a bankable document which will be ready by the end of 1997. A word or two about Skouries. Albrecht has already covered that in the geological sense. We believe the drilling will confirm a substantial resource. Processing seems to be relatively simple. The test work done to date yields clean copper concentrate of about 30 percent copper and plus 50 grams per tonne of gold content. Over the next year engineering will be done to determine firstly mining methods, underground and open pit, and also scale of operations. We anticipate having a pre-feasibility study on Skouries completed by the end of 1997. If I can move on to the Czech Republic, I will summarize the work done there this year. The drilling continues to confirm good grades of plus or minus 10 grams per tonne. A good deal of process test work has been evolving over the year and we're now in a position to confirm the economic extraction can be accomplished without the mine site use of cyanide. This revised flow sheet should greatly assist permit application. In summary, what does all this mean. European drill indicated resource potential we believe is roughly the following. At Kasperske Hory around about 3 million ounces. At Olympias 5 and a half million ounces. Madem Lakkos/Mavres Petres 500,000 ounces. At Skouries 10 million ounces. All in all giving a total of European drill indicated resource potential of 19 million ounces. I'd like to pass on to our Chairman, Eike Batista. BATISTA: Ladies and gentlemen good morning. Let me try to summarize TVX's performance during '96. I have six points. The first, in the beginning of the year I told most of you that my main objective was to find a senior Chief Operating Officer. We actually hired a team of three. I acknowledged the need to improve our technical team. We needed a projects and operational group capable of developing and operating properties to international standards. Finding this team was as difficult as finding a new mine. Their past performance and technical credibility speak for itself. I am convinced that TVX is finally in strong technical hands. Second, at the beginning of the year I also said that Kassandra would develop into a big gold camp, a new gold mining district in the world. The numbers are actually surpassing my own rosy glasses estimates. As you just heard, the reserves and resources will support a big, extremely low cash cost production in the near future transforming Kassandra into TVX's 100 percent owned flag ship, and supporting our goal of surpassing the one million ounce per year production by the turn of the century. Third, please do not forget that Kassandra is Europe, yes Europe. Not Kinshasa, Bangladesh or Jakarta. After landing in Frankfurt you take a two hour flight to Thessaloniki which is Greece's second largest city. An hour later, by car, you're at the mine site. Kassandra is already a running operation with in excess of 600 miners that are being retrained. It will be producing an estimate of $25 million dollars in revenues for TVX in '97. The deal making negotiations team of TVX has handed the property to the operations team. From now on it is on standard procedural operational mode. Like any mine located anywhere in the world in a very, very civilized place. Greece, as you heard before, has a strong central government for the next four years that fully supports the project. I want to remind you that in the early days when I started with the company Chile had problems of perception, Brazil, the whole of the South American continent. It's time for people to understand that Kassandra is part of Europe and I'm convinced that the visit that we are scheduling for the property, actually scheduled for the 12th of January, will only confirm what I'm just saying. Fourth, something to think about. How much is our 19 million ounces in resources in Europe worth, given that they are backed up by more than 140,000 metres of drilling and are extremely high grade. Low cost in production is assumable. If approximately $850 million dollars US was paid for Arequipa in Peru. Fifth, gold price. Well to hedge, TVX's hedge is really the fact that all of the new production is going to be extremely low cash cost. So TVX will have growth and TVX will have low cost. Six and last. Although we concentrated most of our efforts this year in developing existing assets which are big we haven't lost our deal making capabilities. We are as dynamic and alert as always and as you know we only bought and will buy value. Thank you. HICK: Ladies and gentlemen we'll now open up for questions and I believe you all know how this works and the operator will field the questions so, the first question please. OPERATOR: Thank you. We will poll for questions today using our quick cue polling feature. If you have a question please press star and one on your touchtone telephone. If you're using a speaker phone you may need to lift your handset first and then press star one. Should you wish to cancel your question please press star followed by the number sign but please do not hang up. We will poll for questions in the order of request. Please press star and one at this time if you have a question. The first question comes from Mark DeFranco from Pomboy Capital. Please go ahead sir. DeFRANCO: Hi Eike the results look pretty robust to say the least. A question for you, if I try to put some numbers around Skouries, if based on your drill results you've got .75 percent copper 1.36 grams gold, if I use rock value of roughly $32.00 gross. Plugging that into a net smelter model given what Albrecht had said of how the concentrate looked and so forth you should net out of that $32.00 per tonne about $20.00 a tonne. If I subtract out a mining cost of call it $10.00 a tonne, pre-tax to you should be a margin of $10.00 per tonne. Now based on your potential there you're talking north of 200 million tonnes I would take it. I mean this right alone is worth more than your market cap. BATISTA: Yes. Absolutely. You're correct. DeFRANCO: Are the numbers per tonne roughly feasible? BATISTA: Ten dollars per tonne cost? DeFRANCO: Net to you, right. BATISTA: Ken please. SANGSTER: Yes. Ten dollars, yes. DeFRANCO: So why are you still trading at $7.00 a share? SANGSTER: I think actually we haven't really talked to the market since the beginning of the year and as I said before, I mean TVX concentrated in getting a technical team into the company and we're working hard. We drilled more than 50,000 metres in Europe and that's what, as I said before, it's substantiated this resource base with high grade and we're announcing it now. And I wanted, actually, the new technical team to revise our operations because I had doubts about our past technical team. So we needed to do that homework. Now we're ready and we're informing it to you. DeFRANCO: The numbers look great. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dalton Ferris from Carriage House Investors. Please go ahead. FERRIS: Yes, hello. I guess my comment is I'm just a private investor and what I continually see in the press is sort of some sort of negative news about TVX and you guys scurrying around sending out faxes trying to patch it up. So, I think that's what's causing the share value to be what it is. I think somehow you've got to get ahead of that. HICK: It's John Hick. Perhaps a comment on that. Particularly when you're dealing in foreign countries, and I'm thinking for example Greece and the Czech Republic where a lot of that negative publicity has come out, unfortunately we cannot control the local press. We spend a lot of time, effort and money dealing with public relations and informing the local people both at the government levels right down to the man at the street. But you're dealing with, in some cases, people that don't understand mining and unfortunately it's no different there than it is here. The bad news gets the press, the big negative stories about cyanide and pollution get the press and people don't want to hear too much about reality. We're working to change that. I think Greece is a good example of that. If you look at the general press reporting in Greece today I think you see some very good reporting. People now understand what we're doing. There's still going to be negative press. There's always going to be negative press. You can't please everybody. But I understand your concern. It's a concern that we're continually addressing as best we can. But we're confident we can do it right. We know we can. We say that. We're always prepared to talk to people about that but it takes time for them to understand. FERRIS: Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question comes from Alvaro Cattao from AGX. Please go ahead. CATTAO: Yes. My question is with the grade that you gave us on the press release, what are the approximate cash costs in dollars per ounce of gold considering the gold or the gold equivalent with copper? MURRAY: This is David Murray here. I think you need to start off from the basis that Albrecht has already told us that the initial resource estimates will be available towards the end of January. I think it's extremely difficult for me to give you an answer to that question without a resource estimate and without conceptual engineering. And I really believe that your guess is as good as mine. But I must say I'm pretty positive about it. CATTAO: Okay. Thank you very much. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question comes from Don McLean from Nesbitt Burns. Please go ahead. McLEAN: Good morning gentlemen. A couple of questions. Albrecht you went through on the Skouries, the copper recovery I missed. You said 88 percent on the gold. SCHNEIDER: Ninety-two percent Don. Ninety-two on the copper. McLEAN: Okay. And you had clean cons. SCHNEIDER: Yes. McLEAN: Okay. Any sense of what a strip ratio might be so we can start putting together our own estimates? SCHNEIDER: I'll hand over this to Ken. SANGSTER: Between two and three. McLEAN: That was on the Skouries deposit. Thank you. Cliff on Casa Berardi you went through basically a full spectrum of different possibilities. Can you give us a sense as to the possibility of closure, what probability might you attach at this early stage of this evaluation to that possibility? DAVIS: I wouldn't like to put a finger on it Don. It is one of the three or four alternatives we are strongly considering. The final decision is going to be made by the end of the year. Obviously in conjunction with our partners. And I wouldn't like to say anything more than that. McLEAN: Then maybe I can ask the question a little bit differently. You were saying that the operating costs have dropped but you're still having some, I guess, continuity problems in terms of the variability of production. Do you see that within the next year and a half that's going to be something that's just going to carry on and what kind of an operating cost would that translate through to in that timeframe? DAVIS: Yeah. That's the problem we've got. We have inflexibility of operation because we don't have enough developed stopes in the remnants of the East and West mine. That won't change until we've got some additional reserves developed. The best opportunity is probably the Principale Zone. That's a year and a half away so we're going to be left with the situation we've got now for at least a year and a half if we continue operations. Operating costs are currently in the mid to high $300.00 an ounce and we don't see that changing in the short term. McLEAN: Okay. Thank you. That helps, Cliff. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question is from Chris Bradbrook from Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon. Please go ahead. BRADBROOK: Yeah, good morning. Could you maybe give us some idea of what sort of production rate you anticipate at Skouries, and also the timing of potential production at both Skouries and Kassandra. MURRAY: Thank you. This is David Murray again. I will repeat my caution that was given to you before. We need to complete the overall initial resource estimate in January. We need to do conceptual engineering in terms of mining methods. We need to do engineering in terms of scale and I really believe that it's far better that you look at the overall resource and then make your own conclusions. Our conclusions are obviously going to be positive but I would rather wait until we do some proper engineering on it. Thank you. BRADBROOK: Okay. But no estimates on the timing? MURRAY: The timing, your guess is as good as mine. What we are looking for is a pre-feasibility during the course of next year. That will be followed by feasibility documents acceptable to banks and then construction. The construction period in terms of a plant operation like this is relatively simple. BRADBROOK: Okay. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Mark Burridge from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. BURRIDGE: Good day gentlemen. Pleasure to meet your new team. I've got a question and I apologize if this has already been asked or answered because I wasn't on the call, and that is you talked a lot about your operations development. How about your exploration projects internationally? The one that springs to mind right now is Gurupi and I was wondering if you could give an overview of that and your exploration strategy over the next few years. BATISTA: Albrecht. SCHNEIDER: In Brazil at present we are running two major ventures. One is Gurupi as you just said together with Sante Fe our partner. Santa Fe is presently preparing pre-feasibility information which by April next year will put us in the position to review our strategy for the future on how we will proceed at Gurupi. Gurupi is a large low grade deposit within the Amazon region. We have a second project together with Battle Mountain called Volta Grande do Xingu on the Xingu River. It has currently the resource potential in the order of two million ounces and we are preparing for next year's drilling program to define this area further. This area is just one in a very large sector. Apart from Brazil, we are currently very active in Ecuador in a joint venture with Newmont and Cogema in a very interesting epi-thermal low grade oxide gold deposit and we are also active in Nicaragua in a joint venture with our partner, Triton. In Nicaragua we are exploring a gold structure which was previously operated successfully by Noranda. We are very positive about the current results in Nicaragua. So basically our exploration strategy in this year and the future will be concentrating on our joint ventures and also evaluating constantly upcoming possibilities. We have also an exploration interest in our lease in Greece. We also concentrate in Russia in additional areas around our current mine claims. Thank you. BURRIDGE: Okay. Thank you very much. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. John Bridges from Flemings. Please go ahead sir. BRIDGES: Hi Eike. Congratulations on the progress. I just wondered perhaps one question on Skouries, the latest drill results, how do they compare with the work done by Billiton, better/worse... SCHNEIDER: The drill results done by Placer Dome and Nippon Mining were conducted in the early 60s in a period where gold was sitting around $50.00, the copper price was sitting around 35 cents. The gold levels were established a different way. Another major difference is that the drilling was vertical and the deposit geography shows vertical structures so the drilling was basically down deep. We have changed this. We're drilling now two structures. This gives much better average information about deposits and both sectors are resulting in higher grades of gold and copper. BRIDGES: Okay. Great. You talk about a higher low grade zone and a deeper high grade zone. What's the cut-off? How deep do you have to go before you get into the better grade stuff? SCHNEIDER: At Skouries the central part is mineralized throughout so there's no real low grade zone. The higher grade zone at surface indicates the possibility of a very effective open pit scenario where you have grades averaging 1.5 grams of gold and about 0.8 percent copper. This in the area of about 300 metres to about 500 metres. Here grades can go up in gold over 200 metres with 2.7 grams and 1.44 percent copper. BRIDGES: Okay. Great. And now perhaps La Coipa, the Chimberos silver rich project. Would that simply be replacement of other reserves or would you be perhaps increasing the scale of the operation down there? MURRAY: David Murray here. Those alternatives, in fact, are under discussion with Placer and I would assume that we will come to a conclusion on how to economically exploit it during the course of the next year. BRIDGES: Okay. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Paul Carmel from Bunting Warburg. Please go ahead. CARMEL: Good afternoon. David, you mentioned the possibility of declining grades at La Coipa. Could you give me an idea as to what these grades might be looking like in the next two to three years - gold head grades and silver head grades. A second quick question is on Casa Berardi. I'm just wondering about Principale. It seems to me there's been sort of an optimization program going on up there for a couple of years now. I'm just wondering why we're still sort of a year and a half away from accessing the Principale deposit. Cliff maybe you could touch on that? DAVIS: It's Cliff Davis. I'll answer that question first. The work that's been done wasn't solely to access Principale. It was a development program as it was called to link the East and the West mine at depth and put a shaft in at the east end of the mine. It was not only to provide bottom access to Principale but also to provide access for exploration throughout the strike length. It didn't, of itself, develop Principale. If you were doing it again, if I were to sit here now and say well would I do the Principale in conjunction with providing that access development I would state that development itself should have been going on at the same time. The method chosen of development didn't really lend itself to doing that development concurrently so unfortunately we're left here now with while we have access at the bottom we don't have sufficient ore that's developed. That still has to be done. MURRAY: This is David. Back to La Coipa. The silver grades that we're looking at in terms of the current mines continue much the same at the moment. The gold grades probably will be dropping in the region of 15 percent or something like that. However, one needs to add on top of that in fact the potential extraction of Chimberos, which is, as I've said before, not yet determined. CARMEL: Okay. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Bill Otton from Beutel Goodman. Please go ahead. OTTON: Hi. Albrecht, I know it's difficult to do over the phone but I'm just having trouble understanding the geometry and the high grade and lower grade zones of the Skouries deposit. If I can read off numbers that as I understood initially, I understand that the surface expression of the outcrop is about 300 by 250 metres? SCHNEIDER: This information has been known by us from the previous owners and previous people who drilled there to a depth extend over 400 to approximately 550 to 600 metres. It has always been known that this is a rather vertical pipe. But in our drilling now we constantly record on the lateral wall rock zones and how they would compare with the pipe and what would really happened there. Drilling in outer zones we saw a continuation of mineralization in the wall rocks which could not really be associated easily with the centre of height. For that reason there is a strong indications now that there is a major source at depth which generated some other large mineralized zones which was later on dissected by secondary inclusion which is this pipe which re-enriched surface part of the deposit and enrich the centre core. We have also depleted core beyond the centre core. OTTON: Okay. But just for the drilling that you've done, the area that you've investigated, the pipe area, would it be, is it fair to say that the sort of surface expression of that is about 300 by 250 metres? SCHNEIDER: Yes. OTTON: And then it continues down about 300, 400 metres deep? SCHNEIDER: It continues to about 350 metres deep and then it opens up to the shape of a flask. OTTON: Right. Okay. And the aerial, if you took a slice at say 350 metres, a horizontal slice, that area might be 400 by 500 metres, something like that? SCHNEIDER: This is what we're currently thinking of. OTTON: Right. And then the total vertical extent of that flask is at least 750 metres. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. I think 750 metres is again the figure which we are dealing with at the moment. OTTON: Okay. Does anybody there have any idea how deep you could go on an open pit with these kind of grades and this kind of structure, sort of a vertical structure like that? SANGSTER: It's Ken Sangster here. No, not really. As David said we're just embarking on pre-feasibility. We've got no geo-technical information as such. During the course of the pre-feasibility study, that will be one of the things that we need to look at, both in the extraction method and scales. As to the best possible depth for open pit I couldn't really answer that at the moment. OTTON: Okay. Thanks very much. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question comes from Barry Allan from Gordon Capital. Please go ahead. ALLEN: Good afternoon gentlemen. I apologize if I missed it, but could you just sort of flesh out where the construction of the autoclave at Kassandra lies and what the time table is for completion there? SANGSTER: Yes. Ken Sangster here again. The situation is at the moment that we're now doing surface drilling. We've been doing underground drilling all year to try and get about 70 percent of the reserve into proven and probable category. We're also using that program to gather samples and prove our process flow sheet. There has been considerable work done on designing an autoclave and we feel very happy that all of the parameters have been covered. The area we're looking at at the moment actually is trying to do some pre-treatment before the autoclave, trying to get more work done on the concentrator so that we get a more selective number for the autoclave to reduce its size and adjust the oxygen demand, etcetera. All of this, again, will come out during this year when we produce a bankable document. ALLEN: And how long would the construction period be potentially after the bankable document? SANGSTER: We're looking at 24 months at present. ALLEN: Okay. And just briefly, Pachicutza, what's the status of that project now? SCHNEIDER: Pachicutza, we have had a feasibility study done on Pachicutza. It could become a 45,000 ounce producer at a cash cost of $190.00, but in the context of our operations it's probably a property that we will dispose of. ALLEN: Alright. Thank you gentlemen. OPERATOR: Thank you. At this time I would like to remind everyone if you do have a further question please press star and one on your touchtone telephone at this time. We do have a further question from John Bridges from Flemings. Please go ahead sir. BRIDGES: In order to get some sort of strip ratio if you could give me some indication as to what sort of slope angle the rocks around the Skouries deposit would take? MURRAY: As I say we've really very little new technical information. There's a surface expression there obviously and there's a tunnel that was done by Placer and Nippon. The rock quality looks reasonably high. But slope angle will not be defined until we get engineering work completed. BRIDGES: Okay. I just wanted to know sort of order of magnitude. That's all, that's fine. On the concentrate, you were saying it's generally good. Any impurities at all, anything that's going to affect the price a smelter would pay? MURRAY: No. On the tests that we've done at the moment it's extremely low levels of impurities. It was very clean. I mean on the metallurgy we've done minerals are not present so you wouldn't expect them in the concentrate. BRIDGES: Okay. You said something about palladium in the ore? SCHNEIDER: Yes. We reviewed scientific literature on and determined that Skouries has been known to be a platinum minerals carrier and basically there's a very low level but it's an interesting scientific peculiarity in the ore. BRIDGES: Would that be recoverable? MURRAY: It would be recoverable but I doubt it will be sufficient to reach payable levels. BRIDGES: Okay. Thank you very much. OPERATOR: Thank you. We have a further question from Bill Otton from Beutel Goodman. Please go ahead. OTTON: Hi. Just quickly on Kasperske Hory. Can you give us an idea as to the timing for production and the production rate and what sort of processing method you're going to be using if you're not using any cyanide. MURRAY: Yes. The drill program at Kasperske Hory which is ongoing is concentrating on the western extension. On the samples that we've dealt with so far which are in the central zone, the technology we're looking at is really rather simple. It's a mixture of gravity and flotation. The gold tends to be either relatively free and quite course or relatively fine but lots of sulphide, a combination of both methods gives good recovery in the order of 90 percent and a concentrate around about ten ounces per tonne. And in terms of time scale, if you were to build that sort of operation it's obviously a simple construction program than if you were building a full scale gold extraction plant. You'd be looking at about an 18 month construction period. OTTON: And when would you expect that to be in production? MURRAY: We're in the process of starting a pre-feasibility study now. We then have to take that on with all the extra drilling to a full feasibility study. I would think that you're looking at about a two year program in that and then of course you have to get all the permits and approvals. So you're looking at about a two year program to a bankable document situation. OTTON: Okay. And would you have anything in mind as far as production rate goes given a three million ounce resource right now? MURRAY: Well it depends very much on the geometry. I mean until we do the drilling and get the geometry of that ore body, the constraint is probably a mining and available space problem. But a rough idea would be half a million tonnes a year. OTTON: Okay. And where would you be processing the concentrate? MURRAY: I'm not sure at the moment and until we get enough test work done to get a firm handle on how that concentrate would behave and sort of variable it it's likely to be in a mixture of probably leeching it could be even smelting in which case you could sell it to a major smelting organization. OTTON: Right. Okay, thanks very much. OPERATOR: Thank you. And the next question come from Mr. Robert Rossetti from Dean Witter. Please go ahead. ROSSETTI: Hi. Are you, do you have any plans for further write-offs for the Mineral Hill property and are there any write-offs planned for Casa Berardi? BERTO: This is Rogerio Berto here. As Cliff said we're still studying the Casa Berardi situation. We will review the final documentation when it is presented by the technical people and assess the best alternative. With regards to Mineral Hill, it was written off in the third quarter. ROSSETTI: Okay. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question comes from David Mallalieu from Nesbitt Burns. Please go ahead. MALLALIEU: Hi. Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could tell me what you're looking forward to if the Principale Zone goes ahead for future capital costs on that project and could you give a brief description of what you are actually looking for with regards to potential reserves at La India? MURRAY: Principale would appear to require in the order of, depending on the method of development of Principale, somewhere in the order of $20 million to $25 million Canadian to develop the reserve for mining. MALLALIEU: And would there be a, would you have in mind a specific production rate associated with that? MURRAY: We think the Principale Zone can probably provide about 1,000 tonnes a day, about 60 percent of the mill feed. SCHNEIDER: In La India the current resource potential was set by Russian development agencies. They calculated 2.4 million ounces. Our initial reviews demonstrate there should be at least a possibility to convert more than 50 percent of this number into initial reserves. MALLALIEU: And what is your program now for actually translating that into the mineable category? SCHNEIDER: At the moment we are drilling to define this resource and we are planning to increase our drilling rate until the end of April or beginning of May in order to have a full picture of the resource estimates for late 1997. MALLALIEU: That would be considered an underground mine? SCHNEIDER: This would of course be an underground mine, yes. MALLALIEU: Okay. Thank you very much. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question comes from Don McLean from Nesbitt Burns. Please go ahead. McLEAN: Just a couple more questions. Looking at the Kassandra processing plant what would be your sense of how the operating costs could go compared to what was used in the initial numbers that were given to us Ken? Do you feel that the initial numbers are still numbers we should be working with or should we be thinking of capital operating costs higher or lower? That was one question. SANGSTER: Okay. I think if we are successful and we've already got to the pilot stage on heavy media separation, you're looking at 40 percent of the feed weight being rejected. So this obviously means that your concentrator will be smaller, sort of for the run of mine tonnage and we're also looking at ways of enhancing the grade of gold into the concentrate feed or the residue feed in this case with all the weight being taken out at the feed end to the gold extraction unit. So, yes, you are looking at somewhat lower capital costs and we believe with high grade feed lower operating costs can be achieved. McLEAN: Right. Okay. One other thing. Ken if you could just re-run through the breakdown of your 19 million ounce European resource again just to make sure I've got the right numbers. SANGSTER: Yes. At Kasperske Hory we have a drill indicated potential of about three million ounces. Olympias is five and a half million ounces. Madem Lakkos Mavres Petres point five or five-hundred thousand, and Skouries at ten million ounces. Now we've done the Skouries drill indicated resource calculation based on current information using copper equivalents but using 65 cents per pound of contained copper. In other words counting the NSR. McLEAN: If you broke it into the gold only part of the ten million ounces what would that be Ken? SANGSTER: About seven and a half million ounces. McLEAN: Great. The book value for Casa Berardi Rogerio can you give me that too, please? ROGERIO: The book value as of September '96 is about $55 million US in our books. McLEAN: Thank you. Thanks gentlemen. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Carmel from Bunting Warburg. Please go ahead. PAUL: I read somewhere that there's a state archeological institute in Greece that has to sign off on any development decision on Kassandra? Is there any truth to that and if there is does it concern you and how does it sort of play in with your program there? HICK: Paul it's John Hick. First of all in Greece the study of antiquities is extremely important and the Ministry of Culture is in charge of looking at antiquities in Greece. Every time you do something in Greece they are involved. They are involved in the following way. If antiquities are known to be in an area then they get involved in the project. If antiquities are discovered then they are entitled to be notified and to look at it. They then examine the antiquities and the level of examination depends on the facts and then they make a determination one of two ways. They either decide that although there may be antiquities relative to whatever that particular project might be it's not, if you will, important enough to override the project. If they feel that the antiquities are important enough then they can be involved and you may have to make alterations in your project to allow for those antiquities to be looked at from an archeology extent. That's the law of Greece. It's there. It's always been there and we will comply with it. On the Kassandra claims, if you will, or concessions, back in the '70's I guess, when they looked at putting an autoclave in before, this was by the Greeks, they had the Ministry look at the claims and they made a determination at that time that there was nothing of significant importance from an archeological point of view. So that's the current situation. They will look at things and if things are found then we'll deal with that on a case by case basis. But no, it's not something that is of great concern to us. It's the normal procedures. CARMEL: I guess maybe worst case scenario your plant gets delayed. HICK: No. I don't see that it delays anything, Paul, because there is an existing plant there. There's an existing mine and an existing mill. The way the law works, they're not going to come in and say we think we've now got to take that back because we now decide something is there. The issue that it relates to is where do you place the new gold plants. And we have a study going on right now looking at at least, I believe, half a dozen locations for the gold plants. One of the factors that you will look at is whether there is any possibility of the archeological issues taking place. So I don't think it will delay anything. It's just part of the study for the appropriate plants. CARMEL: Olympias is an underground operation. Now Skouries is going to be a big pit. What's been done on that in terms of sort of condemnation work? HICK: Well again, very little has been done but the whole Kassandra area has been deemed not to be of significance and we're not aware of any, if you will, historical work that shows any possibility there. But the same thing applies. But we don't see it as an area of concern. CARMEL: Okay. Thanks John. OPERATOR: Thank you. At this time we only have time for one more question. And we have a further question from Dalton Ferris from Carriage House Investors. Please go ahead. FERRIS: What do you expect your gold and gold equivalent production to be in ounces in 1997? SCHNEIDER: Our projection for 1997 production will be in the range of 400,000 ounces. FERRIS: Is that a lot lower than it was several months ago? Is it a rolling forecast? SCHNEIDER: We estimated for 1996 420,000 ounces and we're going to be in the range of 400,000 in 1997 so there's no big change. The total production is basically the same. FERRIS: Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. And at this time I would like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. John Hick. Please go ahead sir. HICK: Thank you. With the end of the questions we'll now close off. We thank you all for participating. We look forward to seeing some of you in person in Toronto this afternoon and New York tomorrow afternoon. Thank you very much. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-145IA048-000845-B039-312http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr120296.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119195644 text/html 7099HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 19:55:44 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Tuesday, 03-Dec-96 14:30:54 GMTContent-length: 6886 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: December 2, 1996 Press Release December 2, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 KASSANDRA MINES UPDATE Toronto, Ontario, December 2, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. is pleased to provide an update on the current status of its drilling campaigns being conducted by its wholly-owned Greek subsidiary, TVX Hellas, at its three existing mines at the Kassandra mines project in Greece and, to announce the initial results of the exploration program at the Skouries copper-gold porphyry deposit, which is part of the Kassandra mines concessions. At the Madem Lakkos mine, which is currently being mined and provides mill feed to the Stratoni mill, a total of 12,102 metres of drilling has been completed to date with assays averaging 8.2% Pb, 13% Zn and 120 g/t Ag. At the Mavres Petres mine, also located near the Stratoni mill, 3,146 metres of drilling have been completed with results to date averaging 7.4% Pb, 9.5% Zn, 213 g/t Ag and 5.1 g/t Au. At the Olympias mine, all work is continuing normally including ore definition drilling being conducted both underground and from surface. The main purpose of this drilling is to provide a complete understanding of the nature of the existing Olympias orebody to assist in preparing the optimal future mine plan. This information is the basis for the finalization of the design of the process recovery flowsheet to recover lead, zinc, silver and gold from the Olympias ore. At Olympias, 166 drill holes totaling 3,235 metres of infill drilling at the main western orebody have been completed. The assay results to date are confirming average grades of 5.5% Pb, 7.7% Zn and 10.4 g/t Au. At the eastern part of the Olympias orebody, approximately 952 metres of drilling has been completed, however, only one assay result is available to date which showed similar base metal and gold values. TVX Hellas commenced drilling of the Skouries deposit in August 1996. It is located within the southwestern portion of the Kassandra Mines claims, approximately 10 kilometres from the Aegean coast, in a sparsely populated area. The exploration program was designed to reassess previous information regarding the deposit and to get a better understanding of the full extent of the mineralization. Detailed exploration work was conducted in the 1960's by Nippon Mining and Placer Development Ltd. and in the mid-1970's by the previous Kassandra mines owners. The information resulting from this previous work formed part of the Kassandra assets. This work included 16,000 metres of drilling and 600 metres of drifting and was concentrated on the central part of the deposit. Initial assessment demonstrated that the deposit extended to a depth of approximately 400 metres. However, a few deeper holes showed interesting potential at greater depth. The current drilling program extends to greater depth than previously explored, going to 1,000 metres in depth, as well as testing lateral extensions. TVX Hellas expects to complete approximately 22 drill holes, totaling 15,000 metres of drilling by mid-December 1996. As of December 1, approximately 90% of the drilling has been completed, while assay results are currently available on the first seven drill holes and parts of the subsequent two. Initial Skouries results are contained in the attached table. The average grade of all assays is 0.64% Cu and 1.17 g/t Au. Excluding approximately 15% of the samples by cutting at < 0.25% Cu and 0.25 g/t Au, the grades increased to 0.75% Cu and 1.36 g/t Au. Results to date reconfirm Skouries as a classic pipe shaped copper-gold porphyry. Drilling shows exceptionally continuous ore grade mineralization over 800 metres in central parts of the pipe; while laterally to the pipe mineralization in schist wallrocks increases from surface to depth from 80,000 m2 to 200,000 m2. It appears that the deposit consists of two higher grade zones: a near surface zone of approximately 0.8% Cu and 1.5 g/t Au and a high grade core zone at depth of approximately 1.1% Cu and 2.2 g/t Au. Complete assay results and an initial resource estimate for Skouries are expected to be available by the end of January, 1997. To date, a total of approximately 35,000 metres of drilling has been conducted on the Kassandra Mines concessions. The results to date are confirming the previous ore reserve information provided by the Greek government and the high quality of the orebodies. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-146IA048-000845-B040-36http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr110896.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119195813 text/html 16227HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 19:57:43 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Friday, 15-Nov-96 14:35:42 GMTContent-length: 16014 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: November 8, 1996 Press Release November 8, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 TVX ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS Toronto, Ontario, November 8, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. reported today that it incurred a net loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996 of US$23.3 million (US$0.14 per share), compared to net earnings US$1.3 million (US$0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 1995. Net loss for the nine month period was US$13.2 million (US$0.08 per share) compared to net earnings of US$9.8 million (US$0.06 per share) in the corresponding 1995 period. During the quarter, the Company, as part of its ongoing review of its global operations, decided to suspend the mining and milling operations at Mineral Hill and place the mine under care and maintenance. As a result, the Company took a US$29 million one-time charge to earnings. This charge was partially offset by gains on the disposition of minority equity investments which were primarily responsible for the other income of US$7.7 million. Gold equivalent production for the three months ended September 30, 1996 was 108,000 ounces (78,800 ounces of gold and 2,224,000 ounces of silver) compared to 94,300 ounces (80,300 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) during the same period in 1995. Year to date production was 320,700 gold equivalent ounces compared to 311,100 gold equivalent ounces in 1995. Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales during the third quarter of 1996 of 92,900 ounces was US$407 per ounce compared to US$383 per ounce on 107,900 gold equivalent ounces sold in the third quarter of 1995. Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the third quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to US$239 from US$218, principally due to the reduction of mill throughput attributed to the hardness of ore encountered at La Coipa, the Company's principal mine and the high cost of production realized at the Mineral Hill mine, which was partially offset by the removal of the contract miners at Brasilia and diminished use of contractors at the Casa Berardi mine.

The first year's exploration programme on the Mamatla property will include airborne geophysics, ground geophysics, soil geochemistry, geological mapping and a minimum of 20,000 metres of drilling at an estimated cost of US$4.9 million with a reserve for additional definition drilling of a further US$2.0 million. The intent of the above-mentioned programme is to investigate, in a systematic fashion, the major structures of the property. The Mamatla Mineral Reserve Project is located in Mexico, crossing the borders of Mexico and Guerrero states, consisting of approximately 20,800 hectares. Work to date has identified silver, gold, zinc, and lead mineralization over a length of 4 kilometres from El Capire to Cruz Blanca. Geological mapping and sampling confirms a possible extension of this mineralization for several kilometres to the northwest. At El Capire, results to date represent a near surface mineralized zone some 30 metres thick along the line of the 800m long cross section of El Capire to Aurora I. One diamond drill hole at Yerba Buena at the south-east end of the extensive five kilometre San Carlos breccia zone indicates a possible second mineralized system. In addition, current exploration work has gone beyond the principal target areas, concentrating on greenfield targets, to determine the presence of anomalies outside the main zone. As part of the arrangements, TVX has been granted a right of first refusal with respect to the Mamatla property. For further information please contact: Investor Services Valerie Gold Resources Ltd.

In response to erroneous press articles regarding TVX Gold Inc.'s Kassandra Project in Greece carried in the October 29 editions of the Financial Times of London and The Financial Post of Toronto, TVX is making the following statement to clarify the current situation. TVX announced on October 22, 1996 that the blockade that had been preventing full access to the Olympias mine at its wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas', Kassandra project in Greece had been lifted. Certain of the communities and residents in the area of the Olympias mine had been blocking full access to the Olympias operations because of their concerns about mining in the area. As a result of negotiations between senior Greek Government representatives and representatives of the said communities, the blockade was lifted. TVX Hellas immediately commenced moving materials and equipment into the site to allow the planned redevelopment and reopening of the mine and mill and to complete the planning for the construction of a gold recovery plant. Since that time, no "further delays" have been experienced. On the contrary, TVX Hellas has enjoyed full access to the Olympias mine and mill facility and the mobilization of equipment and material has been expedited. The Kassandra Mines property, which encompasses approximately 314 square kilometres, was studied by the responsible archeological authorities having jurisdiction at the time that the former owners were considering building a gold plant in the late 1980's and a formal determination was made at that time by the Ministry of Culture stating that the Kassandra site was not of archeological significance. There has been no "discovery of an ancient city" and no official statements of the Archeological Department of the Ministry of Culture have been made to this effect. After discussions with the local archeological authority, TVX Hellas allowed a general surface survey of the property to be made by representatives of the 16th Archeological Department of Greece. "The archeological service neither sought nor obtained a court order". The proposed site of the gold extraction plant has not yet been determined and will not be determined until after the appropriate studies and permit applications are completed. It would, therefore, be impossible to say that anything of archeological significance was "discovered on the proposed site". There is significant archeological interest in the Chalkidiki region, most specifically the site known locally as "Ancient Stagira", which is believed to be the site of the birth place of the philosopher Aristotle. The site, where extensive archeological work continues, is not located within the Kassandra mining property and is not affected in any way by the mining that has been carried on in the Stratoni and Olympias areas for in excess of 20 years. The "Ancient Stagira" site is located on the Aegean Sea, south of the village of Olympiada, north of the town of Stratoni, approximately eight kilometres by road from the Olympias mine. The refurbishment of the existing Olympias mine and mill and the development of a gold plant will be done in accordance with the applicable Greek laws which govern all appropriate criteria, including engineering, construction, environmental and others. If any antiquities are found in the course of any such work, there are specific legal procedures in place in Greece which would pertain. Furthermore, the refurbishment and development of the existing Kassandra mine assets can hardly be described as a "greenfield project". TVX Hellas and TVX Gold have enjoyed the assistance and support of the Government of Greece in resolving the situation at Kassandra and continue to work with the relevant Government ministries. As part of its discussion with the concerned communities, the Government did not "announce an independent inquiry into the TVX concession area". What was agreed was that an independent mining research firm would be involved in evaluating the potential site locations for the gold plant and would make recommendations. This would be the normal procedure that TVX would undertake in any event. TVX regrets that these erroneous articles, which have caused confusion in the marketplace, have detracted from the excellent progress currently being made in Greece. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-149IA048-000845-B041-170http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr102296.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119200408 text/html 3389HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 20:03:10 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:11:50 GMTContent-length: 3175 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: October 22, 1996 Press Release October 22, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 Toronto, Ontario, October 22, 1996 ...

TVX Gold stated that the continued losses and capital expenditures necessary to continue the current operations at Mineral Hill are not justifiable. TVX Mineral Hill will, however, continue the surface drilling program at Crevice Mountain to enable the company to properly assess this resource which may justify mining on this project in the future. For these reasons, the mine, mill and associated facilities are being put on a care and maintenance basis for the time being. The decision to suspend operations at Mineral Hill will result in a charge to third quarter earnings of TVX Gold Inc. of approximately US$29 million ($0.18 a share), including provision for future site reclamation. Production at the mine has decreased as a result of mining lower grade ore and an ongoing shortfall in mill feed from the main Mineral Hill mine. As a result, cash operating costs at the mine have risen to US$535 on a year to date basis. Year to date production amounted to approximately 17,200 ounces of gold. Contributing to these problems have been the delays encountered in the Crevice tunnel drive, principally due to unexpected water inflows. The majority of the current workforce of 138 employees will be laid off. TVX Mineral Hill is working with the employees in respect of the lay off and assisting in outplacement. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-151IA048-000845-B042-37http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr081996.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119200705 text/html 3488HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 20:07:00 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Tuesday, 20-Aug-96 15:02:42 GMTContent-length: 3275 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: August 19, 1996 Press Release August 19, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 Toronto, Ontario, August 19, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. ("TVX") announced today that The Toronto Stock Exchange has accepted TVX's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid for its common shares through the facilities of The Toronto Stock Exchange. On August 20, 1996, TVX may commence making purchases of up to a maximum of 5,000,000 common shares which represents approximately 3.07% of the 162,734,388 issued and outstanding shares of TVX. Any shares acquired will be purchased at the market price for the shares at the time of acquisition. The bid will terminate on the earlier of the date determined by TVX and August 19, 1997. Proceeding with the normal course issuer bid will give TVX the flexibility to purchase its shares if it determines that, as a result of the difference between TVX's view of the fundamental value of the shares and the market price, it is in the best interest of TVX to do so. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-152IA048-000845-B043-143http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr081496.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119201206 text/html 3234HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 20:11:53 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wednesday, 14-Aug-96 22:08:02 GMTContent-length: 3019 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: August 14, 1996 Press Release August 14, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 TVX GOLD INC.

Net earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 1996 were US$3,879,000 (US$0.02 per share), compared to US$2,900,000 (US$0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 1995. Net earnings for the six month period were US$10,174,000 (US$0.06 per share) compared to US$8,490,000 (US$0.05 per share) for the first six months of 1995. During the second quarter, the Company had gains on the disposition of minority equity investments which was primarily responsible for the other income of US$2,400,000 realized in the period. Gold equivalent production for the three months ended June 30, 1996 was 95,400 ounces (76,600 ounces of gold and 1,401,500 ounces of silver) compared to 114,000 ounces (94,400 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) during the same period of 1995. Year to date production was 212,700 gold equivalent ounces compared to 216,800 gold equivalent ounces in 1995. Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 103,200 ounces was US$396 per ounce in the second quarter of 1996 compared to US$383 per ounce on 103,000 gold equivalent ounces sold in the second quarter of 1995. Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the second quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to US$231 from US$207. This increase was due primarily to an ongoing shortfall in tonnage and the milling of lower grade ore at the Mineral Hill mine and a five week shut down of operations at the Casa Berardi mine stemming from a legal strike which was settled on May 27, 1996.

GOLD INC. ANNOUNCES THAT GREEK PARLIAMENT RATIFIES KASSANDRA MINES CONTRACT AND RELATED PROVISIONS Toronto, Ontario, July 31, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. is pleased to announce that the Greek Government bill to ratify the Kassandra Mines purchase contract, including the related articles providing for the ratification of the 35 per cent grants from the Greek State and regulations for the timely issuance of all necessary licenses and permits in connection with the construction and operation of the gold recovery plant for the Kassandra Mines, was today passed by the Greek Parliament and will become law upon normal publication in the Official Gazette. While the main provisions of the purchase contract effecting the legal transfer of the Kassandra Mines assets to TVX Gold Inc.'s wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas A.E., was legally effective without further action upon its signing on December 21, 1995, the Greek Government chose to ratify the entire contract together with the necessary provisions relating to the grants and the permits which did legally require Parliamentary approval. The approval of the bill was supported by the three major political parties: the ruling PASOK party; the official opposition party, New Democracy and the Political Spring party; which collectively represent 97% of the seats in the Greek Parliament. Since the signing of the purchase contract in December 1995, TVX Hellas has been concentrating on the comprehensive review and refurbishment of the existing operations including the Olympias and Stratoni mills, the Olympias, Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres mines and the port facility at Stratoni. A comprehensive environmental review is being undertaken and some remedial work is already underway. The retraining of existing employees is also well advanced. To date, the basic refurbishment and upgrading of the Stratoni mill has been completed with the Madem Lakkos mine currently operating to supply feed to the Stratoni mill. The first shipments of lead/silver and zinc concentrates, respectively, occurred in July. The completion of the Parliamentary approval process will facilitate progress at the Olympias mine and mill complex and work related to the gold recovery plant. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-155IA048-000846-B001-105http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr053196.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119202136 text/html 4733HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 20:21:24 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:30 GMTContent-length: 4521 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: May 31, 1996 Press Release May 31, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 TVX GOLD FURTHER STRENGTHENS ITS SENIOR OPERATING MANAGEMENT TEAM Toronto, Ontario, May 31, 1996 ...

TVX Gold Inc. ("TVX") announced today that it has signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture with Battle Mountain Exploration Company ("BMEC") to explore and develop TVX's Volta Grande gold property located in the state of Para, Brazil. BMEC can acquire a 50% equity interest in the property in consideration of exploration expenditures totalling US$3.5 million until June 1, 1998 and property payments of US$890,000 over the same period. The property, which comprises approximately 15,100 hectares, is located in the Amazon basin of Brazil approximately 460 kilometres southwest of the city of Belem, on the Xingu river. Gold occurrences in the area have been studied and developed by various mining companies from the 1950's up to today. The Volta Grande project is located in the famous Carajas Mineral province, belonging to the Palmeiras Greenstone belt. The shear belt is eight kilometres wide and extends through the property for over 18 kilometres. The joint venture area shows strong intrusive dioritic and tonalitic magmatic activity, associated with intense tectonic hydrothermal phenomena and primary gold occurrences which have been the target of garimpeiro activity. Preliminary exploration initiated by TVX outlined three major targets. These were defined by soil geochemical, auger, channel sampling and initial drilling and showed the following results: A trend in the diorite domain (shear zone) has an extension of 2,500 metres by 1 00 metres wide, with gold values greater than 0.5 g/t in saprolite material which was confirmed by the first 1,000 metres of auger drill sampling. Channel sampling in saprolite gave the following gold values: 1 00 metres/0. 53 g/t; 22 metres/1.23 g/t; 24 metres/1.47 g/t; 19 metres/0.78 g/t. Internal shear veins in the same trend indicate high gold grades suitable for underground mining; varying locally in thickness of 1.0 to 3.0 metres with gold values of 12.0 g/t to three to four ounces per tonne. A greenstone sequence with a soil-geochemical gold and copper anomaly of three kilometres and hosted in metabasalt. Another anomaly of one kilometre length shows more than 100 ppb of gold with channel samples over a 20.0 metres thick sequence averaging 1.28 g/t. A tonalite sequence with multiple shear-related quartz veins. The first three exploratory holes, intercepted 0.65 metres with 13.45 g/t gold; 1.14 metres with 7.99 g/t gold and 2.5 metres with 1.46 g/t gold. As part of the 1996 exploration program, the joint venture will continue with auger drilling on the open-pit targets (saprolite) and with a diamond drilling program of 3,800 metres to define the open pit and underground targets. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-158IA048-000846-B003-185http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr051696-2.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119203146 text/html 10346HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 20:31:07 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:30 GMTContent-length: 10133 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: May 16, 1996 Press Release May 16, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 TVX ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS Toronto, Ontario, May 16, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. announces that net earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 1996 were US$6,295,000 (US$0.04 per share), representing an increase from US$5,590,000 (US$ 0.03 per share) in the first quarter of 1995. During the first quarter of 1996, the Company realized significant gains on the disposition of minority equity investments, the most significant of which was the Gold Reserve shares acquired through the Brisas property settlement. Gold equivalent production was 117,300 ounces (101,500 ounces of gold and 1,131,500 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1996 compared to 102,800 ounces (85,900 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1995. Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 91,400 ounces increased to US$390 per ounce in the first quarter of 1996 compared to US$ 375 per ounce on 101,400 gold equivalent ounces sold in the first quarter of 1995. A significant portion of the difference between ounces produced and ounces sold relates to an increase in inventories at La Coipa. Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis in the first quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to US$230 from US$225 principally due to increased costs at Casa Berardi and Mineral Hill which were partially offset by improvements at La Coipa.

Mr. Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of TVX Gold Inc. is pleased to announce the strengthening of its Senior Operating Management Team with the appointments of Mr. David Murray as President and Chief Operating Officer and Mr. Clifford J. Davis as Senior Vice President, North American Operations. The Company also anticipates the announcement of a third member of this Senior Operating Management Team as Senior Vice President, European Operations, to be made by month end and whose qualifications and mining industry-related experience are in keeping with those hereby announced. David Murray, as President and Chief Operating Officer, brings to TVX Gold Inc. over twenty-five years of mining industry-related experience as well as strong leadership in operations and project management. Prior to joining TVX Gold, Mr. Murray held the position of President and CEO of RTZ Mineracao, the wholly owned Brazilian subsidiary of Rio Tinto Zinc ("RTZ"), whereby he established a long-term relationship with the Corporation through the TVX/RTZ joint venture Paracatu (Bras�lia) mine. He joined the RTZ Group in Zimbabwe in 1970 and has held senior executive positions in England, Wales, Germany, Spain and Portugal. In Portugal, he was responsible for the $400 million development and operation of the Neves Corvo underground copper/tin mine, an achievement for which he was named to the Order of the British Empire. In 1993, he moved to Brazil as President and CEO, RTZ Mineracao, which interests included the $230 million Fortaleza nickel mine and the $65 million expansion of the Bras�lia mine in which TVX has a 33% interest. Clifford Davis, as Senior Vice President, North American Operations, joins TVX Gold from Echo Bay Mines where he held the position of Vice President, Projects since 1992. Mr. Davis joined the RTZ Group in 1979 as General Manager of two underground tin mines in Cornwall, England. In 1985, he moved to Neves Corvo, Portugal as Project Manager and, later, held the position of Production Manager at this large underground copper/tin mine. In 1989, he became General Manager of Kennecott Corporation's Green's Creek lead/zinc/silver/gold mine in Alaska, and later, General Manager of Kennecott's Ridgeway gold mine in South Carolina. In 1992, he returned to Alaska as Vice President, Projects for Echo Bay Mines. Mr. Batista is also pleased to announce that Mr. John Hick will now serve in the capacity of Vice Chairman of the Corporation. The promotion of Mr. Hick and the appointments of the three new senior members of its Operating team (with over 90 years of mining industry-related experience) will strengthen TVX Gold's management as the Corporation continues the successful development of its global assets. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-160IA048-000846-B005-121http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr042296.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119203938 text/html 3420HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 20:38:22 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:30 GMTContent-length: 3208 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: April 22, 1996 Press Release April 22, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 Toronto, Ontario, April 22, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that based on a vote conducted by Casa Berardi Syndicate des Metallos d'Amerique Union members late Friday evening a decision was made to turn down the Company's latest offer, and a legal strike commenced. TVX Gold has been in discussions with Union representatives since December in anticipation of the contract expiration date of March 7, 1996. The parties have been working with a mutually agreed conciliator since mid-March. The Company has suggested a further meeting with Union representatives as soon as the conciliator is available. The Casa Berardi mine is currently not operating and is under the care and maintenance of senior staff. TVX Gold has a 60% interest in Casa Berardi and is the operator. The remaining 40% interest is held by Golden Knight Resources Inc. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-161IA048-000846-B007-235http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr032996.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119204744 text/html 14502HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 20:45:50 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:30 GMTContent-length: 14289 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: March 29, 1996 Press Release March 29, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 TVX GOLD INC. ANNOUNCES 1995 RESULTS Toronto, Ontario, March 29, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that earnings for the year ended December 31, 1995 were US$9,414,000 or US$0.06 per share, which is a decrease from US$22,779,000 or US$0.14 per share earned in 1994. The principal reason for the year over year decrease was lower translation and foreign exchange gains, increased operating costs at Casa Berardi and Bras�lia and higher exploration spending. For the fourth quarter of 1995, losses were US$425,000 compared with earnings of US$3,598,000 or US$0.02 per share in the corresponding 1994 period, primarily as a result of a US$2.1 million write-down of marketable securities. These marketable securities were, however, disposed of subsequent to year end resulting in the Company recovering its original investment. Gold and gold equivalent production was 423,100 ounces in 1995 compared to 436,900 ounces in 1994. In the fourth quarter of 1995, gold and gold equivalent production was 112,000 ounces, compared with 105,700 ounces in the fourth quarter of 1994. Average realized revenue on a per gold equivalent ounce sold basis was US$380 in 1995 compared to US$372 in 1994. In 1995, average cash cost per ounce on a per gold equivalent ounce sold basis was US$219 compared to US$199 in 1994. The increase was primarily due to higher costs and lower production at Casa Berardi and the impact of the appreciation of the Brazilian currency, increasing local costs at our Brazilian mines.

416-941-0119 TVX GOLD ANNOUNCES THE RESUMPTION OF BASE METAL PRODUCTION AT THE STRATONI MILL AT ITS KASSANDRA MINES COMPLEX Toronto, Ontario, March 27, 1996 ... TVX Gold is pleased to announce the resumption of base metal operations at the Stratoni mill. TVX Gold's wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas A.E., purchased the Kassandra Mines assets on December 21, 1995. At that time, all activities were suspended to effect a comprehensive refurbishment of the operations including the Olympias and Stratoni mills and the Olympias, Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres mines and to enable employees to be retrained. TVX Hellas completed the basic refurbishment of its Stratoni mill over the last ten weeks including upgrading the facility, modernizing and enhancing existing flotation cells, updating certain machinery and replacing reagent lines. During this period, employees have been receiving training in modern mining and milling methods, including alternate ground control, and safety techniques and practices consistent with TVX Gold's corporate standards. The Stratoni mill plans to produce a lead-zinc concentrate at a rate of 700 tpd with mill feed from the nearby Madem Lakkos underground mine where mining has recommenced. Initial mill recoveries are approaching approximately 90% with the potential for further improvements based on tests conducted at the Lakefield Research test facility. In keeping with Greek tradition, the Bishop of Chalkidiki christened the facility on its reopening. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-163IA048-000846-B011-7http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr032096.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119210338 text/html 3817HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 21:02:25 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:30 GMTContent-length: 3605 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: March 20, 1996 Press Release March 20, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 TVX ANNOUNCES BRAS�LIA MINE EXPANSION Toronto, Ontario, March 20, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today a US$65 million expansion plan at its 33% owned Bras�lia mine, Brazil's second largest gold producer. The board of directors of the joint venture company operating the mine approved plans to expand the current operation over a two year period with the goal of increasing annual production to 260,000 ounces of gold by 1998. A feasibility study completed in 1995 indicated the viability of increasing production capacity from the current 13.8 mty to 18 mty. The ore to be processed as part of the expansion will continue to include CTB1 ore and a hydrometallurgical plant, the construction of which will commence in June 1996 at a total capital cost of approximately US$45 million, will be used to expand gold output at the mine. As part of the expansion program, eight 85 tonne trucks are currently being utilized to increase efficiencies. Previously, Bras�lia employed a fleet of 20 tonne trucks operated by contractors. Capital expenditures of US$14.1 million were spent to purchase new equipment including three CAT D10-N 530hp bulldozers, three CAT 992-D front end loaders and the eight CAT 777-C 85 tonne trucks. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-164IA048-000846-B012-112http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr031196.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119210902 text/html 6283HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 21:07:32 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:30 GMTContent-length: 6071 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: March 11, 1996 Press Release March 11, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 UPDATE ON STATUS OF KASSANDRA MINES PROJECT Toronto, Ontario, March 11, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that, in connection with its recently acquired Kassandra Mines operations in Greece, it is encouraged by the recent reaffirmation of support by the Greek Government to the successful development and operation of these assets. Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of the Company, stated that "TVX continues to be very excited about the potential of this project and is committed to the successful establishment of a significant gold producing operation; the Company looks forward to working in conjunction with and with the support of the Greek Government to achieve this objective". TVX President John Hick and other Company officials had an extremely positive meeting last Thursday with Greek Development Minister Mrs. Vasso Papandreou and her Deputy Minister Mr. Ioannidis in which concerns relating to delays caused by local protesters at the Olympias mine site and the most appropriate means by which to obtain all requisite development and operating permits and licences were discussed and addressed and the Government's strong support of the project was reaffirmed. After this meeting, representatives of the Ministry reported that "both the Government and the Ministry are resolved to go ahead with the project" and that, with respect to preventing further delays at the Olympias mine site, "measures will be taken against illegal acts and local residents will be briefed, in cooperation with TVX Hellas, that the project is environmentally sound." Local resistance to the reopening of the Olympias mining operations is apparently based on environmental concerns and the potential effect on local tourism. Both TVX and the Government anticipate that this opposition will be eliminated when residents are made more aware of modern environmentally sound operating practices, the positive environmental contribution of the proposed pressure oxidation gold recovery plant and the importance TVX places on environmental issues and its sound environmental operating record internationally. TVX Hellas continues to enjoy local support in the Stratoni region in connection with the reopening of mining activities in that area and mine rehabilitation and initial environmental work is proceeding. In the meeting with the Ministers, a joint task force comprised of representatives of the Ministry and TVX Hellas was established to facilitate and expedite both overcoming the local concerns and the implementation of the mine rehabilitation program and gold plant construction. The Kassandra Mines assets are located on the eastern coastal region on the Chalkidiki Peninsula in northeastern Greece, approximately 110 kilometers east of Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. They encompass mining concessions over a total area of 314 square kilometers and include the Olympias and Stratoni deposits, including three existing producing mines, base metal milling facilities capable of in excess of 3,000 Tpd and a ship loading facility on the Aegean Sea. The Olympias and Stratoni deposits have been mined for the last 30 years, producing lead/silver and zinc concentrates. Indicated current reserves at Kassandra are approximately 14 million tonnes grading 6.3 grams per tonne of gold (approximately 2.8 million ounces), 100 grams pertonne silver (approximately 500,000 ounces of gold equivalent ), 3.6% lead and 4.8% zinc.There is also an existing stockpile of arsenopyrite/pyrite in excess of 200,000 tonnes grading22.65grams per tonne of gold (approximately 145,000 ounces). The gold content of the ore wasnot previously exploited due to its refractory nature. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-165IA049-000847-B020-259http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr011696.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119211554 text/html 3321HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 21:14:11 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:30 GMTContent-length: 3109 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: January 16, 1996 Press Release January 16, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 TVX GOLD ANNOUNCES CLOSING OF US PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF US $150 MILLION OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES Toronto, Ontario, January 16, 1996 ...

TVX announced today that it has completed a successful exploration program encompassing 21,400 metres of drilling and the sampling of 8,100 metres of drifts on its high grade zone of the Pachicutza project in Ecuador, with the following results: GEOLOGICAL RESERVES                      Dry metric      Au     Ag       Au   Au Equiv   Zn     Pb                     tonnes (dmt)   (g/t)  (g/t)  ounces     ounces   (%)    (%)Proven and Probable      657,600    13.6   79.0	 287,400             4.3    0.7Possible Reserves        300,000    12.3   71.5  118,700             4.7   0.44Total                    957,600    13.2  76.60	 406,000    436,800  4.4    0.6 Based on these results, the Board of Directors of TVX approved the next phase of the project which is the construction of a development adit to intersect the mineral structure at the bottom level of the outline reserves. In accordance with the feasibility study already prepared by TVX personnel, these reserves will allow an annual throughput of 180,000 tonnes and will produce at an estimated annual rate of 58,500 ounces of gold equivalent (55,400 ounces of gold; 234,000 ounces of silver) and a Zn - Pb concentrate which will be treated as a by-product. Cash costs are anticipated to be below US$200 per ounce of gold equivalent. The capital cost before production start-up is expected to be approximately US$30 million and the period of construction is targeted to be 18 months. The life expectancy of the mine, based on known reserves, is approximately six years. The recently acquired Novo Astro plant, mining equipment and plant power generator, which will be refurbished in Ecuador, has been dismantled and will be prepared for shipment for use on the project. An underground mine will be developed using the cut and fill method and a plant of 500 tonnes per day will be erected. The mill process to be employed involves crushing, milling, gravimetric concentration and a flotation circuit with a gold recovery rate estimated at 94%. The mineralization occurs as veins and breccias placed in an intrusive volcanic complex of Cretaceous age, which intrude a granite of probably Paleozoic age. These rocks have been faulted heavily which allowed the development of important vein and breccia systems. The veins, with a general strike of N20'W and deeping 750E to 600W, are located in an area of 1,500 x 600 metres. Their horizontal development has been known by the work of informal miners and their extent in depth has been established by an intensive drilling campaign to an average depth of 300 metres. They have an average width of 0.70 metres. The mineralization consists of pyrite and sphaterite with minor quantities of galena, chalcopyrite and a gangue of rodocrocite. The gold is associated principally with pyrite/sphalerite and may be found as free gold. Exploration work done to date indicates reserves are open laterally and at depth and the Company remains confident that further exploration work could delineate additional reserves. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-167IA049-000847-B023-12http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1996/pr011296.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119212719 text/html 4731HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 21:23:55 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:28 GMTContent-length: 4519 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: January 12, 1996 Press Release January 12, 1996 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 TVX GOLD ANNOUNCES SUCCESSFUL RESULTS AT ITS WHOLLY OWNED KASPERSKE HORY PROPERTY IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC Toronto, Ontario, January 12, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. stated today that its previously announced 1995 exploration program at its wholly owned Kasperske Hory property in the Czech Republic, has been successful in increasing its proven, probable and possible reserves to 3,360,000 tonnes, at a grade of 9.27grams/tonne or approximately 1 million ounces. These reserves are included in the Golden Creek block, over a strike length of 1000 metres up to a depth of 350 metres. Approximately 15,000 metres of diamond drilling and 1.5 kilometres of drifting were conducted within this area. Reserves were estimated on 25 to 50 metre sections. Based on this successful exploration program, TVX anticipates commencing a pre-feasibility study in 1996 while continuing exploration work. The Kasperske Hory project is located 160 kilometres southwest of Prague near the town of Kasperske Hory, in the Czech Republic, about 20 kilometres from the border of Germany and situated in the Sumava Mountain Range. The orebody is within an environmental buffer zone adjacent to the northern boundary of the Sumava National Park. Mining on the property has taken place since ancient times. The areas that host the gold mineralization on the property are underlain mainly by west northwesterly striking paragneisses which exhibit moderate dips to the north and northeast. The gold mineralization is largely confined to quartz veins and lenses with subordinate values present in certain sections of the silicified wall rock. Mineralization width ranges between several decimetres to several metres, and the minimum true width taken into account for reserve estimates was 1.5 metres. Individual gold-quartz zones can be traced up to several hundred metres along strike and the total known strike length of the potentially mineralized structures included within the property boundaries is approximately 20 kilometres. Sparse diamond drilling has had positive results along the entire length of the structure. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-168IA049-000847-B023-132http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1995/pr122195.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119212835 text/html 5010HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 21:28:26 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:28 GMTContent-length: 4798 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: December 21, 1995 Press Release December 21, 1995 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 TVX Announces Acquisition of Kassandra Mines Assets Toronto, Ontario, December 21, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that it has completed, through its subsidiary TVX Hellas A.E., the acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. In accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, TVX Gold made an initial payment of 4.5 billion GRD (approximately US$19.5 million) and will make a further payment of approximately 6.7 billion GRD (approximately US$28 million) payable in five equal annual instalments plus interest. In connection with the acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets, and in accordance with the joint decision of the Ministers of National Economy and Industry, Energy and Technology, respectively, TVX will receive grants from the Greek state, amounting to approximately US$69 million based on 35% of the currently estimated eligible capital expenditures. In accordance with Greek law, this decision on the grants must be ratified by the Greek Parliament. To ensure the timely construction of the new plant to enable recovery of the gold, the Greek Government will also submit to Parliament a draft law regulating the issuance of all necessary licenses and permits in connection with the construction and operation of the gold recovery plant for the Kassandra Mines. The Kassandra Mines assets are located on the eastern coastal region on the Chalkidiki Peninsula in northeastern Greece, approximately 110 kilometres east of Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. They encompass mining concessions over a total area of 314 square kilometres and include the Olympias and Stratoni deposits, including three existing producing mines, base metal milling facilities capable of in excess of 3,000 Tpd and a ship loading facility on the Aegean Sea. The Olympias and Stratoni deposits have been mined for the last 30 years, producing lead/silver and zinc concentrates. Indicated current reserves at Kassandra are approximately 14 million tonnes grading 6.3 grams per tonne of gold (approximately 2.8 million ounces), 1 00 grams per tonne silver (approximately 500,000 ounces of gold equivalent), 3.6% lead, and 4.8% zinc. There is also an existing stockpile of arsenopyrite/pyrite in excess of 200,000 tonnes grading 22.65 grams per tonne of gold (approximately 145,000 ounces). The gold content of the ore was not exploited due to its refractory nature. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-169IA049-000847-B027-135http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1995/pr111595.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119214224 text/html 3187HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 21:39:56 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:28 GMTContent-length: 2975 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: November 15, 1995 Press Release November 15, 1995 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 Toronto, Ontario, November 15, 1995 ... An action against TVX Gold Inc. was commenced today by Messrs. Hendrik M. Visagie, David Lean and James Stephenson, relating to the acquisition by TVX of the Kassandra Mines assets. TVX believes that the claims made by the plaintiffs are frivolous and unfounded and the Company will aggressively and vigorously defend this matter.

TVX Gold Inc. and High River Gold Mines Ltd. are pleased to announce the opening of their New Britannia Mine. As part of the opening ceremonies, the Honourable Darren Praznik, Manitoba's Minister of Energy and Mines, officially inaugurated the New Britannia Mine, Manitoba's newest and largest gold mine. The New Britannia Mine, owned 50% each by the operator, TVX Gold Inc., and its joint venture partner, High River Gold Mines Ltd., operates at 1,800 tonnes per day producing approximately 100,000 ounces of gold per year at an expected cash cost of approximately US$210 per ounce. Following completion of a positive feasibility study, construction of the New Britannia Mine commenced in June 1994. Capital costs to bring the mine into operation were approximately US$37 million. Present mineable reserves are 4.2 million tonnes grading 6 grams of gold per tonne. These reserves are estimated to contain 780,000 ounces of gold. The considerable exploration potential of the property at depth and the large land package that the joint venture controls offer considerable potential for future additions to reserves. The development of the New Britannia Mine has been instrumental in the revitalization of the town of Snow Lake. During the construction phase, the mine employed in excess of 300 employees and contractors, over 85% being residents of the Province of Manitoba. The mine will sustain 180 full-time positions in the local community. The joint venture partners wish to express their appreciation to the Province of Manitoba for its support and cooperation. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-171IA049-000847-B028-94http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1995/pr110995.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119214651 text/html 17796HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 21:45:31 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:28 GMTContent-length: 17583 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: November 9, 1995 Press Release November 9, 1995 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 TVX ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS Toronto, Ontario, November 9, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. announces that net earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 1995 were US$1,349,000 (US$0.01 per share), compared to US$13,319,000 (US$0.08 per share) in the third quarter of 1994. Net earnings for the nine month period were US$9,839,000 (US$0.06 per share) compared to US$19,181,000 (US$0.12 per share) in the corresponding 1994 period. In 1994, the higher net earnings for both the first nine months and the third quarter reflect the one time foreign exchange gains which resulted principally from the appreciation of the Brazilian currency, the Real. Gold equivalent production for the three months ended September 30, 1995 was 94,300 ounces (80,300 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) compared to 111,100 ounces (88,900 ounces of gold and 1,604,000 ounces of silver) during the same period in 1994. Year to date production was 311,100 gold equivalent ounces compared to 331,200 gold equivalent ounces in 1994. Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 107,900 ounces was US$383 per ounce in the third quarter of 1995 compared to US$373 per ounce on 96,800 gold equivalent ounces sold in the third quarter of 1994. Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the third quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$218 from US$190, principally due to increased operating costs at certain mines and lower production at the North American operations and La Coipa. However, the improved La Coipa mine results reflect both a draw down in inventories and higher realized revenues. The continued appreciation of the Brazilian currency accounted for higher costs during the period at the Company's Brazilian operations. At Mineral Hill, third quarter production was in line with the comparable 1994 period, while year to date production was lower than 1994 reflecting lower grade as the main orebody reaches the end of its estimated life. The newly identified Ski Slope zone, adjacent to the Mineral Hill orebody, is being developed and will provide continued production until the completion of the Crevice tunnel project. Gold production at Casa Berardi was significantly lower than 1994 levels due to lower than anticipated grade and increased emphasis on development and exploration. The Company expects that increased production levels in the fourth quarter will result in average cash costs in 1995 of approximately US$215 per ounce.

TVX Gold Inc. announces that net earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 1995 were US$2,900,000 (US$0.02 per share), compared to US$2,547,000 (US$0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 1994. Net earnings for the six month period were US$8,490,000 (US$0.05 per share) compared to US$5,862,000 (US$0.04 per share) for the first six months of 1994. Gold equivalent production for the three months ended June 30, 1995 was 114,000 ounces (94,400 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) compared to 112,200 ounces (86,700 ounces of gold and 1,829,000 ounces of silver) during the same period of 1994. Year to date production was 216,800 ounces compared to 222,600 ounces in 1994. Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 103,000 ounces was US$383 per ounce in the second quarter of 1995 compared to US$370 per ounce on 118,000 gold equivalent ounces sold in the second quarter of 1994. Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the second quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$207 from US$192, principally due to decreased grade and tonnage at certain mines. In particular, Mineral Hill faced decreased mill throughput and lower grades, while at Casa Berardi gold production was below plan principally due to lower than planned plant throughput, head grade and planned recovery. The Brazilian operations results reflected a stabilization of the Brazilian currency and local costs, while production at both Bras�lia and Crix�s were as planned. Novo Astro benefitted from higher than planned plant throughput as it reached the end of its mine life. La Coipa posted a strong quarter as it benefitted from higher than planned head grades and recoveries. TVX Gold anticipates that continued improvements in production volume and grade throughout the balance of the year will result in average cash costs for 1995 of approximately US$200 per ounce compared to US$199 per ounce in 1994.

August 3, 1995 Press Release August 3, 1995 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 Toronto, Ontario, August 3, 1995 ... TVX GOLD INC. announced today that it has acquired a 50% interest in the Asacha and Rodnikovoe gold/silver deposits located in South Kamchatka, Russia, through the acquisition of 50% of the outstanding shares of Trevozhnoye Zarevo ("TZ"), a Russian company. TZ holds the licences for the development of these deposits. TVX is entitled immediately to a majority representation on the board of TZ and has the contractual right to increase its interest to 100% subject to compliance with Russian law. Under the terms of the agreement with TZ and its existing shareholders, TVX has advanced US$3,390,000 to TZ to be utilized to satisfy existing obligations of TZ. In order to maintain its 50% interest and to increase its interest, subject to compliance with Russian law, to 100% TVX is required to make instalment payments to TZ totalling US $5,260,000 up to completion of a feasibility study and final permitting, which payments substantially represent obligations under the development licences on these deposits. If commercial production is achieved, the current principals of TZ will be entitled to receive from the project payments totalling US$9,000,000 over the first seven years following commencement of commercial production. TVX has the right to relinquish its interest in TZ at any time with no continuing obligation to fund TZ. The Asacha and Rodnikovoe gold deposits are located in the Southern Kamchatkan gold-silver belt, within 100 and 60 km respectively, of the provincial capital of Petropavlovsk and are accessible by road. The mineralization style is the classic high-grade, bonanza epithermal-vein type, associated with recent volcanism of the circum Pacific region. Preliminary Russian metallurgical work has shown that a substantial amount of the identified reserves are in the nature of free gold and that recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable by gravimetric and normal cyanidation processes. The Kamchatkan regional government released reserve estimates in categories Cl and C2, which are broadly comparable to proven/probable categories under North American standards, for Asacha of 30.37 tons of gold and 58.8 tons of silver at grades of 22 g/t gold and 40 g/t silver and, for Rodnikovoe of 40.39 tons gold at 1 1 g/t and 342.9 tons silver at 98 g/t. Converted to ounces, based on the Russian categories, these deposits would contain 2.28 M/oz gold and 12.9 M/oz silver or a total of 2.45 M/oz of gold equivalent at today's prices. The licence areas cover 40 sq. km. and contain several additional high grade exploration targets not previously explored and which are believed to have a significant potential to substantially increase high grade ore reserves. Due to the substantial amount of work done on these properties and the high grade nature of the ore bodies, TVX anticipates that a feasibility study will be done in 1996. TVX views its interest in Asacha and Rodnikovoe as a first significant step into the former Soviet Union.

An important factor contributing to the increase in net earnings was the result of a gain of $7.5 million on the settlement of the Brisas property lawsuit in Venezuela, which was partially offset by higher cash operating costs and increased exploration spending. Gold equivalent production was 102,800 ounces (85,900 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1995 compared to 110,400 ounces (91,800 ounces of gold and 1,341,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1994. Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 101,400 ounces was US$ 375 per ounce in the first quarter of 1995 compared to US$ 373 per ounce on 96,200 gold equivalent ounces sold in the first quarter of 1994. Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis in the first quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$ 225 from US$193 principally due to decreased grade and tonnage. Higher operating costs at La Coipa, lower grades at Mineral Hill, and decreased mill throughput and lower grades at Casa Berardi were contributing factors to the overall increase in cash costs. The Brazilian operations results reflected an increase in local costs due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency. However, it is anticipated that improvements in production volume and grade throughout the balance of the year will result in average cash costs for 1995 of approximately $200 per ounce compared to $199 per ounce in 1994.

GOLD INC. ANNOUNCES 1994 RESULTS Toronto, Ontario, March 7, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that earnings for the year ended December 31, 1994 were a record US$22,779,000 or US$0.14 per share, which is an increase from US$15,725,000 or US$0.12 per share earned in 1993. For the fourth quarter of 1994, earnings were US$3,598,000 or US$ 0.02 per share compared with earnings of US$4,164,000 or US$ 0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 1993. Gold and gold equivalent production was 436,500 ounces in 1994 compared to 438,800 ounces in 1993. In the fourth quarter of 1994, gold and gold equivalent production was 105,300 ounces, compared with 110,800 ounces in the fourth quarter of 1993. Average realized revenue on a per gold equivalent ounce basis was comparable at US$371 in 1994 and 1993. On a per gold equivalent ounce basis, average cash cost per ounce for 1994 was US$199, compared to US$172 in 1993. The increase was generally due to lower ore grades mined at Mineral Hill, Casa Berardi and La Coipa. Increased exploration and business development spending in 1994 was offset by reduced interest expense, favourable translation and foreign exchange gains and higher interest income earned on cash balances resulting from the issuance of common shares in January 1994. Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of TVX Gold, said the results are indicative of the ability of the Company's management team to recognize and focus on global opportunities. Mr. Batista also commented that TVX is well positioned for continued growth in the future.

March 3, 1995 Press Release March 3, 1995 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 TVX GOLD INC. RECEIVES OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION THAT IT IS THESUCCESSFUL BIDDER FOR THE KASSANDRA MINES ASSETS IN GREECE Toronto, Ontario, March 3, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that it has received formal notification from Ethniki Kephaleou S.A. (the "Liquidator") of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece, that it is the successful bidder for the purchase and development of these assets. In accordance with the terms of the successful bid and requested improvements, TVX Gold proposes to purchase the Kassandra Mines assets for a purchase price of 11 billion GDr (approximately US$47 million at current exchange rates). The purchase price will be payable as follows: 4.5 billion GDr (approximately US$19 million) upon the Closing Date 6.5 billion GDr (approximately US$28 million) in five equal installments of 1.3 billion GDr (approximately US$5.6 million) on each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversary dates of the Closing Date, plus interest thereon. It is anticipated that completion of the formal agreements and the closing of the purchaseof the assets should be concluded by the end of May. The Kassandra Mines assets are located on the eastern coastal region of the Chalkidiki Peninsula in north-eastern Greece, approximately 11 0 km east of Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. They encompass mining concessions over a total area of 314 square kilometres and include the Olympias and Stratoni deposits, including three existing producing mines, base metal milling facilities capable of in excess of 3,000 Tpd and a ship loading facility on the Aegean Sea. These assets are being sold by the Liquidator on behalf of creditors. These operations have been uneconomic in the recent past, due largely to lack of modernization and to the non-availability of capital. The Olympias and Stratoni deposits have been mined for the last 30 years, operating as silver/lead/zinc mines. The gold content of the ore was not exploited due to its refractory nature. Although considerable time and money were spent studying the possibility of introducing a plant to recover the gold, this strategy was never implemented due to insufficient funding. TVX Gold tendered its bid pursuant to a formal auction process conducted by Ethniki Kephaleou S.A. as legal liquidator. TVX had the opportunity to conduct extensive due diligence studies with its own personnel and expert consultants. As a result of this due diligence, TVX Gold is confident that the current silver/lead/zinc operations can be rehabilitated and modernized to achieve an efficient, economic operation. Further, with the introduction of proven pressure oxidation technology, previously tested by Sherritt Gordon and found suitable for the Kassandra refractory ores, the substantial gold potential of the mines can be profitably realized. Studies to date indicate that gold recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable with the proven pressure oxidation technology. Current estimates of the total capital cost for this project are approximately US$180 million, to be spent over the next three years. Of this amount, approximately US$32 million will be spent for the enhancement and modernization of the existing mining and milling operations, including environmental rehabilitation. This will allow the existing silver/lead/zinc operations to be operating efficiently within 6 months of the Closing Date. The balance of the capital of approximately US$148 million relates to the construction and implementation of the gold plant, which is anticipated to commence production at 50% capacity within 24 months of the Closing Date, with full capacity being reached one year later. Due to Greece's membership in and standing with the European Union, there are significant grants available for projects of this type, related to the introduction of new capital and technology, environmental initiatives and employment and retraining. Because of the importance of this project to the Greek State, the Greek government has provided assurances to TVX Gold that all cooperation will be extended to ensure timely issuance of all necessary licenses and project approvals which may be required and the early approval and implementation of the grants to the maximum levels possible. The Kassandra Mines orebodies are massive sulfide replacement deposits within Paleozoic marble units often with schists or gneiss in the hanging wall of the ore. Aplite dikes and sills are abundant in the mineralized zones. Mineralization is zoned with respect to silver/lead/zinc, and gold mineralization. Information regarding existing reserves on the Kassandra properties, supplied by the Liquidator as part of the auction process and reviewed by TVX Gold personnel during their due diligence, indicates current reserves at Kassandra of approximately 14 million tonnes grading 6.3 g/t Au (approximately 2.8 million ounces of Au), 100 g/t Ag (approximately 500,000 ounces of gold equivalent), 3% Pb, and 4% Zn. There is also an existing stockpile of arsenopyrite/pyrite of 250,000 tonnes grading 22.65 g/t Au (approximately 180,000 ounces of Au) and approximately 3 million tonnes of tailings with up to 3 g/t Au (approximately 300,000 ounces of Au). Based on current plans, TVX Gold anticipates that production of gold would commence approximately 24 months after the Closing Date, with the gold plant operating at approximately 50% capacity. TVX Gold expects production in this first year of operation to be in excess of 190,000 ounces of gold equivalent. In the next three years, when the plant is operating at full capacity, gold equivalent production is expected to exceed 300,000 ounces per year, which includes regular production from the existing mines plus treatment of the existing stockpiles and tailings. Thereafter, after the existing concentrate stockpiles are depleted, production would reduce to levels in excess of 180,000 ounces of gold equivalent per year (unless the further potential on the property justifies an expansion). The current mine plan estimates a mine life of approximately 20 years from the startup of the gold plant. Cash operating costs on a gold equivalent basis are anticipated to be less than US$200 per ounce, taking into account lead and zinc credits. Lead and zinc production, which will commence in the first year after closing, is estimated to reach, on an annualized basis, approximately 27,000 tonnes of zinc and 27,000 tonnes of lead, dropping to around 24,000 tonnes of zinc and 21,000 tonnes of lead annually, after six years of production. Based on the existing Kassandra Mines information supplied and due diligence work, there appears to be excellent potential for increases in reserves at the existing operations. Also, there are numerous other mineralized zones already identified on this large property, including two copper/gold porphyries, and a large manganese/gold zone. An extensive exploration program on the property will commence after closing. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-179IA049-000850-B017-275http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/PressReleases/1995/pr021695.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119221848 text/html 3814HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 22:17:25 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:44:28 GMTContent-length: 3602 TVX Gold Inc. - Press Release: February 16, 1995 Press Release February 16, 1995 For Immediate Release Stock Symbol: TVX For further information, please contact: Exchanges: TSE, NYSE, ME Ed Baer, Manager Investor Relations 416-941-0119 Toronto, February 16, 1995 ...

TVX GOLD INC. ("TVX") announces that it has entered into a letter agreement to form a joint venture with SANTA FE PACIFIC GOLD CORPORATION ("Santa Fe", NYSE: GLD) to explore and develop TVX's Gurupi gold property located in the State of Maranh�o, Brazil. Santa Fe can earn a 50% equity interest in the property in consideration of exploration expenditures totalling US$2 million over the next twenty-two months and property payments totalling US$1.8 million over the same period. TVX will contribute additional property payments totalling US$0.6 million. The property, which comprises approximately 31,700 hectares, is located some 350 kilometers south east of the city of Bel�m along the Gurupi river forming the border between the States of Par� and Maranh�o. Gencor's Aurizona Property, soon to be in development, lies 120 kilometers to the north east of the property, in another trend but in a similar geologic setting. Gold occurrences in the area have been known since the early 17th century with the most recent mining and exploration activities occurring in the last fifteen years. The Gurupi shear belt is two kilometers wide and extends through the property for over twenty kilometers. Gold is contained in volcano sedimentary rocks (tuffaceous rocks, graphitic phyllites, and volcanic conglomerates) intensely hydrothermalized and cut by sheared bands, quartz veins and veinlet zones. Two typological deposits are evident in gold works: quartz vein high grade and disseminate low grade. Channel sampling, geochemical sampling and two diamond drill rigs are ongoing on the property. Samples taken along strike over one kilometer of the shear zone in previously mined areas include 17 meters grading 1.75 gpt Au; 1 9 meters grading 1.08 gpt AU; 1 0 meters grading 1.90 gpt Au; and 19 meters grading 1.21 gpt AU - all open on both ends. Grades of 1 meter samples ranged from <0.05 gpt to 9.75 gpt.

TVX GOLD INC. announces that it has increased its interest in the Bras�lia gold mine located in Paracatu, Brazil to 33%. TVX also increased its interest in the Kasperske Hory gold project in the Czech Republic to 100%. APSA, a private company controlled by Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of TVX Gold, has agreed to sell to TVX its 10.3% interest in the Bras�lia mine. The cost of the transaction is US$14 million or approximately US$33 per contained ounce based on current proven and probable reserve estimates. The Bras�lia mine has been in full commercial production since April, 1988, and annual production for 1994 was approximately 168,000 ounces of gold, at a cash cost per ounce of approximately US$196. With respect to the Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic, TVX purchased the remaining 9.5% equity in Bohemia Dulni S.A., the Czech company which owns 1 00% of this gold property. TVX is currently carrying out a US$3 million exploration and development program on the property, consisting of 1,500 metres of drifting and 20,000 metres of drilling. The objective of this exploration program is to prove up to one million ounces of reserves by the end of 1995. As previously announced by officials in Greece, TVX Gold confirms that it submitted a formal bid proposal to purchase and develop the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece, in accordance with the terms of the auction being conducted by the creditors of the bankrupt Greek company which owned these assets. Under the terms of the auction process it is anticipated that a determination of the winning bid will be made by the beginning of March.

TVX Gold Inc announces today that a fatality was sustained at its Deep Development project at the Casa Berardi Mine. Olivier-Levi Gauvin, 52, a miner with 30 years experience was fatally injured at Les Mines Casa Berardi, at 6:15AM, Saturday, January 7, 1995. Mr. Gauvin is survived by his spouse Lucille Whynott Plourde. Mr. Gauvin, a former mining supervisor and instructor, was fatally injured during an underground safety inspection at a drift face in the Deep Development project of the mine. It was determined by the Company's investigation, performed in conjunction with Worker Health & Safety representative of the Joint Occupation Health Committee, that Mr. Gauvin was struck by a second piece of loose that was released as he was scaling a primary target of loose. The accident was witnessed by a fellow miner who is also experienced in this job function. All proper authorities were contacted immediately after the accident and have visited the site. Pending completion of normal investigations, the Company temporarily suspended all work in this heading of the Development project. Regular mining operations at Casa Berardi were not affected and continue normally. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-184IA049-000850-B020-37http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/AnnualReport/1995/CorporateSummary.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119223040 text/html 2687HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 22:30:05 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:37:40 GMTContent-length: 2475 Annual Report - 1995: Corporate Summary Annual Report - 1995 Corporate Summary TVX Gold's portfolio of mining assets includes six existing operations, several advanced stage projects, and the recently acquired Kassandra Mines assets.

The Company increased its interest in the Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic to 100% and anticipates proving up reserves of one million ounces by year end. The 1995 exploration program includes underground development and surface and underground drifting. The Company was named the winning bidder for the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece, proposing to purchase the assets for $46 million. After completion of a new autoclave plant, Kassandra is expected to produce in excess of 300,000 gold equivalent ounces annually in the initial years of full production and 200,000 ounces annually thereafter. Q2 Second Quarter The Company acquired a 50% interest in the Asacha gold-silver deposit located in South Kamchatka, Russia and has the contractual right to increase its interest to 100%, subject to compliance with Russian laws. Preliminary Russian metallurgical work shows that a substantial amount of the identified reserve contains free gold and recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable by gravimetric and normal cyanidation processes. TVX Gold's share of gold equivalent from the La Coipa mine was 55,900 ounces in the second quarter compared to 49,800 ounces in the second quarter of 1994. Cash costs per ounce were $156 compared to $160 for the same period in 1994. Q3 Third Quarter At the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project, the construction of a 45 kilometre all-weather access road was completed while exploration and feasibility studies continued. A production decision was made in the first quarter of 1996. The underground exploration drifting program at the Kasperske Hory project was expanded after achieving better than expected productivity in the second quarter. At the Company's Mineral Hill mine, a new ore zone was discovered down dip and adjacent to the existing Mineral Hill orebody. This new Ski Slope zone will be brought into production in the second quarter of 1996 supplementing output from the Mineral Hill deposit. At New Britannia, the Company's construction schedule remained on target. The primary crusher building and the installation of mill equipment were completed by mid-September. The mine was visited by the Honourable Gary Filmon, Premier of Manitoba. Q4 Forth Quarter TVX Gold officially opened the New Britannia mine on November 14. At full capacity the mill will produce 100,000 ounces of gold per year. On December 21, TVX Gold announced the closing of its acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. The Company made an initial payment of $19 million and will make a further payment of approximately $27 million, payable in five equal annual installments plus interest. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-187IA049-000850-B021-33http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/AnnualReport/1995/MessagetoShareholders.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119223551 text/html 13179HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 22:34:19 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:37:42 GMTContent-length: 12966 Annual Report - 1995: Message to Shareholders Annual Report - 1995 Message to Shareholders The goal of TVX Gold Inc.�s management team is to increase shareholder value by enhancing the Company's already substantial precious metal mining base. Specifically, by the year 2000, we plan to be producing over one million ounces annually and increase our reserves to 20 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent. In 1995, we continued to make steady progress towards achieving these objectives. Among the year's highlights were the start-up of the New Britannia mine in Manitoba and the completion of our purchase of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. We brought our 50%-owned and operated New Britannia mine into production as planned in the fall, officially opening the mine on November 14. Its annual production is anticipated to average 100,000 ounces while ongoing exploration is expected to add significantly to the existing eight years of reserves. Our $46 million purchase of the Kassandra Mines assets was completed in December, adding approximately 4.3 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent to our reserves. We plan to construct an autoclave plant at this base metal operation in order to recover the gold in the ore which has previously been ignored due to its refractory nature. Gold equivalent production is expected to average 300,000 ounces annually during the initial years of operation and approximately 200,000 ounces per year thereafter over the life of the mine. Financial Results TVX Gold's earnings in 1995 were $9.4 million, or $0.06 per share, compared to $22.8 million or $0.14 per share in 1994. Operating cash flow was $40.7 million or $0.26 per share, compared to $56.6 million and $0.36 per share in 1994. The decreases reflect higher operating and administrative costs, lower foreign exchange gains and increasing expenditures on exploration and business development as the Company pursues its aggressive growth strategy. Revenue in 1995 amounted to $156.9 million, similar to 1994's $157.2 million, resulting from the sale of 413,100 ounces of gold and gold equivalent in 1995 compared to 422,900 ounces in 1994. The Company's share of gold and gold equivalent production in 1995 was 423,100 ounces, approximately 3% less than the 1994 total of 436,900 ounces. Cash costs per ounce averaged $219, an increase of 10% over 1994's average of $199 per ounce, primarily as a result of higher unit operating costs, particularly at the Casa Berardi mine, and the effect of the appreciation of the local currency on operating costs at our Brazilian operations. TVX Gold's realized price averaged $380 per ounce, up from $372 per ounce in 1994. Operations TVX Gold's production in 1995 was derived from its direct and indirect interests in seven mines located in North and South America. The Company operates the New Britannia and Casa Berardi mines in Canada and the Mineral Hill mine in the U.S.A. New Britannia poured its first gold in November, while the Novo Astro mine in Brazil ceased operations in July, its ore reserves mined out after more than a decade of production. The 50%-owned La Coipa mine in Chile is one of South America's largest precious metals mines and one of the world's lowest cost producers. It contributed 48% or 204,600 ounces of gold and gold equivalent to TVX Gold's total 1995 production, almost 5% more than in 1994. Cash operating costs averaged $168 per ounce, down $3 from 1994. In Brazil, production from the 50%-owned Crixas mine in 1995 was marginally higher than the previous year. It contributed 63,300 ounces of gold or 15% of TVX Gold's total production, at an average cash cost of $177 per ounce compared to $170 per ounce in 1994. The Company's share of production from the Brasilia mine increased by 40% in 1995 to 53,600 ounces of gold, contributing 13% of the total annual production of TVX Gold, primarily as a result of the Company increasing its equity interest in the mine by 10% to 33%, effective January 25, 1995. Cash costs at this low grade open pit operation averaged $235 per ounce in 1995, up from $196 in 1994, primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency. A planned expansion at Brasilia, which should add a further 30,000 ounces of gold annually to TVX Gold's total production commencing in 1998, will bring economies of scale to the mine's operating costs in the future. Before its reserves were exhausted in mid-1995, the Novo Astro mine contributed 22,700 ounces of gold, or 5% of the Company's 1995 total production, which is approximately half of the mine's 1994 contribution. Cash costs averaged $183 per ounce, considerably less than the $238 per ounce cost in 1994, essentially due to higher grades and the cessation of production. Production from the 100%-owned Mineral Hill mine in Montana was 34,900 ounces or 8% of the Company's 1995 total. Declining grades and tonnage resulting from the depletion of reserves in the original deposit were responsible for an 11% decline from the previous year's output. As a result of this lower throughput, cash costs were $359 per ounce, up from $321 in 1994.Development of the new Ski Slope zone discovered in mid-1995 should allow production to return to the 40,000 ounce level in 1996, while in 1997, with the anticipated start-up of production from the Crevice Mountain orebody, output is planned to reach 60,000 ounces. In Canada, the 60%-owned Casa Berardi operation provided 36,700 ounces of gold, or 9% of the Company's production total in 1995. This is almost 40% less than in 1994 as a result of limited stope availability. Cash costs increased to $449 per ounce compared to $227 in 1994, partially because of a shortfall in development in 1994 resulted in increased emphasis on development in 1995. The New Britannia mine contributed 7,300 ounces of gold to TVX Gold's 1995 production total in the last month and a half of 1995. This operation is expected to reach commercial production levels in the second quarter of 1996. Reserves TVX Gold increased its reserves by almost 69% in 1995. Proven and probable reserves contained 13.7 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent at year end, a significant jump from the 8.1 million ounces reported a year earlier. The increase reflects the inclusion of reserves from our Kassandra Mines and Asacha acquisitions and the Pachicutza project, as well as higher reserves at the Brasilia and Crixas operations and the Kasperske Hory project. Projects As expected, the decision to put into production the Musselwhite property in northern Ontario was made in February 1996, upon completion of a final feasibility study. TVX Gold has a 32% interest in this project and our share of reserves amounts to approximately 730,000 ounces of gold. Production is expected to commence in 1997 at an annual rate of 200,000 ounces of gold and infill drilling is expected to prolong mining well beyond the 11-year mine life on which the production decision was made. In the Czech Republic, we continue to enhance the reserve potential of our 100%-owned Kasperske Hory project. As a result of our $3 million exploration and development program in 1995, we increased total reserves to one million ounces of gold. Exploration efforts in 1996 will focus on adding to reserves. Our exploration on the Pachicutza project in Ecuador continues with 1996 development including driving an adit into the deposit from which further exploration and development can be carried out. Under consideration is the construction of a mine capable of producing approximately 58,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually along with a by-product zinc-lead concentrate over a 6-year period. The plant from the Novo Astro mine has been purchased and will be moved to the Pachicutza site. Acquisitions On December 21, 1995, TVX Gold completed the acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. In accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, TVX Gold made an initial payment of approximately $19 million and will pay a total of approximately $27 million in five equal annual installments plus interest. In connection with this acquisition, TVX Gold is to receive grants from the Greek state representing 35% of eligible capital expenditures on the Kassandra Mines project. In accordance with Greek law, the award of grants is subject to ratification by the Greek Parliament. TVX Gold also acquired a 50% interest in the Asacha gold-silver deposit in southern Kamchatka in 1995 and has the contractual right, subject to Russian law, to increase its interest to 100%. A feasibility study is planned for 1996 with a view to confirming the potential of the deposit to support a mining operation. The Future As we have noted in past years, TVX Gold's corporate strategy is to increase shareholder value by enhancing those key elements of our business that we can control and which most affect our share price. We pay careful attention to the quality and quantity of our reserves, to our production levels, cash costs, cash flow from operations and our earnings. In addition, our actions are conducted with full regard for our responsibilities, especially in the corporate responsibilities, especially in the areas of environment, health and safety, and community relations. At our existing operations there is continuing emphasis on cost reduction and the expansion of reserves and production. Beyond these operations we are seeking new growth in reserves and production through the acquisition, exploration and development of quality operations and properties with the potential for low operating costs and attractive profits. The Company's total production is planned to increase to 470,000 ounces of gold and gold equivalent in 1996, reflecting the contribution of the New Britannia mine. We should see further increases in production in 1997 due to higher planned output from Brasilia and Mineral Hill and initial production from Musselwhite. We expect to continue adding to and enhancing our reserves, through our acquisition strategy and our ongoing exploration and development programs. We are also optimistic about the reserve potential of the Kassandra Mines property. We would like to express our sincere appreciation to our directors and employees who, through their efforts, have made our many achievements to date possible. Our goal is to build our reserves to 20 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent while we increase annual production to over one million ounces by the year 2000.

TVX Gold personnel have reviewed the reserves and have a high degree of confidence in the data. However, due to the unavailability of historical drill core, TVX Gold is conducting additional drilling and analysis to further confirm the reserves. Reserves prepared by joint venture partners have been reviewed by TVX Gold personnel. Reserves are based on a gold price of $375 and a silver price of $5.75 per ounce. Reserve figures are estimates, and no assurances can be given that the indicated quantities of gold will be produced. Market, short-term operatingfactors relating to the ore reserves, such as the orderly development of orebodies or the processing of new or different grades of ore, could affectthe Company's profitability in any particular accounting period. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-189IA049-000850-B023-136http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/AnnualReport/1995/Reserves.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119224540 text/html 5525HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 22:43:56 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:37:44 GMTContent-length: 5313 Annual Report - 1995: Summary of Proven and Probable Reserves Annual Report - 1995 Summary of Proven and Probable Reserves (TVX Gold Share)                                    1995                                  1994------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                             Proven and Probable                   Proven and Probable                         Tonnes  Grade       Ounces            Tonnes  Grade       OuncesOperating Mines                  gr/MT                                 gr/MT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------La Coipa - 50% (1)   52,275,000    2.0    3,352,000        50,288,000    2.0     3,264,000  ChileCrixas - 50%          4,717,000    8.8    1,338,000         4,483,000    8.0     1,150,000  BrazilBrasilia - 33%       78,539,000   0.45    1,128,000        50,644,000   0.49       798,000  Brazil (23% - 1994)Novo Astro - 19%              -      -            -            57,000   12.7        23,000  Brazil (50% - 1994)Mineral Hill - 100%     804,000   11.1      287,000           766,000   11.4       281,000  U.S.A.Casa Berardi - 60%    3,278,000    7.4      780,000         3,829,000    7.5       922,000  CanadaNew Britannia - 50%   1,960,000    6.4      403,000         2,026,000    6.6       431,000  CanadaProjects------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Musselwhite - 32%     3,274,000     6.9     730,000         3,512,000    9.0     1,016,000  CanadaPachicutza - 92%        662,000    14.7     313,000                 -      -             -  EcuadorKasperske Hory - 100% 2,449,000     9.2     725,000           975,000    6.0       187,000  Czech Republic    (90.5% - 1994)1995 Acquisitions------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kassandra - 100%     17,724,000     7.5   4,292,000                 -      -             -  Greece (1) (4)Asacha - 50%            689,000    17.4     384,000                 -      -             -  Russia------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Proven and Probable 166,371,000     2.6  13,732,000       116,580,000    2.2     8,072,000------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Possible             21,577,000     2.1   1,410,000         2,163,000    7.5       519,000------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Total Company       187,948,000     2.5  15,142,000       118,743,000    2.3     8,591,000------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		 © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-190IA049-000850-B024-240http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/AnnualReport/1995/ExplorationHighlights.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119225159 text/html 5454HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 22:49:38 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:37:40 GMTContent-length: 5242 Annual Report - 1995: Exploration Highlights Annual Report - 1995 Exploration Highlights Cuiu-Cuiu, Brazil The Cuiu-Cuiu project is located in the state of Para in northern Brazil, in the centre of the Tapajos gold province, the country�s oldest and largest gold producing area. The 25,000-hectare property is underlain by granites which are being investigated for their potential to host large volume, low grade gold deposits in hydrothermally altered stockwork zones as well as disseminated gold deposits in granite and tectonic breccias. Initial sampling and auger drilling have identified anomalous areas in saprolite material varying from 20 to 80 metres in width and with a strike extension of at least 1,500 metres. Drilling will be carried out in 1996 to test the property further. Gurupi, Brazil The Gurupi project, a 50/50 joint venture between TVX Gold and Santa Fe Pacific Gold, is located 350 kilometres southeast of the city of Belem along the Gurupi River. The 49,400-hectare property covers a 20-kilometre length of the 2-kilometre wide Gurupi shear belt. Gold is contained in metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks in two intensely mineralized parallel trends cut by shear and stockwork zones and quartz veins. Drilling to date has identified gold-bearing zones in saprolite and bedrock up to 2.5 kilometres in length and 15 to 60 metres thick with grades of about one gram of gold per tonne, and the potential for a reserve of over one million ounces. With four drills on the property, 20,000 metres of drilling in 200 holes is planned for 1996. Volta Grande, Brazil The Volta Grande project is located on the Xingu River, in the Amazon Basin, approximately 460 kilometres southwest of the city of Belem. The 15,100-hectare property lies in the famous Carajas mineral province associated with the Palmeiras greenstone belt. Its primary gold occurrences have been the target of garimpeiro activity. Preliminary exploration has identified three major targets on which drilling will be carried out in 1996 to investigate their potential for both low grade open pit and high grade underground mining operations. Quimsacocha, Ecuador TVX Gold has a 33% interest in the Quimsacocha project, a joint venture with Cogema and Newmont Overseas Explorations Limited. Located in the Azuay Province of south-central Ecuador, southwest of the city of Cuenca, the project covers a total of 12,250 hectares. Geological studies and geochemical and geophysical surveys have already identified six areas with anomalous gold-silver-copper values which will be tested for their bulk tonnage potential. A 28-hole, 3,120 metre drill program will be initiated in the first half of 1996. Collon, Peru The 12,000-hectare Collon project is located in central Peru, 17 kilometres north of the city of Huaraz in an area with excellent access and infrastructure. Initial drilling of a large gold-silver anomaly has yielded encouraging results, identifying mineralization in skarn and porphyry associated with a thrust fault around 25 metres thick. Future plans are to finish the first phase of drilling, for a total 1,400 metres, carry out a further 6,000 metres as a second drilling phase and continue exploration and trenching. The property is underlain by Cretaceous sediments intruded by Tertiary intrusives. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-191IA049-000850-B025-9http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/AnnualReport/1995/CorporateResponsibilities.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119225350 text/html 12771HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 22:52:46 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:37:40 GMTContent-length: 12558 Annual Report - 1995: Corporate Responsibilities Annual Report - 1995 Corporate Responsibilities TVX Gold is committed to conducting its activities in a corporately responsible manner. TVX Gold places major emphasis on workplace health and safety at all of its operations. Safety training programs, designed to improve the safety awareness and performance of all employees both on and off the job, are conducted on an ongoing basis. As an example, the Brasilia mine has been awarded the British Safety Council's Sword of Honour three times, while the International Loss Control Institute has presented its 5-star award to the mine for an unprecedented six years in succession. Environment TVX Gold is very conscious of its corporate commitment and responsibility to maintain the ecological harmony wherever it conducts its activities. The Company's objective is to have all of its operations, whether they be at the exploration, development or mining stage, conform with or exceed recognized environmental standards for the industry. The Company constantly reassesses its performance in the environmental area. TVX Gold's operations and projects are located in diverse environmental settings around the world. They are found in the high Andes desert, the Ecuadorian rain forest and in Canada's Precambrian Shield. In contrast to these somewhat remote areas are those operations that are in close proximity to towns, such as Brasilia and New Britannia, or the Kasperske Hory project. A further contrast is the Mineral Hill mine which is adjacent to Yellowstone National Park in the state of Montana. Each mine develops an environmental program that ensures compliance with locally stated international guidelines while conforming to corporately imposed international environmental practices that ensure the impacts on the local environment are kept to a minimum. South America The La Coipa mine, for example, is located in a desert environment at an elevation of 4,300 metres in the Andes Mountains where temperatures range from plus 35 degrees to minus 25 degrees Celsius. Water is obtained from wells beneath the Maricunga Salt Lake and transported through a 48-kilometre pipeline to the processing facilities. This method of obtaining process water ensures that the local wildlife and vegetation receive maximum benefit from the minimal natural precipitation that occurs in the area. At most mines, tailings generally have a water content of 50-60%. However, at La Coipa, dewatering is maximized through the implementation of one of the largest filtration systems in the mining industry. This system creates tailings with only 15-20% water, leaving the extracted water available for recycling in the mill circuit. The tailings are transported five kilometres in closed conveyors to the tailings storage facility where they are stacked like beach sand in a stable manner. The large tonnage, open pit, Brasilia operation is a good example of a mine that co-exists and cooperates with the neighbouring town of Paracatu. Because of its close proximity, Brasilia is concerned with dust, noise control and water quality. Dust levels are monitored at several sites on the property as well as at three locations in Paracatu. Access and internal roads are surfaced with laterite and sprayed constantly with water, while dormant mine areas are sprayed with lime solution to prevent wind-generated dust. All process water is directed to the tailings area and tested daily to check acidity levels, and the presence of cyanides, suspended solids, metals and oxygen. Groundwater monitoring wells downstream from the treatment and collection ponds are tested for the same substances. As mining proceeds at Brasilia, berms are constructed to screen the mine area, and planted with vegetation. The mine supports its own nursery, which employs four horticulturists, and is capable of providing 20,000 seedlings a year. Over 50,000 trees have been planted on site since the inception of operations. Brasilia's facilities also include an environmental simulation laboratory where chemists are able to assess control methods for potential contaminants. North America Mineral Hill is perhaps TVX Gold's most striking example of a mine operated in harmony with its environment. Because of its proximity to Yellowstone National Park, the mine was designed at the outset to strictly protect the environment and has an exemplary record of environmental protection. The local community has been involved since the early days and a citizens' advisory committee continues to meet quarterly to discuss the operation. The mine has been specifically designed to blend in with its surroundings. Buildings are a neutral tan colour, pipes and electrical cables are buried and new road construction is minimal. Dust on the existing mine roads is controlled by applications of magnesium or calcium chloride, with other materials such as linseed oil also being tested for this purpose. Access to the Crevice Mountain deposit currently under development is by a tunnel originating from the Mineral Hill mine rather than by a surface road. Special fences have been erected to prevent bears and elk from entering the impoundment areas. Garbage is not allowed to accumulate and attract bears, but is transported directly to a solid waste disposal facility 80 kilometres away. Utility poles were redesigned to discourage eagles from roosting and the results were so successful that the local power company is now using similar poles elsewhere in Montana. Mineral Hill is operated as a zero-discharge facility. Water from the mine and mill is treated to neutralize cyanide and remove heavy metals, and is then recycled to the mill. Ongoing tests have also indicated that concentrations of nitrates in the mine water, resulting from the blasting process, can be reduced significantly by passing the mine water through a series of vessels containing naturally occurring bacteria. Under controlled conditions, biological denitrification has resulted in the reduction of nitrate to elemental nitrogen gas, and it is believed that this work may lead to the development of a low cost, low maintenance treatment for mine water which may be of value at non zero-discharge mines. Mill tailings at Mineral Hill are dewatered and stacked in thin lifts designed to withstand liquification in the event of an earthquake. The old tailings dumps, left from historic operations on the property, are being transferred to the Mineral Hill impoundment and the excavated areas are being recontoured and revegetated. One potential concern at Mineral Hill was an old arsenic plant, first operated in 1899, located beside Bear Creek which drains into the Yellowstone River. TVX Gold, through a voluntary reclamation program, removed the building to the tailings area, after documenting it as a historic structure, replaced a metre-thick layer of contaminated soil with new clean topsoil and introduced native grasses. Other historic buildings are being restored and preserved as appropriate, including the mine office, which is located in a building that was used for the same purpose 100 years ago. When mining is completed at Mineral Hill, the mine area will be restored to its original condition. It is estimated that this will involve re-establishing 80 acres of grassland and 13 acres of Douglas fir forest. New Britannia represents TVX Gold's newest gold mine and, as such, employs the most advanced carbon-in-pulp technology to extract gold and the patented Inco SO2 cyanide destruction system to treat the process water. The operation's location within the town of Snow Lake calls for particular attention to be paid to dust and noise control. The location of a mine ventilation outlet on the town golf course demonstrates how residents and the mine can accommodate each other's interests. Environmental audits of each of the Company's North American properties were completed by the end of 1995. Community Involvement As one of its corporate responsibilities, TVX Gold supports the communities associated with its operations. This support takes many forms. At Mineral Hill, local baseball, basketball and bowling leagues have received contributions, as has the district 4-H program which instructs young people in agricultural skills, community service and personal development. Meetings are arranged to inform the community of Mineral Hill activities and the mine provides summer jobs for students from the local high schools and college. Local vendors are given the first opportunity to bid on the provision of supplies and services. The Chief Geologist conducts mine tours and educational programs for school groups. The Casa Berardi mine supports an industrial chair in borehole geophysics at Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal, and a local minor hockey team in the town of La Sarre. Bus transportation is also provided for employees for business purposes from La Sarre and two other locations to and from the mine. The New Britannia mine has contributed to hockey, curling and golf events, to local service groups and is establishing an annual scholarship for a college or university student. Employees are involved in a wide range of activities from serving on the town council and school board to leading Scout and Guide groups. Near La Coipa, the San Lorenzo School, strongly supported by the mine, provides education for about 400 pupils, from kindergarten age to 10 years. About 25% of the students are the children of La Coipa employees. In Rio de Janeiro, TVX Gold funds the Cruzada do Menor, an independent charitable organization which provides underprivileged children with food, improved education facilities and vocational training. At the Crixas operation, over 100 homes have been built for supervisors and operators in the local town, and a club has been built for employees and their families. A group of buildings was also converted into a school for 50 children and various local projects, such as the repair of a church roof, are supported. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-192IA049-000850-B025-90http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/ 205.208.60.13 19970119225530 text/html 3132HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 22:55:14 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:37:42 GMTContent-length: 2920 Annual Report - 1995: Financial Section Annual Report - 1995 Financial Section Contents Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results Management's Responsibility for Financial Reporting Auditor's Report to Shareholders Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Summarized Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statement Information © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-193IA049-000850-B026-48http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/AnnualReport/1995/Glossary.htm 205.208.60.13 19970119230049 text/html 13281HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 23:00:26 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:37:42 GMTContent-length: 13068 Annual Report - 1995: Glossary Annual Report - 1995 Glossary Adit � a tunnel driven horizontally into a hillside to provide access to a mineral deposit. Agitation leaching � leaching of gold from the host rock by agitating the ground ore in a cyanide solution. Archean � a term usually applied to the oldest Precambrian rocks. Argillite � a rock derived either from siltstone, claystone, or shale that has undergone a higher degree of hardening through heat, cementation or pressure than exists in those rocks. Autoclave system � oxidation system in which high temperatures and pressures are applied to convert refractory sulphide mineralization into amenable oxide ore. Backfill � material used to fill the space in a mine after ore has been extracted. Ball mill � a mill using metal balls as the grinding medium. Boudin � structure arising from tensional forces. It develops by stretching of a competent bed along bedding planes giving rise to tension cracks. Appearance is that of a string of sausages. Carbon-in-leach � a process very similar to carbon-in-pulp. In the carbon-in-leach process, the leaching and absorbing of gold onto carbon take place in the same tank. Carbon-in-pulp � a process to recover gold from a cyanide leach slurry. Coarse, activated carbon particles are moved counter-current to the slurry, absorbing the gold. Loaded carbon is removed by screening, and the gold is recovered from the carbon by stripping in a caustic cyanide solution followed by electrolysis or by zinc precipitation. Cash cost � includes production costs, royalties, marketing and refining charges, together with all administration expenses at the joint venture level. Commercial production � production for accounting purposes. Cut-and-fill � a mining method which involves excavating a stope, then filling it with waste material to provide support. Cut-off grade � the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic; used in the calculation of the ore reserves in a given deposit. Cyanidation � a method of extracting gold grains from crushed or ground ore by dissolving them in a weak solution of sodium or calcium cyanide: also known as leaching. Decline ramp � an inclined haulage road. Dip � the angle at which a vein, structure or rock bed is inclined from the horizontal, measured at right angles to the strike. Disseminated ore � ore carrying small particles of valuable minerals, spread more or less uniformly through the gangue matter; distinct from massive ore, wherein the valuable minerals occur in almost solid form with very little waste mineral included. Dor� � impure mixture of metallic gold and silver produced through the smelting of gold and silver concentrate, sand or precipitate. Typical impurities include base metals. Epithermal � hydrothermal deposits formed at low temperature and pressure. Flotation � a process for concentrating materials based on the selective adhesion of certain minerals to air bubbles in a mixture of water and ground-up ore. When the right chemicals are added to a frothy water bath of ore that has been ground to the consistency of talcum powder, the minerals will float to the surface. The metal-rich flotation concentrate is then skimmed off the surface. Footwall � the mass of rock beneath a geological structure such as an orebody or fault. Formation � the ordinary unit of geologic mapping consisting of a large and persistent stratum of rock. Gold equivalent � silver expressed in equivalent ounces of gold using a conversion ratio dependent on prevailing gold and silver prices. Gravity separation � recovery of gold from crushed rock or gravel using gold�s high specific gravity to separate it from lighter material. Grinding media � material used to finely grind ore material to a size which allows recovery of the desired contained material. Hangingwall � the mass of rock overlying a geological structure such as an orebody or fault. Hedging � an arrangement which effectively offsets a price or exchange risk inherent in another transaction or arrangement. In-fill drilling � drilling within a group of previously drilled holes to provide a closer spaced pattern to define more accurately the parameters of the orebody. Leaching � the process in which a soluble metallic compound is extracted from ore by dissolving the metals in a solvent; see cyanidation. Level � a horizontal opening in a mine; levels are usually established at regular intervals. Merrill-Crowe � a precipitation process to recover precious metals using zinc dust to treat a de-oxygenated precious metals-cyanide solution. Mineralized zone � any mass of host rock in which minerals of potential commercial value occur. Net smelter return � an interest in a mining property held by the vendor on the net revenue generated from the sale of metal produced by the mine. Operating cost � cash cost plus depreciation and amortization. Ore � material that contains one or more minerals, at least one of which can be recovered at a profit. Ounces � troy ounces of a fineness of 999.9 parts per 1,000 parts, equal to 31.1034 grams. Oxidized ore � the alteration of metalliferous minerals by weathering and the action of surface waters and their conversion, partly or wholly into oxides, carbonates or sulfates. Phyllite � scaly minerals, micas, chlorites and clays; a term more recently applied to minerals with a layered crystal structure. Porphyry � rocks containing conspicuous phenocrysts in a fine-grained or aphanitic groundmass. Precipitate � a mixture of mineral particles filtered from solutions as a result of a chemical reaction. Proterozoic � the younger of two Precambrian systems or eras. Pyroclastic � produced by explosive or aerial ejection of material from a volcanic vent. Pyroclastic deposits � deposits made up mainly of rock material that has been expelled aerially from a volcanic vent. Reagent � a chemical used in the mineral recovery process. Reclamation � the process by which lands disturbed as a result of mining activity are reclaimed back to a beneficial land use. Reclamation activity includes the removal of buildings, equipment, machinery, other physical remnants of mining, closure of tailings impoundments, leach pads and other mine features, and contouring, covering and revegetation of waste rock piles and other disturbed areas. Reserves � that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Reserves are customarily stated in terms of ore when dealing with metalliferous minerals. There are three categories of reserves: Proven ore � material for which tonnage and grade are computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, underground workings or drill holes; grade is computed from the results of adequate sampling; and the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are so spaced and the geological character so well-defined that size, shape and mineral content are established. Probable ore � material for which tonnage and grade are computed partly from specific measurements, samples or production data and partly from projection for a reasonable distance on geological evidence; and for which the sites available for inspection, measurement and sampling are too widely or otherwise inappropriately spaced to outline the material completely or to establish its grade throughout. Possible ore � material for which quantitative estimates are based largely on broad knowledge of the geological characteristics of the deposit and for which there are few samples or measurements. Resource � mineralization based on geological evidence and assumed continuity. May or may not be supported by samples but is supported by geological, geochemical, geophysical or other data. Rod mill � a mill using metal rods as the grinding mechanism. Room and pillar � a method of mining flat-lying deposits in which the mined-out ore or �rooms� are separated by pillars of approximately the same size. Run of mine ore � uncrushed ore in its natural state just as it is when blasted. Semi-autogenous mill � a mill in which rock is reduced to smaller particles partially by grinding against other pieces of rock. Shaft � a vertical passageway to an underground mine for moving personnel, equipment, supplies and material including ore and waste rock. Skarn � the metamorphic rocks surrounding an igneous intrusive where the latter has come in contact with limestone or dolomite rocks. Spot price � current delivery price of a commodity traded in the spot market, also called the cash price. Stope � the working area in a mine from which ore is extracted. Stratigraphic � pertaining to the composition, sequence and correlation of stratified rocks. Strike � the direction, or course or bearing, of a vein of rock formation measured on a level surface. Stripping ratio � the ratio of the amount of waste material which must be removed in an open pit to allow one ton of ore to be mined. Sulphides � compounds of sulphur with other metallic elements. Tailings � material rejected from a mill after the valuable minerals have been recovered. Tertiary � the earlier of the two geologic periods in the Cenozoic era. Triassic � the earliest of the three geologic periods comprised in the Mesozoic era. Vertical crater retreat (VCR) � a method of mining ore underground in which holes drilled between sublevels are blasted in successive horizontal slices from bottom to top. Water management � the process whereby the groundwater table in the mining area is lowered by pumping water from wells, and the water is conveyed and used or recharged to the groundwater system through infiltration, reinjection or irrigation return.

Quarterly Report Q3 1996 SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS TVX Gold Inc. reported a net loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996 of US$23.3 million (US$0.14 per share), compared to net earnings US$1.3 million (US$0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 1995. Net loss for the nine month period was US$13.2 million (US$0.08 per share) compared to net earnings of US$9.8 million (US$0.06 per share) in the corresponding 1995 period. During the quarter, the Company, as part of its ongoing review of its global operations, suspended the mining and milling operations at its Mineral Hill mine and placed the operation under care and maintenance. As a result, the Company took a US$29 million one-time charge to earnings. This charge was partially offset by gains on the disposition of minority equity investments which were primarily responsible for the other income of US$7.7 million. Gold equivalent production for the three months ended September 30, 1996 was 108,000 ounces (78,800 ounces of gold and 2,224,000 ounces of silver) compared to 94,300 ounces (80,300 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) during the same period in 1995. Year to date production was 320,700 gold equivalent ounces compared to 311,100 gold equivalent ounces in 1995. Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 92,900 ounces during the third quarter of 1996 was US$407 per ounce compared to US$383 per ounce on 107,900 gold equivalent ounces sold in the third quarter of 1995. Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis for the third quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to US$239 from US$218, principally due to the reduction of mill throughput attributed to the hardness of ore encountered at La Coipa, the Company's principal mine and the high cost of production realized at the Mineral Hill mine prior to operations being suspended there, partially offset by the removal of contract miners at the Bras�lia mine and the diminished use of contractors at the Casa Berardi mine. OPERATIONS REVIEW LA COIPA The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in Chile in the third quarter of 1996 was 53,900 ounces (24,700 ounces of gold and 2,224,000 ounces of silver) compared to 46,700 ounces (32,700 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period, on a gold equivalent basis, increased to US$185 per ounce as compared to US$169 in the same period of 1995. The increase in cash costs is principally due to the reduction of mill throughput attributed to the hardness of ore encountered during the quarter. CRIX�S The Company's share of gold production from the Crix�s mine in Brazil was 15,700 ounces in the third quarter of 1996 compared to 16,500 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$182 compared to US$164 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at the Crix�s mine is primarily due to lower grade ore being encountered in 1996. BRAS�LIA The Company's share of gold production from the Bras�lia mine in Brazil was 14,000 ounces in the third quarter of 1996 compared to 13,600 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$191 compared to US$229 for the corresponding 1995 period. The decrease in cash costs at the Bras�lia mine is primarily due to continued efficiencies achieved as a result of the removal of contract mining and the introduction of the larger tonnage fleet of trucks. MINERAL HILL During the quarter, the Company announced the suspension of mining and milling at its wholly-owned Mineral Hill mine in Montana, U.S.A. The Company stated that the continued losses and capital expenditures necessary to continue the current operations at Mineral Hill are not justifiable. TVX Mineral Hill will, however, continue the surface drilling program at Crevice Mountain to enable the Company to properly assess this resource which may justify mining on this project in the future. Production at the mine decreased as a result of mining lower grade ore and an ongoing shortfall in mill feed from the main Mineral Hill mine. As a result, cash operating costs at the mine had risen to US$524 on a year to date basis. Year to date production amounted to 17,300 ounces of gold. Contributing to this situation were delays encountered in the Crevice tunnel drive, principally due to unexpected water inflows. For these reasons, the mine, mill and associated facilities were placed on a care and maintenance basis. The decision to suspend operations at Mineral Hill resulted in a charge to third quarter earnings of the Company of approximately US$29 million ($0.18 a share), including provision for future site reclamation. CASA BERARDI The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine in Quebec, Canada was 11,300 ounces in the third quarter compared to 8,300 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$354 compared to US$612 in the previous year. The decrease in cash costs is primarily attributed to the diminished use of contractors on site. NEW BRITANNIA The Company's share of production from the New Britannia mine in Manitoba, Canada was 9,200 ounces. The mine commenced commercial production on August 1. Cash costs for the months of August and September were US$316. Underground production is increasing steadily with the ramp advance to the 650m level completed during the quarter. KASSANDRA MINES The Company recently announced that the blockade which had been preventing full access to the Olympias mine at the Company's Kassandra project in Greece was lifted. Certain of the communities and residents in the area of the Olympias mine had been blocking full access to the operations over concerns about mining in the area. As a result of negotiations between senior Greek Government representatives and representatives of the said communities, the blockade was lifted and TVX Hellas, the Company's wholly-owned Greek subsidiary, commenced moving materials and equipment to the Olympias site to refurbish and reopen the mine and to plan the construction of the gold recovery plant. During the quarter, ore production from the Madem Lakkos mine was ongoing, supplying feed to the Stratoni mill. Lead / silver and zinc concentrates continue to be shipped from the Stratoni port. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MUSSELWHITE At the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project, Placer Dome Canada Limited, joint venture partner and operator, continues construction with substantial completion of the tailings dams, plant site surfacing and the pouring of the concrete foundation for the primary crusher achieved during the quarter. The mill building cladding and roof sheathing are now also completed. The construction project continues to be on schedule and below budget with production anticipated to commence in April 1997. KASPERSKE HORY Underground exploration drilling continued at TVX Gold's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic. During the three month period, 160 metres of underground drifting and 3,840 metres of underground diamond drilling were completed. The diamond drilling was directed towards exploring the westerly strike extension of the main auriferous zone. Results to date have confirmed the presence of mineralization with drill intersections of similar grade and width to those obtained in 1995. In addition to the exploration diamond drilling, a series of closely spaced small diameter holes drilled from the 700 metre level have shown the mineralization to be continuous over greater than 300 metres. During the remainder of 1996, underground development and diamond drilling will continue to be concentrated on adding to the resource base by exploring to the west of the known mineralization. A pre-feasibility study being conducted by Davy International is scheduled to be completed during the fourth quarter of 1996. As part of the pre-feasibility study, Lakefield Research, Ontario, Canada is conducting a series of metallurgical tests to determine the optimal gold recovery methodology. LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW Operating activities in the third quarter of 1996 used $0.8 million, down from generating $16.9 million in the corresponding 1995 period, due to higher production costs and a 14% decrease in ounces sold as a result of delays in realizing sales at La Coipa. Working capital requirements utilized $6.2 million primarily due to the payment of interest on the US$150 million unsecured Notes issued in January 1996, and inventory increases at La Coipa. Excess inventories at La Coipa are expected to be sold in early 1997. In the third quarter of 1996, investing activities for mining property, plant and equipment increased to $42.6 million from $25.1 million in the same period in 1995. These increases are related to the Kassandra mines assets, which were acquired in late 1995, and the development of the Musselwhite project. Proceeds on investments of $17.9 million were the result of the Company liquidating its minority interest in publicly traded mining companies. In 1995, the Company had acquired minority interest investments for $11.1 million. Financing activities utilized $1.1 million in cash compared to generating $5.2 million in 1995 when the Company commenced the drawdown of the New Britannia financing. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID The Company filed a Notice of Intention (the "Notice") to make a normal course issuer bid (the "Bid") with The Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSE") which was accepted by the TSE on August 16, 1996. In the Notice, the Company provided for the purchase of up to a maximum of 5,000,000 common shares of its issued capital through the facilities of the TSE. Such purchases are to be made at market prices at the time of purchase with the Bid expiring on the earlier of the date determined by the Company and August 19, 1997. The Bid gives the Company the flexibility to purchase its shares for cancellation if it determines that, as a result of the difference between its view of the fundamental value of the shares and the market price, it is in the best interest of the Company to do so. Shareholders may obtain a copy of the Notice, without charge, by contacting the Company. To date the Company has purchased 604,000 shares.

Net earnings for the six month period were $10,174,000 ($0.06 per share) compared to $8,490,000 ($0.05 per share) for the first six months of 1995. During the second quarter, the Company had gains on the disposition of minority equity investments which were primarily responsible for the other income of $2,405,000 realized in the period. Gold equivalent production for the three months ended June 30, 1996 was 95,400 ounces (76,600 ounces of gold and 1,401,500 ounces of silver) compared to 114,000 ounces (94,400 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) during the same period of 1995. Year to date production was 212,700 gold equivalent ounces compared to 216,800 gold equivalent ounces in 1995. Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 103,200 ounces was $396 per ounce in the second quarter of 1996 compared to $383 per ounce on 103,000 gold equivalent ounces sold in the second quarter of 1995. Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the second quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to $231 from $207. This increase was due primarily to an ongoing shortfall in tonnage and the milling of lower grade ore at the Mineral Hill mine and a five week shut down of operations at the Casa Berardi mine stemming from a legal strike which was settled on May 27, 1996. OPERATIONS REVIEW LA COIPA The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the second quarter of 1996 was 45,700 ounces (26,900 ounces of gold and 1,401,500 ounces of silver) compared to 55,900 ounces (36,300 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis for the period increased to $189 as compared to $156 in the same period of 1995. The increase in cash costs and the decrease in production are primarily due to unfavourable weather conditions experienced during the quarter. CRIX�S The Company's share of gold production from the Crix�s mine was 15,700 ounces in the second quarter of 1996 compared to 15,700 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period were $176 compared to $194 in the same period of 1995. The decrease in cash costs is primarily due to ongoing efficiencies achieved at the operations and the stabilization of the Brazilian currency. BRAS�LIA The Company's share of gold production from the Bras�lia mine was 13,300 ounces in the second quarter compared to 13,200 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period were $197 compared to $228 in the previous year. The decrease in cash costs is attributable principally to the ongoing efficiencies realized from the introduction of the wholly owned and operated fleet of 85 tonne trucks as well as the stabilization of the Brazilian currency. MINERAL HILL The production from the Company's Mineral Hill mine was 5,200 ounces in the second quarter compared to 8,900 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period were $604 compared to $341 in the corresponding 1995 period. This decrease in production and increase in cash costs was a result of mining lower grade ore and an ongoing shortfall in mill feed from the main Mineral Hill mine. The future operations at this property are currently being evaluated. CASA BERARDI During the period, the Casa Berardi mine experienced a legal strike which commenced April 19, 1996, resulting in a shut down of production, and was settled on May 27, 1996. The strike was resolved with the assistance of a conciliator, management and the Casa Berardi Syndicat des Metallos d'Amerique Union members. Under the terms of the new agreement, a three year contract was accepted, effective retroactively from March 7, 1996. The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 9,000 ounces in the second quarter compared to 8,700 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were $335 compared to $423 in the corresponding 1995 period. NEW BRITANNIA The Company's share of production from the New Britannia mine was 6,500 ounces for the period. The production rate is steadily improving as ongoing development work continues to add to the number of stopes available for production. This development will partially offset the lower than planned ore grade currently being encountered which is expected to continue for the remainder of 1996. To offset the lower ore grade, plans are in place to increase throughput. It is expected that the operation will continue to show steady improvement in all key parameters for the remainder of the year. KASSANDRA MINES Since the signing of the purchase contract in December 1995, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas A.E., has been concentrating on the comprehensive review and refurbishment of the existing operations comprised of the Olympias and Stratoni mills, the Olympias, Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres mines and the port facility at Stratoni. A detailed environmental review is being undertaken and remedial work is currently underway. The retraining of existing employees is also well advanced. To date, the basic refurbishment and upgrading of the Stratoni mill has been completed with the Madem Lakkos mine currently operating to supply feed to the Stratoni mill. The first shipments of lead/silver and zinc concentrates occurred in July. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, the Greek Parliament passed the bill to ratify the Kassandra Mines purchase contract, including the related articles providing for the ratification of the 35 per cent grants from the Greek State and regulations for the timely issuance of all necessary licenses and permits in connection with the construction and operation of the gold recovery plant. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MUSSELWHITE The Company and its joint venture partner, Placer Dome Canada Limited, the operator of the project, made a decision in February 1996 to construct a gold mine at the Musselwhite property at a capital cost of $190 million. Construction work commenced during the quarter with the first major concrete pour of the milling facility building foundation. Exploration work at the southern portion of the T-Antiform deposit and the Island and Pebble zones is ongoing with the objective of identifying readily accessible mineable resources to supplement initial mill feed for the project. Production is expected to commence in the second quarter of 1997. KASPERSKE HORY During the second quarter, underground exploration work continued at TVX Gold's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project with the goals of adding additional ounces to the resource outlined in 1995 and further delineating the mineralization discovered to date. Within the Golden Creek deposit, 240 metres of underground development and 5,470 metres of diamond drilling were completed. Underground drilling continues to confirm the presence of auriferous mineralization. Approximately 200 metres of development and 6,000 metres of diamond drilling remain to be completed during the 1996 exploration program. A large percentage of this effort will be directed towards increasing the known resource base by drilling along strike to the west of the known mineralization. PACHICUTZA At the Company's Pachicutza project in Ecuador, the adit drive continued during the quarter allowing for further development and underground exploration work. Underground development work continues to outline major vein systems as anticipated. Reserve analysis along with engineering studies are underway and the definition of the reserves and completion of the engineering studies is expected in the fourth quarter. LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW Cash flow provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 1996 was $3.9 million, down from $5.2 million in the corresponding period in 1995, primarily as a result of higher cash operating costs. Investing activities for mining properties, plant and equipment increased to $32.1 million from $18.8 million in the corresponding period in 1995 due to spending at the Kassandra Mines and the development of the Musselwhite mine. The Company had a net outflow of $6.3 million in connection with the acquisition of equity investments including an interest in Valerie Gold Resources Ltd. Financing activities utilized $6.0 million in the quarter as compared to $9.1 million in the corresponding 1995 period, primarily as a result of the final loan payment made on the La Coipa project loan.

Quarterly Report Q1 1996 MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS Net earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 1996 were $6,295,000 ($0.04 per share), representing an increase from $5,590,000 ($ 0.03 per share) in the first quarter of 1995. During the first quarter of 1996, the Company realized significant gains on the disposition of minority equity investments, the most significant of which was the Gold Reserve shares acquired through the Brisas property settlement.Gold equivalent production was 117,300 ounces (101,500 ounces of gold and 1,131,500 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1996 compared to 102,800 ounces (85,900 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1995.Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 91,400 ounces increased to $390 per ounce in the first quarter of 1996 compared to $ 378 per ounce on 101,400 gold equivalent ounces sold in the first quarter of 1995. A significant portion of the difference between ounces produced and ounces sold relates to an increase in inventories at La Coipa.Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis in the first quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to $230 from $225 principally due to increased costs at Casa Berardi and Mineral Hill which were partially offset by improvements at La Coipa. OPERATIONS REVIEW LA COIPA The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the first quarter of 1996 was 59,200 ounces (43,400 ounces of gold and 1,131,500 ounces of silver) which compares to 45,700 ounces (28,800 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent ounce basis for the period decreased to $159 from $188 the previous year. The decrease in cash costs and increase in production are primarily due to higher grades of gold in the ore being mined and achieving higher plant recoveries. CRIX�S The Company's share of gold production from the Crix�s mine was 15,400 ounces in the first quarter of 1996 compared to 15,600 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period were $186 compared to $191 in the same period of 1995. BRAS�LIA The Company's share of gold production from the Bras�lia mine was 12,800 ounces in the first quarter compared to 13,400 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period were $232 compared to $238 in the previous year. During the quarter, the Company and its joint venture partners approved plans for a two year expansion program of the current operation designed to increase annual production to 210,000 ounces of gold by the year 1999. On February 1, the new 85 tonne fleet of trucks was commissioned, and the mining contractor replaced. MINERAL HILL The Company's share of gold production from the Mineral Hill mine was 8,200 ounces in the first quarter compared to 8,800 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. This decrease in production was a result of milling lower grade ore and reduced tonnage. Cash costs for the period were $422 compared to $370 in the previous year. Ore was intersected on the Ski Slope decline indicating that access to the main Ski Slope ore reserve block will occur by the end of the second quarter. The development of the Crevice tunnel is progressing and at March 31, 1996, 1.9 kilometres of the total planned tunnel length of approximately 4 kilometres was completed. CASA BERARDI The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 12,700 ounces in the first quarter compared to 9,500 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs per ounce for the first quarter were $370 compared to the previous year when cash costs were $277 per ounce. Quarter over quarter, cash costs are expected to continue to decline. The increase in production reflects the ongoing production improvements being achieved at the mine compared to the prior year. Production was 1% below plan while total development realized was 7% below plan, principally due to low production in January. Total backfill achieved was 20% above plan allowing the mines to catch up on their backlog. The Deep Development program is nearing completion with approximately 350 metres of development needed to join the Est and Ouest mines through the Principale Zone. The Principale Zone has been intersected by an access drift. A legal strike commenced April 19 after unionized workers rejected the final offer by the Company. During the strike, the mine was under the care and maintenance of senior staff. On May 27, with the assistance of a mutually agreed conciliator, management and the Casa Berardi Syndicat des Metallos d'Amerique Union members agreed to a 3 year contract, effective retroactively from March 7, 1996. The overall cost of the contract averages 4.5% per year. NEW BRITANNIA The Company's share of production from the New Britannia mine was 9,000 ounces for the first quarter of 1996. The initial ore mined from the satellite No. 3 Zone was milled in its entirety by March 31. Main mine tonnage scale up was adversely affected by lower grades at the Toots Zone and slower than planned main mine development. To supplement feed while ongoing development is being performed at the main mine, a 25,000 tonne test pit is being implemented at the Birch Zone. By the end of the second quarter, it is anticipated that four long-hole stopes will be available for mining from the main mine and tonnages should approach 1,400 tpd. The revised projected production for 1996 is estimated at 75,000 ounces, 25% below the planned 100,000 ounce annual production. KASSANDRA MINES The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas A.E., 100% owner of the Kassandra Mines, encountered delays at the Olympias mine as local protestors restricted the passage of equipment and materials to the site. At the Stratoni mill, base metal operations resumed. TVX Hellas completed the basic refurbishment of the Stratoni mill over the ten weeks prior to its being put into production. The refurbishment included upgrading the facility, modernizing and enhancing existing flotation cells, updating certain machinery and replacing reagent lines. The Stratoni mill plans to produce a lead-zinc concentrate at a rate of 700 tpd with mill feed from the nearby Madem Lakkos underground mine where mining has recommenced. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MUSSELWHITE The Company and its joint venture partner, Placer Dome Canada Limited, the operator of the project, made a decision in February to construct a gold mine at the Musselwhite property in northwestern Ontario at a capital cost of $190 million. Development of a mine and construction of processing facilities started immediately in order to commence production in the second quarter of 1997. Reserves are estimated to be 2,100,000 ounces of gold for an estimated mine life of ten years at a projected production rate of approximately 200,000 ounces of gold annually. The mill will be designed for a production rate of 3,300 tonnes per day (1,204,500 tonnes per year). Processing facilities will employ conventional gravity separation, cyanide leach and carbon-in-pulp (CIP) processes. The ore is free milling, providing gold recoveries of approximately 95%. Cash production costs are estimated at $200 per ounce. KASPERSKE HORY During the first quarter of 1996, exploration work at TVX Gold's Kasperske Hory project was directed largely towards following up surface diamond drilling results from 1995's successful exploration program. Within the Golden Creek Deposit, 4,600 metres of underground drilling and 313 metres of underground development were completed. The majority of the drill holes intersected their targets as planned, confirming the initial interpretation of the mineralization. During the remainder of 1996, additional diamond drilling and underground development is planned in an attempt to further define the known mineralization and increase the reserve base. PACHICUTZA At the Company's Pachicutza project in Ecuador, an adit is being driven into the deposit to permit development and further exploration. The 1996 development program calls for 6,000 metres of drilling, 600 metres of tunnelling and 180 metres of underground drifting along high grade structures. This work is being conducted in anticipation of an operation producing approximately 58,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually, with a by-product zinc-lead concentrate, for an estimated mine life of six years. LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW Cash flow from operations increased to $16.5 million in the first quarter of 1996, from $2.2 million in the comparable 1995 period, as a result of the improvements in working capital due to reduced funding of the joint venture partner for New Britannia and proceeds received from the settlement of the Casa Berardi insurance claim. Major expenditures in 1996 include the expansion of the Bras�lia mine, the development of the Kassandra Mines and the Musselwhite project . As well, the Company purchased the commitment to issue 400,000 shares to Royalstar Resources for Cdn $2 million. During the first quarter of 1996, the Company realized $26.4 million from the sale of equity investments which included $14.3 million on the disposition of the Gold Reserve shares and warrants received as part of the settlement of the Brisas property dispute in Venezuela. PRIVATE PLACEMENT In January 1996, TVX Gold completed a private placement in the United States of $150 million Unsecured Senior Notes bearing interest at 7.51% and due January 15, 2001. The Notes were sold to several U.S. life insurance companies. Approximately $20,000,000 of the proceeds were used to repay drawings on operating bank lines. The balance is available for anticipated capital expenditures, for the acquisition, exploration and development of mining prospects and for general corporate purposes. MANAGEMENT In May, the Company announced the strengthening of its Senior Operating Management Team with the appointments of Mr. David Murray as President and Chief Operating Officer and Mr. Clifford J. Davis as Senior Vice President, North American Operations.

Net earnings for the nine month period were US$9,839,000 (US$0.06 per share) compared to US$19,181,000 (US$0.12 per share) in the corresponding 1994 period. In 1994, the higher net earnings for both the first nine months and the third quarter reflect one time interest and foreign exchange gains which resulted principally from the appreciation of the Brazilian currency, the Real. Gold equivalent production for the three months ended September 30, 1995 was 94,300 ounces (80,300 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) compared to 111,100 ounces (88,900 ounces of gold and 1,604,000 ounces of silver) during the same period in 1994. Year to date production was 311,100 gold equivalent ounces compared to 331,200 gold equivalent ounces in 1994. Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales during the third quarter of 1995 of 107,900 ounces was US$383 per ounce compared to US$373 per ounce on 96,800 gold equivalent ounces sold in the third quarter of 1994. Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the third quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$218 from US$190, principally due to increased operating costs at certain mines and lower production at the North American operations and La Coipa. However, the improved revenue results at the La Coipa Mine reflect a draw down in inventories and higher realized revenues. The continued appreciation of the Brazilian currency accounted for higher costs during the period at the Company's Brazilian operations. At the Mineral Hill Mine, third quarter production was in line with the comparable 1994 period, while year to date production was lower than 1994 reflecting the mining of lower grade ore as the main orebody reaches the end of its expected life. The newly identified Ski Slope zone, adjacent to the Mineral Hill orebody, is currently being developed and will provide continued production at a mining grade of 7.2 grams per tonne, until the completion of the Crevice tunnel project. Gold production at Casa Berardi was significantly lower than 1994 levels due to lower grade ores and an increased emphasis on development and exploration. The Company expects that improved production levels in the fourth quarter will result in average cash costs in 1995 of approximately US$215 per ounce. OPERATIONS REVIEW LA COIPA The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa Mine in Chile in the third quarter of 1995 was 46,700 ounces (32,700 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) compared to 53,500 ounces (31,300 ounces of gold and 1,604,000 ounces of silver) in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent ounce basis for the period increased to US$169 as compared to US$157 in the same period of 1994. The increase in cash costs and the decrease in production are primarily due to the mining of lower head grades during the period. CRIX�S The Company's share of gold production from the Crix�s Mine in Brazil was 16,500 ounces in the third quarter of 1995 compared to 17,600 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decrease in production is attributable to mining lower grade ore. However, throughput at the mill continues to exceed plan and the Crix�s Mine is on target to increase its annual throughput to 485,000 tonnes for 1995 compared to 453,000 tonnes milled in 1994. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$164 compared to US$133 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at the Crix�s mine is primarily due to lower production in the period and the appreciation of the Brazilian currency. BRAS�LIA The Company's share of gold production from the Bras�lia Mine in Brazil was 13,600 ounces in the third quarter compared to 9,600 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is primarily due to the Company's acquisition of an additional 10% equity interest in the Bras�lia Mine effective January 25, 1995, raising the Company's effective interest in the operation to 33%. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$229 compared to US$151 for the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in cash costs at the Bras�lia Mine is primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency. Production efficiencies are anticipated to improve in the first quarter of 1996 with the introduction of a fleet of 85 tonne trucks which will replace the 20 tonne trucks currently used. NOVO ASTRO The planned closure of the Novo Astro Mine in Brazil which reached the end of its mine life in June 1995 will be completed by year end 1995. The 1,200 ounces of production registered in the quarter were the result of remnants recovered during mill clean up. MINERAL HILL The Company's share of gold production from the Mineral Hill Mine in Montana, U.S.A. was 8,000 ounces in the third quarter compared to 8,800 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs for the period were US$392 compared to US$396 in the previous year. The advancement of the Crevice tunnel continues, however at a slower than anticipated rate, due to unexepected ground water encountered. The Company's efforts at grouting in the tunnel drive have been successful and the tunnel is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1997. The recently discovered Ski Slope Zone will be in production in the first quarter of 1996. It is anticipated that, based on the Company's current information and ongoing drilling, the deposit will contribute sufficient production until the Crevice reserves are developed. CASA BERARDI The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi Mine in Quebec, Canada was 8,300 ounces in the third quarter compared to 12,900 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$612 compared to US$227 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs and decrease in production during the third quarter reflect the operational transition period encountered at the mine in which emphasis was placed on development of multiple feed sources. To accelerate this program, a contractor was retained. The deep development program continues with shaft sinking completion scheduled for the fourth quarter. MINE UNDER DEVELOPMENT NEW BRITANNIA Officially opened, subsequent to the end of the quarter, on November 14, 1995. The Company, as the operator of the project, maintained its construction schedule on target at its 50% owned New Britannia Mine in Manitoba, Canada. During the period, long hole drilling of the No. 3 Zone orebody commenced along with development work at the 1,780 metre level. Erection and completion of the primary crusher building occurred while the installation of mill equipment was finalized by mid-September. By the end of September, crushed waste was fed into the fine ore bin in preparation for start-up. The mill processing facilities are expected to operate on a 24 hour day, 365 days per year schedule at an operating availability of 96% and a rated throughput of 78 tonnes per hour to average 1,800 tonnes per day. The crushing facility is expected to operate 12 hours per day. The mill is expected to process 665,000 tonnes per annum, recovering approximately 100,000 ounces of gold. In anticipation of the official mine opening, the Honourable Gary Filmon, Premier of Manitoba, visited the site during the quarter. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MUSSELWHITE Exploration work and feasibility studies continue at the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project in Ontario, Canada, with a production decision expected in early 1996. Total costs for the 1995 program are expected to be approximately $15 million and include the construction of a newly-completed 45 kilometre all-weather access road to the property and a feasibility study. Preliminary indications are that this underground, shaft accessed property will be mined and milled at a rate of approximately 1.4 million tonnes of ore per annum to produce approximately 250,000 ounces of gold annually. KASPERSKE HORY At the Company's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic, the underground drifting program continues on course to achieve 2,350 metres of total development. Surface drilling results continue to confirm mineralized systems along strike. Underground drilling work is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter. The Company is evaluating the continuance of further underground drifting and drilling plans for 1996, as findings to date remain positive, and in accordance with expectations. PACHICUTZA During the period, the Company realigned its drilling and exploration program at the Pachicutza project in Ecuador. The initial exploration program focused on large tonnage, low grade zones which, to date, have proved to be uneconomic. However, after careful consideration, the Company has switched its exploration program to smaller high grade zones. Pending positive results from these zones, the Company anticipates commencing a feasibility study in 1996. ACQUISITION PROJECT KASSANDRA MINES Discussions aimed at the completion and signing of the contract to purchase the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece, continue. The Company remains confident that the transaction will soon close and the Greek government continues to affirm its support in this process. LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW Cash flow provided by operating activities in the third quarter of 1995 was US$16.9 million, down from US$25.6 million in the corresponding period in 1994, as higher sales revenues were offset by higher cash costs of production and exploration spending during the 1995 period increased compared to the prior year period. The higher overall cash flow in 1994 reflects the realization of one time interest and foreign exchange gains. Improvements in working capital increased cash flow, principally as a result of the Company completing, during the quarter, the financing of the development of the New Britannia Mine. Investing activities for mining properties, plant and equipment remained relatively consistent at US$25.0 million in the third quarter of 1995 from US$27.3 million in the prior period. Spending in 1995 was the result of requirements at the La Coipa, Casa Berardi and Mineral Hill mines, the development of the New Britannia Mine, costs related to acquiring new properties in Greece and the recently acquired interests in properties in Kamchatka, Russia. Investments in other assets increased to US$11.2 million from US$1.5 million in 1994 as a result of strategic minority interest investments in publicly traded mining companies. Financing activities generated US$5.2 million in the quarter compared to US$2.3 million in the same period of 1994. Cash generated from the issuance of share capital in the third quarter was significantly reduced as compared to the 1994 third quarter, as 1994 included shares issued for the acquisition of mining properties. Net long-term debt financing resulted in an increase in cash of US$10.1 million as a result of the first draw down on the New Britannia Mine project financing completed during the third quarter. The total facility is US$28 million, of which US$21.4 million had been received as of September 30. MANAGEMENT CHANGES The Company continued to strengthen its corporate structure with the recent additions of Ross F. Brown as Vice President, Human Resources and R. Gregory Laing as Corporate Secretary and Legal Counsel.

US$2,547,000 (US$0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 1994. Net earnings for the six month period were US$8,490,000 (US$0.05 per share) compared to US$5,862,000 (US$0.04 per share) for the first six months of 1994. Gold equivalent production for the three months ended June 30, 1995 was 114,000 ounces (94,400 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) compared to 112,200 ounces (86,700 ounces of gold and 1,829,000 ounces of silver) during the same period of 1994. Year to date production was 216,800 gold equivalent ounces compared to 222,600 gold equivalent ounces in 1994. Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 103,000 ounces was US$383 per ounce in the second quarter of 1995 compared to US$370 per ounce on 118,000 gold equivalent ounces sold in the second quarter of 1994. Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the second quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$207 from US$192, principally due to decreased grade and tonnage at certain mines. In particular, at the Mineral Hill mine, throughput declined as a result of lower grades, while gold production at the Casa Berardi mine decreased due to lower plant throughput, head grade and plant recovery. Cash costs at the Brazilian operations reflected an appreciation of the Brazilian currency, while production at both the Bras�lia and Crix�s mines were as planned. The Novo Astro mine, which began shut down operations late in the second quarter, benefitted from higher than planned plant throughput as it reached the end of its mine life. The La Coipa mine posted a strong quarter as it benefitted from higher than planned head grades and recoveries. The Company anticipates that continued improvements in production volume and grade throughout the balance of the year will result in average cash costs for 1995 of approximately US$200 per ounce compared to US$199 per ounce in 1994. OPERATIONS REVIEW LA COIPA The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the second quarter of 1995 was 55,900 ounces (36,300 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) compared to 49,800 ounces (24,300 ounces of gold and 1,829,000 ounces of silver) in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis for the period declined to US$156 as compared to US$160 in the same period of 1994. The decrease in cash costs and the increase in production are primarily due to mining higher head grades and achieving higher plant recoveries somewhat offset by lower than planned plant throughput during the period. CRIX�S The Company's share of gold production from the Crix�s mine was 15,700 ounces in the second quarter of 1995 compared to 17,000 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decrease in production is attributable to mining lower grade ore. Throughput at the mill continues to exceed plan. The Crix�s mine is on target to increase its annual throughput to 485,000 tonnes for 1995 compared to 453,000 tonnes milled in 1994. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$194 compared to US$172 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at the Crix�s mine is primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency. Cash costs are expected to be less than $200 for the year. BRAS�LIA The Company's share of gold production from the Bras�lia mine was 13,200 ounces in the second quarter compared to 9,400 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is primarily due to the Company's acquisition of an additional 10% equity interest in the Bras�lia mine on January 25, 1995, raising the Company's effective interest in the operation to 33%. Cash costs per ounce of gold of US$228 for the period is the same as the previous year. Management at the mine continues to improve performance by increasing throughput. Further production efficiencies are anticipated with the introduction in the first quarter of 1996 of 85 tonne trucks which will replace the current 20 tonne trucks. Cost efficiencies commensurate with the introduction of the new fleet are expected as early as the second quarter of 1996. A study is also underway to examine the feasibility of increasing throughput to 18 million tonnes per year from the current 13 million tonnes. NOVO ASTRO The Company's share of gold production from the Novo Astro mine was 11,600 ounces in the second quarter compared to 9,600 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. In the period cash costs per ounce of gold were US$135 compared to US$254 in the previous year. Novo Astro's production reflects the mining of the remaining high grade stopes of the mine and the shutting down of the facility. An orderly shutdown of the operations commenced in the quarter. MINERAL HILL The Company's share of gold production from the Mineral Hill mine was 8,900 ounces in the second quarter compared to 12,900 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. This decrease in production was a continued result of milling lower grade ore and a 25 tonnes per day shortfall in tonnage. Cash costs for the period were US$341 compared to US$253 in the previous year. During the period, a new zone was discovered down dip and adjacent to the Mineral Hill ore zone which will allow flexibility to improve tonnage and grade production. The development of the Crevice tunnel is behind schedule by approximately two months due to unexpected ground water conditions. Approximately one quarter of the distance has been developed. It is still anticipated the Crevice tunnel can meet its targeted completion schedule of November 1996. CASA BERARDI The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 8,700 ounces in the second quarter compared to 13,500 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$423 compared to US$216 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs and decrease in production reflects the temporary suspension of mining in a high grade stope due to poor ground conditions, as well as lower than planned tonnage and an increased emphasis on development of mining stopes. The loss of the primary stope prevented accelerating the development of the lower, intermediate and West zones. To facilitate this work, a contractor has been hired to enable the advancement of these zones. The deep development program continues on schedule with shaft sinking completion scheduled for the fourth quarter. Development of the Principale zone will begin in the 4th quarter as planned. Exploration work to date continues to show excellent potential. MINE UNDER DEVELOPMENT NEW BRITANNIA At the Company's 50% owned New Britannia mine, both underground development and surface construction remain on schedule and on budget with mill commissioning expected to begin in the third quarter. Mineable reserves stand at approximately 4.1 million tonnes grading 6.6 grams of gold per tonne for a total of 862,000 ounces. Mine site exploration is ongoing and a comprehensive evaluation of potential satellite zones on the property continues. No. 3 zone ore continues to be stockpiled and will be ready for processing at the start-up of the mill. Once operational, the mill will have an estimated throughput capacity of 660,000 tonnes, for an annual production rate of approximately 100,000 ounces of gold. With start-up scheduled to begin in the third quarter, this mill will contribute to production in the fourth quarter. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MUSSELWHITE Exploration work at the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project continues to delineate additional reserves. A feasibility study is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1995 with a production decision anticipated thereafter. To date, an all weather road is in place and evaluation of the construction of a power line in 1996 is underway. Assuming a positive production decision in the first quarter of 1996, early indications are for the start up of production to commence in the fourth quarter of 1997. Total proven and probable reserves are currently estimated at 3.2 million ounces of gold. KASPERSKE HORY At the Company's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project, an accelerated US$3 million drilling program to prove up one million ounces of gold reserves remains on target. Continued drilling results are encouraging and support the presence of mineralized systems extending past the initial target areas with some veins being traced for over 200 metres in length. Drift expansion work has rendered better than expected productivity adding 850 metres to the previous 1,500 metres. A feasibility study could commence as early as 1996. PACHICUTZA The Company continues its exploration program at its 92% owned Pachicutza project in Ecuador. A number of gold-bearing zones have been identified, however, some of the large low grade resources initially identified have not proved to be economic but investigation work continues. Meanwhile, the main focus of the drilling and evaluation efforts is currently directed towards several smaller, higher grade zones. NEW PROJECT KASSANDRA MINES The Company remains confident that the closing will occur this fall as all material terms of the purchase have been agreed on. In anticipation of closing, engineering, procurement and environmental work is ongoing. As part of the Company's ongoing planning of the project, it is anticipated that all three existing operations will remain in production. Plans to commence environmental rehabilitation, to retrain miners, and to enhance and modernize the existing operations upon the signing of the agreement are in place. RECENT ACQUISITION ASACHA AND RODNIKOVOE The Company recently undertook a careful step into a new geographical area when it announced the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Asacha and Rodnikovoe gold/silver deposits located in South Kamchatka, Russia through the acquisition of 50% of the outstanding shares of Trevozhnoye Zarevo ("TZ"), a Russian company. The Company is entitled to a majority representation on the board of TZ and has the contractual right to increase its interest to 100%, subject to compliance with Russian laws. The Asacha and Rodnikovoe deposits are located in the Southern Kamchatkan gold-silver belt, within 60 and 100 kilometres respectively, of the provincial capital of Petropavlovsk and are accessible by a primitive road. The mineralization style is the classic high-grade, bonanza epithermal-vein type, associated with recent volcanism of the circum Pacific region. Preliminary Russian metallurgical work has shown that a substantial amount of the identified reserves contain free gold and that recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable by gravimetric and normal cyanidation processes. Based on Russian reserve estimates, these deposits contain approximately 2.28 million ounces of gold and 12.9 million ounces of silver, or a total of 2.45 million ounces of gold equivalent at today's prices. LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW Cash flow provided from operations in the second quarter of 1995 was US$5.2 million, down from US$14.9 million in the corresponding period in 1994. This reduction is primarily due to changes in the Company's silver hedging position and additional working capital requirements primarily related to funding our joint venture partner's contributions to the New Britannia project. Investing activities for mining properties, plant and equipment increased significantly to US$18.8 million from US$4.8 million in the prior year largely due to the expansions at the Casa Berardi and Mineral Hill mines and the development of the New Britannia project. During the quarter, the Company sold its 44% equity interest in CMA for net proceeds of US$8.9 million. CMA holds a 71% interest in the Novo Astro mine which represented a 31% indirect investment for TVX Gold. The sale provided for adjustments to the price to reflect the ceasing of production at Novo Astro in the quarter. The Company retains its 19% direct interest in the Novo Astro mine. Debt repayments during the second quarter were primarily related to the La Coipa project loan and were similar to debt repayments in the previous year. MANAGEMENT CHANGES Recognizing the rapid growth of the Company both at existing operations and new international projects, the Company strengthened its operating group with the addition of two senior individuals. On June 1st, Gary E. German was appointed a Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer responsible for overseeing all operating and development projects of the Company. Also, Mr. Frank X. Koch has recently been appointed Project Director for the Kassandra project in Greece. He had most recently been with Noranda Inc. as the Group's Vice President, Engineering.

Quarterly Report Q1 1995 MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS Net earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 1995 were $5,590,000 ($0.03 per share), an increase from $3,315,000 ($0.02 per share) in the first quarter of 1994. Contributing to the increase in earnings in 1995 was an accounting gain of $7.5 million, which was recorded by the Company in January 1995, resulting from the settlement of the Brisas property lawsuit in Venezuela. As part of the settlement, TVX received 1.5 million shares of Gold Reserve Corporation, a corporation listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. During the quarter, the Company reduced its outstanding silver position based on its assessment of the silver market, which partially offset the Brisas gain. Gold equivalent production was 102,800 ounces (85,900 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1995 compared to 110,400 ounces (91,800 ounces of gold and 1,341,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1994. The realized price for gold in the first quarter of 1995 was $378 per ounce (1994 - $378) and for silver was $4.43 per ounce (1994 - $4.89). Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 101,400 ounces was $375 per ounce in the period compared to $373 on 96,200 gold equivalent ounces sold in the same period of 1994. Cash costs on a gold equivalent basis in the first quarter of 1995 increased to $225 per ounce from $193 in the same period of 1994, principally due to decreased grade and tonnage. Higher operating costs at La Coipa, lower grades at Mineral Hill, and decreased mill throughput and lower grades at Casa Berardi were contributing factors to the overall increase in cash costs. The Brazilian operations results reflect an increase in local costs due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency. The Company anticipates that improvements in production volume and grade throughout the balance of the year will result in average cash costs for 1995 of approximately $200 per ounce compared to $199 per ounce in 1994. OPERATIONS REVIEW LA COIPA The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the first quarter of 1995 was 45,700 ounces ( 28,800 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) which compares to 48,000 ounces (29,400 ounces of gold and 1,341,000 ounces of silver) in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash cost on a gold equivalent ounce basis for the period increased to $188 from $163 the previous year. The increase in cash costs was primarily due to an increase in the consumption of zinc and cyanide during the quarter, which was required as a result of the changing nature of the ore. In addition, normal mill maintenance scheduled for later in 1995 was advanced to the first quarter. As well, La Coipa experienced a decline in milling throughput in the quarter, which has returned to target rates during the second quarter. The mine plan indicates cash costs of $170 per ounce for the year. CRIX�S The Company's share of gold production from the Crix�s mine was 15,600 ounces in the first quarter of 1995 compared to 11,500 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is attributable to increased mill throughput. Cash costs for the period were $191 compared to $184 in the same period of 1994. The increase is primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency. As a result of planned modifications to the mill, the Crix�s mine is expected to increase its annual throughput to 485,000 tonnes for 1995 compared to 453,000 tonnes milled in 1994. BRAS�LIA The Company's share of gold production from the Bras�lia mine was 13,400 ounces in the first quarter compared to 9,300 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is primarily due to the Company's acquisition of an additional 10% equity interest in the Bras�lia mine on January 25, 1995, raising the Company's effective interest in the operation to 33%. Cash costs for the period were $238 compared to $194 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at Bras�lia reflect the appreciation of the Brazilian currency and the mining of lower grade ore. During the first quarter, the Bras�lia mine received, for an unprecedented sixth consecutive year, the five star award of excellence from the National Occupational Safety Association. NOVO ASTRO The Company's share of gold production from the Novo Astro mine was 9,800 ounces in the first quarter compared to 12,400 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decline in production is the result of changing grades as the winding down of operations at Novo Astro commences. Plans are in place to facilitate an orderly shutdown, now scheduled for July, 1995. At $226 per ounce, cash costs were comparable to $225 per ounce recorded in the previous year. MINERAL HILL The Company's 100% owned Mineral Hill mine produced 8,800 ounces of gold in the first quarter compared to 12,900 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. This decrease in production was a result of milling lower grade ore. Cash costs for the period were $370 compared to $269 in the previous year. In order to offset future declines in production and decrease cash costs, plans are in place to accelerate the exploration and development program in the lower levels of the mine. In view of the face that new stoping areas are at least two months away, production and grade are expected to remain at approximately current levels for the second quarter. The development of the Crevice tunnel is progressing satisfactorily and at March 31, 1995, 3/4 of a kilometre of the total planned length of approximately 4 kilometres of the tunnel was complete. CASA BERARDI The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 9,500 ounces in the first quarter compared to 16,300 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decrease in production reflects the shutdown of operations at a high grade heading following a fatality in January, 1995. In addition, ongoing mine development was delayed. Cash costs for the period were $277 compared to $213 in the previous year. Although first quarter results were disappointing, efforts continue to maintain production while the deep development program continues. The deep development program remains on budget and on schedule, and shaft access and sinking continue according to plan. MINE UNDER DEVELOPMENT NEW BRITANNIA The Company's 50% owned New Britannia mine is scheduled to commence production in the third quarter of 1995. As the operator of the project, the Company has been successful in maintaining the construction and development of the project on budget and on schedule. The headframe has been erected and the foundation for the mill has been poured. It is expected that the mill will be in place by the end of the second quarter. Shaft sinking from the previous 600 metre level to the 1,000 metre level continues on schedule. Once operational, the mine is expected to produce 100,000 ounces of gold on annual basis. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MUSSELWHITE The Company remains confident that a positive production decision will be made in early 1996 at its 32% owned Musselwhite project. Drilling results at the project continue to exceed expectations and completion of the feasibility study is expected by year end. Total proven and probable reserves are currently estimated to be 11 million tonnes averaging 9 grams of gold per tonne, at a cut-off grade of 4.5 grams per tonne, and containing 3.2 million (TVX share 1 million) ounces of gold. KASPERSKE HORY The Company's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project is anticipated to have one million ounces of reserves by the end of 1995. The Company increased its interest in the project to 100% during the first quarter of 1995. An accelerated $3 million drilling program commenced in the first quarter. Initial results support the continued presence of sulfide systems with some veins being traced for over 200 metres in length. Drifting continues at a rate of 8 metres per day. The 1995 program call for 500 metres of expansion on the existing 1,500 metres of development. PACHICUTZA The Company has an $8 million exploration program in place for 1995 at its 92% owned Pachicutza project in Ecuador. The exploration consists of 20,000 metres of drilling and about 3,000 metres of underground drifting. The completion of an 18 kilometre road has facilitated access to 60 kilometres of trails and allowed for the erection of seven temporary exploration camps, and a sample preparation facility. As of the end of the first quarter, 15 square kilometres of the concession were geologically mapped, 8 kilometres of trenching completed, and over 8,000 metres of core drilling sampled. Initial indicated resource calculations are anticipated by mid-1995. NEW PROJECT KASSANDRA MINES The Company was named the winning bidder for the Kassandra Mines in the latter part of the first quarter. The company proposes to purchase the Kassandra Mines assets for approximately $47 million. The purchase price will be payable as $19 million on closing with five equal installments, plus interest, on the anniversary dates of the closing. It is anticipated that the purchase will close in the second quarter of 1995. Company personnel continue to gear their efforts to allow for an orderly succession of operations. Plans are in place to commence environmental rehabilitation, the employment and retraining of miners, and the enhancement and modernization of the existing operations, upon the closing. The construction of an autoclave plant will be tendered to experienced engineering firms on a turn key basis. Upon completion of the autoclave plant and the subsequent start of commercial production, the anticipated annual production of the Kassandra Mines is estimated at 350,000 gold equivalent ounces for the initial three years of full production. Thereafter gold equivalent production for the 20 year life of the project will be approximately 200,000 ounces per annum. LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW Cash flow from operations increased to $2.2 million in the first quarter of 1995, from $1.5 million in the comparable 1994 period, as a result of the increase in earnings described above. Expenditures on mining properties, plant and equipment were $35.1 million in 1995 (1994 - $4.2 million) as the Company's development and expansion plans progress. Major expenditures in 1995 include the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in the Bras�lia mine for $14 million, construction of the New Britannia mine for $3.1 million and development and expansion of the Mineral Hill mine ($2.1 million) and the Casa Berardi mine ($2.8 million). The Company's net cash position remained strong at $81 million at the end of the first quarter (1994 - $144 million). Eike F. Batista Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John W.W.

Net earnings per share were $0.06, which compares with $0.14 in 1994 and $0.12 in 1993. The significant decrease in 1995 earnings from 1994 is principally related to lower foreign exchange gains due to the stabilization of the Brazilian currency, higher exploration spending and higher operating costs encountered at the Casa Berardi and Bras�lia mines. These reductions in earnings were partially offset by the gains realized on the settlement of the Brisas property dispute and lower income taxes. The increase in net earnings in 1994 over 1993 is attributed to higher interest income due to the issuance of $146.5 million common shares in January 1994, higher foreign exchange gains realized in Brazil and lower interest expense due to reduction in the La Coipa project financing. These improvements were offset by lower operating margins at the Novo Astro and La Coipa mines and a three fold increase in exploration spending. Reserves The Company�s share of proven and probable ore reserves, a key component of future production growth potential, at December 31, 1995 increased by 69% to 13.7 million gold equivalent ounces compared to 8.1 million ounces at December 31, 1994. This increase is due to acquisitions undertaken during 1995, particularly the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. Through the development of these projects, the Company anticipates attaining one million ounces of annual gold production by the turn of the century. Key activities which occurred during 1995 are as follows: on March 3, 1995, the Company was named the successful bidder for the Kassandra Mines Complex in Greece. On December 21, 1995, the contract was signed and the Company acquired the assets for approximately $46 million with the initial payment of $19 million and the remainder payable over a 5 year period, plus interest. The Company has a commitment to complete the construction of a gold plant within two years from the receipt of all necessary licences and maintenance of certain staffing levels for a period of three years. Refer to note 13(c) in the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Company�s commitments. in January 1995, the Company acquired an additional 10.3% interest in the Bras�lia mine for $14 million, bringing the Company�s effective ownership to 33%. This acquisition represents an additional 16,000 ounces of annual gold production to the Company. the Company completed and put into production the New Britannia mine for a total capital cost of $38 million. Underground production for the main mine should reach capacity in the second quarter of 1996, as the operation is currently mining a satellite ore zone. the Company acquired a 50% interest in two undeveloped gold properties in the Kamchatka peninsula of Eastern Russia. These properties contain approximately 2 million ounces of gold. The Company has the option to acquire, pending the issuance of certain licences, an additional 50% interest in these properties. Mine Operations A description of the Company�s operations is contained on pages 18 to 43 of this report. The description contains details on financial information, unit costs, operating statistics, reserves and operating performance. Revenue Revenue from 413,100 ounces of gold equivalent sold during the year was $156.9 million, consistent with the $157.2 million from sales of 422,900 ounces reported in 1994 which was 4% lower than the $163.4 million from sales of 440,300 ounces in 1993. Realized revenue on an equivalent ounce basis was $380 in 1995 and $371 in 1994 and 1993, compared to COMEX averages of $384, $384 and $360 respectively. The consistent revenues between 1995 and 1994 were the combined result of lower ounces sold, due to reduced sales from Casa Berardi and Novo Astro mines, which was offset by the increased ownership in Bras�lia and higher realized prices due to the reduced impact of hedging transactions. The decrease between 1994 and 1993 was the result of an increase in dor� inventories. The Company�s realization per ounce sold differs from the COMEX average primarily as a result of hedging programs. Hedging programs, which are primarily entered into to minimize the downside risk of metal price fluctuations, reduced revenues by $1.7 million in 1995 and $4.2 million in 1994 and contributed revenues of $2.7 million in 1993. Brazilian price premiums did not contribute to higher revenues in 1995 or 1994, but contributed $2.2 million in 1993. In 1995, gold equivalent realizations per gold equivalent ounce were $4 below the COMEX average due to the positive impact of gold hedging offsetting silver hedging losses at the La Coipa mine. Please refer to notes 7 and 9 in the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the Company�s gold and silver hedging positions as at December 31, 1995. During 1994, gold equivalent realizations per gold equivalent ounce were $13 below the COMEX average and were primarily due to silver hedging conducted by one of the Company�s joint venture partners. The Company has a hedging policy which allows management to hedge up to a maximum of 60% of the next five years of production. The purpose of hedging a portion of the Company�s production is to ensure its revenue stream. The Company uses forward sales, spot deferred sales, the sale of call options and the purchase of put options to hedge production from time to time. The Company constantly reviews its hedging position, and changes in the price of gold and silver, interest rates and contangos could cause the Company to change its position on hedging. Mine Operating Costs Cost of sales For purposes of financial reporting, the Company defines cost of sales as operating costs, marketing, refining and changes in inventory levels, together with administration expenses at the joint venture level directly attributable to mining activities. The Company�s cash costs in both total dollars and per equivalent ounce measures, are dependent on the amount of production contributed by each mine during the year. In 1995, cash costs totaled $90.7 million compared to $84.3 million in 1994 and $75.6 million in 1993. On a gold equivalent ounce sold basis, cash costs were $219 in 1995, up from $199 in 1994 and $172 in 1993. The La Coipa mine, which accounts for 38% of the Company�s cost of sales in 1995, decreased to $168 per gold equivalent ounce sold in 1995 compared to $171 in 1994, due to higher production volume. The Crix�s and Bras�lia mines cash costs increased to $177 and $235 per gold equivalent ounce sold in 1995 compared to $170 and $196 respectively in 1994. The impact of the strengthening of the Brazilian currency has resulted in increased local operating costs when converted into U.S. dollar terms, while efficiencies at Crix�s helped to reduce its overall impact. The Casa Berardi mine cash costs increased to $449 per gold equivalent ounce sold from $227 in 1994. Higher unit operating costs were the result of increased operating development, lower grades and tonnage and a writedown in the circuit inventory. Total production for the property dropped by 39% in 1995, but production returned to normal levels in the fourth quarter of 1995 and the Company anticipates a significant reduction in unit costs in 1996. The Mineral Hill mine cash costs increased to $359 per gold equivalent ounce sold from $321 in 1994. The mine results will continue to be impacted by limited ore headings until the Crevice Mountain project comes on stream in mid 1997. An additional ore zone (Ski Slope) has been identified and will supplement 1996 gold production. As a result, cash costs should be reduced marginally in 1996. The Novo Astro mine, which ceased production in mid-1995, had cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold of $183 in 1995, compared to $238 in 1994. The Company anticipates a reduction in its overall unit cash costs in 1996, primarily as a result of increased gold production at the Casa Berardi mine as tonnage resumes to expected levels, also due to efficiencies to be realized at Bras�lia with the use of larger equipment and increases in overall mill throughput at Bras�lia and Crix�s. The increase in cash costs to $199 in 1994 from $172 in 1993, was principally the result of mining lower grades at La Coipa in 1994 whereas in 1993, the operation mined higher grade material in order to generate sufficient cash flow to meet a $75 million project debt repayment. Other contributing factors were tailings dam repairs at the Crix�s mine and the mining of lower grades at Casa Berardi, Mineral Hill and Bras�lia. Depletion and Depreciation The Company�s depletion and depreciation expenses, in both total dollars and per gold equivalent ounce measures, are dependent on the amount of production, capital costs and gold reserve base for each mine. All mines are different and therefore the depletion and depreciation expense is a composite amount. Depletion and depreciation expenses decreased to $37.6 million in 1995 from $41.6 million in 1994 and $45.9 million in 1993. On a per gold ounce equivalent basis they were $91 in 1995, $98 in 1994 and $104 in 1993. The decrease in depletion and depreciation expenses by 10% in 1995 compared to 1994 was primarily due to the completion of mining at Novo Astro, which had a relatively high depletion charge, and reduced charges at Casa Berardi, due to lower production levels. The decrease in depletion and depreciation by 9% in 1994 compared with 1993 was primarily due to lower gold equivalent sales at the La Coipa mine, which has a relatively high depletion and depreciation charge. The Company anticipates depletion and depreciation rates in 1996 of $90 per ounce, despite the fact that gold reserves have increased substantially. This is due to the fact that the increases in reserves are primarily related to new projects which will not be in production in 1996. Other Expenses/Income Corporate Administration Expenses Corporate administration increased to $10.1 million in 1995 compared to $7.5 million in 1994 and $6.6 million in 1993 which represents, on a per gold equivalent ounce basis, $24, $18 and $15 respectively. The increase in 1995 is the result of the Company�s increasing international focus, management of near term expansion in gold production and the costs associated with the closure of an office and severance of employees. The increase in 1994 from 1993 was principally the result of the addition of personnel due to the growth in the Company�s operations as well as costs related to the acquiring of a listing of the Company�s shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company anticipates corporate administration costs of $9 million in 1996. Interest Expense Interest expense was $7.2 million in 1995 compared to $7.4 million in 1994 and $13.9 million in 1993. Interest expense remained consistent in 1995 with 1994 as increases in debt financing in the latter part of the year were offset by scheduled debt repayments. The 1994 decrease over 1993 was due to significant debt repayments at the La Coipa, Novo Astro and Crix�s mines. Interest expense is expected to increase in 1996 due to the issuance of the $150 million Unsecured Notes offering in January, 1996. The project financing at La Coipa is expected to be repaid in full in 1996. Exploration and Business Development The Company�s strategy is to grow through the expansion of reserves and production at existing mines and through the acquisition, exploration and development of new properties. The Company participates in minimal grass roots exploration preferring to focus on advanced stage projects. Exploration spending, exclusive of property acquisition costs, amounted to $19.0 million in 1995 compared to $15.6 million and $5.1 million in 1994 and 1993. Exploration and business development continue to increase as the Company maintains its aggressive growth strategy, with expenditures increasing by 21% over 1994, as compared to a three-fold increase between 1994 and 1993. The most significant expenditures made in 1995 were for the Pachicutza project in Ecuador, expansion of reserves around the Mineral Hill mine in Montana, and various properties in Brazil and Peru. The Company completed its commitment for the technology of treatment of refractory ores in 1995 and decided not to proceed further. A description of the Company�s exploration and development projects is contained on pages 44 to 58 of this report. The increase in expenditures in 1994 versus 1993 relates primarily to expenditures at the Pachicutza project, Mineral Hill and Crix�s mines and refractory ore research. The Company�s policy is to expense exploration and development expenditures until it has been established that a mineral property has development potential. When this has been established, further costs prior to the commencement of mining are capitalized. All property acquisition costs are capitalized and expensed only when properties are abandoned. During 1995, the Company determined that three projects had development potential; the Pachicutza property in Ecuador, the Asacha property in eastern Russia and the Ski Slope deposit at Mineral Hill. In 1994, five projects met this criterion; New Britannia, Musselwhite, the Casa Berardi deep development program, the Crevice Mountain project at Mineral Hill and the Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic. The Company will continue its aggressive exploration program in 1996, with costs expected to be approximately $10 million. Translation and Foreign Exchange The impact of foreign exchange returned to normal levels in 1995 as compared to 1994. In 1994, the Company realized significant favourable foreign exchange gains as a result of dramatic changes to the Brazilian monetary system. The Company does not anticipate significant fluctuations in foreign exchange during 1996. Interest Income The Company�s policy is to invest its surplus cash in liquid, short-term investments. In 1995, the Company�s interest income was $15.8 million versus $18.8 million in 1994 and $2.3 million in 1993. Interest income remained high in 1995, despite decreasing cash balances, due to higher returns received on short-term Brazilian investments. The increase in 1994 compared to 1993, was due to higher cash balances as a result of the equity offering in January 1994. The Company anticipates interest income to rise in 1996 due to the $150 million Unsecured Note issuance, which occurred in January 1996. Other Income/Loss Other income increased to $2.8 million from a loss of $0.4 million in 1994 and a gain of $1.7 million in 1993. This increase is principally related to the $7.5 million gain on the settlement of the Brisas property dispute in Venezuela, which has been offset by charges related to asset disposals and a writedown for marketable securities of $2.1 million. In the first quarter of 1996, the Company has disposed of all of its shares in Gold Reserve received as a result of the Brisas property settlement and other publicly traded companies, which resulted in an additional after-tax profit of approximately $6 million. Income and Mining Taxes Effective tax rates on earnings before income and mining taxes were 0% in 1995, 26% in 1994 and 29% in 1993. The effective tax rate is a composite rate resulting from the various tax regimes in which the Company operates. The significant drop in the effective tax rate in 1995 from 1994 and 1993, is primarily related to lower rates in the Company�s foreign jurisdictions and due to non taxable gains realized in foreign subsidiaries. In Brazil, effective January 1, 1996, combined corporate and social tax rates were reduced to 33% from 53%. Also, the effects of inflation are no longer recognized for tax purposes. These impacts will reduce the Company�s future tax expenses. The Company expects its long-term effective tax rate to average 30%. Cash Flow and Liquidity Cash Flow from Operating Activities Cash provided from operating activities totaled $40.7 million in 1995, $56.6 million in 1994 and $52.9 million in 1993. The decrease in the 1995 cash flow from 1994 is attributed to higher cash operating costs, higher exploration spending and reductions in realized foreign exchange gains. Working capital of the Company was $43.5 million at December 31, 1995, compared to $31.0 million and $19.2 million in 1994 and 1993. The increase in working capital in 1995 is primarily attributed to minority investments in publicly traded companies which have been predominately sold subsequent to the year end. Receipt of the $4.5 million in escrow funds on the 1994 settlement of the Brisas property is expected to be received in the second quarter of 1996. The increase between 1994 and 1993 was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable related to cash expenditures made on the Brisas property dispute in Venezuela, advances made on behalf of the Company�s joint venture partner for the development of the New Britannia mine and increases in inventory. Investing Activities Investments in mining property, plant and equipment were $126.5 million in 1995 compared to $51.7 million in 1994 and $14.2 million in 1993. The continued increase in investments in 1995 and 1994 was primarily due to acquisition of producing and development properties and the continued growth of current operations. The following significant investments were made in 1995: Existing Operations Bras�lia, Brazil � acquisition of an additional 10.3% interest in the Bras�lia mine for $14.0 million. Also, $4 million was spent as a result of a decision in the second half of the year to replace the mining contractor and perform mining in-house, with larger, more efficient 85 tonne trucks. This should result in a 45% reduction in mining costs. New Britannia, Canada � completion of the development and production start-up in the fourth quarter of the New Britannia mine with 1995 capital costs of $12.5 million to the Company. Casa Berardi, Canada � continued spending on the construction of a shaft and deep development program, with 1995 capital costs of $15.0 million to the Company. La Coipa, Chile � spending related to the stripping of the existing Ladera-Farellon pit as well as the adjacent Coipa Norte pit. The Company�s share of total costs were $6.5 million in 1995. Mineral Hill, United States � continued spending on the Crevice Mountain tunnel and development of the newly discovered Ski Slope zone, with spending of $8.7 million in 1995. Kassandra Mines, Greece � feasibility study, metallurgical tests and acquisition costs of $55.2 million. Of this amount, $27.2 million is payable to the vendor in five equal installments of $5.5 million over the next five years, plus interest. the purchase and dismantling of two mills, for a total expenditure of $12.8 million. One of these mills will be used for the Pachicutza property in Ecuador. Development Projects Kamchatka, Russia � acquisition costs of exploration properties in Eastern Russia for a total expenditure of $5.3 million in 1995. Kasperske Hory, Czech Republic � costs related to the expansion of underground reserves of $5.4 million. Musselwhite, Canada � exploration and feasibility study costs of $4.6 million which resulted in a positive production decision in early 1996. Spending on other assets increased to $20.6 million, principally as a result of the valuation of the shares received on the Brisas property dispute and the acquisition of minority equity positions in publicly traded companies. Also during 1995, the Company sold its 31% indirect interest in the Novo Astro mine in northern Brazil, for net proceeds of $9.9 million, which approximated its residual value. The increase in capital expenditures to $51.7 million in 1994 from $14.2 million in 1993 was primarily due to the acquisition of 90.5% of the Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic, spending on the Casa Berardi deep development project, initial development of the New Britannia gold mine and acquisition of the Chimberos silver deposit located near the La Coipa mine. Expenditures in 1996 are estimated to be $35 million for existing operations and $160 million for development projects. Actual 1996 expenditures will be impacted the most by the progress of the Kassandra and Musselwhite projects. Financing Activities Net long-term debt repayments were $14.5 million in 1995, $26.3 million in 1994 and $38.7 million in 1993. The principal debt repayments relate to the project financing for the La Coipa mine in 1995, 1994 and 1993 of $31.2 million (including an unscheduled prepayment of $12.5 million in December 1995), $18.8 million and $37.5 million respectively. This loan is expected to be fully paid in 1996. An additional $8.5 million was repaid on the Company�s silver loan. Additional debt financing of $13.8 million was received in 1995 from the completion of the New Britannia mine financing. This recourse debt financing can become non-recourse in 1996, once certain commercial completion tests are reached. Additionally, export financing loans of $15.4 million were received in Brazil by both operating mines, which carry favourable local interest rates. These loans, while short-term in nature, are expected to be utilized as a form of revolving credit facility. Liquidity The Company�s net cash position for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $13.9 million, $122.2 million and $2.5 million respectively. Net cash consists of cash and cash equivalents less bank indebtedness. The Company considers cash equivalents to include financial instruments with maturities of less than ninety days. In January, 1996, the Company issued US$150 million of 7.5% Unsecured Notes which are due January, 2001, to strengthen its cash position. On January 6, 1994, the Company issued 23 million common shares of Cdn$8.75 per share, resulting in net proceeds of Cdn$193.3 million. The total current and long-term debt balance of the Company at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $92.0 million, $80.6 million and $106.8 million respectively. In 1996, improved current operations cash flows, sales of investments held in publicly traded companies and financing from the Unsecured Notes issue should provide sufficient cashflow to meet the capital requirements of the Company. Further commitments on the Kassandra Mines assets will require additional funding in 1997, and it is anticipated this will be provided through project financing. Environmental The Company�s environmental programs are designed to minimize the environmental impact of its operations and should significantly reduce future restoration costs. Environmental costs are accrued over the life of each mine, once a reasonable estimate of the closure costs can be determined. The Company charged $0.8 million in 1995 and 1994, to cost of sales related to post closure accruals and environmental costs. Additionally, $2.7 million and $1.1 million were spent in 1995 and 1994 on environmental capital projects, with the increase in 1995 related to the construction of the New Britannia tailings area and expansion of the existing Casa Berardi tailings area. Risks The Company operates in the precious metals mining industry and is inherently exposed to operational, geographical and financial risks. Operational hazards which could interrupt or otherwise seriously impair future production include supply obstacles, physical asset damage or destruction, labour interruptions and stability, unexpected ground conditions and orebody structures. To reduce these hazards, the Company carefully plans and designs its mines, trains employees in safety and production methods and maintains adequate supply inventories and insurance. Geographic risks arise from political, legal, social, structural, and economic conditions. The Company has recently further diversified its investment base, thus reducing its dependance on any one sector. As well, there is a growing liberalization of mining laws globally, which will increase access to mining properties throughout the world. The Company obtains political risk insurance to further reduce country risk as required. Local management and advisors are employed where possible to monitor and assess economic, political and legal developments which could affect the Company and to allow a prompt response to any perceived threat. For instance, two lawsuits were launched against the Company in late 1995, with regards to the Company�s acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets and its Russian properties. These claims are detailed in notes 13 a) and 13 b) of the financial statements. The Company firmly believes that these claims are unfounded and will aggressively defend against these matters. Commodity pricing, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and income taxes are some of the financial threats to which the Company is exposed. Because the world markets for precious metals can be volatile, the Company hedges its precious metals production from time to time. The Company estimates that a $10 per ounce change in the price of gold in 1996 will affect net earnings by approximately $3 million. As the world foreign exchange markets can fluctuate, the Company hedges its foreign exchange exposure when deemed appropriate. Interest rate risks arise from unexpected changes in inflation combined with the level of debt financing utilized. To reduce this risk, the Company maintains an appropriate mix of debt and equity in order to allow access to both the debt and equity markets as required. When debt financing is required, the Company prefers to utilize non-recourse project financing, with a rapid repayment schedule, to further reduce commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-216IA049-000852-B013-105http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/ManagementResponsibilities.htm 205.208.60.13 19970120011103 text/html 4880HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Monday, 20-Jan-97 01:08:56 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:37:42 GMTContent-length: 4668 Annual Report - 1995: Management's Responsibility for Financial Reporting Annual Report - 1995 Management's Responsibility for Financial Reporting The accompanying consolidated financial statements of TVX Gold Inc. and all the information in this annual report are the responsibility of management and have been approved by the Board of Directors.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principlesgenerally accepted in Canada which, in the Company's case, conform in all material respects withaccounting principles generally accepted in the United States, except as disclosed in note 16. The significant accounting policies followed by the Company and its incorporated and unincorporatedjoint ventures are summarized as follows: (a) Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.Investments in incorporated and unincorporated joint ventures are accounted for by the proportionateconsolidation method as substantially all of the Company's business is conducted through jointventures. (b) Translation of foreign currencies The accounts of the Canadian operations and operations in foreign countries have been translated intoUnited States dollars using the temporal method because the Company considers the U.S. dollar to bethe principal currency of its operations. Under this method, monetary assets and liabilities have beentranslated at the end of year exchange rates. Non-monetary assets, which primarily compriseinventories and mining property, plant and equipment, have been translated using historic rates ofexchange. Revenues and expenses have been translated at the average rates of exchange during theyears, except for depletion and depreciation, which have been translated at the same rates as the relatedassets. Foreign exchange gains and losses on current monetary assets and liabilities are included in thedetermination of earnings. Gains and losses related to long-term debt are deferred and amortized overthe remaining term of the debt. (c) Inventories Gold and silver bullion inventories are stated at market. Dor�, work-in-process and ore stockpiles arestated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Materials and supplies inventories are stated at thelower of cost or replacement value. (d) Mining property, plant and equipment Mining property, plant and equipment is shown at cost including costs associated with acquisition andfurther development of mining properties. Depletable assets are amortized over the life of the mine ona unit-of-production basis. The estimated mine lives range from 6 to 20 years with the average being17 years. Depreciable assets are also amortized over the life of the mine on a unit-of-production basisexcept where the useful life of a depreciable asset is less than the life of the mine, in which casedepreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis. (e) Exploration and business development Exploration expenditures, excluding property acquisition costs, are charged to earnings as incurred. When it has been established that a mining property has development potential, further explorationcosts incurred prior to the start of mining operations, are recorded as deferred development costs andamortized as development costs in accordance with the policies described above. (f) Reclamation costs Expenditures relating to ongoing environmental and reclamation programs are charged againstearnings as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefit. These ongoing programs are designed to minimize the environmental impact of the Company's miningoperations and should significantly reduce future removal and site restoration costs that may otherwise be incurred upon cessation of mining activities. Estimated future reclamation costs,including site restoration, where reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings over theestimated life of the mine. (g) Income and mining taxes Deferred income and mining taxes are provided as a result of timing differences that arise in therecognition of revenue and expenses in different years for accounting than for income and mining taxreporting purposes. Taxes have been provided on undistributed earnings of non-Canadian operationsbased upon the level of expected remittance of these earnings. (h) Financing costs Debt issue costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the debt. Financing costs, includinginterest and debt issue costs, are capitalized when they arise from indebtedness incurred to financedevelopment activities on properties that are not in full production and are amortized to earnings whenmining operations commence. (i) Commitments to deliver gold and silver Commitments to deliver gold and silver arise from gold and silver loans, fixed forward sales, spotdeferred sales and option contracts. Contracted prices on forward sales, spot deferred sales and options related to future production arerecognized in revenue as the related gold and silver is delivered. Gold and silver loans which hedge the Company's share of revenues from future production aremarked to the spot price at the balance sheet date. Unrealized gains and losses are deferred and arereflected in earnings when the hedged production is delivered. (j) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include those short-term money market instruments which, on acquisition,generally have a term to maturity of three months or less. 2. Accounts Receivable As a result of inflows of overburden material and caving of fault material in 1992, the Company hasrecorded $4,966,000 as insurance claims receivable (December 31, 1994 - $4,920,000), representingits share of costs incurred as a result of the incidents, excluding any business interruption costs, and netof an interim payment of $1,238,000 received in 1993.

Cumulative withholding taxes of $9,105,000 (December 31, 1994 � $ 7,343,000) have been provided on unremitted foreign earnings including $1,762,000 in 1995 (1994 � $1,372,000). Deferred income and mining taxes are provided as a result of timing differences that arise in the recognition of income and expenses for financial reporting and tax purposes. The sources of timing differences and the related deferred tax amounts are as follows:                                 December 31,  December 31,                                       1995          1994	                                 ----------    ----------Depletion and depreciation       $   21,173    $   23,397Other, including accrued   withholding taxes                   6,039         5,013                                 ----------    ----------                                     27,212        28,410                                 ==========    ========== 11. Earnings Per Share The earnings per share for the year have been calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 160,399,200 shares (1994 � 158,383,696; 1993 � 134,627,314). The total number of common shares that would be outstanding as at December 31, 1995 is 176,528,140 (December 31, 1994 � 174,239,390) if all outstanding options and commitments regarding property purchases were exercised. Based on current market conditions, the issuance of these shares would not be dilutive. 12.

Commitments and Contingencies Kassandra Litigation A claim was filed against the Company on November 15, 1995, and subsequently amended, relating to the Company�s interest in the Kassandra mining assets in Greece. The plaintiffs allege breach of fiduciary duties and misuse of confidential information and seek, among other things: (i) a declaration that the Company holds the Kassandra orebodies in trust for the plaintiffs; or \ (ii) acknowledgement that the Company holds a 12% carried interest in Kassandra in trust for the plaintiffs and a further 12% �right to purchase� in Kassandra; and (iii) damages in the amount of $500 million (Cdn.); and punitive damages in the amount of $1 million (Cdn.). The Company is in the process of filing its statement of defence and while the outcome is not presently determinable, the Company firmly believes that the claims made by the plaintiffs are unfounded. The Company will aggressively defend this matter. Kamchatka Litigation A Complaint Seeking Damages and Demand for Jury Trial with Injunctive Relief Sought was filed in the United States District Court against the Company on October 19, 1995 relating to their mining interests in Kamchatka, Russia. The plaintiffs allege that the Company breached the terms of a confidentiality agreement and claim, among other things: (i) judgment against the Company for breach of contract; (ii) a mandatory injunction to cease and desist from using the plaintiffs� information and to stop all exploration, negotiation or purchasing of mining rights in Kamchatka; and (iii) the deposit in court of all sums collected by the Company as a result of mining and exploration of the subject sites. The Company has filed an Answer, Affirmative Defences and Counterclaim on February 2, 1996 and while the outcome is not presently determinable, the Company firmly believes the claims made by the plaintiffs are unfounded. The Company will aggressively defend this matter. Kassandra Mines Commitments Pursuant to the acquisition of the Kassandra Mine assets, signed on December 21, 1995, the Company is obligated to fulfil the following; Purchase Price Mortgage: To provide the vendor with a mortgage of approximately $36.0 million as security for unpaid purchase price amounts plus interest. The payment terms of the acquisition require 5 equal installments, on December 21 of each year, for approximately $5.5 million, plus applicable interest; Gold Plant Guarantee: The Company is obligated to construct a gold plant within two years from receiving all applicable licences, which may be extended by a further eight months under certain circumstances. The Company has provided a letter of guarantee of approximately $11.0 million against this commitment; Employment Guarantee: The Company is obligated to maintain 550 employees and a further 50 employees once the gold plant is completed, for a minimum period of three years. The Greek government is obligated to provide an allowance of 50% of the cost to employ 50 of these employees for a six month period and an additional 50 employees for a three year period. Additionally, employment must be offered by the contractor to 150 former employees of Kassandra for a period of 18 months, during the construction of the gold plant. Kasperske Hory Commitment Pursuant to an agreement dated August 8, 1994, as amended, the Company is obligated to issue to each of Royalstar Resources Ltd. (�Royalstar�) and Paramount Ventures and Finance Inc. (�Paramount�), 400,000 common shares of the Company if, within two years of the agreement date, the Company concludes that the Kasperske Hory property can be brought into commercial production. If the above two year period expires without the Company issuing the shares or the Company notifies the companies that the Kasperske Hory property does not contain an orebody which the Company wishes to bring into commercial production, Royalstar and Paramount have the right to repurchase their respective shares held by the Company at their original cost to the Company, plus an amount equal to 50% of the total cost incurred by the Company. As described in note 15 (b), the commitment to Royalstar has been settled. 14. Related Party Transactions On January 25, 1995, the Company purchased an additional 10.3% in the Bras�lia mine for $14.0 million from a company in which the Company�s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer held an 80% ownership interest. The purchase price was based on the future discounted cash flows of the operation. An equivalent offer was made simultaneously to another third party interest in the mine, which was rejected. 15. Events Subsequent to December 31, 1995 On January 12, 1996, the Company issued $150.0 million of 7.51% Unsecured Notes due January 17, 2001. Commissions on the Notes totalled 0.9% or $1.4 million. On February 20, 1996, the Company and Royalstar finalized an agreement whereby, in consideration for a payment of $1.5 million, Royalstar waived all its rights, as detailed in note 13 (d). During the first quarter of 1996, the insurance claim for the Casa Berardi inflows was finalized for a total of $10.3 million, less an original advance of $2.0 million. The Company�s 60% share of this settlement approximates the book value of the accounts receivable. Funds are expected to be received by the second quarter of 1996. During the first quarter of 1996, the Company sold its equity position in Gold Reserve Corp., 1,500,000 common shares and 500,000 share purchase warrants, for total proceeds of approximately $14.0 million. As a result, the Company will realize an after tax gain of approximately $5.9 million. 16. Differences Between Canadian and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada (�Canadian GAAP�). In the Company�s case United States generally accepted accounting principles, (�U.S. GAAP�), differ materially from Canadian GAAP in the accounting for income taxes. The Company adopted SFAS 109 in 1993 for purposes of U.S. GAAP. SFAS 109 requires that the deferred taxes be provided for differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability, and the amounts reported in an entity�s financial statements. As a result of SFAS 109, both mining property, plant and equipment and deferred income taxes in the balance sheet would be increased by $29,725,000 at December 31, 1995, (December 31, 1994 � $21,565,000). In the statement of earnings, depreciation and depletion would be increased by $1,256,000, (1994 � $1,633,000; 1993 � $961,000), and income and mining taxes decreased by the same amount. This difference does not impact overall net earnings. As well, SFAS 109 requires that the annual adjustment of deferred tax balances to reflect current tax rates. Under Canadian GAAP, deferred tax balances are maintained at the tax rate in effect in which the year they were first reported. The principal mines in which the Company has interests, commenced operations in recent years therefore deferred taxes have been provided for at rates which have not changed significantly to date. As a result, deferred taxes under SFAS 109 are not materially different from deferred taxes reported in the Company�s financial statements. © TVX Gold Inc.webmaster@tvxgold.comWT03-B21-220IA049-000854-B002-155http://einstein.tvxgold.com:80/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/SummarizedQuarterly.htm 205.208.60.13 19970120012157 text/html 5836HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Monday, 20-Jan-97 01:21:14 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N WPO-1293)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 12-Aug-96 19:37:42 GMTContent-length: 5624 Annual Report - 1995: Summarized Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statement Information Annual Report - 1995 Summarized Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statement Information Unaudited (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts) 1995                                          Quarters Ended        Full Year                    March 31    June 30    Sept 30     Dec 31------------------------------------------------------------------------Revenue            $  38,046  $  39,414  $  41,336  $  38,152  $ 156,948Operating earnings     5,696      8,331      8,492      6,147     28,666Net earnings           5,590      2,900      1,349       (425)     9,414Earnings per share      0.03       0.02       0.01      (0.00)      0.06Total assets         555,782    555,032    574,928    614,180    614,180Long-term debt        43,193     29,650     35,807     47,096     47,096Shareholders� equity 406,116    410,934    412,389    412,402    412,402Cash provided by  operations           2,206      5,215     16,919     16,402     40,742 1994                                                Quarters Ended         Full Year                       March 31     June 30     Sept 30      Dec 31-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Revenue               $  35,874   $  43,675   $  36,108   $  41,518   $ 157,175Operating earnings        7,644      10,181       7,060       6,468      31,353Net earnings              3,315       2,547      13,319       3,598      22,779Earnings per share         0.02        0.02        0.08        0.02        0.14Total assets            521,157     529,856     544,565     540,398     540,398Long-term debt           74,197      63,530      58,444      47,815      47,815Shareholders� equity    371,938     374,711     395,292     400,308     400,308Cash provided by  operations              1,498      14,954      25,644      14,501      56,597 Share Prices -------------------------------------------------------------------------------Toronto Stock Exchange (Cdn$)                                 1995                             1994                     High    Low      Volume          High    Low      Volume                     -------------------------        -------------------------First quarter        10.13   8.25   34,112,700         9.75   8.00   48,563,200Second quarter       11.38   8.63   38,509,400         9.25   7.38   19,390,800Third quarter        11.13   9.38   28,120,900        10.50   7.13   40,186,900Fourth quarter       10.00   8.88   32,135,900        10.25   8.38   18,414,800-------------------------------------------------------------------------------New York Stock Exchange (US$)(1)                               1995                             1994                     High    Low      Volume          High    Low      Volume                      -------------------------        -------------------------First quarter        7.13    5.75    8,532,000        7.25    5.88    6,707,900Second quarter       8.25    6.38    9,606,300        6.88    5.13    3,437,300 Third quarter        8.25    6.75    8,630,600        7.88    5.13   11,833,700 Fourth quarter       7.38    6.13    8,050,500        7.75    6.13    6,955,000(1) The Company listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange on August 10, 1994.
